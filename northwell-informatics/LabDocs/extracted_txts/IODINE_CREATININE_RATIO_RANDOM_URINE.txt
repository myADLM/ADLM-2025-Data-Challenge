IODINE/CREATININE RATIO, RANDOM, URINE SOP
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Iodine/Creatinine Ratio in
random urine samples to assess iodine status in patients. This
protocol is intended to ensure accurate and consistent results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow the
procedure outlined below. This includes preparation, processing,
analysis, quality control, and documentation of all steps.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Random urine sample.
Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of urine is required.
Container: Clean, sterile, and tightly sealed urine collection
container.
Stability:
• Urine specimens should be analyzed as soon as possible after
collection.
• If analysis will be delayed, samples can be refrigerated at 2-8°C
for up to 24 hours.
• For long-term storage, samples can be frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Contaminated samples.
• Samples collected more than 24 hours before analysis if not
refrigerated.
• Improperly labeled specimens or containers with visible signs of
leakage.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a
UV detector.
• Creatinine reagent kits.
• Iodine standards and calibration solutions.
• Deionized water.
• Urine centrifuge tubes.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Verification:
◦ Verify the sample labeling and integrity. Ensure the sample
meets the acceptable criteria.
2. Mixing the Sample:
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly by inverting the container
several times.
3. Aliquoting:
◦ Aliquot an appropriate volume of urine into a centrifuge
tube.
B) Centrifugation:
1. Centrifuge urine samples at 1500-2000 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean tube without
disturbing the pellet.
C) Creatinine Analysis:
1. Follow the instructions provided in the creatinine reagent kit.
2. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength (usually
around 520 nm).
3. Calculate the creatinine concentration using the provided
calibration curve or instrument software.
D) Iodine Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Dilute the urine sample if necessary based on the analysis
requirement.
◦ Refer to the HPLC manual for specific details on sample
volume and dilution.
2. HPLC Setup:
◦ Prepare the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Load the prepared sample onto the HPLC.
◦ Set the appropriate parameters (e.g., column type, mobile
phase, flow rate, detection wavelength).
3. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run iodine standards to create a calibration curve.
◦ Include quality control samples with known iodine
concentrations in each batch.
4. Analysis:
◦ Run the urine samples and record the retention times and
peak areas.
◦ Calculate the iodine concentration using the calibration
curve.
E) Iodine/Creatinine Ratio Calculation:
1. Express the iodine concentration in μg/L (μg/L = ppb).
2. Express the creatinine concentration in g/L.
3. Calculate the Iodine/Creatinine Ratio using the formula: [
\text{Iodine/Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{\text{Iodine concentration
(μg/L)}}{\text{Creatinine concentration (g/L)}} ]
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples
to ensure accuracy.
◦ Use quality control samples with known iodine and
creatinine concentrations.
◦ Document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
Acceptable Range of QC:
Discuss acceptable ranges with the quality control guidelines
provided with the materials.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Use the Laboratory Information System (LIS) to enter and
report results.
◦ Verify results to ensure accuracy.
◦ Notify relevant personnel for out-of-range results according
to laboratory policies.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Iodine: Normal range (based on guidelines and population
studies, e.g., 100-199 μg/L for school-aged children).
◦ Creatinine: Healthy adult urine creatinine level typically
ranges between 0.5 to 2 g/L.
◦ The acceptable Iodine/Creatinine ratio will depend on
specific clinical or epidemiological recommendations.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure proper sample handling and storage to prevent
degradation of analytes.
◦ Follow specific guidelines for the HPLC and creatinine
analysis methods to ensure consistent results.
◦ Any sample presenting unusual values should be
reanalyzed and cross-verified if necessary.
