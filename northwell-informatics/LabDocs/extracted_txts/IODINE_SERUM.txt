Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Iodine, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
iodine determination in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing serum
iodine analysis as per the procedure. All staff must identify any issues
affecting test results and report them to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a
red-top tube without additives or gel. Serum must be separated
from the cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. Samples arriving without proper identification, collection
date, or time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Ultrapure water
• Calibration standards for iodine
• Quality control materials (high, low, and normal controls)
• Serum sample vials
• NIST traceable reference materials
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the serum sample, verify patient identification
and documentation.
2. Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 3,000 x g to separate
serum from cells.
3. Transfer the clear serum to labeled vials using a pipette,
avoiding any cellular material.
4. Store the processed serum samples at 2-8ºC until analysis;
samples should be analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards for iodine in ultrapure water
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Run a full calibration curve with each analytical batch.
3. Analyze quality control materials at the beginning, middle, and
end of each batch to monitor accuracy and precision.
4. Acceptable performance criteria for control measures are
defined as within ±2 standard deviations of the target values.
C) Analysis using ICP-MS:
1. Set up ICP-MS according to the manufacturer's instructions,
ensuring the system is properly calibrated and optimized.
2. Load the calibration standards, samples, and quality control
materials onto the ICP-MS auto-sampler.
3. Run the samples along with calibration standards and quality
control materials in the analytical run.
4. Record and save all raw data generated by the ICP-MS.
5. POST ANALYSIS
• Review the raw data and calibration curve for acceptance. Ensure
that the quality control results fall within acceptable ranges.
• Identify any samples requiring re-analysis due to out-of-range
control results or non-conformance to established protocols.
• In the case of any QC failures or equipment malfunction, notify
the supervisor, troubleshoot as needed, and rerun the analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Results Verification:
• Verify all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Confirm that all standards, controls, and patient results fall within
acceptable limits.
B) Documentation:
• Document the analysis results, calibration, QC data, and any
corrective actions taken in the logbook.
• Enter final validated patient results into the LIS for clinician review
and patient records.
C) Critical Values:
• If a patient's serum iodine level is below the critical lower
threshold or above the critical upper threshold, follow the critical
value notification protocol, including immediate reporting to the
treating clinician. Document the notification process thoroughly.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform regular maintenance on the ICP-MS as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Record all maintenance activities and any troubleshooting events
in a logbook.
• Ensure the instrument is properly calibrated after any
maintenance before resuming patient sample analysis.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in external quality assurance programs.
• Regularly review and update the SOP to ensure compliance with
current best practices and regulatory requirements.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure precise and
accurate iodine serum analysis, contributing to high-quality patient
care.
