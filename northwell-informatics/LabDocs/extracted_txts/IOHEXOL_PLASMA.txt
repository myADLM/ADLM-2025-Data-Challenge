Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of Iohexol,
Plasma Testing
1. PURPOSE To provide accurate and precise quantification of
Iohexol concentration in plasma specimens to aid clinical
assessment of renal function.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting analytical procedures for Iohexol
plasma testing. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify and report
any deficiencies or deviations in the test process to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION Iohexol: A contrast agent commonly used in
radiological imaging studies. Its plasma concentration can be
measured to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for kidney
function evaluation.
2. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and Preparation Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen type: Plasma
• Collection container: Heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST)
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of plasma
Stability and Storage:
• Plasma specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and must be
analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
• If transport is required, specimens must be maintained at 2-8°C
during transport.
• Ensure samples are free of hemolysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are clotted or grossly hemolyzed.
• Specimens received in evacuated blood collection tubes other
than the specified heparinized vacutainer.
• Specimens received at room temperature beyond the 24-hour
stability limit.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) system
• Iohexol standards and calibrators
• Mobile phase reagents
• Sample preparation reagents (protein precipitation reagents, etc.)
• Internal standards
• Quality control materials (two levels: normal and high
concentration)
C) Analytical Procedure
1. Calibration and Quality Control: Prepare calibration standards
using Iohexol stock solution, diluting to relevant concentrations
in plasma matrix. Run a standard calibration curve prior to
sample analysis. Prepare quality control samples at designated
concentration levels for normal and high Iohexol
concentrations. Include QC samples in each analytical run.
2. Sample Preparation: a. Thoroughly mix plasma specimens. b.
Aliquot 200µL of plasma to a labeled centrifuge tube. c. Add
400µL of protein precipitation reagent to each tube, vortex for 5
minutes. d. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. e. Transfer
supernatant to a clean vial. f. If required, further dilute
supernatants to fit within calibration range.
3. Instrumental Analysis: a. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS system
according to operational SOP. b. Inject calibration standards,
QC materials, and prepared plasma samples into the system. c.
Perform analysis using validated parameters. d. Collect and
record chromatographic data (or mass spectrometry data).
4. Reviewing and Verifying Results: a. Compare sample data with
calibration curve to quantify Iohexol concentration. b. Ensure
QC samples fall within acceptable limits. Re-run analysis if QC
results are outside tolerance. c. Review results for any outliers
or discrepancies. Perform re-testing if necessary.
5. Reporting Results: Results are to be transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and
verified by the authorized technologist. Adjust any errors as
necessary and report critical values according to laboratory
guidelines.
D) Quality Control and Validation
• Perform instrument calibration and verification regularly.
• QC materials should be analyzed with every batch. Document
results, and take corrective measures in case of any deviations.
• Procedures for correlation of new sensor cassettes or solution
packs must be followed, including patient comparison and
acceptance criteria.
• Maintain detailed records of all validations, QC results, and
corrective actions.
E) Critical Result Handling
• Iohexol concentrations beyond clinical thresholds must be
reported as critical results.
• Follow the established protocol for documenting and
communicating critical values.
