Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: IOHEXOL,
TIMED COLLECTION, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the analytical process for
measuring the concentration of Iohexol in urine as part of a timed
collection study. Iohexol is a contrast agent used to determine
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and requires precise and accurate
analysis. This SOP ensures consistent and reliable results in our
CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP for the analysis of Iohexol in urine. It is the responsibility of the
staff to ensure all procedures are performed accurately and any
deviations, incidents, or anomalies are documented and reported to a
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• 24-hour urine collection in a clean, properly labeled container.
• Ensure the total volume is recorded and an aliquot is taken for
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens without proper labeling.
• Specimens collected over a period shorter or longer than 24
hours.
• Specimens contaminated or incorrectly stored.
• Specimens where the total volume is not provided.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a UV detector.
• Iohexol assay reagents.
• Calibrators and controls for Iohexol.
• Analytical balance.
• Volumetric flasks, pipettes, and other standard laboratory
glassware and PPE.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Specimens
1. Measure the total volume of urine collected over the 24-hour
period.
2. Mix the urine thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Transfer an aliquot (e.g., 10 mL) of the mixed urine to a labeled
sample container for analysis.
4. Store the specimen at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare Iohexol calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform daily calibration of the HPLC system using prepared
calibrators.
3. Run quality control samples with each batch of urine specimens
analyzed to ensure accuracy and precision.
C. Analytical Method
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the instrument's
operating manual.
2. Equilibrate the system with the mobile phase until stable
baselines are achieved.
3. Load urine samples, calibrators, and quality control samples
onto the HPLC system.
4. Inject each sample following the HPLC operating procedure.
5. Monitor and record the chromatography results, ensuring each
peak corresponds to Iohexol.
6. Calculate urine Iohexol concentrations using system software
and calibrator response curves.
D. Data Analysis and Result Verification
1. Assess the chromatograms for the presence of the Iohexol
peak and ensure no interfering substances are present.
2. Verify calibration and control results against expected values to
validate the assay run.
3. Input the sample concentrations into the urinalysis data
management system.
4. Review and confirm test results according to laboratory
protocols.
E. Reporting Results
1. Report Iohexol concentrations in units of mg/L (or µg/mL) to
reflect the assay measurements.
2. Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and ensure proper linkage to patient records.
3. Communicate critical or out-of-range results to the ordering
physician as per standard laboratory policy.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Maintain thorough documentation of all calibrations, quality
control tests, and maintenance performed.
• Periodically review SOP and update as needed based on new
research, technology upgrades, or procedural changes.
• Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons
to validate method performance.
• Ensure all deviations and corrective actions are documented and
reviewed.
1. REFERENCE RANGES AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
Reference Intervals:
• Specific reference intervals for Iohexol concentration in urine will
depend on the method validation and clinical study design.
• Consult clinical and application-specific guidelines to interpret
results.
Method Limitations:
• Hemolyzed or incorrectly preserved specimens may yield
inaccurate results.
• Adherence to specified collection and storage conditions are
critical to test integrity.
1. REFERENCES
• Instrument and reagent manufacturer’s manuals.
• Clinical guidelines for the use and interpretation of Iohexol GFR
studies.
• Relevant laboratory quality control standards and procedures
documentation.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent
and high-quality analytical results for Iohexol in timed urine collection
studies.
