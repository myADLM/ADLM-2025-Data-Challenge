Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Iron and
Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and precise determination
of iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) in serum. The analysis
is critical for the assessment of iron metabolism and diagnosing
related disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP and documenting all procedures and results
accurately. Supervisors must ensure that all staff are trained and
comply with the analytical procedures.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
• Collect blood in a red or gold-top (SST) tube.
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen within 2 hours of collection to separate
serum.
• Serum should be analyzed as soon as possible or stored at 2-8°C
for up to 7 days if delayed. For long-term storage, freeze serum
aliquots at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens that are not properly labeled.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of performing iron and
TIBC assays
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and Freezer (-20°C or lower)
Reagents:
• Commercially available iron reagent kits
• Commercially available TIBC reagent kits or calculated via iron
and unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC)
• Calibrators and controls as provided by the reagent
manufacturers
Supplies:
• Centrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Gloves and appropriate PPE
4. PROCEDURE
I. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen’s integrity (absence of hemolysis) and
proper labeling.
2. Centrifuge blood specimens to obtain serum if not already
done.
3. Aliquot serum if necessary.
II. Iron Measurement:
1. Load the serum sample and iron reagent onto the automated
chemistry analyzer.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to perform the iron
assay.
3. Document the results.
III. TIBC Measurement:
Method 1: Direct Measurement:
1. Load the serum sample and TIBC reagents onto the automated
chemistry analyzer.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to perform the TIBC
assay.
3. Document the results.
Method 2: Calculation via UIBC:
1. Perform iron measurement as described above.
2. Perform UIBC assay using the automated analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Calculate TIBC using the formula: TIBC = Iron + UIBC.
4. Document the results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Commercially available iron and TIBC controls (normal and
abnormal ranges)
Procedure:
1. Run quality control materials with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Document control results and ensure values fall within
established ranges before reporting patient results.
3. If controls fail, remediate the issue, recalibrate the analyzer,
and re-run the controls.
Frequency:
• Perform quality control at the beginning of each shift.
• Perform additional QC after instrument maintenance or
calibration.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all patient results and QC data.
2. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Ensure results are verified by authorized personnel before
releasing.
7. REFERENCE RANGES
Consult your laboratory's established reference ranges or the reagent
manufacturer’s guidelines for normal ranges. Common reference
ranges are:
• Serum Iron:
◦ Men: 65-176 µg/dL
◦ Women: 50-170 µg/dL
• TIBC:
◦ 250-450 µg/dL
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can lead to falsely elevated iron levels.
• Proper specimen handling is crucial to avoid degradation or
contamination.
• Ensure serum separation occurs within the recommended
timeframe.
