Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating IRON Results from LIVER TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating iron results from liver tissue specimens in a
clinical laboratory setting. The protocol ensures accurate and reliable
results for diagnosing and monitoring conditions related to iron
metabolism such as hemochromatosis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP,
ensuring proper use of equipment, reagents, and documentation of
processes and results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Iron Measurement: Quantification of iron content in liver tissue,
typically performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry or
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Liver
Tissue Specimen: Liver biopsy samples preserved and prepared for
iron analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer or ICP-MS
• Centrifuge
• Microbalance
• Homogenizer
• Water bath or heating block
• Acid-washed glassware and containers
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Hydrogen peroxide (trace metal grade)
• Certified iron standard solutions
• Calibration standards
• Control samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Obtain liver tissue sample following standard collection and
accession procedures.
2. Homogenize the liver tissue sample using a homogenizer.
3. Accurately weigh a known amount of the homogenized liver
tissue (typically 0.1-0.5 grams) using a microbalance and
transfer it to an acid-washed digestion tube.
4. Add 5 mL of trace metal grade nitric acid to the tissue sample.
5. Add 1 mL of trace metal grade hydrogen peroxide to the tube.
6. Place the digestion tube in a water bath or heating block at
95°C until the sample is completely digested (usually 3-4
hours).
7. Allow the digested sample to cool to room temperature.
C) Instrument Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the atomic absorption spectrophotometer or ICP-MS
using certified iron standard solutions at multiple concentrations
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run control samples at known iron concentrations to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the measurements. Document
control results.
3. If control sample results fall outside acceptable limits,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's guidelines and
recalibrate the instrument.
D) Iron Measurement and Data Recording:
1. Dilute the digested liver tissue sample as needed to fall within
the linear range of the instrument.
2. Load the diluted sample into the instrument according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Measure the iron concentration of the liver tissue sample.
Obtain a printout or electronic record of the results.
4. Record the iron concentration and relevant information (sample
ID, date, technologist initials) in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
E) Reporting Results:
1. Review the iron concentration results for accuracy and
completeness.
2. Compare the results with defined reference intervals for liver
iron content.
3. Verify the results in the LIS before submitting the final report.
4. Notify the attending physician of any critical values according to
laboratory policy.
F) Sample Integrity and Troubleshooting:
1. Visually inspect the digested sample for any signs of incomplete
digestion or contamination.
2. If there are integrity concerns, repeat the digestion procedure
with a new aliquot of the liver tissue sample.
3. Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control checks are essential for ensuring the accuracy of
iron measurements.
• Run control samples at the beginning of each analytical run.
• Maintain proper documentation of control results and corrective
actions if necessary.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for liver iron content typically range from:
• Normal: 0.3 – 1.2 mg/g dry weight
• Elevated: > 1.2 mg/g dry weight
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instrument manual and reagent
specifications for limitations and potential interferences that may
affect iron measurement.

This SOP is effective as of [Date] and will be reviewed annually or as
needed. Laboratory personnel must adhere to the procedures
outlined to ensure accurate and reliable iron measurement results
from liver tissue specimens.
