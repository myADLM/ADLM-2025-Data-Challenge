Standard Operating Procedure for Iron Profile Testing in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a consistent and efficient method for the analysis of iron
profile in plasma in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
laboratory results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of iron profiles in plasma samples. The iron profile typically includes
the measurement of serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC),
and transferrin saturation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this SOP to
ensure accurate and consistent results. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring compliance with this SOP and providing training to
laboratory staff.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
4.1 Equipment:
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter, etc.)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibration and control materials specific for iron profile
4.2 Reagents:
• Iron reagent kit
• TIBC reagent kit
• Calibrators
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal levels)
4.3 Materials:
• Plasma samples
• Sample tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Requirements:
• Collect blood in a heparinized tube (preferably green top tube).
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes to obtain
plasma.
• Aliquot the plasma into appropriately labeled tubes if not analyzed
immediately.
• Store samples at 2-8°C if short-term storage is required (up to 24
hours). For longer storage, freeze the samples at -20°C or lower.
5.2 Calibration:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to prepare and load
calibrators.
• Calibrate the chemistry analyzer as per the instrument’s
requirements.
• Record the calibration results. Ensure that calibration passes all
quality checks before proceeding.
5.3 Quality Control:
• Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning of each shift,
after calibration, and with each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure that QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
patient samples are tested. If QC results are outside the
acceptable limits, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and repeat the QC.
• Document the QC results and any corrective actions taken.
5.4 Sample Analysis:
• Load the plasma samples on the chemistry analyzer according to
the laboratory’s sample processing guidelines.
• Ensure the correct sample identification and match the sample
positions with the worklist.
• Select the iron profile test panel which includes serum iron and
TIBC.
• Enter the required information in the analyzer’s system and start
the analysis.
5.5 Result Calculation:
• Once the plasma samples have been analyzed by the instrument,
retrieve the raw results for serum iron and TIBC.
• Calculate transferrin saturation using the formula: [
\text{Transferrin Saturation (%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Serum Iron (µg/
dL)}}{\text{TIBC (µg/dL)}} \right) \times 100 ]
• Ensure that the results for serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin
saturation are accurate and within expected ranges.
5.6 Validation and Reporting:
• Review and validate all results to ensure consistency and
accuracy.
• Report results according to the laboratory’s standard reporting
procedures.
• Critical or unusual results should be re-checked and confirmed
before reporting. For any discrepancies, follow the laboratory
protocol for repeat testing and result verification.
6. POST ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
• Dispose of all biohazard waste materials (e.g., used pipette tips
and sample tubes) in accordance with the laboratory’s waste
disposal policies.
• Clean and maintain instruments as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines and laboratory protocols.
• Document any maintenance performed and any issues
encountered during the analysis.

• Manufacturer’s Instructions and Product Inserts for the Chemistry
Analyzer and Reagents.
• Laboratory’s Quality Control and Calibration Procedures Manual.
• CLIA Regulations and Guidelines for Clinical Laboratories.
8. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• The laboratory manager is responsible for ensuring that this SOP
is reviewed and updated annually or whenever there is a change
in procedures, equipment, or regulations that affect the analysis of
the iron profile.
By adhering to this SOP, we ensure consistent and accurate
measurement of the iron profile in plasma samples, contributing to
effective patient diagnosis and management.
NOTE: Always refer to the latest guidelines and training materials
updated as of October 2023 for any procedural changes.
