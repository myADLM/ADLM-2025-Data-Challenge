STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: ANALYTICAL PHASE OF
GENERATING IRON, SERUM RESULTS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
measurement of serum iron levels using the laboratory’s assigned
methodology. This protocol ensures accuracy, precision, and
reproducibility in the generation of iron, serum results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all qualified laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of serum iron levels.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform the analysis as
per this protocol and to ensure quality control measures are adhered
to. Any deviations or discrepancies must be reported to the
supervisor immediately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Specimen Type and Collection
• Specimen: Serum
• Collection Container: Red-top (no additive) or serum separator
tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum
• Collection Criteria:
◦ Collect blood by venipuncture.
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge promptly to separate serum.
◦ Preferred collection time: Morning (due to diurnal variation in
iron levels).
4.2 Specimen Handling and Stability
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if assay will be performed within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment
• Spectrophotometer
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
5.2 Reagents
• Iron reagent kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Calibrators
• Controls (Normal and Abnormal Levels)
• Distilled or deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to come to room
temperature prior to use.
2. Ensure that the spectrophotometer and all equipment are
calibrated and functional.
6.2 Calibration
1. Prepare calibration standards as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Program the spectrophotometer with the calibration curve,
following the instrument’s manual.
6.3 Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (both normal and abnormal) with
each batch of patient samples.
2. Document and verify QC results before proceeding with patient
sample analysis. QC results must be within the acceptable
range defined by the lab’s quality assurance guidelines.
6.4 Sample Analysis
1. Label all sample tubes clearly with patient identification.
2. Pipette the appropriate volumes of serum, reagents, and
calibrators into the tubes as specified by the reagent kit
instructions.
3. Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
4. Incubate the mixture at the specified temperature and time
recommended by the reagent kit.
5. After incubation, measure the absorbance or color change on
the spectrophotometer.
6. Record the absorbance readings and calculate serum iron
concentration using the calibration curve.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Data Entry
1. Enter the serum iron levels into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Verify the results to ensure they match the values recorded
from the spectrophotometer.
7.2 Reference Intervals
• Normal Serum Iron Levels:
◦ Males: 12.5–31.3 µmol/L (70-175 µg/dL)
◦ Females: 10.7–30.4 µmol/L (60-170 µg/dL)
7.3 Critical Values
• Any results outside the reference intervals or those deemed
clinically significant must be flagged and promptly communicated
to the attending physician or healthcare provider.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
8.1 Regular Maintenance
• Regularly clean and maintain the spectrophotometer according to
the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Perform periodic calibration verifications to ensure accuracy.
8.2 Documentation and Review
• Maintain records of all controls, calibrations, and patient results.
• Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance with
the SOP.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
9.1 Interferences
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with serum iron
measurements.
• Certain medications and dietary supplements can affect serum
iron levels.
9.2 Troubleshooting
• If QC samples are out of range, recalibrate the instrument and
rerun the controls.
• Investigate and resolve any causes of variability before reporting
patient results.
