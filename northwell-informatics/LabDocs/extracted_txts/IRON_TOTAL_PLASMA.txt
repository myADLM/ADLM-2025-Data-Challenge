STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE ANALYTICAL PHASE
FOR IRON, TOTAL, PLASMA
1. Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the procedure for
conducting the analytical phase of generating results for Total Plasma
Iron using the specified assay method in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
The aim is to ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability in the assay
results.
1. Scope
This SOP applies to all designated staff responsible for conducting
total plasma iron assays in the laboratory.
1. Responsibility
All designated staff are responsible for performing total plasma iron
assays as per the method described. It is the responsibility of the
supervising technologist to ensure that all procedures are followed
accurately and promptly, and that results are reviewed appropriately.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred specimens: Plasma collected in lithium heparin. Sodium
heparin or EDTA tubes are also acceptable.
• Specimens should be processed within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimens must be centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain plasma.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
1. Reagents and Supplies
• Commercially available Iron Assay Kit.
• Calibrators and Quality Control materials.
• Reagent Grade Water (Type I Water).
• Certified analytical grade reagents and supplies as described in
the assay kit manual.
1. Equipment
• Automated Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.
• Centrifuge (capable of achieving 3000 x g).
• Refrigerated storage for reagents and controls.
• Suitable calibrated pipettes.
• Timer.
1. Calibration and Quality Control
• Calibrate the Clinical Chemistry Analyzer using the calibrator
provided with the Iron Assay Kit.
• Perform calibration verification using at least two levels of control
material, both within and outside the expected range of results,
prior to running patient samples.
• Quality control must be conducted at the beginning of each shift,
with each new reagent kit, and following any maintenance or
repair of the analyzer.
• Quality control results must fall within the defined limits provided
by the manufacturer before reporting any patient results.
1. Procedure
A. Preparation
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Gently mix reagents and specimens by inversion.
• Confirm that all electronic equipment (analyzer, centrifuge) is
functioning correctly.
B. Assay Procedure
• Load the prepared plasma samples, calibrators, and quality
controls onto the chemistry analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Program and run the analyzer following the Iron Assay Kit
methodology.
• Start the assay.
C. Monitoring
• Monitor the assay run to ensure there are no alarms or error
codes.
• Ensure all calibration and quality control data are acceptable
before proceeding with patient specimens.
• Document all calibrations and quality control results in the
appropriate log.
D. Result Generation
• Review analyzer results upon completion of the assay run.
• Compare the generated data against quality control ranges to
ensure assay validity.
• Document any instances of recalibration or corrective action in
response to out-of-range quality control results.
E. Result Verification
• Verify patient results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• For any critical or unexpected results, repeat the analysis to
confirm accuracy before reporting.
• Ensure results are reviewed and signed off by the supervising
technologist.
1. Reporting Results
• Results should be entered into the LIS and released to the
Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system once verified.
• Report units for iron concentration in µg/dL (micrograms per
deciliter).
• Include any relevant comments or interpretation based on
laboratory policies or necessary physician consultations.
1. Reference Intervals
• Reference intervals for total plasma iron should be based on the
laboratory's validated ranges as provided by the assay
manufacturer or laboratory’s specific population data.
1. Troubleshooting and Limitations
• Refer to the Iron Assay Kit insert for specific limitations.
• In case of technical problems or unexpected assay results,
consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
• Verify instrument and reagent performance if repeated issues
occur, and document any actions taken.
1. Documentation
• Maintain logs for calibrations, quality control checks, and patient
results.
• Document all troubleshooting activities and corrective actions.
1. References
• Manufacturer's Iron Assay Kit Instructions for Use (IFU)
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Relevant reference literature for total plasma iron assays.
1. Review and Amendments
This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
significant change in procedure or instrumentation. Amendments to
this SOP must be approved by the laboratory supervisor and
documented accordingly.
