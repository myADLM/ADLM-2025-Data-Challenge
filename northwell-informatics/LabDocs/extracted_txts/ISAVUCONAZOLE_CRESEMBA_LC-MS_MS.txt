ISAVUCONAZOLE (CRESEMBA) LC-MS/MS Analysis Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To establish and maintain a standardized method for the quantitative
determination of Isavuconazole (CRESEMBA) in plasma or serum
samples using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel trained in LC-MS/MS operation
will perform the analysis of Isavuconazole.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
protocol to ensure the integrity and accuracy of results.
2. PRINCIPLE
This method involves protein precipitation followed by sample
extraction, chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometric
detection for the quantification of Isavuconazole in clinical
specimens.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: Plasma or serum collected in EDTA or heparin tubes.
• Volume: 1-2 mL.
• Minimum: 0.5 mL (limited testing scenarios).
• Avoid hemolysis and lipemic samples.
3.2. Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Samples must be centrifuged within 1 hour of collection at 1500 x
g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Aliquot plasma or serum into labeled cryovials.
• Store samples at -20°C or colder if analysis is not performed
immediately.
• Thaw samples at room temperature and mix thoroughly before
analysis.
3.3. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
• Samples not stored as per the above guidelines.
• Samples greater than 24 hours old if stored at room temperature.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1. Equipment:
• LC-MS/MS System: Comprised of a high-performance liquid
chromatograph (HPLC) coupled with a tandem mass
spectrometer.
• Centrifuge, Micropipettes, Vortex Mixer.
4.2. Reagents:
• LC-MS grade water, acetonitrile, methanol.
• Formic acid or any volatile acid for mobile phase preparation.
• Internal Standard: Example - Deuterated Isavuconazole (IS).
• Calibration standards and quality control samples of known
Isavuconazole concentration.
4.3. Supplies:
• Sample vials, HPLC columns, mobile phase solvents.
• Disposable pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Calibration and QC Preparation:
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples at
various concentrations in blank plasma/serum.
• Verify calibration and QC standards against reference material for
accuracy.
5.2. Sample Preparation: A. Protein Precipitation:
1. Add 100 µL of plasma/serum sample to a microcentrifuge tube.
2. Add 10 µL of the internal standard solution to each sample.
3. Add 300 µL of cold acetonitrile, vortex for 1 minute.
4. Centrifuge at 15000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for LC-MS/MS analysis.
B. Chromatographic Conditions:
1. Column: Specify appropriate C18 column (e.g., 50 x 2.1 mm,
2.6 µm particle size).
2. Mobile Phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid.
3. Mobile Phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
4. Gradient: Begin with 95% A and 5% B, gradient to 5% A and
95% B over 10 minutes.
5. Flow rate: 0.4 mL/min.
6. Injection volume: 10 µL.
C. Mass Spectrometric Conditions:
1. Ion Source: Electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode.
2. Monitor multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions for
Isavuconazole and internal standard.
5.3. Data Acquisition and Analysis:
• Analyze samples in batches; include blank, calibration standards,
and QC samples within each run.
• Utilize LC-MS/MS software to acquire and integrate peak areas of
Isavuconazole and internal standard.
5.4. Calculation and Result Validation:
• Generate calibration curve by plotting peak area ratios (analyte/
IS) versus concentration of calibration standards.
• Determine sample concentrations from the calibration curve.
• Validate results through comparison with QC sample results;
ensure all QC results fall within ±15% of their nominal
concentrations.
5.5. Reporting Results:
• Report Isavuconazole concentration in µg/mL.
• Review and verify all results for consistency and accuracy.
• Document any deviations from the procedure and take corrective
actions if necessary.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of QC samples (low, high) in each
analytical run.
• Verify that QC results fall within specified limits.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, reevaluate samples
and troubleshoot possible sources of error.
B. Inter-Laboratory Comparison:
• Periodically participate in inter-laboratory comparison to ensure
the accuracy of the method.
• Address and rectify any discrepancies immediately.
7. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Routine maintenance of the LC-MS/MS system should be
performed as per the manufacturer’s recommendation.
• Document any system glitches or anomalies, perform
troubleshooting, and notify the supervisor if necessary.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the LC-MS/MS system and
consumables.
• Peer-reviewed analytical methods and guidelines from accredited
bodies (e.g., Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, CLSI).
• Package insert for CRESEMBA and the reference standards
used.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
reliable and accurate determination of Isavuconazole concentrations
in clinical specimens using LC-MS/MS methods. Compliance with
this procedure will help maintain consistency across analyses and
safeguard result integrity.
