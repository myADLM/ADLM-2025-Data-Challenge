Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ISAVUCONAZOLE
SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to standardize the process of
isavuconazole susceptibility testing, ensuring accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results for the determination of fungal susceptibility to
isavuconazole.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform
isavuconazole susceptibility testing according to this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all technologists are
adequately trained and that the procedures are followed.
1. DEFINITION
Isavuconazole susceptibility testing involves determining the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isavuconazole against
fungal isolates, to establish the effectiveness of isavuconazole in
treating fungal infections.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable:
• Freshly isolated fungal cultures grown on suitable medium and
incubated for an appropriate period as per established
microbiological guidelines (e.g., Sabouraud dextrose agar).
Unacceptable:
• Mixed cultures, contaminated cultures, and cultures older than
specified incubation period.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Isavuconazole powder
• Sterile normal saline (0.85% NaCl) or appropriate diluent
• Microdilution plates (e.g., 96-well plates)
• Sterile pipets and tips
• Sterile tubes for preparation of drug dilutions
• Culture medium (e.g., RPMI 1640 with MOPS buffer)
• Incubator set to 35°C
• Sterile cotton swabs
• Turbidity standard (e.g., 0.5 McFarland standard)
• Automated or manual readers for MIC determination
• Quality control strains (e.g., Candida krusei ATCC 6258, Candida
parapsilosis ATCC 22019)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Isavuconazole Stock Solution
1. Weigh the necessary amount of isavuconazole powder to
prepare the stock solution. Dissolve in a suitable solvent (e.g.,
DMSO as per the manufacturer’s instruction).
2. Prepare stock solutions at a high concentration (e.g., 1 mg/mL).
3. Filter-sterilize the stock solution and aliquot into sterile tubes.
4. Store aliquots at -20°C and use within the expiry date.
B. Preparation of Serial Dilutions
1. Thaw an aliquot of isavuconazole stock solution.
2. Prepare serial twofold dilutions of isavuconazole in the
appropriate diluent to cover the desired range of
concentrations.
3. Dispense 100 µL of each dilution into corresponding wells of the
microdilution plate.
C. Inoculum Preparation
1. Use a sterile cotton swab to transfer colonies from a fresh
subculture to a sterile tube containing normal saline.
2. Adjust the turbidity to match a 0.5 McFarland standard, yielding
approximately 1x10^6 to 5x10^6 CFU/mL.
3. Further dilute the inoculum to achieve a final concentration of
0.5x10^3 to 2.5x10^3 CFU/mL.
D. Inoculation and Incubation
1. Add 100 µL of the prepared fungal inoculum to each well of the
microdilution plate containing the isavuconazole dilutions.
2. Include growth controls (medium plus antifungal-free inoculum)
and sterility controls (medium only).
3. Cover the microdilution plate with a sterile lid and incubate at
35°C for 48 hours.
E. MIC Determination
1. Examine the wells for visible growth inhibition.
2. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of
isavuconazole that completely inhibits visible growth.
3. Record the MIC values manually or using an automated reader.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform susceptibility testing on control strains with known
isavuconazole susceptibility patterns.
6. Compare MIC values obtained for control strains with
established reference values.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Report MIC values using the clinical thresholds defined by
established guidelines (e.g., CLSI or EUCAST).
9. MIC interpretations should be reported as susceptible,
intermediate, or resistant based on standardized breakpoints.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the latest CLSI or EUCAST guidelines for interpretative
breakpoints of isavuconazole against specific fungal isolates.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to CLSI or EUCAST documents for potential limitations on
susceptibility testing methods and any organism-specific variations.
