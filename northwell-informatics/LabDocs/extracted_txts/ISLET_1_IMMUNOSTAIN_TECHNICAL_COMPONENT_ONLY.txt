Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
ISLET 1 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized methodology for preparing, staining, and
analyzing tissue sections using the Islet 1 immunostain for technical
component only. This procedure will ensure consistency in the
performance of immunohistochemistry and reproducibility of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemical staining techniques and is relevant for
technical purposes only.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined, recording results, and ensuring quality
control.
• Supervisors/Laboratory Managers: Responsible for training
personnel, ensuring adherence to SOPs, and reviewing recorded
results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopic slides with paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Islet 1 primary antibody
• Detection System (DAB or other as specified)
• Positive and negative controls
• Auto-stainer (if available)
• Staining reagents (buffer solutions, blocking solutions, secondary
antibodies)
• Xylene, ethanol, and distilled water
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Microscope
5. TEMPERATURE AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS
• Storage of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks: Room temperature
• Islet 1 antibody: Store as per manufacturer’s instructions (typically
at 2-8°C)
• Other reagents: Store according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
Some may require refrigeration (2-8°C).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Pre-staining Preparation
1. Sectioning
◦ Cut paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into 4-5 µm thick
sections using a microtome.
◦ Float sections in a water bath at approximately 40°C to
flatten.
◦ Mount sections onto charged slides.
2. Drying
◦ Bake slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour to facilitate
adhesion.
6.2. Staining Process
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes, repeat this step
twice.
◦ Hydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol solutions
(100%, 95%, 70%) followed by distilled water for 5 minutes
each.
2. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer pH 6.0) in a microwave or a pressure cooker.
◦ Cool slides to room temperature and wash in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS).
3. Peroxidase Blocking
◦ Incubate slides with hydrogen peroxide solution (3%) for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Rinse in PBS.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Apply Islet 1 primary antibody diluted as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
◦ Rinse in PBS.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation
◦ Apply secondary antibody according to the detection system
being used.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in PBS.
6. Detection and Visualization
◦ Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB) and incubate for the
recommended time (typically 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
7. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in tap water and differentiate in a mild acid solution if
necessary.
◦ Blue in tap water for 5 minutes.
8. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
100%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 10 minutes.
◦ Mount slides with coverslips using a suitable mounting
medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include appropriate positive and negative controls with each
staining run.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date.
3. Document any deviations from the procedure and notify the
supervisor immediately.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Evaluate the stained sections under a microscope.
• Document staining patterns and intensity.
• Submit slides for pathologist review.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for Islet 1 antibody and detection
system.
