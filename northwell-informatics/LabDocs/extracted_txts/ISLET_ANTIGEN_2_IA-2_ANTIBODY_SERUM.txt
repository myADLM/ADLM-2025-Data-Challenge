Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ISLET ANTIGEN 2 (IA-2)
ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The procedure outlines the standardized method for the analytical
phase of generating results for ISLET ANTIGEN 2 (IA-2) ANTIBODY,
SERUM testing. The IA-2 antibody test aids in the diagnosis and
monitoring of autoimmune diabetes by detecting autoantibodies
against islet cell antigen 2.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members will perform the IA-2 antibody testing
following this SOP. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring all
procedures are followed accurately, results are validated, and any
corrective actions are implemented.
1. DEFINITIONS
IA-2 antibody: Autoantibodies directed against the islet cell antigen 2,
associated with autoimmune diabetes.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Specimen Collection: Blood should be collected into SST (serum
separator tube) or plain red-top tube.
• Handling: Centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours of
collection.
• Storage: Store serum at 2-8°C if testing within 72 hours;
otherwise, freeze at -20°C or lower for up to 6 months.
B. Reagents and Equipment:
• IA-2 Antibody ELISA Kit:
◦ Store kit components as per manufacturer’s instructions
(typically at 2-8°C).
◦ Do not use reagents past the expiration date.
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm (with 620 nm
reference filter, if required)
• Automated or manual wash system for ELISA
• Pipettes and tips for accurate liquid handling
• Calibration standards and controls as provided in the kit
C. Quality Control Materials:
• Positive Control Serum (High-level control)
• Negative Control Serum (Low-level control)
• Store control materials at 2-8°C until ready for use.
D. Testing Procedure:
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to equilibrate to room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare all reagents, working standards, and samples
according to the kit instructions.
3. Pipette appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples into designated wells of the microplate.
4. Add the provided enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well.
5. Incubate the microplate according to kit instructions (usually
30-60 minutes at room temperature).
6. Wash the microplate wells to remove unbound materials using
the automated or manual wash system.
7. Add the substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the microplate in the dark for the specified time
(usually 15-30 minutes) at room temperature.
9. Add the stop solution to terminate the reaction.
10. Read the microplate at 450 nm using a microplate reader with a
reference filter, if applicable.
E. Interpretation of Results:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each standard, control, and
patient sample.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting mean absorbance values
of standards against their respective concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of IA-2 antibodies in patient samples
from the standard curve.
• Interpret according to kit-provided criteria for positivity thresholds.
F. Reporting Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by a
technologist.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for format and critical
values.
G. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Validate new batch reagents against known standards.
• Document controls and patient results as per laboratory policy.
• If controls fail, troubleshoot and repeat the assay before reporting
any patient results.
H. Method Limitations:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with test results and
should be avoided.
• Refer to kit insert for additional limitations specific to the IA-2
Antibody ELISA.

1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Should discrepancies arise in the results, review calibration
curves and control results.
• Ensure no contamination or procedural errors during sample
handling and testing.
• Notify the supervisor for further investigation and corrective action
if needed.
