ISOAGGLUTININ TITER, ANTI-A, SERUM Analysis SOP
1. PURPOSE: This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is
established to describe the process for performing
ISOAGGLUTININ TITER, ANTI-A, SERUM analysis. It will
ensure accurate, precise, and reproducible results are achieved
in accordance with regulatory and accrediting organization
standards.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to
follow the procedure as outlined and to ensure all quality controls are
performed and documented. Supervisors are responsible for the
oversight and verification of the process.
1. SPECIMEN: 2.1 Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Serum collected in a red-top tube (serum separator tube).
Optimum collection is 5-10 mL.
◦ Specimen must be properly labeled with patient information
and collection time.
2.2 Unacceptable: - Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or
icteric. - Specimens not properly labeled or collected.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES: 3.1 Reagents:
◦ Anti-A reagent
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Normal saline
Store reagents at 2-8°C, following manufacturer instructions for
storage and expiration.
3.2 Supplies: - Micropipettes and tips - Test tubes - Serological
pipettes - Centrifuge - Incubator - Marker for labeling
1. QUALITY CONTROL: 4.1 Use positive and negative control
samples with each batch of tests. 4.2 Document control results
in the QC logbook.
2. PROCEDURE: 5.1 Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room
temperature.
◦ Label test tubes appropriately for controls and patient
specimens.
5.2 Initial Dilution: - Pipette 25 µL of patient serum into a test tube. -
Add 225 µL of PBS to the tube, achieving a 1:10 dilution.
5.3 Serial Doubling Dilutions: - Prepare additional tubes for serial
dilutions. - Transfer 100 µL from the initial 1:10 dilution to the next
tube containing 100 µL of PBS, mixing thoroughly. Repeat the
process to generate serial two-fold dilutions up to 1:1280 (1:10, 1:20,
1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640, 1:1280).
5.4 Addition of Anti-A Reagent: - Add 25 µL of Anti-A reagent to each
test tube containing the diluted serum.
5.5 Incubation: - Gently mix and incubate the tubes at 37°C for 30
minutes.
5.6 Centrifugation: - Centrifuge the test tubes at 1000 rpm for 5
minutes.
5.7 Observation: - After centrifuging, resuspend the pellets gently by
tapping the bottom of the tubes. - Observe and grade the
agglutination reaction visually using the following scale: 4+ = One
solid clump 3+ = Several large clumps 2+ = Medium-sized clumps,
clear background 1+ = Small clumps, turbid background 0 = No
agglutination
5.8 Titer Determination: - The titer is the highest dilution at which
agglutination is still observable (i.e., last tube showing 1+
agglutination).
5.9 Documentation: - Record results, including the grade of each
dilution and the titer value. - Document any irregularities or deviations
in the process in the procedural log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS: 6.1 Reference intervaI:
◦ Typical titer result for Anti-A: Less than or equal to 1:64
◦ Values higher than the reference interval may indicate
alloimmunization and should be reported promptly to the
clinician.
6.2 Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) accurately. Results and any comments or abnormalities
should be verified by a supervisor before release.
1. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION: 7.1 The titer value is
calculated as the highest dilution at which agglutination is
observed. 7.2 Interpretation should be done in the context of
patient clinical history and current condition.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS: 8.1 Any hemolyzed or contaminated
specimens must be recollected and tested. 8.2 Interpretation
requires careful observation. Operator skill and experience are
key for reliable results. 8.3 Adherence to incubation times and
temperatures is crucial for accurate results.
3. REFERENCES: 9.1 Manufacturer’s instructions for Anti-A
reagent. 9.2 Transfusion Medicine Standards and Guidelines
for clinical interpretation.
The procedure ensures that all steps from sample preparation,
dilutions, reagent addition, incubation, and result recording are
standardized for the ISOAGGLUTININ TITER, ANTI-A, SERUM
analysis, guaranteeing consistent and accurate outcomes.
