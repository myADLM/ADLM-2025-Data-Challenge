Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results:
ISOAGGLUTININ TITER, ANTI-B, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps for performing the ISOAGGLUTININ
TITER, ANTI-B, SERUM test to ensure accurate and reliable results
in the laboratory.
1. SCOPE
This procedure is mandatory for all laboratory personnel involved in
performing the ISOAGGLUTININ TITER, ANTI-B, SERUM test.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure the accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results.
All staff members must notify supervisory personnel of any
deficiencies encountered during the procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
ISOAGGLUTININ TITER, ANTI-B, SERUM: A laboratory test
performed to determine the concentration of Isoagglutinin anti-B
antibodies in a patient's serum.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Test tubes (12x75 mm)
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Saline solution (0.9% NaCl)
• Anti-B serum (commercially prepared reagent)
• Type B red blood cells (RBCs)
• Timer
• Agglutination viewer (optional)
• Latex gloves
• Laboratory coat and eye protection
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Verify and document the identity of the patient's serum sample.
2. Allow all reagents and patient serum to reach room temperature
before testing.
B) Serial Dilution of Serum
1. Label a series of test tubes from 1:2 to 1:2048.
2. Pipette 50 μL of normal saline into each labeled test tube.
3. Add 50 μL of the patient's serum to the first test tube (1:2
dilution) and mix thoroughly.
4. Transfer 50 μL from the first test tube to the next, mixing
thoroughly after each transfer. Continue this process through
the last dilution tube (1:2048).
C) Adding RBCs
1. Prepare a 2-5% suspension of type B RBCs in normal saline.
2. Add 50 μL of the B RBC suspension to each tube.
D) Incubation
1. Incubate the test tubes at 37°C for 30 minutes in the incubator.
2. After incubation, centrifuge the tubes at 1000 rpm for 1 minute
to enhance the visibility of agglutination.
E) Reading Results
1. Gently resuspend the RBCs by tapping the bottom of each test
tube.
2. Examine the resuspended RBCs for agglutination using an
agglutination viewer or the naked eye.
3. Record the highest dilution at which agglutination is observed.
This dilution represents the titer of anti-B isoagglutinin in the
patient serum.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include positive and negative control sera with each batch of
tests to ensure test validity.
6. Document the control results and ensure they are within the
expected range before reporting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. The titer of the anti-B isoagglutinin should be reported as the
highest dilution producing observable agglutination.
9. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
10. Verify and ensure results are accurately transmitted to the
healthcare provider.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
No specific reference intervals apply. Results must be interpreted in
context with patient history and clinical condition.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Variability in the preparation of red blood cell suspensions can
impact agglutination.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may yield inaccurate results.
• Improper incubation or centrifugation techniques may lead to
erroneous readings.
1. REFERENCES
• Standard laboratory texts on blood bank and immunohematology
procedures.
• Manufacturer instructions for commercial anti-B reagent and B
RBCs.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological samples with standard precautions.
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials in accordance with
institution protocols.
• Ensure all staff performing the procedure wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE).
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure consistent and
high-quality results for the ISOAGGLUTININ TITER, ANTI-B, SERUM
test. All steps must be meticulously documented, and any deviations
or issues must be immediately reported to supervisory staff.
