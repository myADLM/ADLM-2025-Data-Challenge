Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of
ISOCYANATE HDI, IgE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of Isocyanate HDI-specific IgE in serum. Accurate and timely analysis
of these antibodies can aid in the diagnosis of hypersensitivity
reactions to isocyanates, which are commonly used in industrial
settings.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory staff involved in
performing and interpreting the isocyanate HDI, IgE, serum test
within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the test
and documenting results.
• Quality Control Coordinator: Ensures quality control procedures
are followed and documented.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Reviews results and addresses any
issues or deviations from standard protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or plain red
top tube
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL of serum
• Specimen Stability: Stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Isocyanate HDI-specific IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators/Freezers
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
6. PROCEDURES
6.1. Initial Setup and Calibration
1. Prepare the Analyzer
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to perform a
self-check.
◦ Ensure that the maintenance and cleaning procedures have
been completed as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load Reagents
◦ Load the Isocyanate HDI-specific IgE reagent kit into the
designated slots.
◦ Check that all reagents are within their expiration dates.
3. Calibration
◦ Perform calibration using the calibrators provided with the
reagent kit.
◦ Follow the analyzer’s user manual for the calibration
procedure.
◦ Document the calibration results in the LIS and attach
printouts to the daily log.
6.2. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the Specimen
◦ Centrifuge SST tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ If using a plain red top tube, allow the blood to clot for 30
minutes before centrifugation.
2. Aliquot the Serum
◦ Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, uniquely labeled
sample tube.
◦ Ensure no red cells or fibrin contaminates the serum.
6.3. Analysis
1. Load Samples
◦ Place the aliquoted serum samples into the sample holder
on the analyzer.
◦ Enter the sample IDs into the LIS and ensure they match
the physical labels.
2. Run the Test
◦ Initiate the test run as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any errors or irregularities during
the run.
3. Quality Control
◦ Run positive and negative controls alongside patient
samples.
◦ Ensure that control results are within the acceptable range
before validating patient results.
6.4. Reporting Results
1. Review and Verification
◦ Review all results for accuracy and consistency with
controls.
◦ Investigate any outlier or questionable results as per the
laboratory's troubleshooting procedures.
2. Result Documentation
◦ Enter the validated results into the LIS.
◦ Print out the results and manually verify against the
instrument printout.
◦ Attach the printouts to the patient’s test documentation.
3. Critical Values
◦ Follow the laboratory’s protocol for reporting critical results.
◦ Document any calls made to healthcare providers and
actions taken.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Internal Quality Control
◦ Perform and document quality control checks as per the
reagent manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Maintain logs for reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
control results.
2. Proficiency Testing
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs at the
intervals required.
◦ Review and take corrective actions based on proficiency
test outcomes.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste in accordance with laboratory and
institutional protocols.
