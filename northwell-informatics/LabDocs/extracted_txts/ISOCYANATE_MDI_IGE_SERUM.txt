Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Isocyanate MDI,
IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of testing
Isocyanate MDI-specific IgE in serum samples. This SOP ensures
that the results generated are accurate, reliable, and reproducible.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to follow this SOP to ensure
the quality and integrity of the test results. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the adherence to these procedures and
addressing any issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITION
Isocyanate MDI-Specific IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to
Methylenediphenyl isocyanate (MDI), a compound commonly used in
the production of polyurethane foams.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA reader
• ELISA kits specific for Isocyanate MDI-specific IgE detection
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplates
• Refrigerators and freezers for reagent storage
• Laboratory timers
• Serum samples
• Deionized water
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
2. Prepare all necessary controls and calibrators per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Set up the ELISA reader and software for data acquisition.
Sample Handling:
1. Verify serum sample integrity upon receipt. Samples should be
properly labeled with patient ID, collection date, and time.
2. Store samples at 2-8°C if not immediately processed. For long-
term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
3. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature before
analysis. Mix gently without causing froth or bubbles.
ELISA Procedure:
1. Add required volume of calibrator, control, and serum sample to
the designated wells of the microplate.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the specified time
(refer to ELISA kit instructions).
3. Wash wells following the protocol provided in the ELISA kit
insert.
4. Add enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate further as per
instructions.
5. Wash wells thoroughly again.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and allow color
development for the time specified in the kit insert.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well.
8. Measure the absorbance using the ELISA reader. Collect data
using appropriate software.
Data Analysis:
1. Ensure all calibrators and controls within acceptable range
before interpreting patient results.
2. Use the calibration curve generated to derive concentration of
Isocyanate MDI-specific IgE in the serum samples.
3. Export data from ELISA reader for analysis and verification.
4. Paste results into Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
further review.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls alongside samples to
monitor assay performance.
2. Record control data and ensure compliance with established
limits.
3. Review control data periodically to identify trends or issues.
Reporting Results:
1. Verify results using laboratory SOP for result verification.
2. Input results into LIS after final review by laboratory personnel.
3. Ensure compliance with critical value reporting protocols.
Reference Intervals:
Consult the ELISA kit insert and laboratory references to establish
reference intervals for Isocyanate MDI-specific IgE.
Method Limitations:
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to the
detection of Isocyanate MDI-specific IgE.
