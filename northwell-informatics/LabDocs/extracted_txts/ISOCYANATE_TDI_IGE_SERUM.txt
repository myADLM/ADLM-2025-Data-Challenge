Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ISOCYANATE TDI, IGE,
SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide standardized procedures
for the analysis of ISOCYANATE TDI, IGE in serum samples in the
laboratory to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow
these procedures accurately to ensure the quality and integrity of the
results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any technical issues that may arise.
3. DEFINITIONS
Isocyanate TDI: It refers to Toluene Diisocyanate, a chemical
compound used in the manufacture of plastics and foams, which can
cause respiratory and skin sensitization.
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a type of antibody associated with allergic
reactions.
Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid that remains from blood plasma
after clotting factors have been removed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum obtained from venous blood.
• Collection Container: Red top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Specimen Stability: Stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge: For serum separation
• Pipettes and Tips: Various volumes
• Microplate Reader: For detecting and quantifying IgE
• TDI-specific IgE Assay Kits: Validated commercial assay kits
• Incubator: 37°C for reaction development
• Control Sera: Positive and negative controls for IgE and TDI
standards
• Calibrators: For calibration of IgE assay
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Phase
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Verify patient information and collection details.
◦ Centrifuge blood samples within 30 minutes of collection at
1,500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
◦ Aliquot serum into labeled sample tubes and store at 2-8°C
if analysis is performed within 48 hours, or freeze at -20°C
for long-term storage.
B. Analytical Phase
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples and reagents to room temperature
before use.
◦ Prepare assay reagents according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibrators and controls at the beginning of each assay
according to the kit instructions.
◦ Document the results and ensure that they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding with sample analysis.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette the required volume of serum and reagents into the
microplate wells as specified in the kit protocol.
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the recommended
duration.
◦ Wash the microplate as instructed to remove unbound
reagents.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate to allow color
development.
◦ Measure absorbance using the microplate reader at the
specified wavelength.
4. Calculation and Interpretation:
◦ Construct a standard curve using the absorbance values of
the calibrators.
◦ Determine the concentration of IgE specific to TDI in the
samples by comparing the sample absorbance to the
standard curve.
◦ Document results for each sample, including the units of
measurement (e.g., IU/mL or ng/mL).
C. Post-analytical Phase
1. Result Reporting:
◦ Review and verify all results for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Communicate critical values to the appropriate clinical
personnel following laboratory protocols.
2. Quality Assurance:
◦ Retain assay documentation including the standard curve,
control results, and sample absorbance values for quality
audits.
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure ongoing accuracy of test results.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or icteric samples may interfere with the assay and
should be avoided.
• Cross-reactivity with other isocyanates or unrelated compounds
should be considered while interpreting results.
