SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Isoniazid (INH)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a comprehensive protocol for
the analytical phase of generating results for isoniazid (INH) levels in
patient specimens. This will ensure accuracy, reliability, and
consistency in the measurement of INH, which is critical for
therapeutic drug monitoring and ensuring effective treatment for
tuberculosis.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated staff to follow this SOP
meticulously to ensure the integrity and accuracy of INH testing.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff adhere to the
procedure and that all corrective actions, if necessary, are
documented and implemented.
1. DEFINITION
Isoniazid (INH) is an antibiotic used for the treatment and prevention
of tuberculosis (TB). The accurate measurement of INH levels in
patient specimens is essential for monitoring therapeutic efficacy and
avoiding potential toxicity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum or plasma. Heparinized plasma is
preferred to avoid sample hemolysis.
◦ Collection: Blood should be drawn 2 hours post-dosing to
reflect peak levels.
◦ Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of serum or plasma is required.
◦ Stability: Serum or plasma specimens are stable for up to 24
hours at 2-8°C. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
may interfere with the assay and are not acceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) apparatus with
UV detection.
• INH-specific column for HPLC.
• Isoniazid standard solutions.
• Mobile phase: phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 3.0) and acetonitrile
(95:5, v/v).
• Quality control (QC) samples: at least two different
concentrations.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
◦ Prepare a series of INH standards at concentrations ranging
from 0.1 µg/mL to 5 µg/mL.
◦ Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the calibration range.
◦ Store standards and QC samples at -20°C.
B) Instrument Setup and Calibration:
◦ Set up the HPLC system with the INH-specific column.
◦ Degas the mobile phase and calibrate the HPLC system
using the INH standards.
◦ Inject the standards, and create a calibration curve by
plotting the peak areas against the respective INH
concentrations.
◦ Ensure the correlation coefficient (r) of the calibration curve
is at least 0.995 before proceeding with patient samples.
C) Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix
thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge serum/plasma samples at 3500 rpm for 10
minutes to ensure separation of cellular debris.
◦ Pipet 500 μL of the serum/plasma supernatant into a clean,
properly labeled HPLC vial.
D) Sample Analysis:
◦ Inject prepared patient specimens, QCs, and blank
(negative control) into the HPLC system.
◦ Run the HPLC system according to the specified INH
analytical method.
◦ Monitor the chromatograms for INH peaks and record the
retention times and peak areas.
E) Data Analysis and Reporting:
◦ Compare the retention times and peak areas of unknown
patient samples to the standard calibration curve to
determine INH concentrations.
◦ Ensure QC results fall within the pre-established acceptable
ranges. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the
assay and rerun the affected samples.
◦ Enter the INH concentration results into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. QUALITY CONTROL
• QC samples are to be run with each batch of patient samples to
ensure the accuracy and precision of results.
• If QC fails, the run must be repeated after identifying and
correcting the issue.
• Maintain a QC chart to monitor trends and deviations over time.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report INH concentrations in µg/mL.
• Critical results indicating potential toxicity (>6 µg/mL) should be
promptly communicated to the requesting physician.
• Document all results in the LIS and ensure they meet the
laboratory's reporting guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC apparatus and INH
column.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of
isoniazid.
1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintained following the
laboratory's routine maintenance schedule.
• Follow appropriate safety guidelines when handling biological
samples and reagents.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory will consistently produce
accurate and reliable INH measurements for effective patient care
and therapeutic management.
