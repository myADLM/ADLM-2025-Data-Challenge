Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for ISPAGHULA, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for ISPAGHULA, IgE, and SERUM testing. This
ensures reliable, accurate, and standardized results in compliance
with CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the tests according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and for addressing any issues that arise during testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• ISPAGHULA: Serum collected in a red-top tube (no
anticoagulant).
• IgE: Serum collected in a red-top or SST (Serum Separator Tube).
• SERUM: General serum analysis in a red-top or SST.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens must be kept at room temperature if they are to be
analyzed within the same day.
• For extended storage, specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C
and are stable for up to 72 hours.
• If specimens need to be stored longer, they should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Lipemic specimens
• Specimens collected in the wrong tube type
• Specimens not labeled with the date and time of collection.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Analyzer (e.g., Immunoassay Analyzer for IgE)
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Quality Control Materials
• Calibrators and Controls specific to each test
• ISPAGHULA reagent kits
• IgE reagent kits
• Routine SERUM chemistry reagents
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, safety
goggles
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Perform calibration using the manufacturer's recommended
calibrators for each assay.
• Calibration should be performed as per manufacturer's
instructions or after significant maintenance.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples at multiple levels (e.g., low, medium,
and high) for each test.
• QC materials should be run at the beginning of each shift, after
calibration, and after maintenance.
• Document all QC results and assess for acceptability before
proceeding with patient sample testing.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot, re-calibrate, and
repeat QC before analyzing patient samples.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
analysis.
• Label all tubes and materials appropriately.
ISPAGHULA Analysis:
• Obtain kits and reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare and run the sample on the designated analyzer.
• Document the run and ensure all controls fall within the
acceptable range.
• If the test is performed manually, follow the package insert for
detailed steps.
IgE Analysis:
• Prepare and load samples into the immunoassay analyzer.
• Calibrate the analyzer as needed.
• Load the specific IgE kit and ensure proper installation and
identification by the analyzer.
• Run the QC samples as described above.
• Proceed with patient sample analysis only after verifying
acceptable QC results.
SERUM Analysis:
• Prepare serum samples as required by the specific serum
analysis methods.
• Load samples into the chemistry analyzer or perform the manual
procedure as per the test requirement.
• Run and verify QC results.
• Analyze patient samples and document all findings.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results against QC and reference ranges.
• Document any deviations and take necessary corrective actions.
• Enter results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Review and verify results before final release.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REFERENCE RANGES
• Reference ranges should be included in the final report.
• Any results outside of reference ranges should be flagged and
rechecked.
• Critical values should be reported immediately to the attending
clinician as per lab policy.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the individual test kit inserts for limitations related to
reagent stability, assay interference, and other critical factors.
• Document and address any unexpected assay interferences or
anomalies immediately.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain all calibration, QC, and patient result logs for at least
three years.
• Ensure all logs are regularly reviewed and any discrepancies
investigated.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for common
issues.
• Contact technical support if problems persist.
