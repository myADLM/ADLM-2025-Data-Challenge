STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
TITLE: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Itraconazole,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear and precise instructions on the analytical procedures
for generating results for itraconazole levels in serum specimens.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all medical laboratory scientists performing
itraconazole assays in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
procedure accurately and ensure the quality and integrity of the
analytical process.
4. DEFINITIONS
Itraconazole: An antifungal drug used to treat a variety of fungal
infections.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Specimen Type: Serum
- Collection Container: Red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST)
- Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for the assay
- Storage: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C for long-term storage
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
- High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with UV detector
- Analytical Column: C18 or equivalent
- Analytical Standards: Itraconazole standard
- Quality Control Samples: Commercially available or laboratory prepared control samples at different concentration levels
- Mobile Phase Reagents: Typically consists of a mixture of organic solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) and aqueous solution (e.g., water with a buffer)
- Laboratory glassware and consumables
- Pipettes and pipette tips
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum sample to come to room temperature if stored
at 2-8°C or thaw completely if frozen.
2. Vortex the serum sample for 1-2 minutes to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Pipette a specific volume (e.g., 200 µL) of serum into a clean
microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 400 µL of extraction solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) to the serum
sample.
5. Vortex the mixture for 5 minutes.
6. Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
7. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge
tube.
8. Evaporate the supernatant to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen or using a centrifugal evaporator.
9. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of the mobile phase.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer’s
instructions and equilibrate the column with the mobile phase.
2. Inject a suitable volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the reconstituted
sample into the HPLC system.
3. Run the HPLC program with appropriate parameters for
detection of itraconazole (e.g., column temperature, flow rate,
UV detection wavelength).
4. Identify itraconazole by the retention time of the sample
compared to that of the standard.
5. Quantify the itraconazole concentration in the serum sample
using a calibration curve generated with known standards.
Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of quality control samples (low,
medium or high concentration) with each batch of samples
analyzed.
2. The results from the quality control samples must fall within the
established ranges before reporting patient results.
3. Repeat the assay if QC results are out of range and
troubleshoot potential issues (e.g., equipment malfunction,
reagent integrity).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
- All results should be reviewed for consistency and anomalies by the technologist before they are released.
- Enter the itraconazole concentration result into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
- Verify and validate results according to laboratory guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
- Reference intervals and therapeutic ranges should be based on current clinical guidelines and literature. Commonly used therapeutic range for itraconazole is 0.5-4.0 µg/mL but can be adjusted based on clinical settings.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Ensure the HPLC system is properly calibrated and maintained to avoid inaccuracies.
- Hemolyzed or lipemic serum samples might interfere with the analysis, appropriate handling and visual inspection of samples is necessary.
