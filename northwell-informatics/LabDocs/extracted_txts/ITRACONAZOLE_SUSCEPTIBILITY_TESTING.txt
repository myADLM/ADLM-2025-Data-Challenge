ITRACONAZOLE SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to standardize the procedure for
performing Itraconazole susceptibility testing to ensure accurate and
reliable results. This protocol outlines the methods to be used for the
preparation, inoculation, incubation, and interpretation of the results
for fungal isolates to determine their susceptibility to Itraconazole.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to carry out Itraconazole susceptibility testing according to
this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
and addressing any issues that arise during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A) Acceptable specimens:
• Pure fungal isolates from clinical specimens prepared according
to standard laboratory practices.
• Isolates must be in their exponential growth phase for optimal
results.
B) Unacceptable specimens:
• Mixed cultures or contaminated specimens.
• Specimens not properly labeled or with incomplete requisition
forms.
1. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Incubator set at 35°C ± 2°C.
• Spectrophotometer or alternative optical density measuring
device.
• Sterile petri dishes.
• Inoculating loops or needles.
• Pipettes and tips.
Materials:
• Mueller-Hinton broth (supplemented with glucose and methylene
blue for some fungi).
• Itraconazole reagent (pre-prepared Itraconazole dilutions).
• Sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl).
• Standard reference strains for quality control.
Reagents:
• Sodium chloride (NaCl).
• Glucose.
• Methylene blue.
• Distilled water.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Fungal Inoculum:
1. Inoculate the fungal isolate onto a suitable solid medium (e.g.,
Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) and incubate it at 35°C for 24-48
hours until adequate growth is observed.
2. Using a sterile inoculating loop, pick several colonies and
suspend in 5 mL of sterile saline.
3. Adjust the turbidity of the suspension to match the 0.5
McFarland standard using a spectrophotometer (approximately
1-5 x 10^6 CFU/mL).
B) Preparation of Test Media:
1. Prepare Mueller-Hinton broth according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, supplementing with glucose and methylene blue if
necessary.
2. Dispense 100 µL of prepared broth into each well of a
microdilution plate.
C) Inoculation and Itraconazole Addition:
1. Add 100 µL of the fungal suspension prepared in step A3 to
each well of the microdilution plate containing Mueller-Hinton
broth.
2. Add 100 µL of each Itraconazole dilution to the designated
wells, ensuring proper mixing.
3. Include positive controls (broth without Itraconazole) and
negative controls (broth without inoculum) in the microdilution
plate.
D) Incubation:
1. Seal the microdilution plate with a sterile cover to prevent
contamination and evaporation.
2. Incubate the plate at 35°C ± 2°C for 48 hours, checking at 24-
hour intervals for any growth.
E) Reading and Interpretation of Results:
1. After incubation, examine the wells for turbidity, which indicates
fungal growth.
2. Determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) by
identifying the lowest concentration of Itraconazole that inhibits
visible fungal growth.
3. Interpret the MIC values according to the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for fungal
susceptibility testing.
F) Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control testing alongside patient isolates using
standard reference strains to ensure accuracy.
2. Record all control results and validate the test results only if
quality control results are within acceptable ranges.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Enter the MIC values into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and review the results for accuracy.
5. Report results according to the established reporting guidelines,
ensuring that MIC values and interpretive categories
(susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are included.
6. PROCEDURE NOTES
7. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and validated prior to use.
8. Adhere to aseptic techniques to prevent contamination.
9. Follow all laboratory safety protocols while handling fungal
cultures and reagents.
