Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for J-Chain Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the technical
component of the J-Chain immunostain to ensure consistent and
reliable results. This procedure covers the preparation, staining, and
initial quality control of the immunohistochemistry process, excluding
the interpretation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This protocol is to be followed by trained laboratory personnel who
are responsible for conducting immunohistochemistry staining. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the procedure
is adhered to and to address any deviations.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Microscope slides
• Positive control slides (known J-chain positive tissue)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (absolute, 95%, and 70%)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 / EDTA buffer,
pH 9.0)
• Peroxidase block solution
• Blocking serum (appropriate for the species of the secondary
antibody)
• Primary anti-J-Chain antibody (specified concentration and
vendor)
• Secondary antibody (biotinylated or HRP-conjugated, specified
concentration and vendor)
• HRP-Streptavidin (if using biotinylated secondary antibody)
• DAB Substrate Kit
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Incubator/oven preset to required temperature for drying slides
• Staining rack and trays
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 micrometer thick tissue sections using the
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath set to approximately 40-45°C
to flatten them.
◦ Mount tissue sections onto microscope slides and air dry
overnight or place in an incubator at 37°C for 1-2 hours.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Immerse slides sequentially in two changes of xylene for 5
minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through two changes of absolute ethanol
for 3 minutes each, followed by 95% ethanol and then 70%
ethanol for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in running distilled water for 1-2 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (citrate
buffer or EDTA buffer) and incubate at 95-98°C for 20
minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in the antigen retrieval solution at room
temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes.
B. Immunostaining:
1. Peroxidase Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides in peroxidase block solution for 10 minutes
at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase
activity.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes.
2. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking serum to the slides and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature in a humidified chamber to
reduce nonspecific binding.
◦ Drain excess blocking serum but do not rinse.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply appropriately diluted primary anti-J-Chain antibody to
the tissue sections and incubate for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes, three times.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the appropriate secondary antibody (biotinylated or
HRP-conjugated) to the tissue sections and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
◦ If using a biotinylated secondary antibody, follow this step
with incubation with HRP-Streptavidin for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes, three times.
5. Visualization:
◦ Apply DAB substrate solution to the tissue sections and
incubate for 5-10 minutes, monitoring under a microscope
until the desired stain intensity develops.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes to stop the
reaction.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water and blue in 0.1% ammonia
water or similar for a few seconds.
◦ Rinse in running tap water again for 1-2 minutes.
C. Mounting:
• Dehydrate the tissue sections through sequential ethanols and
clear in xylene.
• Apply mounting medium and cover with a coverslip carefully to
avoid bubbles.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide with known J-Chain positive tissue
in each staining run to ensure staining accuracy.
• Stain a negative control slide (without primary antibody) to check
for nonspecific binding.
• Verify staining quality (intensity, localization) under a microscope
before releasing slides for interpretation.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides will be handed off to the designated pathologist
or trained personnel for interpretation and reporting of results.
• All results, including the performance of controls, will be
documented and reviewed.

1. REVISIONS
• Revised SOP document as of [October 2023]. Future revisions
will be documented and approved by the laboratory supervisor.
