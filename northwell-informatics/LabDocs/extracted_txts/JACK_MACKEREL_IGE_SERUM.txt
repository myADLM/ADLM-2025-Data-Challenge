Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Jack
Mackerel, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the steps and procedures involved in the analytical phase
of determining Jack Mackerel-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
concentration in serum by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). This protocol aims to ensure accurate and reliable
results while maintaining compliance with CLIA standards.
1. Scope
This protocol applies to all qualified laboratory personnel performing
Jack Mackerel-specific IgE serum testing within the laboratory.
1. Responsibilities
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
and ensuring adherence to the protocol.
• The supervisor is responsible for the oversight of the testing
process, validation of results, and addressing any deviations or
issues.
• All personnel must ensure that quality control measures are
consistently applied and any discrepancies are reported to the
supervisor immediately.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• ELISA microplate reader
• ELISA microplates
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Precision balance
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (capable of maintaining 37°C)
• Wash bottle or automated ELISA plate washer
Reagents:
• Jack Mackerel-specific IgE ELISA kit
• Controls and calibrators (provided with the ELISA kit)
• Wash buffer, substrate solution, stopping solution, and sample
diluent (provided with the ELISA kit)
• Deionized/distilled water
1. Procedure
Specimen Preparation:
1. Allow serum specimens to thaw if frozen.
2. Vortex to ensure homogeneity before analysis.
Assay Procedure:
1. ELISA Plate Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Set up the necessary number of wells for standards,
controls, and patient samples on the ELISA plate according
to the plate layout template.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples as specified in the kit insert
(typically 1:10 or 1:100) using the sample diluent provided.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
diluted samples into their designated wells.
◦ Add the detection antibody to all wells as per kit instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with an adhesive seal or plate cover.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified duration as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate wells using the wash buffer provided. This
typically involves multiple washes (e.g., 3-5 times) to
remove unbound materials. Manual or automatic washing
procedures can be followed.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to all wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for the
time specified by the manufacturer (usually 10-30 minutes).
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to all wells to terminate the enzyme-
substrate reaction.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength (commonly 450 nm) using the ELISA microplate
reader.
8. Quality Control
9. Ensure that external controls are within the specified range
before accepting patient results.
10. Positive and negative controls must be included in each assay
run.
11. All calibrators, controls, and patient samples should be
performed in duplicate for accuracy.
12. Interpretation of Results
13. Calculation:
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
each standard against its corresponding concentration. Use
linear regression or another suitable method to determine
the concentration of Jack Mackerel-specific IgE in patient
samples.
◦ Calculate the concentration of IgE in each sample from the
standard curve.
14. Validation:
◦ Verify that the control samples fall within the predefined
acceptable range. If controls are outside this range, the run
is invalid and must be repeated.
◦ Evaluate patient sample results for any possible
preanalytical or analytical errors.
15. Reporting of Results
16. Report the Jack Mackerel-specific IgE concentrations in
international units (IU/mL).
17. Document any anomalies or issues encountered during the
assay and the steps taken to resolve them.
18. Verified results should be entered into the laboratory
information system (LIS) for review and release by the
supervising technologist.
