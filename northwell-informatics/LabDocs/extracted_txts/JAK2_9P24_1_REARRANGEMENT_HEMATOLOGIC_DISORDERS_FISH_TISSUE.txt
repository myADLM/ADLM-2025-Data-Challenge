Standard Operating Procedure for JAK2 (9P24.1)
Rearrangement, Hematologic Disorders, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the detection of JAK2 (9P24.1) rearrangements in tissue samples
using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for the diagnosis of
hematologic disorders.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained technologists to perform the analysis
following this SOP and ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol,
reviewing results, and documenting corrective actions as necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type:
▪ Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
◦ Specimen Handling:
▪ Ensure samples are properly labeled with patient
identification.
▪ Store FFPE blocks at room temperature until use.
▪ Sections should be cut at 3-4µm thickness and mounted
on positively charged slides.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Fluorescent microscope with appropriate filter sets.
◦ FISH probe for JAK2 (9P24.1) rearrangement.
◦ Hybridization buffer.
◦ DAPI counterstain.
◦ Mounting media.
◦ Humidified hybridization chamber.
◦ ThermoBrite (or equivalent instrument for denaturation and
hybridization).
◦ Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%).
◦ 2x SSC (saline-sodium citrate) buffer.
◦ Detergent wash buffer.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Hybridization:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
▪ Bake slides at 56°C for 1 hour.
▪ Deparaffinize in two changes of xylene for 10 minutes
each.
▪ Rehydrate through an ethanol series: 100%, 85%, and
70% ethanol for 3 minutes each.
▪ Rinse slides in distilled water and air dry.
2. Pretreatment:
▪ Immerse slides in pre-warmed pre-treatment solution
(as specified by the probe manufacturer) at 80°C for
30 minutes.
▪ Rinse slides in 2x SSC buffer and air dry.
3. Proteolytic Digestion:
▪ Treat slides with enzyme solution (e.g., pepsin) at
37°C for 10-20 minutes.
▪ Rinse in 2x SSC buffer, dehydrate through an ethanol
series, and air dry.
B. Hybridization:
1. Denaturation:
▪ Apply 10 µL of JAK2 (9P24.1) FISH probe mix to the
target area on the tissue section.
▪ Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
▪ Place the slides in a pre-warmed ThermoBrite or
equivalent instrument for denaturation at 75-80°C for 5
minutes, followed by hybridization at 37°C overnight in
a humidified chamber.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Remove coverslip gently and immerse slides in 2x SSC
buffer at room temperature to remove excess probe.
2. Wash slides in detergent wash buffer at 45°C for 5-10
minutes.
3. Rinse slides briefly in 2x SSC buffer.
4. Dehydrate through an ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%)
and air dry.
D. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to each slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and seal with mounting media.
3. Let the slides dry in the dark for at least 15 minutes.
4. MICROSCOPY AND ANALYSIS
◦ Examine the slides under a fluorescent microscope with
appropriate filter sets for DAPI and the specific fluorophore
used in the JAK2 (9P24.1) FISH probe.
◦ Count at least 100 nuclei per sample.
◦ Document the presence or absence of JAK2 rearrangement
in a minimum of 2 separate areas of the tissue section.
◦ Record the percentage of nuclei exhibiting the abnormal
signal pattern.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative control samples with each batch
of patient samples.
◦ Regularly calibrate the microscope and validate the
performance of FISH probes according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Any deviation from expected control results must be
addressed before patient results are reported.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
and a supervising pathologist.
◦ Report must include the percentage of nuclei with JAK2
rearrangement, the interpretation of findings, and any
relevant clinical notes.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for the JAK2 (9P24.1) FISH
probe.
◦ Relevant clinical and laboratory guidelines for FISH analysis
in hematologic disorders.
◦ Equipment manuals and maintenance logs.

(9P24.1) rearrangements in hematologic disorders using FISH,
facilitating effective diagnosis and patient care.
