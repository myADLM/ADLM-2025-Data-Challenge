Standard Operating Procedure JAK2 Exon 12-15 Sequencing,
Polycythemia Vera Reflex Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide comprehensive guidance on the analysis of JAK2 Exon
12-15 Sequencing for the Polycythemia Vera Reflex test, ensuring
accurate and reliable results. This protocol details the analytical
procedures to be followed after specimen collection and
accessioning.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting the
steps outlined in this SOP, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the
analysis process. It is also their responsibility to report any deviations
or issues encountered during the process to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Peripheral blood sample collected in EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Bone marrow aspirate in EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in non-approved anticoagulants.
• Specimens that are clotted, hemolyzed, or have been improperly
stored.
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit: commercial prep kit designed for use with
blood or bone marrow samples.
• PCR amplification reagents: primers specific for JAK2 Exon
12-15, DNA polymerase, dNTPs.
• Thermal cycler.
• Agarose gel electrophoresis equipment.
• Sequencing reagents: commercial sequencing reagents for
Sanger sequencing.
• Automated DNA sequencer.
• Laboratory grade water.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Pipettes and sterile pipet tips with aerosol barriers.
• Proper personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Begin with an EDTA whole blood or bone marrow specimen.
2. Isolate genomic DNA from the specimen using the commercial
DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Assess the quantity and quality of the extracted DNA using a
Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
4. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR
amplification.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix containing DNA polymerase, specific
primers for JAK2 Exon 12-15, dNTPs, MgCl2, and buffer.
2. Add 2 µL of extracted DNA to 48 µL of PCR master mix.
3. Perform PCR amplification in the thermal cycler using the
following program:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes.
◦ 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Annealing at 55°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.
4. Verify amplification by running 5 µL of PCR product on a 1.5%
agarose gel and visualizing under UV light.
C) Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR product using a commercial PCR purification kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the purified PCR product and prepare sequencing
reactions using the purified product, specific sequencing
primers, and sequencing reagents per the commercial
sequencing kit's instructions.
3. Perform sequencing reaction in the thermal cycler as specified
by the sequencing reagent kit.
4. Purify sequencing reactions using a commercial purification
system.
5. Load purified sequencing reactions onto the automated DNA
sequencer and perform sequencing.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze sequencing data using appropriate sequencing
analysis software.
2. Compare the obtained sequences with reference sequences to
identify mutations or variations in JAK2 Exon 12-15.
3. Document the identified mutations.
4. Perform interpretation as per protocol for Polycythemia Vera
diagnosis.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify results by a designated technologist.
2. Enter verified results into the LIS.
3. Generate and issue a final report as per site-specific guidelines,
incorporating any additional reflex tests if required.
4. Ensure critical or notable findings are communicated to the
appropriate healthcare providers promptly.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls during PCR
amplification to ensure the reliability of the assay.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration checks on
equipment used in the analysis.
3. Incorporate internal quality control samples in sequencing
runs to monitor performance.
4. Review quality control data regularly and take appropriate
corrective actions as needed, documenting issues and
resolutions.
