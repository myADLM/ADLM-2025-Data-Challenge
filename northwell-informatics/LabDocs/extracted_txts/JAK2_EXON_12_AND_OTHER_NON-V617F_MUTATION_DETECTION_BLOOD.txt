Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for JAK2 Exon 12 and Other
Non-V617F Mutation Detection in Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the detection of
JAK2 Exon 12 and other non-V617F mutations in blood samples.
This procedure ensures accurate and reliable results through
standardized testing and documentation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
protocol as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of laboratory
staff to ensure adherence to all procedural steps, quality control
requirements, and proper documentation.
1. DEFINITIONS
JAK2 Exon 12 Mutation: Genetic mutation affecting exon 12 of the
JAK2 gene. Non-V617F Mutation: Genetic mutations in the JAK2
gene excluding V617F. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): A
molecular technique used to amplify DNA. Real-Time PCR: A PCR
technique that allows for the detection of DNA during the
amplification process.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen:
• 5-10 mL peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in heparin, citrate, or serum tubes.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or clots.
• Specimens with incorrect labeling.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• Real-Time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500)
• JAK2 Exon 12 and Other Non-V617F Mutation Detection assay kit
(e.g., ARUP Laboratories kit)
• Primers and probes specific for JAK2 exon 12 and other non-
V617F mutations
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR tubes and plates
• Pipettes and tips
C. Procedure Steps
1. DNA Extraction:
a. Obtain 5-10 mL of peripheral blood collected in EDTA tube. b.
Follow the instructions provided with the DNA extraction kit to
isolate genomic DNA from the blood sample. c. Measure the
concentration and quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer. d. Dilute the DNA sample to the required
concentration for PCR amplification.
2. PCR Amplification:
a. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the assay kit
instructions. Include primers, probes, enzymes, and nuclease-
free water. b. Transfer the prepared master mix into PCR tubes
or plates. c. Add the appropriate amount of extracted DNA to
the PCR tubes or plates. d. Set up the Real-Time PCR
instrument following manufacturer instructions.
3. Real-Time PCR Detection:
a. Load the PCR tubes or plates onto the Real-Time PCR
instrument. b. Configure the cycling parameters based on
manufacturer recommendations (denaturation, annealing, and
extension). c. Monitor the amplification process and validate the
detection of JAK2 exon 12 and non-V617F mutations in real-
time. d. Analyze the results using appropriate software and
identify the presence or absence of mutations.
D. Quality Control & Reporting Results
1. Quality Control:
a. Perform positive and negative controls with each PCR run to
validate the accuracy of the results. b. Ensure proper calibration
and maintenance of the Real-Time PCR instrument. c.
Document all QC steps and review criteria for acceptance.
2. Reporting Results:
a. Confirm the final results using Real-Time PCR output. b.
Generate a report indicating the presence or absence of JAK2
exon 12 and/or other non-V617F mutations in the patient's
genomic DNA. c. Verify results by a senior technologist before
final approval. d. Submit results to LIS (Laboratory Information
System) for integration into patient records.
E. Limitations
• Inadequate sample quality or concentration may affect the PCR
amplification and detection process.
• Potential for contamination; ensure all equipment is regularly
decontaminated and proper lab protocols are followed to avoid
cross-contamination.
