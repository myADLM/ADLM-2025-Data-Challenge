Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for JAK2 EXON 12 AND
OTHER NON-V617F MUTATION DETECTION, BONE MARROW
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the detection of JAK2 exon 12 and
other non-V617F mutations in bone marrow samples to aid in the
diagnosis and management of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the steps outlined in this procedure, ensuring accurate and reliable
results. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure adherence to
this protocol and to address any issues that occur during testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Specimen Type: Bone marrow aspirate
- Collection volume: 1-2 mL
- Transport medium: EDTA anticoagulant (lavender top tube)
- Stability: Specimens should be tested within 48 hours of collection. If delayed, store at 2-8°C for a maximum of 72 hours.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
- DNA extraction kits (validated for use with bone marrow samples)
- PCR reagents and supplies
- Primers specific for JAK2 exon 12 and other non-V617F mutations
- Thermocycler
- Gel electrophoresis apparatus or other suitable DNA visualization method
- Sequencing reagents and equipment or alternative mutation detection method (e.g., high-resolution melt analysis)
- Positive and negative control DNA samples
- Microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and tips (RNase/DNase-free)
- Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction
a. Ensure the bone marrow sample is well-mixed before starting.
b. Extract DNA from the bone marrow aspirate using a validated DNA extraction kit.
c. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or other suitable method.
d. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR.
5.2 PCR Amplification
a. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
b. Add primers specific for JAK2 exon 12 and other non-V617F mutations.
c. Aliquot master mix into individual PCR tubes or plates.
d. Add DNA samples, positive controls, and negative controls to the PCR tubes.
e. Run the PCR in a thermocycler with the following cycling conditions (adjust as needed based on primer specifications):
i. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
ii. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
iii. Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds
iv. Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
v. Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
f. Hold at 4°C until further analysis.
5.3 Detection of PCR Products
a. Prepare an agarose gel for electrophoresis.
b. Load PCR products and appropriate molecular weight markers onto the gel.
c. Run the gel electrophoresis at appropriate voltage (e.g., 100V) until separation is sufficient.
d. Stain the gel with ethidium bromide or other DNA stain.
e. Visualize bands under UV light to confirm successful amplification.
5.4 Sequencing (or Alternative Mutation Detection)
a. Purify successful PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
b. Prepare sequencing reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
c. Run sequencing reactions on a suitable sequencing platform.
d. Analyze sequencing data to identify mutations in JAK2 exon 12 and other regions of interest.
e. For alternative methods like High-Resolution Melt Analysis, follow the specific protocol of the chosen method to detect mutations.
5.5 Interpretation and Reporting
a. Compare results with control samples to validate findings.
b. Confirm presence or absence of JAK2 exon 12 and other non-V617F mutations.
c. Document and interpret the results.
d. Report findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) and communicate results to the ordering physician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
b. Verify the integrity of reagents and equipment before use.
c. Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions taken.
d. Regularly participate in proficiency testing and external quality assessment schemes.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
a. The sensitivity and specificity of the PCR primers and detection method.
b. Potential for contamination; always use good laboratory practices to minimize risk.
c. Mutation detection limited to regions specifically targeted by the primers.
8. REFERENCES

validation of JAK2 mutation testing. Refer to manufacturer’s
instructions for reagents and equipment used.
