1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Label microcentrifuge tubes with appropriate patient
identification.
2. Transfer 200 µL of well-mixed blood specimen to a
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Follow DNA extraction kit instructions to isolate genomic DNA.
4. Measure DNA concentration and purity using Nanodrop or
equivalent spectrophotometer. Record values.
5. Adjust DNA concentration to 10 ng/µL for subsequent PCR
analysis.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, including specific JAK2 V617F primers and probes.
2. Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add 10-50 ng of sample DNA to each tube/plate well.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
5. Seal tubes/plates and load them into the thermal cycler.
6. Run the thermal cycler program with initial denaturation,
amplification cycles, and final extension based on optimized
conditions.
C. Detection:
1. For real-time PCR, analyze the amplification plots for the
presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation.
2. For endpoint PCR, perform gel electrophoresis and visualize
bands under UV light (if applicable).
3. Compare patient samples against positive and negative control
results.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Interpret real-time PCR data using system software.
2. Confirm the presence or absence of the JAK2 V617F mutation.
3. Record all results, including amplification curves and any
observed bands from gel electrophoresis if applicable.
E. Quality Control:
1. Ensure positive and negative controls are consistently yielding
expected results.
2. Perform periodic proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparison.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Verify and validate results by a qualified technologist.
3. Notify the relevant healthcare provider of critical findings.
4. Issue a final report including details of the mutation detection
and any additional remarks.
5. RESULTS VALIDATION AND INTERPRETATION
Reference Intervals:
• Presence of mutation: Positive detection of JAK2 V617F allele.
• Absence of mutation: Negative detection of JAK2 V617F allele.
Method Limitations: Refer to respective vendor's instruction for
detailed limitations related to primers, probes, PCR conditions, and
potential interference.
