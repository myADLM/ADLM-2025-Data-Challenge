Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
JAK2 V617F Mutation Detection in Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
To provide the procedure for the accurate and reliable detection of
the JAK2 V617F mutation in bone marrow specimens, ensuring high-
quality patient care by consistent test results. This procedure outlines
the steps for processing bone marrow samples, extracting DNA,
amplifying the target region, and analyzing the presence of the JAK2
V617F mutation using real-time PCR.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory scientists to
perform the testing in accordance with this SOP and document each
step appropriately. Supervisors are responsible for providing
oversight and ensuring compliance with this protocol.
3. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• JAK2: Janus Kinase 2
• V617F: Valine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 617 of
the JAK2 gene
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
• NTC: No Template Control
• QC: Quality Control
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Bone marrow aspirate collected in EDTA anticoagulant
◦ Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens showing signs of hemolysis
◦ Specimens not properly labeled with patient identification
◦ Specimens not accompanied by a complete requisition form
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocycler for real-time PCR analysis
• DNA extraction kit (validated for bone marrow samples)
• Real-time PCR master mix and JAK2 V617F specific primers/
probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive Control containing known JAK2 V617F mutation DNA
• NTC (nuclease-free water in place of DNA)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• PCR tubes or 96-well plates with adhesive covers
6. PROCEDURE
Step 1: DNA Extraction from Bone Marrow
1. Pre-analytical preparation:
◦ Vortex bone marrow specimen for 30 seconds.
◦ Aliquot approximately 200 µL of bone marrow aspirate for
DNA extraction.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the validated DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Document the DNA concentration and quality using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
◦ Adjust DNA concentration to 20-50 ng/ µL, if necessary.
Step 2: PCR Setup for JAK2 V617F Mutation Detection
1. Reagent preparation:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix as per the manufacturer's
instructions, ensuring to include the JAK2 V617F specific
primers/probes.
◦ Prepare sufficient volume for all test samples, controls
(positive and NTC), and include reactions in triplicate.
2. PCR reaction setup:
◦ In a 96-well plate, add 20 µL of PCR reaction mix to each
well.
◦ Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each well designated for test
samples.
◦ Include 5 µL of positive control DNA in control wells.
◦ Add 5 µL of nuclease-free water in NTC wells.
◦ Seal the plate with an adhesive cover.
3. Real-time PCR conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification (45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Ensure that the data collection is set at the extension step.
Step 3: Data Analysis
1. Threshold setting:
◦ Set the threshold where the fluorescence signal is in the
exponential phase of amplification for all samples.
◦ Acknowledge the Ct values where the amplification signal
exceeds the threshold.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Positive for JAK2 V617F mutation: Ct value detected in all
replicates comparable to the positive control.
◦ Negative for JAK2 V617F mutation: No Ct or Ct value
significantly higher than the positive control (greater than 40
cycles).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive control containing JAK2 V617F mutation must show
amplification in all replicates.
• NTC should not show any amplification.
• Internal controls (if included in the kit) must pass the
manufacturer's criteria for the assay to be considered valid.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Positive Mutation Result: "Detected"
• Negative Mutation Result: "Not Detected"
• Include the statement: “JAK2 V617F mutation testing was
performed using real-time PCR assay.”
9. LIMITATIONS
• Detection is specific to the JAK2 V617F mutation; other mutations
or variations are not assessed by this assay.
• Poor quality or insufficient DNA may lead to inconclusive results.
• Ensure proper specimen handling and processing to prevent
contamination and false results.
