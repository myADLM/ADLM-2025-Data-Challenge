STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for detecting the JAK2 V617F
mutation in clinical specimens using a molecular diagnostic assay.
The JAK2 V617F mutation is commonly associated with several
myeloproliferative disorders, including polycythemia vera, essential
thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. Accurate identification
of this mutation aids in the diagnosis and prognosis of these
conditions.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated staff to
perform the assay following this SOP, ensuring accurate and timely
results. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring adherence to the
protocol and addressing any deviations or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top tube), minimum
volume 5 mL.
• Bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA (lavender top tube),
minimum volume 2 mL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
• Specimens received beyond 48 hours post-collection without
proper storage.
Processing and Storage: Specimens must be maintained at 2-8°C
and processed within 48 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus (if required for DNA visualization)
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• JAK2 V617F mutation detection kit (e.g., AS-PCR or Real-Time
PCR)
• Positive and negative control DNA
• Nuclease-free water
• Ethidium bromide or other DNA gel stain (if gel electrophoresis is
used)
• Agarose gel (if required)
1. GENERAL PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Label each specimen and control tube with the unique identifier.
2. Extract DNA from a 200 µL aliquot of blood or bone marrow
using the DNA extraction kit, following the manufacturer's
protocol.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry, ensuring a minimum concentration of 10 ng/
µL and a purity ratio (A260/A280) of 1.8-2.0.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, including primers specific for the JAK2 V617F
mutation and wild-type JAK2.
2. Add extracted DNA (20-50 ng) to the PCR master mix in each
reaction tube.
3. Include positive and negative controls in the assay to ensure
reliability of results.
4. Perform thermal cycling according to the kit's specifications
(typically denaturation, annealing, and elongation cycles).
C. Detection:
1. For allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR):
◦ Run PCR products on an agarose gel (2%) with ethidium
bromide staining.
◦ Visualize under UV light to identify bands corresponding to
the mutation and wild-type alleles.
2. For Real-Time PCR:
◦ Analyze the amplification curves using the PCR system's
software.
◦ Determine the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation based
on fluorescence thresholds.
D. Interpretation:
1. Compare the specimen results to the controls.
2. Identify the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation based on
detected bands or amplification curves:
◦ Mutation Positive: The amplification curve crosses the
threshold in the mutation-specific channel and/or mutation-
specific band is visualized in gel.
◦ Mutation Negative: No amplification curve above threshold
in the mutation-specific channel and/or no mutation-specific
band visualized.
3. Record all observations appropriately.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure controls run correctly:
◦ Positive control DNA must show mutation presence.
◦ Negative control DNA must show absence of the mutation.
• Document and report any failed controls immediately to the
supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
• Report results in compliance with site-specific guidelines and LIS
(Laboratory Information System) protocols.
• Monitor for critical results, such as unexpected findings or sample
integrity issues, and follow procedures for notification.
