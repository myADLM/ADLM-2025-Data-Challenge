Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for JALAPENO/CHIPOTLE (CAPSICUM
ANNUUM) IGE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing and reporting results for
Jalapeno/Chipotle (Capsicum annuum) IgE tests, ensuring consistent
and accurate results for the detection of specific IgE antibodies.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and reporting Jalapeno/Chipotle (Capsicum annuum) IgE
tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the tests
according to this SOP and are accountable for accurate data entry
and documentation. Supervisors must review and verify test results
as needed.
4. DEFINITION
Jalapeno/Chipotle (Capsicum annuum) IgE test measures specific
IgE antibodies in patients’ blood, indicating an allergic response to
Jalapeno/Chipotle peppers.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
5.1 Specimen Type: Venous blood.
5.2 Collection Container: Serum Separator Tube (SST) or plain red
top tube.
5.3 Volume Required: 1-2 mL of serum.
5.4 Handling:
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
• Centrifuge to separate serum at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer serum to a clean, labeled tube and store at 2-8°C if
testing within 7 days. For longer storage, serum aliquots must be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
6.1 Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP or equivalent)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
6.2 Reagents:
• Jalapeno/Chipotle (Capsicum annuum) IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Diluent
• Wash solution
• Substrate
• Stop solution
6.3 Supplies:
• Pipette tips
• Vials/tubes for aliquoting
• Gloves
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Prepare the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Calibrate the analyzer with provided standards.
7.2 Analysis:
1. Load patient serum samples, controls, and calibrators into the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Ensure correct identification and labeling of each sample.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s procedure for the Jalapeno/Chipotle
IgE assay, including:
◦ Adding reagents
◦ Incubation times
◦ Washing steps
◦ Measurement of optical density (OD) or fluorescence
7.3 Calculation:
• Using the calibration curve, calculate the concentration of
Jalapeno/Chipotle IgE in the patient samples.
• Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 Result Overview:
• Results are expressed in kUA/L (kilo units of allergen-specific IgE
per liter).
• Positive results indicate the presence of specific IgE to Jalapeno/
Chipotle (Capsicum annuum), suggesting sensitivity or allergy.
8.2 Documentation:
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include patient identification details, test date, and results.
• Verify results based on control outcomes.
8.3 Reporting:
• Transmit results to the requesting physician or healthcare
provider.
• Discuss any unexpected or unusual findings with a supervisor
before releasing results.
Reference Intervals:
• <0.35 kUA/L: Negative
• 0.35 - 0.70 kUA/L: Low
• 0.70 - 3.50 kUA/L: Moderate
• 3.50 - 17.50 kUA/L: High
• 17.50 kUA/L: Very High
9. QUALITY CONTROL
9.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure control results are within the specified range before
patient results are reported.
9.2 External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as required by
regulatory agencies.
10. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
10.1 Routine Maintenance:
• Perform regular maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
10.2 Troubleshooting:
• If instrument malfunctions, refer to the troubleshooting guide
provided in the analyzer manual.
• Document any corrective actions taken during the troubleshooting
process.
