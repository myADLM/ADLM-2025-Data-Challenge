Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for JANUS
KINASE 2 (JAK2 V617F) MUTATION ASSAY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standard procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2
V617F) Mutation Assay in the laboratory. This includes the
preparation of reagent, assay set-up, analysis, and result
interpretation. Ensuring accurate and reliable assay results is critical
for the diagnosis and management of myeloproliferative disorders.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring SOP adherence and
addressing any discrepancies or issues.
2. DEFINITION
Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2 V617F) Mutation Assay: A molecular
diagnostic test to detect the presence of the V617F mutation in the
JAK2 gene, which is associated with various myeloproliferative
disorders.
3. PROCEDURE
A. REAGENT AND EQUIPMENT PREPARATION
Required Materials:
• DNA extraction kit
• JAK2 V617F Mutation Detection Kit (including master mix,
primers, probes)
• PCR tubes/plates
• Micropipettes and tips
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• Nuclease-free water
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
B. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from collected whole blood samples using a
DNA extraction kit.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the extraction
process.
◦ Measure the concentration and purity of DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
2. Sample Storage:
◦ Store DNA samples at -20°C until ready for analysis.
C. ASSAY SET-UP
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents (master mix, primers, and probes) to
room temperature and mix thoroughly by vortexing.
◦ Prepare a reaction master mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions provided in the JAK2 V617F
Mutation Detection Kit, including the master mix, primers,
probes, and nuclease-free water.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Label PCR tubes/plates with sample identifiers.
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of reaction master mix into
each PCR tube/well.
◦ Add the DNA sample (including positive and negative
control samples) to the respective tubes/wells.
◦ Ensure final reaction volume is as per the protocol from the
JAK2 V617F Mutation Detection Kit manufacturer (e.g., 25
uL).
3. Loading the Thermocycler:
◦ Place the tubes or plate into the Real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Program the Real-time PCR cycler according to the
amplification protocol specified by the assay kit, which
typically includes initial denaturation, followed by specific
cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension.
D. PCR AMPLIFICATION
• Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial Activation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute (repeat for a total of
40 cycles)
E. RESULT ANALYSIS
1. Data Acquisition:
◦ Upon completion of the PCR cycles, gather the data from
the Real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Use software provided with the instrument for analysis.
2. Data Interpretation:
◦ Analyze amplification plots to determine the presence or
absence of the JAK2 V617F mutation.
◦ Compare the fluorescence threshold cycle (Ct) values of
samples to positive and negative controls.
◦ A lower Ct value indicates the presence of the mutation,
while no amplification (or high Ct value relative to the
negative control) indicates the absence of the mutation.
F. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control:
◦ Confirm that the positive control produces a Ct value within the
expected range.
• Negative Control:
◦ Ensure that the negative control does not show amplification
(confirm absence of contamination).
G. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the findings in the laboratory information system.
• Results for each sample should include:
◦ Interpretation (presence/absence of JAK2 V617F mutation)
◦ Ct values
◦ Quality control adherence
• Verify and review all results before final verification and reporting
by the technologist.
H. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES STORAGE
• Store all kit components, DNA samples, and control samples as
per manufacturer's guidelines.
• Maintain record for the lot numbers and expiry dates of all
reagents and supplies used.
