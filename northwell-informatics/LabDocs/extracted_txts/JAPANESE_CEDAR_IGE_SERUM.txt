Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generating
Results for JAPANESE CEDAR, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of Japanese Cedar-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
levels in serum samples, ensuring accuracy and reliability of
test results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of testing for Japanese Cedar, IgE in
serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure consistent and accurate results. It
is the duty of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance
with this protocol and to address any deviations or issues that
arise during the analytical process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection tubes: SST (Serum Separator Tubes)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for 7 days when refrigerated
at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP System or equivalent for specific IgE testing
• Reagents specific for Japanese Cedar IgE testing, per
manufacturer’s instructions
• Controls: Positive and negative controls specific for Japanese
Cedar IgE
• Calibrators: Provided by the reagent manufacturer
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
2. Allow the serum samples, controls, and calibrators to come to
room temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
3. Mix samples gently by inversion or using a vortex mixer to
ensure homogeneity.
B. Calibration and Control Preparation
1. Prepare calibrators and control solutions according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure that the calibrators and controls are at room
temperature before use.
C. Assay Setup
1. Load the calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples into
the appropriate positions on the analyzer's sample rack.
2. Ensure that each sample is properly identified and matched
with the appropriate barcode or sample ID.
D. Running the Assay
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for setting up and
running the assay on the ImmunoCAP System or equivalent.
2. Set the assay parameters specific for Japanese Cedar IgE as
outlined in the manufacturer’s manual.
3. Load the reagents, samples, controls, and calibrators as per the
analyzer’s requirements.
4. Start the assay run and monitor the analyzer to ensure proper
functioning throughout the testing process.
E. Result Interpretation
1. Upon completion of the assay, verify that the analyzer has
processed all samples correctly.
2. Review the calibration curve and control values to ensure they
fall within acceptable ranges. If controls are out of range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay if necessary.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control at the beginning of each assay run using
positive and negative controls.
• Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
• Ensure that all control results are within the manufacturer’s
specified ranges before reporting patient results.
• Retain records of calibrators, controls, and any corrective actions
taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results for Japanese Cedar IgE will be automatically transmitted
to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and review all results in the LIS before releasing them to
ensure accuracy and completeness.
• Report any flagged or critical values following the laboratory’s
standard reporting protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for any specific limitations
of the Japanese Cedar IgE assay.
• Any potential interfering substances or conditions that may affect
the accuracy of results should be monitored and addressed.

1. DOCUMENTATION
• Keep records of all testing, including sample IDs, control results,
calibration data, and any issues encountered during the assay.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and the corrective actions
taken.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure that the
analysis of Japanese Cedar IgE in serum samples is performed
accurately and reliably, providing valuable information for patient
diagnosis and care.
