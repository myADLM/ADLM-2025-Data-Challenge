Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for JC Polyoma Virus DNA,
Quantitative Real-Time PCR, Plasma
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the step-by-step procedures for performing a
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the detection and
quantification of JC Polyoma Virus DNA from plasma samples. The
accurate detection and quantification of JC Polyoma Virus DNA are
critical for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients, particularly those
who are immunocompromised.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained
and authorized to perform JC Polyoma Virus DNA qPCR analysis
within the laboratory.
3. Responsibility
• The laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
procedures accurately and for maintaining the quality and integrity
of the testing process.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring proper training of the
laboratory technologists and for addressing any issues related to
the performance of the assays.
4. Reagents and Materials
• qPCR Master Mix (select one specific to your lab, e.g., TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix)
• JC Polyoma Virus-specific primer and probe set
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control samples
• Plasma samples (previously collected, received, and
accessioned)
• PCR-grade tubes and plates
• Compatible qPCR instrument (e.g., Bio-Rad CFX96, Applied
Biosystems 7500)
5. Equipment
• qPCR instrument
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes (0.1-10µL, 10-100µL, 100-1000µL) and corresponding
tips
• Sample storage freezer (-20°C)
6. Safety Requirements
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including proper waste
disposal and spill cleanup procedures.
7. Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice.
◦ Mix the reagents by gentle vortexing and briefly centrifuge to
collect all liquid at the bottom of the tubes.
2. Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Prepare the qPCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., per reaction: x µL of qPCR
Master Mix, y µL of primer/probe mix, z µL of nuclease-free
water).
B. Sample Preparation
1. Plasma Sample Handling:
◦ Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
◦ Vortex briefly and centrifuge at 1500xg for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
◦ Aliquot samples into labeled PCR-grade tubes.
C. PCR Setup
1. Plate Setup:
◦ In a PCR clean area, aliquot the master mix into the
designated wells of the PCR plate.
◦ Add x µL of the plasma DNA sample to the corresponding
wells.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive film and briefly centrifuge to
remove air bubbles and settle the reagents.
D. PCR Cycling Conditions
1. Setup Cycler Program:
◦ Configure the qPCR instrument with the appropriate cycling
parameters:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
▪ Number of cycles: 40
E. Analysis
1. Run the Plate:
◦ Place the plate in the qPCR instrument and start the run.
◦ Monitor the run for any errors and ensure the instrument is
functioning properly.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the data using the qPCR instrument’s software.
◦ Determine the threshold cycle (Ct) values for each sample.
◦ Quantify the JC Polyoma Virus DNA using a standard curve
generated from the positive control samples.
8. Quality Control
1. Include appropriate controls (positive and negative) in each run
to monitor assay performance.
2. If control results fall outside the defined acceptable ranges,
identify and resolve issues before repeating the assay.
3. Record all data in the appropriate laboratory logbooks and
ensure proper documentation of any deviations or corrective
actions.
9. Reporting Results
1. Review all qPCR data to confirm the accuracy of Ct values and
virus quantification.
2. Report the results according to laboratory protocol, ensuring all
relevant patient information and assay details are included.
3. Discuss any critical or unexpected results with a supervisor or
relevant clinical personnel.
