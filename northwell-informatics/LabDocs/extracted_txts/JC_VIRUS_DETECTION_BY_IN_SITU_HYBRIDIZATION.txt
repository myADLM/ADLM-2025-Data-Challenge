Protocol for JC Virus Detection by In Situ Hybridization
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure to detect JC Virus (JCV) in
tissue specimens using the in situ hybridization (ISH) technique. This
method allows for the localization of viral DNA within tissue sections,
which can aid in the diagnosis of PML (Progressive Multifocal
Leukoencephalopathy) and other JC Virus-related conditions.
2. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel trained in in situ
hybridization techniques and responsible for processing and
analyzing tissue specimens for JC Virus detection.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the in
situ hybridization procedure and ensuring results' accuracy.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying the completion and
accuracy of the detection procedure and interpreting the results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Unstained slides cut from FFPE blocks (recommended section
thickness: 4-5 microns).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Non-formalin fixed tissue.
• Specimens that are inadequately fixed (e.g., under-fixed or over-
fixed) or have not been processed correctly.
• Specimens with sections thicker than 5 microns.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Hybridization buffer
• JC Virus-specific DNA probe labeled with a suitable reporter
molecule (e.g., DIG or biotin)
• Detection system compatible with the reporter molecule (e.g.,
anti-DIG antibody for DIG-labeled probes)
• Blocking solution
• Wash buffers (e.g., SSC buffer)
• Counterstaining reagents (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Glass slides and coverslips
6. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Incubator (with humidity control)
• Hybridization oven
• Water bath
• Light microscope
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Tissue Section Preparation:
1. Cut tissue sections (4-5 microns thick) from the FFPE blocks
using a microtome.
2. Place the sections on positively charged slides and air dry
overnight at room temperature.
7.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the sections by immersing them in xylene for 5
minutes, repeat twice.
2. Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%, and distilled water) for 5 minutes each.
7.3 Pre-Treatment:
1. If required, perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate buffer
(e.g., citrate buffer) at 95°C for 20 minutes.
2. Allow sections to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7.4 Hybridization:
1. Pre-treat the tissues with a pre-hybridization buffer (e.g., saline
sodium citrate (SSC) buffer).
2. Apply the JC Virus-specific DNA probe to the tissue sections
(approx. 20 µL per section).
3. Cover the sections with coverslips and seal the edges with
rubber cement.
4. Incubate the slides in a hybridization oven at 42°C overnight
(12-16 hours).
7.5 Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Remove coverslips carefully and wash the slides in SSC buffer
(2x SSC at room temperature) for 5 minutes.
2. Perform stringent washes in pre-warmed SSC buffer (0.5x SSC
at 55°C) for 15 minutes.
7.6 Detection:
1. Block the sections with a blocking solution for 30 minutes to
prevent non-specific binding.
2. Apply the detection reagent (e.g., anti-DIG antibody for DIG-
labeled probes) and incubate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Wash the sections thoroughly with wash buffer to remove
unbound antibody.
7.7 Visualization:
1. Apply the appropriate substrate-chromogen solution to the
sections and incubate until the desired signal intensity is
achieved.
2. Counterstain the sections lightly with hematoxylin for contrast.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series and clear in xylene.
4. Mount the sections with a permanent mounting medium and
coverslips.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative tissue controls in each run to
ensure assay performance.
• Monitor the hybridization and detection steps to ensure no signal
is present in negative controls and appropriate signal intensity in
positive controls.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Examine the slides under a light microscope.
• A positive result is indicated by a specific hybridization signal
localized to the nuclei of infected cells.
• Record and report the findings to the appropriate clinician or
department.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a logbook of all processed specimens, including control
results, reagent lot numbers, and incubation times.
• Document any deviations from the standard procedure, including
troubleshooting steps taken and their outcomes.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all institutional safety guidelines for handling biohazardous
materials.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coats, and safety glasses.
