Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for JC Virus (JCV) PCR
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for JC Virus (JCV) PCR testing, ensuring
accurate and timely identification of JCV DNA in clinical specimens.
This SOP covers all steps from specimen preparation to result
reporting.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory staff must follow this procedure.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance and quality
assurance.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Plasma
• Whole blood
• Urine
2.2 Collection and Handling:
• Specimens collected should be well-labeled with identifier, date,
and time of collection.
• CSF samples must be collected in sterile tubes.
• Blood samples should be collected in EDTA tubes.
• Urine specimens should be collected in sterile containers.
• Transport specimens to the laboratory immediately. If there is a
delay, store CSF and plasma at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours. Store
whole blood and urine at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For longer
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, unlabeled, or improperly labeled specimens.
• Specimens subjected to improper storage conditions leading to
degradation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Heat block/Incubator
• Biosafety cabinet
3.2 Reagents:
• JCV-specific PCR Master Mix
• JCV Primers and Probes
• Nuclease-Free Water
• Positive and Negative Controls
• DNA extraction kit
3.3 Supplies:
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes/plates
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Wear PPE to prevent contamination.
• Clean the workstation with a suitable disinfectant.
• Confirm specimens are appropriately labeled and store them
correctly until processed.
4.2 DNA Extraction:
• Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol for isolating nucleic acid
from the specimen.
• Label all extracted DNA samples correctly.
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not analyzed immediately.
4.3 PCR Setup:
• Thaw all reagents on ice and vials gently.
• Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• In labeled PCR tubes, add the following components: • 5 µL
extracted DNA • 15 µL PCR Master Mix containing JCV primers
and probes • 5 µL Positive Control • 5 µL Negative Control • Make
up the volume to 25 µL with Nuclease-Free Water if required.
4.4 PCR Amplification:
• Place the PCR tubes in the thermocycler.
• Set up the thermocycler with the following cycling conditions: •
Initial denaturation: 94°C for 3 minutes • Denaturation: 94°C for 30
seconds • Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute • Repeat for 40
cycles • Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes • Hold at 4°C
• Run the PCR.
4.5 Analysis:
• Once the PCR run is complete, remove tubes from the
thermocycler.
• Analyze the PCR product using gel electrophoresis or a real-time
PCR detection system.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
5.1 Interpretation:
• Compare the amplified products to the positive and negative
controls.
• A positive control should show a specific band or fluorescence
signal.
• A negative control should show no band or signal.
5.2 Follow the lab-specific guidelines to interpret:
• Positive: Presence of JCV DNA
• Negative: Absence of JCV DNA
• Invalid: Control failure, necessitate rerunning the test.
5.3 Documentation:
• Record all test results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before reporting.
• Notify the attending physician or appropriate personnel of critical
positive results promptly.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs.
• Document all quality control and maintenance activities.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the DNA extraction kit and JCV
PCR reagents.
• Laboratory quality control manual.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and clinical guidelines on JCV
testing.
This standard operating procedure ensures the analytical phase of
JCV PCR testing is performed consistently, reliably, and accurately.
All staff must adhere to these guidelines to ensure quality and safety
in the laboratory.
