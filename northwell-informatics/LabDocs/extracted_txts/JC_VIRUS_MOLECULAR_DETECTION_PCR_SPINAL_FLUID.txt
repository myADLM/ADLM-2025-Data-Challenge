1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of JC Virus
DNA in spinal fluid specimens using PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction) methodology in order to ensure accurate and reliable test
results that may aid in the diagnosis of JC Virus infections such as
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that all steps in the procedure are carried out accurately and
efficiently in accordance with this SOP.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel working in the molecular
diagnostics laboratory and encompasses all processes from
specimen preparation to result reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Spinal fluid (CSF) collected in a sterile container.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of spinal fluid.
• Storage: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C if testing will be
performed within 48 hours of collection. For longer storage,
specimens should be frozen at -70°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed,
contain insufficient volume, or are not properly labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA Extraction Kit
• JC Virus specific primers and probes
• PCR Master Mix (including Taq DNA Polymerase, dNTPs, and
other required components)
• Nuclease-free water
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and aerosol-resistant tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Molecular grade ethanol and other necessary buffers/reagents
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation and DNA Extraction
1. Review Specimens:
◦ Verify that all specimens are acceptable based on the
requirements specified.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Use the designated DNA Extraction Kit.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for extracting DNA from
200μL of CSF.
◦ Elute the extracted DNA in 50μL of nuclease-free water.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not proceeding immediately
with PCR.
B. PCR Setup
1. Preparation of PCR Master Mix:
◦ Prepare a PCR master mix according to the following
components per reaction:
▪ 12.5 μL of PCR Master Mix
▪ 0.5 μL of JC Virus forward primer (10 μM)
▪ 0.5 μL of JC Virus reverse primer (10 μM)
▪ 0.5 μL of JC Virus probe (10 μM)
▪ 2.0 μL of extracted DNA
▪ 9.0 μL of nuclease-free water
◦ Scale up the preparation proportionally according to the
number of samples and controls.
2. Aliquot and Loading:
◦ Aliquot 25μL of the master mix into each PCR tube or plate
well.
◦ Add 2.0 μL of each extracted DNA sample to the appropriate
tube/well.
◦ Include no-template control (NTC) and positive control in
each PCR run.
C. Thermal Cycling Conditions
• Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Repeat the denaturation and annealing/extension steps for 40
cycles.
D. Post-PCR Analysis
1. Detection:
◦ Analyze the amplification data using the thermal cycler’s
software.
◦ Check for the presence of specific JC Virus amplification
curves and compare them against control reactions.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Positive Result: JC Virus DNA detected. Clear exponential
amplification in the sample well with a corresponding CT
value within the expected range of the positive control.
◦ Negative Result: JC Virus DNA not detected. No significant
amplification curve observed.
◦ Invalid Result: Equivocal or failed controls. Re-extract and
re-test if necessary.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative controls and positive controls in each PCR run.
• Record the control results and verify that they fall within
acceptable ranges.
• If a control fails, invalidate and repeat the run.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the PCR results into the LIS for subsequent review and
verification.
• Positive Result: Report as "JC Virus DNA Detected."
• Negative Result: Report as "JC Virus DNA Not Detected."
• Invalid Result: Repeat testing required before reporting.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False-negative results may occur due to sample degradation,
presence of inhibitors, or low viral load.
• False-positive results may occur due to contamination; adhere to
strict PCR workflow protocols to prevent contamination.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the DNA Extraction Kit.
• Manufacturer's instructions for the PCR reagents and thermal
cycler.
• Relevant published literature and guidelines for JC Virus detection
by PCR.
10. DOCUMENTATION
All steps taken, controls used, and results obtained should be
documented in the laboratory records as specified in the Laboratory’s
documentation policy.
• Temperature Logs for storage equipment must be maintained.
• QC Logs must be updated and reviewed regularly.
• Report all discrepancies and corrective actions to the designated
supervisor.
