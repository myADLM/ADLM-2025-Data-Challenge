Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for JO-1 Antibody, IgG
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for JO-1 antibody, IgG, which is used for the diagnosis and
management of patients with polymyositis and other autoimmune
myopathies.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
testing, ensuring accuracy, and verifying results of the JO-1
antibody, IgG test.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and validating the test
results.
2. DEFINITION
JO-1 antibody, IgG, is an autoantibody targeted against histidyl-tRNA
synthetase, commonly associated with idiopathic inflammatory
myopathies, particularly polymyositis.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment and Reagents:
• Equipment:
◦ ELISA plate reader
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Incubation equipment (e.g., water bath, incubator)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Calibrated timer
• Reagents:
◦ JO-1 antibody ELISA kit (includes coated microtiter plates,
calibrators, controls, wash buffer, sample diluent, substrate,
stop solution)
◦ Deionized or distilled water
B) Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum-separator tube
(SST)
◦ Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
◦ Store at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours; for longer storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens stored at 2-8°C for longer than 48 hours without
freezing
• Samples with visible contamination
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature.
◦ Dilute wash buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and functioning
properly.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Dilute the patient serum samples (e.g., 1:100 dilution) using
the provided sample diluent.
◦ Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
diluted patient samples into the designated wells of the
microtiter plate.
◦ Run standards and controls in duplicate.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate as per the manufacturer's instructions
(e.g., 60 minutes at 37°C).
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the microtiter plate multiple times with the diluted
wash buffer using the microplate washer. Ensure complete
removal of any unbound components.
6. Adding Detection Reagents:
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate as specified by the kit instructions (e.g., 30 minutes
at room temperature).
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark based on the manufacturer’s guidelines (e.g., 15
minutes at room temperature).
8. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well in the same sequence as
the substrate.
9. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength (e.g.,
450 nm) using the ELISA plate reader.
◦ Record all readings in the laboratory information system.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculation:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the absorbance readings of
the standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of JO-1 antibody, IgG, in patient
samples based on the standard curve.
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Negative: <20 U/mL
◦ Indeterminate: 20-25 U/mL
◦ Positive: >25 U/mL
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• Document and verify the QC results before reporting patient
results.
• If controls are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot the assay
and repeat testing.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• All results must be reviewed and validated by a technologist
before release.
• Provide clear comments if results fall into the indeterminate range
or if there are issues with sample quality.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results are obtained, verify the following:
◦ Correct preparation and handling of reagents.
◦ Proper performance of incubation and washing steps.
◦ Calibration and functioning of the ELISA reader.
• Repeat testing if necessary and inform supervisor of any
persistent issues.
8. REFERENCES
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided with the JO-1
antibody, IgG ELISA kit.
• Current literature and guidelines on autoimmune myopathies and
serological testing.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for JO-1 antibody, IgG testing which
are critical for patient care and management.
