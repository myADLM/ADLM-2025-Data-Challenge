Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for JOHNSON GRASS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To provide standardized instructions for the accurate and precise
measurement of serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels specific to
Johnson Grass allergen using appropriate laboratory techniques.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the analysis of serum samples for Johnson Grass specific
IgE.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to ensure
that this procedure is followed accurately and completely.
Supervisors must ensure that laboratory personnel are competent
and adhere to this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS:
Johnson Grass, IgE, Serum: A laboratory test that measures the
concentration of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to Johnson Grass
allergen in the serum.
5. PROCEDURE:
Equipment and Supplies:
• Thermo Scientific™ Phadia™ 250 Immunoassay Analyzer or
equivalent
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Serum tubes (red-top or serum separator)
• Johnson Grass specific IgE reagent kit
• Quality control material (negative and positive controls)
• Lab timer or stopwatch
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
• Biohazard waste disposal containers
Reagent Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents are stored at the temperature indicated
by the manufacturer.
2. Bring all reagents to room temperature (18-25°C) before use.
Mix gently by inverting.
Specimen Requirements:
1. Collect blood in red-top or serum separator tubes.
2. Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge the tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain clear
serum.
4. Ensure that the serum is free from hemolysis, lipemia, or
microbial contamination.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer and pipettes as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Run quality control samples (negative and positive) prior to
patient sample analysis.
3. Document the results of quality control testing. Ensure control
results are within acceptable ranges. If controls do not meet
criteria, troubleshoot per manufacturer instructions, and do not
proceed with patient samples until resolved.
Sample Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Label all sample tubes with unique
patient identifiers. b. Dilute the serum samples if required by
test instructions.
2. Loading Samples: a. Load calibrators, quality control
materials, and patient sera onto the Phadia 250 instrument,
carefully following the sequence indicated by the protocol. b.
Begin the analysis run as per the instrument's operating
manual.
3. Running the Assay: a. Start the assay. Follow the prompts on
the analyzer to run the assay. b. Allow the analyzer to read the
samples and display results.
4. Recording Results: a. Once the analysis is complete, review
the generated results for each sample. b. Verify that the results
of quality control samples fall within the acceptable limits. c.
Results with flags or errors should be re-analyzed or
discrepancies investigated following troubleshooting guidance.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify each result in the LIS. Ensure all critical results follow
verification protocols as defined by the lab policy.
3. Release the results to the physician/healthcare provider. Any
critical values must be communicated immediately and
documented appropriately.
Post-Test:
1. Dispose of all used materials in accordance with the biohazard
waste disposal protocols.
2. Clean and maintain the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions to ensure optimal performance.
3. Document all maintenance and troubleshooting activities
performed on the analyzer.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
1. Ensure all analytical procedures comply with quality assurance
and CLIA guidelines.
2. Maintain a log of all calibration, quality control, and
maintenance activities.
3. Review and evaluate quality control data regularly to identify
and address any trends or issues.
