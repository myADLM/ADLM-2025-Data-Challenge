Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
JOINT INFECTION PANEL, PCR, SYNOVIAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of pathogens
causing joint infections using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
technology on synovial fluid samples. This SOP ensures accurate
and timely reporting of results to aid in the diagnosis and
management of joint infections.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing PCR-based
joint infection panel testing on synovial fluid samples within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for performing the PCR
assay according to the protocol and ensuring quality control.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to this SOP, address any issues,
and validate the results for reporting.
• Clinical Pathologists: Interpret and confirm results, providing
insights and recommendations based on the reported data.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Synovial fluid collected in a sterile
container with a minimum volume of 1 mL.
• Storage and Transport: Specimens must be stored and
transported at 2-8°C and tested within 24 hours of collection. If
extended storage is needed, samples should be aliquoted and
frozen at -70°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal Cycler
• PCR reagents and primers specific for joint infection pathogens
• DNA extraction kit
• Sterile pipettes, tips, and microcentrifuge tubes
• Positive and negative control samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Clean work area and equipment with 70% ethanol or
another suitable disinfectant.
2. Extraction:
◦ Vortex the synovial fluid sample thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot 200 µL of synovial fluid into a sterile microcentrifuge
tube.
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit instructions to isolate DNA.
Ensure to include negative and positive controls.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA (A260/
A280 ratio).
B. PCR Setup
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Aliquot 22.5 µL of the master mix into each PCR tube or well
of a PCR plate.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 2.5 µL of extracted DNA to the appropriate PCR tubes
or wells.
◦ Include negative (no template control) and positive controls
in each PCR run.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Load the PCR tubes or plate into the thermal cycler.
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the appropriate cycling
conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C (temperature specific to primer
set) for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Post-PCR Analysis:
◦ Run PCR products on an agarose gel for electrophoresis
(optional).
◦ Alternatively, use real-time PCR software to analyze and
interpret results.
C. Quality Control
• Ensure each run includes positive and negative controls.
Document any deviations.
• Use proficiency testing samples periodically to ensure accuracy.
• Record all observations, reagent lot numbers, and any
troubleshooting steps taken.
D. Interpretation of Results
• Positive results: Presence of expected PCR product size for
specific pathogens.
• Negative results: Absence of amplification or only primer-dimer
formation.
• In the case of inconclusive or unexpected results, repeat the
extraction and PCR process or troubleshoot as required.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the supervising
technologist.
• Report results to the appropriate clinician or enter into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include the following in the report: detected pathogens, quality
control outcomes, and any relevant clinical information.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Not applicable for pathogen detection. Report presence or
absence of each pathogen.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• PCR-based detection is highly sensitive to contamination;
meticulous technique must be used.
• False positives can occur due to contamination; repeat testing
may be necessary.
• PCR inhibitors present in synovial fluid may affect the assay
performance. Ensure thorough sample preparation.
