Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of JO 1
ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of JO 1 Antibodies, IgG in serum. This includes preparation, assay
setup, operation of equipment, and reporting of results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to ensure that the procedures are followed accurately and to
document and report any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
1. DEFINITION
JO 1 Antibodies, IgG are antibodies associated with certain
autoimmune diseases, particularly polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
The presence of these antibodies in serum is determined through
specific immunoassays.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• Microplates (specific for JO 1 Antibodies)
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagent kits (specific for detecting JO 1 Antibodies, IgG in serum)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Distilled water
• Absorbent paper
• Tube racks
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum, at least 1 mL, collected in SST
(Serum Separator Tube).
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 72 hours when
stored at 2-8°C. For long-term storage beyond 72 hours,
specimens should be aliquoted and stored at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
may interfere with the assay and should be rejected.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the ELISA reader and washer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Label microplates and arrange tubes in racks.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum samples
to the designated wells on the microplate.
2. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Wash the microplate 5 times with wash buffer using an ELISA
washer.
C. Detection:
1. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugate to each well and incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
2. Wash the microplate 5 times with wash buffer.
3. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 10 minutes in the dark.
4. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the enzymatic
reaction.
D. Reading and Interpretation:
1. Read the microplate at a wavelength of 450 nm using the
ELISA reader.
2. Calculate the results using the calibration curve generated from
the standards.
3. Record the quantitative result for JO 1 Antibodies, IgG in IU/mL
(International Units per milliliter).
E. Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality controls with each batch of samples
analyzed.
2. Ensure that the control values fall within the established
acceptable range.
3. If controls do not fall within the acceptable range, identify and
resolve the issue before proceeding with the sample analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report results in IU/mL.
• Reference interval for JO 1 Antibodies, IgG: < 20 IU/mL
(Negative), 20-40 IU/mL (Borderline), > 40 IU/mL (Positive).
• Document and report any critical values immediately to the
requesting physician or clinician.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the assay fails to meet performance specifications, including
control results out of acceptable range, perform the necessary
troubleshooting steps according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Repeat the assay if necessary and document any deviations or
corrective actions taken.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Original SOP implemented on [insert date].
• Revised on [insert date] to include updated reference intervals.
This SOP is intended to ensure the validity and reliability of the JO 1
Antibodies, IgG serum testing and to provide clear guidelines for
laboratory staff to follow during the analytical phase of testing.
