Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for JUNE GRASS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of testing
for JUNE GRASS, IGE, SERUM, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and validating serum IgE analysis specific to JUNE
GRASS. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
laboratory staff adhere to this procedure and that any issues are
promptly resolved.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Use a serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled vial.
• Serum samples are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at
-20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes
• Specimens with prolonged transport times exceeding stability
limits
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if necessary)
• Immunoassay Analyzer
Supplies:
• Serum separator collection tubes (SST)
• Clean, labeled transfer vials
• Pipettes and tips
• Appropriate Immunoassay kit for JUNE GRASS specific IgE (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP, Hycor, etc.)
1. REAGENTS AND CONTROLS
Reagents:
• Use the specific Immunoassay kit for JUNE GRASS specific IgE,
following the manufacturer's instructions
Controls:
• Utilize two levels of controls (e.g., negative and positive) for
quality assurance.
• Store controls as per manufacturer instructions and ensure they
are within the expiry date.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Equipment Preparation
• Ensure the Immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and ready to use.
• Perform instrument maintenance as required.
5.2 Sample Preparation
• Ensure all samples and reagents reach room temperature before
use.
• Label all sample vials appropriately.
• If frozen, thaw serum samples at room temperature and mix
gently.
5.3 Assay Procedure
• Follow the specific instructions provided by the Immunoassay kit
manufacturer for the testing procedure.
1. Load samples, controls, and calibrators as per kit
instructions.
2. Add reagents to the wells as specified.
3. Incubate, wash, and process according to the kit protocol.
4. Measure absorbance or fluorescence using the
Immunoassay analyzer.
5.4 Result Evaluation
• Analyze the data collected from the immunoassay analyzer.
• Ensure that control results fall within acceptable ranges.
• Interpret patient results based on the standards provided by the
Immunoassay kit.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify the accuracy of data entry.
• Report results according to laboratory-specific guidelines. Refer
any critical or abnormal results immediately to the laboratory
supervisor for validation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality controls with each batch of tests or as specified by the
Immunoassay kit.
• Document all quality control results in the laboratory QC log.
• Investigate and address any out-of-range QC results following
laboratory policies.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the Immunoassay kit for specific reference intervals for
JUNE GRASS, IGE, SERUM. Record the appropriate reference
intervals within the laboratory information system.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Immunoassay kit insert for specific limitations regarding
sample conditions and potential assay interferences.
