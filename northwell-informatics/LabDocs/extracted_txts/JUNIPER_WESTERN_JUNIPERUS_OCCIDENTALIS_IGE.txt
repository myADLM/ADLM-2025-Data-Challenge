Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Generation of Results for
JUNIPER WESTERN (JUNIPERUS OCCIDENTALIS) IGE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for JUNIPER WESTERN (JUNIPERUS
OCCIDENTALIS) Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in patient specimens. This
protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and consistent measurement of
specific IgE levels related to the allergen Juniperus Occidentalis.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis in accordance with this procedure. All laboratory staff must
ensure accurate and precise documentation of test results.
2. DEFINITION
Juniperus Occidentalis IgE is an antibody produced by individuals
with an allergic reaction to the Juniperus Occidentalis allergen.
Detection and measurement of IgE levels help diagnose allergic
conditions.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250, Immulite 2000)
• Calibrators and Control (Allergens from the manufacturer)
• IgE Test Kits specific for Juniperus Occidentalis
• Micropipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Laboratory timer
• Record logs and appropriate result reporting system
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
3.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform instrument calibration using the allergen-specific
calibrators provided with the IgE test kits.
• Run positive and negative controls provided by the kit to ensure
the assay's accuracy. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for
control preparation and storage.
• Record calibration and quality control results in the designated
logbook.
• If controls are out of acceptable range, troubleshoot according to
the kit's instructions before proceeding with patient samples.
3.3 Sample Preparation and Handling:
• Acceptable Specimens: Serum collected in SST (serum separator
tubes) or plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples with gross hemolysis,
lipemia, or inadequate volume.
• Centrifuge and separate serum or plasma within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store samples at 2-8°C if analyzing within 48 hours, otherwise
freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
3.4 Analytical Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature.
◦ Prepare the immunoassay analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Vortex samples gently before loading onto the analyzer.
◦ Load calibrators, controls, and patient samples into the
designated wells on the analyzer.
◦ Ensure sample placement corresponds to the analyzer's
sample run order.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the appropriate test for Juniperus Occidentalis IgE on
the analyzer.
◦ Initiate test run as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow the analyzer to perform the assay and generate initial
results.
4. Assay Completion and Review:
◦ Upon completion, review the results and control data.
◦ Ensure all controls meet manufacturer acceptance criteria.
◦ If control results are not within the acceptable range, repeat
the assay.
3.5 Result Validation and Interpretation:
• Validate qualitative and quantitative results according to the
analyzer output and within the established laboratory reference
ranges.
• Reference Range for IgE: 0-0.1 kUA/L (negative), 0.1-0.35 kUA/L
(equivocal), >0.35 kUA/L (positive) - Note: reference ranges may
vary depending on kit used.
• If the result falls outside the measurable limits, report the highest
or lowest value with a comment, such as "above assay range," or
"below assay range."
3.6 Reporting Results:
• Enter validated results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Notify clinicians of critical or significant results promptly following
laboratory policies.
• Record result in the patient's file with appropriate documentation.
3.7 Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
• Document all quality control results.
• Replace reagents and maintenance of equipment as needed per
manufacturer’s schedule.
• Address and troubleshoot any equipment errors or discrepancies
according to the analyzer’s manual and seek assistance if
necessary.
4. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow biosafety guidelines for handling human specimens and
potentially infectious materials.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste, including used test kits and
contaminated materials, in accordance with institutional and
governmental regulations.
5. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs for calibration, quality control, sample identification,
and results.
• Ensure all records are up-to-date and reviewed regularly for
compliance and quality assurance purposes.
