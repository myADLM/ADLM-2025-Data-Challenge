Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of KAPPA
AND LAMBDA LIGHT CHAIN MRNA, IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION
(ISH) TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for KAPPA AND LAMBDA LIGHT CHAIN MRNA
using In Situ Hybridization (ISH) in the laboratory. This SOP ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for clinical diagnosis.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing all procedures
outlined in this SOP and documenting results accurately. Supervisors
and staff must ensure adherence to the procedures, including
identification and resolution of any deficiencies that may affect the
quality and accuracy of test results.
1. DEFINITION
In Situ Hybridization (ISH) is a technique used to detect specific
nucleic acid sequences within fixed tissues and cells, allowing for
localization and visualization of KAPPA and LAMBDA light chain
mRNA within specimens.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Unfixed fresh tissue may be snap-frozen and cryosectioned for
ISH analysis
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microscope
• Bench-top microtome
• Thermal cycler
• Hybridization chamber
• Automated stainer (optional)
• KAPPA and LAMBDA light chain mRNA probes
• ISH detection kit, including labeled probes, hybridization buffer,
washing buffer, and counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Glass slides
• Positive and negative control slides
• Disposal containers for biohazard waste
Procedure: A) Pre-Hybridization:
1. Prepare FFPE tissue sections (4-6 µm thickness) and place on
glass slides.
◦ Ensure sections are free from folds and bubbles.
2. Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in xylene twice for 5
minutes each.
3. Hydrate slides through a series of graded alcohol solutions
(100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) and finally distilled water for 2 minutes
each.
4. Perform antigen retrieval using appropriate buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer, pH 6.0) in a heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER)
method in a thermal cycler or water bath at 95°C for 20
minutes.
5. Cool slides to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
B) Hybridization:
1. Pre-warm hybridization buffer to 37°C.
2. Apply 100 µL of hybridization buffer containing KAPPA and
LAMBDA light chain mRNA probes to each tissue section.
3. Cover with coverslips and place slides in the hybridization
chamber.
4. Incubate overnight at 55°C.
C) Post-Hybridization:
1. Remove coverslips carefully to avoid tissue damage.
2. Wash slides in pre-warmed washing buffer (three times for 5
minutes each) to remove unbound probes.
3. Apply ISH detection reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
D) Counterstain and Mounting:
1. Counterstain tissue sections with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to
1 minute.
2. Rinse in distilled water and blue in ammonia or alkaline water.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohol solutions (70%, 80%,
95%, 100%).
4. Clear slides in xylene and apply mounting medium.
5. Cover with coverslips and allow to dry completely.
E) Microscopic Analysis:
1. Examine each slide under a microscope to assess hybridization
signals.
2. Positive signals will appear as distinct staining of KAPPA and
LAMBDA light chain mRNA within specific cellular
compartments.
3. Document the results with images if needed.
Quality Control:
1. Perform ISH on positive and negative control slides
concurrently with patient samples.
2. Ensure that hybridization and detection steps produce expected
results on control slides.
3. Record observations and repeat assays if control slide results
are not as expected.
Reporting Results:
1. Generate and document results based on the presence or
absence of hybridization signals.
2. Verify and confirm the findings with a peer or supervisor.
3. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
