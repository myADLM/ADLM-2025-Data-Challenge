KELCH-LIKE PROTEIN 11 ANTIBODY, CELL BINDING ASSAY,
SERUM SOP
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the procedure for performing
the cell binding assay to detect KELCH-LIKE PROTEIN 11
antibodies in serum samples. The aim is to ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP and ensure adherence to established
procedures. Supervisors must ensure that all procedures, including
quality control measures, are properly documented and any
deviations from the protocol are addressed promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Preferred collection: 5 mL blood sample collected in a serum
separator tube (SST)
• Stability:
◦ At room temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): Stable for up to 6 months
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens with insufficient volume (< 200 µL serum)
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents, equipment, and instruments are calibrated
as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Verify that the assay-specific reagents are within their expiry
date.
B) Assay Setup
1. Thaw serum samples if stored frozen. Mix thoroughly and allow
them to come to room temperature prior to assay setup.
2. Prepare working solutions according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, including any required dilutions.
C) Incubation
1. Label assay wells or plates appropriately.
2. Add 100 µL of serum sample to each well.
3. Add 100 µL of the cell binding assay reagent to each well
containing the serum sample.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
D) Wash Steps
1. Aspirate or decant the reaction mixture from each well.
2. Wash wells with 300 µL of wash buffer, repeat wash steps three
times.
3. After the final wash, gently tap the plate to remove any
remaining wash buffer.
E) Detection
1. Add 100 µL of detection reagent (secondary antibody) to each
well.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Aspirate or decant the detection reagent.
4. Wash wells with 300 µL of wash buffer, repeat wash steps three
times.
F) Signal Generation
1. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature for a period determined
by the substrate’s requirements (usually 10-30 minutes).
3. Stop the reaction with 100 µL of stop solution if required by the
substrate protocol.
G) Measurement
1. Read the absorbance or fluorescence signal using a plate
reader set at the appropriate wavelength specific to the assay.
2. Record the data generated by the plate reader.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay validity.
• Verify that control sample results fall within the expected range.
• Document all control results in the Quality Control log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze the plate reader data, calculate and interpret results
based on established thresholds or criteria.
• Ensure result accuracy and consistency.
• Enter results into Laboratory Information System (LIS) and review
before final verification.
• Any critical results should be promptly reported to the requesting
clinician.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's assay package insert and guidelines.
• Laboratory Quality Management System protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records including assay setup, sample information,
quality control logs, and results in accordance with laboratory
standard operating procedures.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results occur, check for common issues such as
reagent expiry, instrument calibration, or sample integrity.
• Document any anomalies and corrective actions taken.
• Consult with a supervisor or the manufacturer for further
troubleshooting guidance.
By adhering to this SOP, consistent and accurate detection of
KELCH-LIKE PROTEIN 11 antibodies can be achieved, ensuring
reliable diagnostic information for patient care.
