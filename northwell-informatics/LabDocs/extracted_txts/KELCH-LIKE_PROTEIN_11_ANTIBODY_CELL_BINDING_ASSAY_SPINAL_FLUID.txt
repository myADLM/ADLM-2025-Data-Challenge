STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
KELCH-LIKE PROTEIN 11 ANTIBODY, CELL BINDING ASSAY,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Kelch-like Protein 11 (KLHLC11) Antibody, Cell Binding Assay,
using spinal fluid specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists will perform the cell binding
assay according to the procedure outlined in this document. It is their
responsibility to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test results,
including resolving any issues that arise during testing and reporting
any critical values promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Spinal fluid collected aseptically in sterile
tubes. Ensure specimens are delivered to the laboratory with
minimal delay (within six hours post-collection).
• Storage and Stability: Spinal fluid specimens can be stored for up
to 72 hours at 2-8°C or frozen at -20°C for longer storage. Thaw
samples completely and bring to room temperature before testing.
• Unacceptable: Specimens with contamination, excessive
hemolysis, or with identified clots.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Cell Binding Assay Kit for KLHLC11 Antibody Detection.
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Plate reader for cell assays
• Spinal fluid specimen tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents
1. Prepare all reagents and solutions as described in the Cell
Binding Assay Kit instructions.
2. Ensure reagents are at room temperature before beginning the
procedure.
3. Follow manufacturer's instructions for any dilution or
combination steps needed.
B. Sample Processing
1. Vortex spinal fluid specimens gently to ensure homogenization.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1,500 RPM for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
3. Transfer the supernatant into a new sterile microcentrifuge
tube.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Add specimen to the designated wells in the assay plate
according to the assay kit protocol.
2. Perform the cell binding assay as detailed in the manufacturer’s
instructions. This generally includes:
◦ Incubation steps at controlled temperatures.
◦ Multiple washes to remove unbound substances.
◦ Addition of detection antibodies and substrates.
◦ Final incubation and development of reaction.
3. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using the plate
reader.
D. Controls and Calibration
1. Include positive and negative controls as well as calibrators
with each assay run.
2. Ensure controls are within the established range before
validating assay results.
3. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat the assay if
necessary.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform internal and external quality control procedures
regularly with every batch of assay.
◦ Record results of the QC material and verify they are within
acceptable limits.
6. Any failed quality control requires investigation, resolution, and
documentation before reporting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. Verify all results by checking calibration curves and control
samples.
10. Flag and notify the physician of any critical values according to
laboratory policies.
11. Document any sample integrity issues affecting results (e.g.,
hemolysis) and report appropriately.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals for KLHLC11 antibody levels will be provided
with the assay kit.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Cell Binding Assay Kit insert for specific limitations
regarding reagent sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and potential
interference factors.
1. REFERENCES
Instructions for use provided with the Cell Binding Assay Kit for
KLHLC11 Antibody Detection will serve as the primary reference
material.
