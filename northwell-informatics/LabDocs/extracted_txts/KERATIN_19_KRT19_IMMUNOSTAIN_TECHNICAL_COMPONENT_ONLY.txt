STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Laboratory Protocol for KERATIN 19 (KRT19) IMMUNOSTAIN,
TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to describe the
procedure for performing the technical component only of
KERATIN 19 (KRT19) immunostaining in the laboratory. This
procedure outlines the steps for processing, staining, and
mounting tissue sections to detect KRT19 expression.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all qualified laboratory personnel
trained and authorized to perform KRT19 immunostaining.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated lab
personnel to ensure that all steps of this procedure are followed
correctly and that any issues are promptly reported to the
laboratory supervisor. All personnel involved in this process
must be trained in and familiar with this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Micro slides (positively charged)
• Coverslips
• Immunostaining system (e.g., automated immunostainer)
• KERATIN 19 antibody
• Detection kit (e.g., polymer-based detection kit)
• Hematoxylin
• Xylene
• Ethanol (various concentrations)
• Mounting medium
• Distilled water
• Control tissue sections (positive and negative controls)
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, face shield, etc.)
1. DEFINITIONS KERATIN 19 (KRT19) is a member of the keratin
family of intermediate filament proteins and is commonly used
as a biomarker for epithelial malignancies.
2. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow general laboratory safety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
• Handle all reagents and specimens following universal
precautions.
• Dispose of waste according to laboratory and institutional
guidelines.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Tissue Sectioning
• Obtain paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
• Cut tissue sections at 4 micrometers (µm) thickness using a
microtome.
• Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and pick up onto
positively charged micro slides.
• Dry slides at 58-60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion.
7.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize tissue sections in xylene for 3 changes of 5 minutes
each.
• Rehydrate sections through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
• Rinse sections in distilled water for 2 minutes.
7.3 Antigen Retrieval
• Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer, pH 6.0) in a microwave or pressure cooker according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Allow sections to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse sections in distilled water for 2 minutes.
7.4 Immunostaining
• Load slides onto the automated immunostainer or manually
perform immunostaining steps if necessary.
• Incubate sections with primary KERATIN 19 antibody at the
recommended dilution and incubation time according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Wash sections with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or TBS.
• Apply the detection reagent (polymer-based detection kit) and
incubate for the recommended time.
• Wash sections with PBS or TBS.
• Apply substrate-chromogen solution and incubate until a visible
reaction appears (usually 5-10 minutes).
7.5 Counterstaining
• Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse sections in running tap water for 2-5 minutes.
• Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
100%) for 1-2 minutes each.
• Clear sections in xylene for 2 changes of 2 minutes each.
7.6 Mounting
• Mount sections using a compatible mounting medium and cover
with coverslips.
• Allow slides to dry completely.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each run to
ensure staining accuracy and specificity.
• Document the results of control slides and take appropriate action
if control results are not satisfactory.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak staining: Ensure proper antigen retrieval and correct
antibody dilution.
• Non-specific staining: Check primary antibody specificity and
optimize washing steps.
• No staining: Verify if primary antibody and detection reagents are
active and stored as recommended.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The technical component only procedure does not involve
interpreting or reporting results. The stained slides are to be
provided to the appropriate pathologist for microscopic
examination and interpretation.
