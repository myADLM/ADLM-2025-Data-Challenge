Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase for Generating Results for KERATIN 20 (KRT20)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for KERATIN 20
(KRT20) immunostain in the laboratory, ensuring reliable and
reproducible results. This SOP is for the technical component of the
test only and includes details on specimen preparation, staining
protocol, and quality control measures.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of qualified histotechnologists to perform the
staining protocol as outlined in this SOP. All staff must ensure the
procedure is followed accurately to maintain the quality and reliability
of results.
2. DEFINITIONS
KERATIN 20 (KRT20): Keratin 20 is a protein known to be expressed
in the epithelial cells of several tissues, often utilized in
immunohistochemistry for diagnosing certain carcinomas.
Immunostaining: A laboratory technique used to detect specific
proteins in tissue sections using antibodies.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
Acceptable Specimen:
• Fresh-frozen tissue sections, appropriately preserved.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Partially fixed tissue or compromised tissue specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Microtome
2. Glass slides
3. Hematoxylin
4. Mounting medium
5. Cover slips
6. Incubator
7. Xylene, ethanol, and distilled water
8. Antibody against KERATIN 20 (KRT20)
9. Primary antibody diluent
10. Secondary antibody
11. Substrate-chromogen solution (e.g., DAB - Diaminobenzidine)
12. Counterstain
5. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Sectioning:
• Cut 3-5 µm thick sections from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
• Place sections onto positively charged glass slides.
• Air dry at room temperature then incubate slides at 60°C for 1
hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Immerse slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
• Rehydrate through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%, 5
minutes each).
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
or another appropriate buffer for 20 minutes at 98°C.
• Allow slides to cool then rinse slides with distilled water followed
by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
D. Blocking:
• Apply protein block to slides and incubate for 20 minutes at room
temperature to prevent non-specific bindings.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Dilute primary antibody against KERATIN 20 (KRT20) as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Apply primary antibody to the sections and incubate for 1 hour in
a humid chamber at room temperature or as specified.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
• Rinse slides with PBS.
• Apply the secondary antibody (anti-mouse/rabbit HRP-conjugate)
and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
G. Visualization:
• Rinse slides with PBS.
• Apply substrate-chromogen solution and incubate for 5-10
minutes or until desired stain intensity is observed.
• Rinse with distilled water.
H. Counterstaining:
• Apply hematoxylin to counterstain the tissue for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse with tap water until sections are visibly blue.
• Optional: Dip slides in ammonia water (0.1%) for bluing.
I. Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%, 3 minutes
each).
• Clear in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
• Mount with a resinous mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Control Slides:
• Include positive and negative control slides with every staining
batch.
• Ensure controls yield expected results for validation.
B. Equipment Maintenance:
• Regular maintenance and calibration of incubators and
autostainers.
• Record all maintenance activities according to laboratory policy.
C. Reagent Validation:
• Verify efficacy of antibodies and reagents prior to use, following
manufacturer guidelines.
• Document lot numbers and expiry dates, and conduct validation
tests for new reagent lots.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
The stained slides are subject to review by a qualified pathologist.
Results of the technical component must be documented clearly,
detailing the staining quality and any discrepancies observed during
the procedure. Ensure any deviations from normal protocol are
recorded and communicated appropriately.
