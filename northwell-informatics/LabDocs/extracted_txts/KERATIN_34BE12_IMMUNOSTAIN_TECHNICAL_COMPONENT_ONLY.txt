4. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Sectioning and Mounting
1. Cut FFPE tissue sections at 4-5 microns using a microtome.
2. Float the sections on a water bath and pick them up on
positively charged slides.
3. Dry the slides on a heating block or in an oven at 60°C for
45-60 minutes to ensure proper adhesion.
Step 2: Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by incubating them in xylene
for 5 minutes, twice.
2. Rehydrate the sections through a graded alcohol series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 minutes, twice
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes, twice
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
3. Rinse the slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Step 3: Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval:
◦ Place slides in a retrieval solution and heat in a microwave
or pressure cooker as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Allow the slides to cool to room temperature.
3. Rinse the slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
Step 4: Blocking
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating the slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse the slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
Step 5: Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Incubate the slides with anti-Keratin (34BE12) primary antibody
diluted in PBS with 1% BSA.
2. Place the slides in a humidity chamber and incubate at room
temperature for 30-60 minutes.
3. Rinse the slides in PBS for 5 minutes, twice.
Step 6: Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Incubate the slides with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse the slides in PBS for 5 minutes, twice.
3. Develop the color by incubating the slides with DAB substrate
for 2-7 minutes or until the desired stain intensity is achieved.
4. Rinse the slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Step 7: Counterstaining
1. Counterstain the slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse the slides in running tap water until the water runs clear.
3. Dip slides in ammonia water (0.1% NH4OH) briefly to blue the
hematoxylin.
4. Rinse the slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Step 8: Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate the slides through a graded alcohol series:
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes, twice
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 minutes, twice
2. Clear the slides in xylene for 5 minutes, twice.
3. Mount the slides with a coverslip using a compatible mounting
medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Positive Controls:
• Include a positive control tissue known to express Keratin
(34BE12).
Negative Controls:
• Include a negative control by omitting the primary antibody and
using PBS.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides will be reviewed microscopically by the
designated pathologist.
• Results, including the quality of staining, will be documented
thoroughly.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and datasheets for all reagents used.
• Relevant laboratory protocols and guidelines.
8. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Regularly maintain and calibrate all equipment as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document all maintenance activities and calibration checks.
This protocol ensures a consistent and reliable procedure for
immunostaining KERATIN (34BE12) optimizing the accuracy and
quality of the test results.
