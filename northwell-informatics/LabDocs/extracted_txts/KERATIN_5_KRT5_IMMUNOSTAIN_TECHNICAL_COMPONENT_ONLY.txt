Analytical Phase SOP for Keratin 5 (KRT5) Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the technical component of
performing the Keratin 5 (KRT5) immunostain on patient tissue
samples. This will ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable staining
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
staining process, documenting results, and identifying any issues that
arise during the procedure. The supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the process and providing guidance as necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Keratin 5 (KRT5) is an intermediate filament protein expressed in
basal cells of epithelia. Immunostaining for KRT5 is utilized to identify
the presence and distribution of basal cells, aiding in the
differentiation of various epithelial tissues and tumors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE)
• Section Thickness: Cut sections at 3-5 microns thickness.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Rabbit anti-human Keratin 5 (KRT5) antibody
• Secondary antibody: Poly-HRP anti-Rabbit (or as recommended)
• Detection system: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) kit
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Xylene-Free Clearant
• Positive control tissue: Known KRT5-positive tissue section
• Negative control: Tissue section with primary antibody omission
1. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Incubate slides in xylene-free clearant solutions: a. Clearant 1:
5 minutes b. Clearant 2: 5 minutes
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanol solutions: a.
100% ethanol: 3 minutes b. 95% ethanol: 3 minutes c. 70%
ethanol: 3 minutes d. Distilled water: 2 minutes
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (e.g., Citrate buffer,
pH 6.0).
2. Heat retrieval solution in a microwave or pressure cooker: a.
Microwave: High for 5 minutes followed by low/defrost for 15
minutes. b. Pressure Cooker: 2 minutes at full pressure.
3. Allow slides to cool in retrieval solution to room temperature
(about 20 minutes).
4. Rinse slides with distilled water followed by PBS or TBS buffer.
C. Immunostaining
1. Block endogenous peroxidases: a. Incubate slides in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. b. Rinse with distilled water.
2. Apply primary antibody: a. Incubate slides with rabbit anti-
human KRT5 antibody at the recommended dilution for 30
minutes at room temperature. b. Rinse in PBS or TBS buffer.
3. Apply secondary antibody: a. Incubate slides with Poly-HRP
secondary antibody for 20 minutes at room temperature. b.
Rinse in PBS or TBS buffer.
4. Detection: a. Apply DAB solution to slides and incubate for 5-10
minutes until desired stain intensity develops. b. Rinse with
distilled water.
5. Counterstaining and Mounting: a. Counterstain with
hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. b. Bluing in mild alkaline solution
(e.g., ammonia water) for 1 minute. c. Rinse in distilled water
and dehydrate through a graded series of ethanol to clearant. d.
Mount coverslip using xylene-free mounting medium.
D. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls with each staining run.
2. Evaluate both control slides: a. Positive control should show
expected positive staining pattern. b. Negative control should
show no specific staining.
3. Document QC results for each run.
E. Troubleshooting
1. Weak or No Staining: a. Verify antigen retrieval step and
antibody dilution. b. Check for expired or improperly stored
reagents.
2. Non-specific Staining: a. Increase blocking time. b. Verify
primary antibody specificity and concentration.
3. Variable Staining: a. Standardize incubation times and
temperatures. b. Ensure consistent reagent lot numbers.
F. Reporting Results
• Ensure images are captured and stored electronically if
applicable.
• Pass completed technical slides to the pathologist for
interpretation and diagnosis.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package insert for primary and secondary
antibodies.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on KRT5 immunostaining.
• Internal quality control and standardization protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all details of staining runs in the appropriate logbook,
including reagent lot numbers, conditions, and control results.
• Ensure any deviations or anomalies are documented and
reported to the supervisor.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the generation of
reliable and high-quality Keratin 5 (KRT5) immunostaining results for
diagnostic purposes.
