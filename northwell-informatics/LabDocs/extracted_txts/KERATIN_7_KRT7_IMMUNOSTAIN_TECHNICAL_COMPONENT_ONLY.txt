STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE KERATIN 7 (KRT7)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the standardized analytical phase for
generating technical results of Keratin 7 (KRT7) immunostaining in
tissue specimens. Keratin 7 is a type of intermediate filament protein
useful in the differential diagnosis of epithelial tumors and various
carcinomas.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
immunostaining process and for ensuring all steps are followed
accurately as outlined in this SOP. It is the duty of the laboratory
supervisor to monitor adherence to the protocol and address any
deviations or issues.
1. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Fresh tissue, inadequately fixed
specimens, hemolyzed samples, or inappropriate section
thickness.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark, Dako
Autostainer)
• KRT7 primary antibody (appropriate clone based on
manufacturer's recommendation)
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated secondary antibody/
detection kit)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6, EDTA pH 9)
• Mounting medium (e.g., DPX)
• Positive control tissue sections known to express KRT7
• Negative control tissue sections
• Water bath, incubators, and necessary glassware
• Microtome for sectioning paraffin blocks
• Slides, coverslips, and associated mounting supplies
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Preparation
1. Sectioning
◦ Cut 4-6 μm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged microscope slides.
◦ Air-dry slides overnight at room temperature or alternatively
dry at 60°C for 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene or xylene substitutes (3
changes, 5 minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%, and
distilled water, 2 minutes each).
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER)
◦ Preheat antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6)
to 95-100°C in a water bath or microwave.
◦ Immerse slides in preheated retrieval solution and maintain
temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution at room
temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by tris-buffered saline
(TBS).
C. Immunostaining
1. Blocking
◦ Apply blocking reagent if required (e.g., 5% normal serum)
to prevent non-specific binding.
◦ Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in a humidity
chamber.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Apply diluted KRT7 primary antibody onto the tissue section.
◦ Incubate as per manufacturer's recommendation, generally
30-60 minutes at room temperature.
3. Washing
◦ Rinse slides in TBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
4. Secondary Antibody and Detection
◦ Apply secondary antibody or detection system as per
manufacturer's recommendation.
◦ Incubate the tissue sections and then wash with TBS.
5. Chromogen Development
◦ Apply the chromogen (e.g., DAB) and allow the color to
develop under a microscope.
◦ Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
6. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain the sections with hematoxylin for nuclear
contrast.
◦ Rinse in running tap water and blue in weak ammonia water
or TBS solution.
7. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols, clear in xylene,
and coverslip with mounting medium.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Always include positive and negative control slides during each
run. Ensure the positive control shows appropriate KRT7 staining,
and the negative control (omission of primary antibody)
demonstrates no staining.
• Review control results to validate the staining run before reporting
patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All slides are to be reviewed microscopically by a qualified
pathologist.
• Technologists are to document the staining observation results
including any issues encountered.
• The pathologist provides the final diagnostic interpretation of
KRT7 staining.
