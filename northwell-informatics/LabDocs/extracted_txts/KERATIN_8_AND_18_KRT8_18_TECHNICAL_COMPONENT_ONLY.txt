Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Keratin 8 and 18 (KRT8/18)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase in generating results
for Keratin 8 and 18 (KRT8/18) technical component only. These
results are crucial in identifying the presence and distribution of these
intermediate filament proteins in various tissue samples, which can
be indicative of pathologic conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform and document all tasks related to the analysis of Keratin 8
and 18, adhering to this SOP as well as any additional manufacturer
protocols provided with reagents and equipment used in this
procedure.
3. DEFINITION
Keratin 8 and 18 are intermediate filament proteins expressed in
simple epithelia. Their presence is commonly assessed in various
diagnostic and research settings through immunohistochemistry
(IHC).
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Equipment, Reagents and Supplies
• Microscopy slides with appropriately fixed tissue sections
• Primary antibodies against Keratin 8 (e.g., clone M20)
• Primary antibodies against Keratin 18
• Secondary antibodies (conjugated with a detectable marker such
as HRP or fluorophore)
• Blocking solution (e.g., normal goat serum or serum-free protein
blocker)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA
buffer, pH 9.0)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate or secondary fluorophore)
• Mounting medium
• Microscopy equipment (light microscope or fluorescent
microscope, as applicable)
• Positive and negative control slides
4.2 Specimen Integrity
• Ensure that tissues are properly fixed and embedded in paraffin
blocks.
• All sections should be 3-5 µm thick and placed on positively
charged glass slides.
• Label slides accurately with the specimen identifier.
4.3 Protocol Steps
A) Preparation and Antigen Retrieval:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene, followed by rehydration through
graded ethanol to water.
2. Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in preheated
antigen retrieval solution and heating in a microwave or
pressure cooker as per reagent manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled
water followed by washing with appropriate buffer (e.g., PBS or
TBS).
B) Blocking: 4. Block endogenous peroxidase activity (if using HRP-
conjugate) by incubating slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10
minutes. 5. Apply blocking solution for 15-30 minutes to block non-
specific binding sites.
C) Primary Antibody Incubation: 6. Dilute primary antibodies
against Keratin 8 and Keratin 18 according to manufacturer
instructions. 7. Apply the primary antibody to each slide and incubate
in a humid chamber for 1-2 hours at room temperature or overnight at
4°C.
D) Washing: 8. Wash slides in appropriate buffer (e.g., PBS or TBS)
for 3 times, 5 minutes each wash.
E) Secondary Antibody Incubation: 9. Apply secondary antibody
(HRP or fluorophore-conjugated) and incubate according to
manufacturer instructions. 10. Wash slides again in appropriate buffer
for 3 times, 5 minutes each wash.
F) Detection: 11. For HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, develop
color with DAB or other suitable substrates. Monitor the development
under a microscope. 12. For fluorophore-conjugated secondary
antibody, directly proceed to counterstaining.
G) Counterstaining and Mounting: 13. Counterstain slides (e.g.,
with hematoxylin for HRP or DAPI for fluorescence) if necessary. 14.
Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol to xylene and mount with a
permanent medium. 15. For fluorescence, mount with an aqueous
medium appropriate for the fluorophore used.
4.4 Quality Control:
• Always run positive and negative control slides alongside patient
samples.
• Review and record control results to ensure assay reliability
before interpreting patient samples.
4.5 Reporting Results:
• Analyze stained slides under the light or fluorescence
microscope.
• Record the presence, absence, or distribution pattern of Keratin
8/18 staining.
• Use a standardized reporting format for qualitative assessment.
• Ensure all observations are documented and verified by another
technologist before final reporting.
