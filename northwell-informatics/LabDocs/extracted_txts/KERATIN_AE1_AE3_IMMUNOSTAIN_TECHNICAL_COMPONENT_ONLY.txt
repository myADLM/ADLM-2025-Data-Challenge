Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): KERATIN (AE1/AE3)
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the
technical component of the Keratin (AE1/AE3) immunostain in
tissue samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the Keratin (AE1/AE3) immunostain
following this SOP and documenting all steps and results
accurately. It is also their responsibility to identify and report any
discrepancies or issues to the laboratory supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS Keratin (AE1/AE3) Immunostain: An
immunohistochemical stain used to identify keratin proteins in
tissue sections, aiding in the differentiation of epithelial cells
from other cell types.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Microscope slides and coverslips
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
◦ Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS)
◦ Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution
◦ Keratin (AE1/AE3) primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme (e.g.,
horseradish peroxidase)
◦ Detection reagent (e.g., DAB substrate)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Hematoxylin for counterstaining
◦ Slide racks and staining jars
◦ Humidity chamber or incubator
◦ Positive and negative control tissue sections
5. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Preparation
1. Cut paraffin-embedded tissue sections at 4-5 micrometers
using a microtome.
2. Place the sections onto microscope slides and dry
overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C in a drying oven.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by immersing slides in
xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate the tissue sections through a graded series of
ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse the slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval by placing slides in a preheated
retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and
microwaving, pressure cooking, or using a dedicated
antigen retrieval device according to manufacturer’s
protocol.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 minutes.
D. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Block Endogenous Peroxidase Activity: Incubate slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes to block
endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 minutes.
3. Apply Primary Antibody: Incubate slides with diluted
Keratin (AE1/AE3) primary antibody in a humidity
chamber for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C, depending on the antibody specification.
4. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
5. Apply Secondary Antibody: Incubate slides with
secondary antibody conjugated with an enzyme (e.g.,
horseradish peroxidase) for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
7. Apply Detection Reagent: Incubate slides with detection
reagent (e.g., DAB substrate) until the desired stain
intensity develops (typically 5-10 minutes).
8. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
E. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate slides quickly through graded ethanol series
(70%, 95%, 100%) for 1 minute each.
4. Clear slides in xylene for 3 x 3 minutes.
F. Mounting and Coverslipping
1. Apply a drop of mounting medium to the slides.
2. Place coverslips over the tissue sections.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each
staining batch to ensure staining accuracy and consistency.
◦ Document all staining steps and results in the laboratory log.
◦ Review stained slides under a microscope to confirm the
presence of the expected staining pattern in control tissues.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Only the technical component of the staining process is
being reported. Interpretative results should be recorded by
the designated pathologist.
◦ Document and archive the control results for reference and
compliance with laboratory accreditation standards.
8. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instruction manual for Keratin (AE1/AE3)
antibody staining.
◦ Laboratory’s quality control guidelines.
◦ Relevant pathology textbooks and research articles.
This SOP ensures that the technical component of the Keratin (AE1/
AE3) immunostain procedure is performed consistently, accurately,
and in compliance with laboratory standards.
