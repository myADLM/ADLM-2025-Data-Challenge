Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Keratin (OSCAR)
Immunostain: Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Keratin (OSCAR) Immunostain, focusing on the
technical component only. This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy,
and reliability of immunostaining results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the Keratin (OSCAR) immunostain according to this
procedure. It is the responsibility of the lab supervisor to ensure
adherence to the SOP and address any issues that arise during the
analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure proper fixation and embedding of tissue samples.
• Store and handle specimens according to laboratory guidelines to
preserve antigenicity.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Immunostaining platform (automated or manual)
• Incubators
• Optical microscope
Reagents and Supplies:
• Keratin (OSCAR) primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (conjugated with enzyme or fluorophore)
• Blocking solution
• Washing buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, PBS)
• Substrate solution (for enzymatic detection)
• Mounting medium
• Cover slips
• Control slides (positive and negative)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation: a. Cut serial sections (4-5 µm thick) from paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks using a microtome. b. Place sections onto
positively charged glass slides. c. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to
adhere tissue sections to slides.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration: a. Immerse slides in xylene for
2-3 minutes (repeat twice). b. Rehydrate through graded alcohols
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2-3 minutes each. c. Rinse slides in distilled
water for 2-3 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval: a. Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or other suitable buffer in a microwave or pressure cooker for 20
minutes. b. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes and rinse in distilled
water.
Immunostaining: a. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by
incubating slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. b. Apply
blocking solution to cover tissue sections and incubate for 20 minutes
at room temperature. c. Incubate slides with Keratin (OSCAR)
primary antibody at the recommended dilution for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C. d. Wash slides with PBS for 5
minutes (repeat twice). e. Apply secondary antibody and incubate for
30 minutes at room temperature. f. Wash slides with PBS for 5
minutes (repeat twice). g. Apply substrate solution and incubate until
desired staining intensity is achieved (usually 5-15 minutes). h. Rinse
slides in distilled water to stop the enzymatic reaction.
Counterstaining and Mounting: a. Counterstain with hematoxylin for
1-2 minutes. b. Wash slides in running tap water for 5 minutes. c.
Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) for 2-3
minutes each. d. Clear in xylene for 2-3 minutes (repeat twice). e.
Mount coverslip using mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides in each run to validate
the staining procedure.
• Ensure secondary antibody is specific to the primary antibody
species.
• Periodically review the staining patterns and intensities to
maintain consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by a qualified pathologist.
• Report the presence or absence of Keratin (OSCAR) staining and
its intensity.
• Document any issues or deviations in the staining process.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for Keratin (OSCAR) primary antibody.
• Relevant immunohistochemistry manuals and guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Staining intensity may vary based on fixation and processing
conditions.
• Antigen retrieval method and duration may affect results.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow laboratory safety protocols when handling chemicals and
reagents.
• Dispose of waste according to institutional guidelines.
