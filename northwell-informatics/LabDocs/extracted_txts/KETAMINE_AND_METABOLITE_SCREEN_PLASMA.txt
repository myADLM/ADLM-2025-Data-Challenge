Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Ketamine and
Metabolite Screen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to establish a standard procedure for
the analysis of ketamine and its metabolites in plasma samples. This
procedure includes guidelines for sample preparation,
instrumentation, analysis, quality control, and result reporting to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated technical staff to perform the
analysis following this SOP. All staff involved in the analysis must be
trained and competent in the procedures outlined below.
1. DEFINITION
Ketamine is an anesthetic medication, while its primary metabolites
include norketamine and dehydronorketamine. The plasma screen
aims to detect and quantify these compounds to assess drug
exposure and potential toxicity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type:
◦ Preferred: Plasma from an EDTA or heparinized tube.
• Specimen Volume:
◦ Minimum volume: 2 mL of plasma.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Plasma can be stored:
▪ At room temperature for up to 24 hours.
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 72 hours.
▪ Frozen (-20°C or colder) for longer-term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens diluted with infusion fluids.
• Specimens containing anticoagulants other than EDTA or heparin.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micro-pipettes
◦ LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass
Spectrometry)
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Water bath or heating block
◦ Analytical software for data interpretation
• Reagents:
◦ Methanol (LC-MS grade)
◦ Acetonitrile (LC-MS grade)
◦ Ammonium formate buffer (10 mM, pH 3.5)
◦ Internal standard solution (e.g., deuterated ketamine or
norketamine)
◦ Calibration standards and quality control samples (prepared in
plasma matrix)
Supplies:
• Sample tubes
• LC-MS/MS vials
• Disposable pipette tips
• Nitrogen gas for drying (if necessary)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature if frozen.
2. Vortex the samples for at least 30 seconds to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Pipette 0.5 mL of plasma into a clean sample preparation tube.
4. Add an appropriate volume of internal standard solution to each
sample.
5. Precipitate proteins by adding 2 volumes of cold acetonitrile,
cap, and vortex thoroughly.
6. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
7. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean LC-MS/MS vial.
LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions, ensuring proper tuning and calibration.
2. Set up the chromatographic conditions:
◦ Column: C18 reverse-phase column (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm)
◦ Mobile phase A: 0.1% formic acid in water
◦ Mobile phase B: 0.1% formic acid in methanol
◦ Gradient elution: begin at 10% B, gradient up to 90% B over
5 minutes, hold 1 minute, return to 10% B and equilibrate.
◦ Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min
3. Set up the MS parameters:
◦ Ion source: ESI (electrospray ionization) in positive mode
◦ MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) transitions: specific ions
for ketamine and its metabolites
◦ Dwell time, collision energy, and other settings optimized for
target compounds
4. Inject 10 µL of each sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
5. Acquire data and process using analytical software.
Quality Control:
• Run calibration standards and quality control samples at the
beginning, middle, and end of each analytical batch.
• Verify that QC sample results are within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
• Evaluate the linearity, precision, and accuracy of the assay
periodically.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze data and quantify ketamine and its metabolites using
generated calibration curves.
• Review all data for accuracy and verify by a qualified technologist.
• Report results in ng/mL with appropriate clinical comments.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during analysis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Interpretation of results should reference applicable medical
guidelines or literature. Reference values for ketamine and
metabolites should be established based on clinical relevance
and available data.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the LC-MS/MS operating manual and validation
documents for method sensitivity, specificity, and known
interferences.
• Ensure specimens are processed promptly and stored properly to
prevent degradation or contamination.

By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the reliability and
accuracy of the ketamine and metabolite screening results for patient
diagnosis and management.
