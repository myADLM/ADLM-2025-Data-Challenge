Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ketones in Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection and quantitation of ketones
in urine using the Siemens Multistix 10SG reagent strips when
automated equipment is unavailable or manual urinalysis is required.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform and
document urinalysis testing according to this procedure. Supervisors
shall ensure that the procedure is followed correctly and quality
control measures are adhered to.
2. DEFINITION
Ketones in urine can indicate a state of ketosis, which may be related
to conditions such as diabetes, prolonged fasting, or other metabolic
disorders. The primary ketone detected in urine is acetoacetate.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: 10 mL of freshly voided urine sent to the
laboratory within 6 hours of collection. Patient should be
instructed to discard the initial portion.
• BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Conical Urine tube.
Specimens in these tubes are stable for up to 72 hrs at 4-25° C
with an ideal volume of 7-9 mL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 6 hours after
collection (for BD vacutainer tubes, specimens arriving in the
laboratory greater than 72 hours after collection).
• Specimens without a collection date and time indicated on the
sample container or requisition.
Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure 10 mL fresh urine is brought to room temperature if
refrigerated.
• Keep urine specimens for up to 6 hours after the time of
collection.
Materials:
• Siemens Multistix 10SG reagent strips
• Timer
• Urinalysis centrifuge tubes (if using QC material)
• QC materials (Kenlor Industries, Biorad Liquichek Urinalysis)
Procedure Steps:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control with each new bottle of Multistix
10SG according to site-specific guidelines.
◦ Ensure QC material is brought to room temperature before
use. Transfer QC into appropriately labeled urinalysis tubes
or use a dropper for Kenlor QC/qUAntify QC.
2. Testing:
a. Completely immerse the reagent strip in urine and remove
immediately to prevent reagents from dissolving in the urine. b.
Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to remove
excess urine. c. Start Timer. d. Read the ketone pad at the
appropriate time indicated on the label. e. Hold the strip close to
the color block on the label and match carefully.
Note: If the color of the test pad is outside the expected color
range, do not provide a result. Use the comment 'No result due
to interference.'
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. Verify if the result falls
within the reference interval for ketones:
- Ketone: negative
Results outside the expected range should be reviewed and
appropriately documented.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to Siemens Multistix 10SG insert for specific reagent pad
limitations and possible interferences.

current standards and practices. Any amendments shall be
documented and disseminated to all relevant staff.
