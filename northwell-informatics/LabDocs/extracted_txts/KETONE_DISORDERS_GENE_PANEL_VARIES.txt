Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): KETONE DISORDERS
GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase in generating
results for the KETONE DISORDERS GENE PANEL. This procedure
ensures reliable and accurate identification of genetic variants
associated with ketone disorders.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the gene
panel analysis and documenting all relevant data. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP and verifying results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to laboratory personnel performing genetic
testing for ketone disorders using the designated gene panel.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Blood or saliva sample collected in an appropriate
container.
• Acceptable: Buccal swab.
Transportation Conditions:
• Maintain sample stability by keeping blood samples at 2-8°C and
saliva samples at room temperature.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, incorrectly labeled, or have
insufficient quantity for testing.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR machine
• DNA extraction kit (specific to specimen type)
• Next-generation sequencing (NGS) instrument
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Master mix for PCR
• Primers specific to the gene panel
• Nuclease-free water
• Ethanol for nucleic acid precipitation
• Sequencing reagents
Supplies:
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and lab coat
• Sample collection containers
5. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA from the
collected specimen.
2. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer to ensure sufficient
concentration and purity. Target concentration should be at
least 20 ng/µL.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Add specific primers for the ketone disorders gene panel.
3. Perform PCR using the appropriate thermal cycling program.
4. Validate amplification by running a gel electrophoresis.
C) Library Preparation for NGS:
1. Quantify PCR products using a fluorometer and pool them if
necessary.
2. Perform library preparation using the designated kit, including
end-repair, a-tailing, and adapter ligation.
3. Purify the prepared library using magnetic beads.
4. Quantify the library using a real-time PCR.
D) Sequencing:
1. Load the library onto the NGS instrument, following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Initiate the sequencing run and monitor progress.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Secure the raw sequencing data from the NGS instrument.
2. Use designated bioinformatics tools and pipelines to align
reads, and call variants.
3. Annotate variants to identify pathogenic variants associated
with ketone disorders.
4. Verify and interpret results using reference databases and
clinical guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Validate library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis by
comparing variant calls with known standards.
External Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs and interlaboratory
comparisons.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification:
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a certified
technologist.
• Report sequence variants associated with ketone disorders using
the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
Critical Results:
• Immediate notification of any critical genetic findings to the
clinician via predetermined channels.
8. DOCUMENTATION
Log Sheets:
• Document specific details of the analytical process, including
sample ID, reagent lot numbers, dates, times, and initials of
personnel.
