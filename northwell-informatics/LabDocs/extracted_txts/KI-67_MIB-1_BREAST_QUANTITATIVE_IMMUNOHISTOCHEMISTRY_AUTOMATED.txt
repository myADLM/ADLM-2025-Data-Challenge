STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR KI-67 (MIB-1)
BREAST, QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,
AUTOMATED
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the automated quantitative
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of Ki-67 (MIB-1) in breast
tissue samples. This protocol is designed to ensure accuracy,
reproducibility, and consistency in the analytical phase of
generating Ki-67 results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
automated quantitative IHC analysis of Ki-67 in breast tissue
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis,
maintenance, and quality control checks as outlined in this
SOP.
◦ Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP and address
any issues related to analytical performance.
◦ Quality Control Staff: Monitor the quality control procedures
and documentation.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ Automated IHC Staining System (e.g., Ventana BenchMark
ULTRA)
◦ Ki-67 (MIB-1) Primary Antibody
◦ Detection Kit (e.g., UltraView Universal DAB Detection Kit)
◦ Control Slides (Positive and Negative Controls)
◦ Buffered Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Breast Tissue
Sections
◦ Automated Digital Pathology Scanning System
◦ Quantitative Image Analysis Software (e.g., ImageJ, Aperio)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Sections should be cut at 4 μm thickness from formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks.
2. Place sections on positively charged slides and bake at
60°C for 1 hour.
B. Automated Immunohistochemistry Staining
1. Load slides into the automated IHC staining system.
2. Select the appropriate protocol for Ki-67 staining on the
system.
3. Ensure reagents (antibodies, detection kit) are loaded and
sufficient for the run.
4. Protocol steps typically include:
▪ Deparaffinization
▪ Antigen retrieval: ~20 min at 100°C using appropriate
buffer (e.g., Cell Conditioning Solution, CC1)
▪ Primary antibody application: Anti-Ki-67 (MIB-1)
antibody incubated for the specified time (e.g., 30
minutes)
▪ Secondary antibody application
▪ DAB chromogen application
▪ Hematoxylin counterstaining
C. Quality Control
1. Include known positive and negative control slides in each
run.
2. Ensure staining intensity and localization are consistent
with the control standards.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during
staining.
D. Automated Image Analysis
1. Scan stained slides using an automated digital pathology
scanning system.
2. Upload scanned images to the quantitative image
analysis software.
3. Set parameters for analysis:
▪ Define the region of interest (ROI), typically the
invasive breast carcinoma area.
▪ Adjust thresholds for DAB (positive nuclei) and
hematoxylin (counterstain).
4. Run the analysis to quantify Ki-67 positivity.
5. Review and validate the output from the software,
ensuring accuracy of the quantified results.
6. Record the percentage of Ki-67 positive nuclei among the
total number of nuclei counted.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ The final result should be reported as the percentage of
Ki-67 positive cells.
◦ Include the total number of cells analyzed and the
methodology used in the report.
◦ Verify results and sign the report before releasing it to the
ordering physician.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Regular maintenance and calibration of automated staining
and imaging systems.
◦ Routine participation in external proficiency testing for
immunohistochemistry.
◦ Continuous monitoring and recording of quality control
results.
◦ Address and document any troubleshooting steps for
staining artifacts or discrepancies in the analysis.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
◦ Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the
use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Handle all reagents and tissue specimens with appropriate
biosafety precautions.
