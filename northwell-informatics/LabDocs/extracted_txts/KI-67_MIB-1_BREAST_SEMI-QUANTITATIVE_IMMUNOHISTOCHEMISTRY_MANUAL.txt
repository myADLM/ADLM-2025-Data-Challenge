SOP for KI-67 (MIB-1) Semi-Quantitative Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) on Breast Tissue - Manual Method
1. Purpose: This procedure is to outline the steps for performing and
interpreting semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry for KI-67
(MIB-1) proliferation marker in breast cancer tissue, ensuring
consistent and accurate results.
2. Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing the KI-67 IHC staining procedure and the subsequent
semi-quantitative analysis. It is the responsibility of the staff to follow
the outlined procedures diligently and report any deviations,
anomalies, or equipment malfunctions to the supervisor.
3. Specimen Requirements:
• Tissue: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue
samples.
• Sections: 4-5 micrometer thick sections mounted on charged
slides.
4. Equipment and Supplies:
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• 37°C Oven
• Staining Jars and Racks
• Humid Incubation Chamber
• Microscope
• KI-67 (MIB-1) Mouse Monoclonal Antibody
• Detection Kit (e.g., DAB Detection System)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting Medium
• Coverslips
5. Reagents and Solutions:
• Primary Antibody: KI-67 (MIB-1) antibody
• Secondary Antibody: Anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate
• DAB Chromogen
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Antigen Retrieval Buffer: Citrate or EDTA
6. Procedure:
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue block using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C.
3. Mount sections on charged slides and dry in a 37°C oven
overnight.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a series of ethanol solutions:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 x 3 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol, 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol, 2 minutes
3. Rinse in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
Citrate Buffer pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or pressure
cooker, following manufacturer’s recommendations.
2. Allow the slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in PBS.
D. Blocking:
1. Incubate slides with blocking solution (e.g., 5% normal serum)
for 20 minutes at room temperature to block nonspecific
binding.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate slides with the KI-67 (MIB-1) primary antibody (dilution
as per manufacturer's instructions) in a humidified chamber for
1 hour at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 x 5 minutes.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate) and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 x 5 minutes.
3. Apply DAB chromogen and incubate until desired color intensity
is reached (~5 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in PBS.
G. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain the slides with Hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate and clear slides through graded ethanol solutions:
◦ 70% ethanol, 2 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol, 2 minutes
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 x 2 minutes
◦ Xylene, 2 x 2 minutes
4. Mount coverslips using a synthetic resin mounting medium.
7. Interpretation of Results:
1. Examine the stained slides under a microscope to identify
brown nuclear staining indicating KI-67 positivity.
2. Perform semi-quantitative analysis by counting the percentage
of positively stained tumor nuclei in a minimum of 1000 tumor
cells.
3. Record the result as the percentage of KI-67 positive cells out
of the total tumor cells counted.
8. Quality Control:
• Include a positive control slide (known Ki-67 expressing tissue) in
each run.
• Include a negative control slide (omit primary antibody) to check
for non-specific staining.
• Record any deviations or anomalies observed during the staining
process.
9. Reporting Results:
• Report the percentage of KI-67 positive tumor cells.
• Reference interval: Pathologist to determine specific clinical
significance based on established guidelines.
10. Method Limitations:
• Immunohistochemical staining intensity may vary based on
fixation and processing.
• Interpretation is semi-quantitative and subjective; therefore, intra-
observer variations may occur.
11. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for KI-67 (MIB-1) antibody.
• Clinical guidelines for breast cancer proliferation marker
assessment.
This protocol ensures accurate and reproducible results while
maintaining a high standard of analytical integrity.
