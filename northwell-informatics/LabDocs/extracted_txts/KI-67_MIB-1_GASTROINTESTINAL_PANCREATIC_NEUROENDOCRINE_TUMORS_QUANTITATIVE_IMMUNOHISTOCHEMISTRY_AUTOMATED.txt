Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Quantitative Immunohistochemistry Analysis of
Ki-67 (MIB-1) for Gastrointestinal/Pancreatic
Neuroendocrine Tumors
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and validated protocol for the automated
quantitative analysis of Ki-67 (MIB-1) in gastrointestinal/pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to ensure
accurate and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
Ki-67 (MIB-1) immunohistochemistry analysis on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections from gastrointestinal/pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory managers are responsible for ensuring that the
equipment and reagents are properly maintained and that
personnel are trained and proficient in this procedure.
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for the accurate
and timely execution of this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from
gastrointestinal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
• Tissue sections should be cut at 4-5 microns and mounted on
positively charged glass slides.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Automated IHC staining instrument (e.g., Ventana BenchMark XT,
Leica BOND III)
• Ki-67 (MIB-1) primary antibody (validated for use on an
automated stainer)
• Secondary antibody and detection system suitable for the
instrument used
• Positive control slides (tissue known to express Ki-67)
• Negative control slides (tissue section without primary antibody)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Microscope for evaluation of stained slides
• Distilled water, buffers, and other reagents as required for the
automated instrument
• Calibrated temperature monitoring device for equipment
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Prepare and label slides with patient identifiers.
2. Cut tissue sections at 4-5 microns from the formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and mount on positively
charged glass slides.
3. Bake tissue slides at 60°C for 1 hour.
B) Automated Staining Procedure
1. Load slides into the automated IHC stainer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Program the automated stainer to conduct the following steps:
◦ Deparaffinization and rehydration of tissue sections.
◦ Antigen retrieval as per validated protocol for Ki-67 (MIB-1).
◦ Application of Ki-67 (MIB-1) primary antibody at
manufacturer-recommended dilution and incubation time.
◦ Washing steps to remove excess unbound antibody.
◦ Application of secondary antibody and detection system.
◦ Counterstaining with hematoxylin.
3. Review the programmed run to ensure all steps are correct and
start the staining process.
C) Post-Staining Procedure
1. Remove the slides from the stainer and rinse in distilled water.
2. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
3. Mount coverslips using appropriate mounting medium.
D) Quality Control
1. Include one positive control slide and one negative control slide
in each staining run.
◦ Positive control: Tissue known to express Ki-67.
◦ Negative control: Tissue processed without primary
antibody.
2. Assess control slides to ensure proper staining:
◦ Positive control must show expected staining pattern.
◦ Negative control must show no staining.
7. EVALUATION AND REPORTING
1. Examine stained slides under a microscope.
2. Quantify Ki-67 staining:
◦ Count the number of Ki-67 positive and negative tumor cells
in at least three high-power fields (HPFs).
◦ Calculate the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells.
3. Review internal QC checks and concordance with control
slides.
4. Report results according to laboratory protocol:
◦ Include percentage of Ki-67 positive cells.
◦ Include interpretation and any pertinent comments regarding
the quality of the specimen or staining.
8. REFERENCE RANGES
Interpret the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells in context of
established clinical guidelines for gastrointestinal/pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Document all findings, deviations from the standard procedure, and
any corrective actions taken. Include in the laboratory information
system (LIS) as well as a physical log if required by laboratory policy.
