Standard Operating Procedure for KI-67 (MIB-1),
Gastrointestinal/Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,
Quantitative Immunohistochemistry, Manual
1. Purpose
• The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedure for the quantitative immunohistochemical
evaluation of KI-67 (MIB-1) in gastrointestinal and pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors using manual techniques.
1. Scope
• This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
staining and analysis of KI-67 (MIB-1) in gastrointestinal and
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor specimens.
1. Responsibilities
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to follow this
SOP and ensure accurate and reproducible staining results.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
technologist is properly trained and competent in the procedure.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block of the
gastrointestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.
• Tissue sectioned at 4 micrometers (μm).
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Microscope slides
• Xylene
• Ethanol (absolute and graded)
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) solution (pH 6 or pH 9)
• Microwave or pressure cooker
• Peroxidase blocking solution
• Protein blocking solution
• KI-67 (MIB-1) primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB Substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
1. Procedure
A. Preparation of Slides
1. Cut 4-μm sections from the FFPE tissue block and place them
on charged microscope slides.
2. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure optimal adhesion of
the tissue sections to the slides.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol solutions
(absolute, 95%, 70%, 50%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in HIER solution (buffer solution, pH 6 or pH 9) and
perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using a microwave or
pressure cooker for the recommended time (usually 20
minutes).
2. Allow slides to cool in the HIER solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
D. Immunohistochemical Staining
1. Apply peroxidase blocking solution on the tissue section;
incubate for 10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase
activity.
2. Rinse slides in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) for 5 minutes.
3. Apply protein blocking solution on the tissue sections; incubate
for 20 minutes.
4. Do not rinse; immediately apply the KI-67 (MIB-1) primary
antibody diluted to the manufacturer’s recommendation.
Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
5. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
6. Apply secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
7. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
8. Apply DAB Substrate for 5-10 minutes to visualize the reaction.
9. Rinse slides in distilled water until clean.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water until clear.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
absolute) and xylene.
4. Mount with mounting medium and coverslip.
5. Interpretation and Reporting of Results
A. Assessment
1. Evaluate staining under a microscope. Scan the slides to
identify areas with the highest density of tumor cells.
2. Count the number of positively stained tumor cell nuclei and the
total number of tumor cell nuclei in 10 high-power fields (HPFs)
or use digital image analysis software if available.
3. Calculate the proliferative index as the ratio of positive nuclei to
total nuclei (percentage of KI-67-positive cells).
B. Reporting
1. Report the KI-67 labeling index as a percentage. Include the
percentage of positive cells and the method of assessment in
the report.
2. Refer to the laboratory's reporting guidelines for interpretation
of the KI-67 index in the context of gastrointestinal/pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors.
3. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative control tissues with each batch of
slides to ensure staining accuracy.
• Regularly validate antibody performance and maintain lot-to-lot
consistency.
• Document all reagents, controls, and technical steps in the
laboratory's quality control log.
1. References
• Manufacturer's instructions for the KI-67 (MIB-1) antibody and
detection reagents.
• Current clinical guidelines for the assessment of GI/pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors.
1. Documentation and Records
• Maintain records of staining protocols, QC results, and any
deviations or corrective actions taken.
• Ensure that all steps of the procedure are documented in
accordance with laboratory accreditation and regulatory
requirements.
1. Review and Approval
• This SOP has been reviewed and approved by the laboratory
director and quality assurance team. Reviews will be conducted
annually or as needed based on changes in methodology or
relevant clinical guidelines.
