STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE KI-67 (MIB-1) Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the technical procedures
involved in the preparation, staining, and quality control of KI-67
(MIB-1) immunohistochemical staining. This SOP ensures consistent,
high-quality staining results for the assessment of cell proliferation in
tissue samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained personnel to perform and
document staining procedures according to this SOP. It is also the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to the
protocol, manage quality control, and address any technical issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Accepted Specimens
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
• Optimal fixation is achieved within 12-24 hours in 10% neutral
buffered formalin
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens
• Tissues fixed in non-formalin fixatives
• Inadequately fixed tissues (over-fixation or under-fixation)
• Specimens with incomplete clinical information or labeling errors
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Reagents
• Primary antibody: KI-67 (MIB-1) antibody
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate biotinylated or enzyme-
conjugated secondary antibody
• Chromogen: DAB or other suitable chromogen
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin or other suitable nuclear counterstain
• Blocking solutions and dilution buffers
3.2 Supplies
• Microtome
• Water bath (37-42°C)
• Staining dishes and racks
• Coplin jars
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Slides (positively charged)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Slide Preparation
1. Cut 3-4 µm tissue sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and mount on
positively charged slides.
3. Allow slides to dry overnight at 37°C or for 1-2 hours at 60°C.
4.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene or a xylene substitute through
three changes of 5 minutes each.
2. Hydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, and 70%)
and then in distilled water.
4.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval by placing slides in a suitable buffer
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heating in a microwave,
pressure cooker, or steamer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4.4 Blocking
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides with
3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in distilled water followed by appropriate buffer
(e.g., PBS or TBS).
3. Block non-specific binding by incubating slides with a protein
blocking solution for 10-20 minutes.
4.5 Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Dilute the primary MIB-1 antibody in the recommended dilution
buffer.
2. Apply diluted primary antibody to each slide and incubate for
30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
4.6 Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Wash slides in buffer to remove primary antibody.
2. Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4.7 Detection and Chromogen Application
1. Detect antibody binding using an appropriate enzyme-
conjugated system.
2. Develop the chromogen (e.g., DAB) for the recommended time
until desired staining intensity is achieved.
3. Counterstain with hematoxylin and rinse in distilled water.
4.8 Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols and clear in xylene or
a xylene substitute.
2. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Positive Control
• Include a tissue section known to express KI-67 (e.g., tonsil or
another high proliferative tissue) in each staining run to ensure
antibody reactivity.
5.2 Negative Control
• Include a negative control by omitting the primary antibody and
using an isotype control to check for non-specific staining.
5.3 Documentation
• Record all staining procedures, reagent lot numbers, and any
deviations from the SOP in a standardized log.
• Document results of positive and negative control tissues.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
The stained slides will be reviewed by a qualified pathologist who will
interpret the results and report the percentage of KI-67 positive cells.
Technical staff are responsible for ensuring high-quality, consistent
staining but do not perform interpretation.

This SOP is effective as of (Date) and will be reviewed annually or as
necessary.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the reliability,
reproducibility, and accuracy of the KI-67 (MIB-1) immunostain,
contributing to high-quality diagnostic and research outcomes.
