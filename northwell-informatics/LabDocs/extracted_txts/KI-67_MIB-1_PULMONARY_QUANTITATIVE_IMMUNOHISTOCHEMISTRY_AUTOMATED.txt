Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for KI-67 (MIB-1) Quantitative
Immunohistochemistry, Pulmonary, Automated
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the quantitative assessment of
Ki-67 expression in pulmonary tissue sections using automated
immunohistochemistry, ensuring accurate and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase performed in the
laboratory for immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 in pulmonary
tissue specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reporting the results from the automated
immunohistochemistry assay following this SOP. The quality of the
results should be reviewed and verified by the laboratory supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
Ki-67 (MIB-1): A nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Ki-67 (MIB-1) primary antibody
• Detection reagent (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Secondary antibody polymer conjugate
• Automated immunohistochemistry staining system
• Positive and negative control pulmonary tissue sections
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Xylene
• Alcohol solutions (graded ethanol series)
• Distilled water
6. EQUIPMENT
• Automated immunohistochemistry stainer (e.g., Ventana
Benchmark, Dako Autostainer)
• Light microscope
• Slide drying oven
• Deparaffinization station
• Timer
• Microtome (for sectioning control and patient tissue)
7. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Preparation
1.0 Ensure tissue sections are properly fixed and paraffin-embedded.
2.0 Cut sections 4-5 microns thick on a microtome. 3.0 Mount
sections on positively charged microscope slides. 4.0 Bake slides at
60°C for 30 minutes in a slide drying oven.
B) Automated Staining Protocol
1.0 Load slides into the automated immunohistochemistry stainer. 2.0
Select the appropriate Ki-67 staining protocol on the stainer interface.
• Include necessary steps for deparaffinization, rehydration, antigen
retrieval, and staining. 3.0 Load reagents, including the primary
antibody, secondary antibody, and detection reagents according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.0 Ensure that both positive
and negative controls are included in each run. 5.0 Start the run
on the automated stainer. 6.0 At the end of the run, remove slides
and rinse with distilled water. 7.0 Counterstain slides with
hematoxylin in an automated or manual system. 8.0 Dehydrate
the slides through graded alcohol solutions and clear in xylene.
9.0 Apply coverslips using mounting medium.
C) Slide Evaluation and Quantification
1.0 Examine slides under a light microscope. 2.0 Verify the inclusion
of positive and negative controls. 3.0 Assess staining quality and
ensure there is no non-specific staining. 4.0 Evaluate the percentage
of positively stained nuclei out of total cells in representative high-
power fields. 5.0 Perform cell count quantification manually or with
image analysis software, ensuring consistency. 6.0 Document the
results in the laboratory information system (LIS), indicating the
proportion of Ki-67 positive cells.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that positive and negative control tissues are included in
each staining run.
• Confirm that the staining intensity and pattern match known
standards.
• Evaluate QC results and document any non-conformance or
corrective action.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the findings in the LIS.
• Include percentage of Ki-67 positivity in the pulmonary tissue.
• Review and verify the results before validation by the pathologist.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Ki-67 labeling is expressed as a percentage, representing the
proportion of Ki-67 positive nuclei among total nuclei within the
assessed pulmonary tissue section.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Variations in tissue fixation and processing may affect staining
results.
• Background staining or non-specific binding of antibodies should
be accounted for and controlled.
• Ensure consistent and accurate cell count methodology to
maintain reproducibility.
12. REFERENCES Reference manufacturer’s kit insert for detailed
information about the reagents and equipment used.
13. DOCUMENTATION
All findings, including discrepancies, must be accurately documented
in the appropriate logbooks and in the LIS according to laboratory
policies.
14. REVISIONS
This SOP should undergo periodic review and revision as necessary,
based on new information, procedural adjustments, or regulatory
requirements.
By following the steps outlined in this SOP, laboratory personnel can
ensure the consistent and reliable generation of quantitative
immunohistochemistry results for Ki-67 in pulmonary tissue.
