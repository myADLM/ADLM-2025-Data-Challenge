Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for KI-67 (MIB-1),
Pulmonary Quantitative Immunohistochemistry, Manual
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for manual quantitative immunohistochemical
analysis of KI-67 (MIB-1) in pulmonary tissue. This procedure is
essential for the assessment of cell proliferation in pulmonary cancer
diagnostics and treatment monitoring.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the process of manual
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and quantitative assessment of
KI-67 in pulmonary tissue sections.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory technicians and scientists are responsible for
performing the staining and quantitative analysis.
• Pathologists are responsible for the final interpretation and
reporting of results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring the
procedure is followed and that all equipment is maintained and
calibrated.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pulmonary tissue
specimens.
• Tissue sections should be cut to a thickness of 3-4 micrometers
and mounted on positively charged glass slides.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Mouse monoclonal anti-KI-67 (MIB-1) antibody.
• Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG.
• Chromogen: 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin.
• Positive and negative control slides.
• Deparaffinization solutions: Xylene or xylene substitutes.
• Rehydration solutions: Ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%).
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
• Peroxide block solution.
• Washing buffers: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-
buffered saline (TBS).
6. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome for sectioning paraffin blocks.
• Water bath.
• Humidified chamber for incubation.
• Light microscope.
• Automated slide stainer (optional, for consistency and efficiency).
• Pathologist-approved software for quantitative analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Cut 3-4 μm thick FFPE pulmonary tissue sections using a
microtome.
2. Mount sections on positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour or overnight at 37°C to ensure
adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene or
xylene substitutes for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate sections by sequential immersion in 100%, 95%,
and 70% ethanol for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer, pH
6.0).
2. Heat the solution to 95-100°C for 20 minutes using a water bath
or microwave.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature (approximately 20
minutes).
4. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS/TBS for 5
minutes each.
D. Blocking
1. Apply peroxide block solution to tissue sections to quench
endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS for 5 minutes.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply mouse monoclonal anti-KI-67 (MIB-1) antibody to
sections.
2. Incubate in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS for 5 minutes.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS for 5 minutes.
G. Chromogen Development
1. Apply DAB substrate to tissue sections.
2. Incubate for 5-10 minutes, monitoring under the microscope for
optimal stain development.
3. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS followed by distilled water.
H. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water and then distilled water.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and
clear in xylene.
I. Mounting and Coverslipping
1. Apply a suitable mounting medium.
2. Cover tissue sections with glass coverslips.
J. Quantitative Analysis
1. Examine stained slides under a light microscope.
2. Identify and count the number of positively stained (brown)
nuclei and total nuclei in representative fields.
3. Calculate the KI-67 labeling index as the percentage of
positively stained nuclei out of the total number of nuclei.
4. Document results and take digital images for records.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining to ensure staining specificity and sensitivity.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Validate staining results by comparing with known positive and
negative controls.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the percentage of KI-67 positive cells.
• Include any relevant observations or deviations in the report.
• Pathologists will review and sign off on the final report.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Pathologist to provide specific cut-off values or interpretative
criteria based on current clinical guidelines and literature.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Unsatisfactory staining: Verify reagent quality, review antigen
retrieval steps, and check incubation times.
• High background staining: Ensure thorough washing steps and
verify blocking steps.
• Inconsistent results: Reassess control slides and repeat staining if
necessary.
