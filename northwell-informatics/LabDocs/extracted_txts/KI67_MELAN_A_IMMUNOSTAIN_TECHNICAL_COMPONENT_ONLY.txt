Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: KI67 +
MELAN A Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and precise preparation, staining, and analysis of
KI67 + MELAN A immunostain on tissue specimens in accordance
with standardized laboratory procedures.
Responsibility: Designated staff, including technologists and
pathologists, are responsible for performing and documenting
procedures related to KI67 + MELAN A immunostaining.
2. DEFINITION
KI67 is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation, often
used in cancer diagnostics. MELAN A (Mart-1) is a marker useful in
identifying melanocytes and associated tumors.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
• Acceptable specimen: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Unacceptable specimens: Tissue sections that are not properly
fixed, damaged, or insufficiently processed.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Primary Antibodies: KI67 (clone MIB-1), MELAN A (clone A103)
• Secondary Antibody: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
• Detection Systems: DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit.
• Ancillary Reagents: PBS, antigen retrieval buffers, mounting
media, coverslips.
• Equipment: Microtome, water bath, staining jars, microscope.
Staining Procedure:
A) Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 1. Prepare tissue sections (4-5
microns thick) on charged glass slides. 2. Deparaffinize sections in
xylene for 3 x 5 minutes. 3. Rehydrate sections through graded
ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each. 4. Rinse sections in
distilled water for 2 minutes.
B) Antigen Retrieval: 5. Heat slides in antigen retrieval buffer (e.g.,
citrate buffer pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker or microwave. 6. Allow
slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature. 7. Rinse slides in
PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
C) Blocking: 8. Apply blocking solution (5% BSA or serum-free
protein blocking agent) for 20 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
9. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
D) Primary Antibody Application: 10. Incubate slides with diluted KI67
primary antibody (according to manufacturer’s instructions) for 1 hour
at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. 11. Rinse slides in PBS for
2 x 5 minutes. 12. Incubate slides with diluted MELAN A primary
antibody for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. 13.
Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
E) Secondary Antibody Application: 14. Apply HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody (according to manufacturer’s instructions) for 30
minutes at room temperature. 15. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5
minutes.
F) Detection and Visualization: 16. Incubate slides in DAB substrate
solution for 5-10 minutes, monitoring the development of brown
staining. 17. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes. 18. Counterstain with
hematoxylin for 1 minute. 19. Rinse, dehydrate through graded
ethanol, clear in xylene and mount with coverslip using appropriate
mounting media.
Quality Control: 20. Include positive control slides for each run to
ensure staining quality. 21. Include negative control slides (without
primary antibody) to check for non-specific binding. 22. Document all
slides and reagents used in the run.
Reporting Results: 23. Document the staining results in the
laboratory information system (LIS). 24. Confirm the adequacy of
staining before reporting analysis results. 25. Ensure the results align
with expected controls and quality thresholds. 26. Forward stained
slides to the pathologist for evaluation and interpretation.
Reference Intervals: - KI67: % positive staining cells for Ki67, varies
depending on tissue type. - MELAN A: Presence of specific staining
in melanocytes
Method Limitations: - False positives or negatives due to improper
tissue processing, inconsistent reagent lot, or incorrect antibody
dilution. - Refer to product inserts for individual reagent limitations.

Proceed according to the established protocols, and ensure thorough
documentation and communication with a supervisor if issues arise
during the staining process.
