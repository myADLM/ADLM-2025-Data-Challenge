STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR KIDNEY BEAN
(RED) IgE, SERUM ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures required for the accurate
measurement and reporting of Kidney Bean (Red) IgE in serum
samples using ImmunoCAP technology (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to the analytical phase of testing
carried out in a CLIA-certified medical laboratory, ensuring all
steps are followed for quality results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analysis according to this SOP,
ensuring all quality control measures are followed, proper
documentation is maintained, and results are reported
appropriately.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ImmunoCAP 250 Instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
• ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Reagent for Kidney Bean (Red)
(Thermo Fisher Scientific)
• Calibrators and Controls (Low, Medium, High)
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Storage: Reagents and kits should be stored at recommended
temperatures specified by the manufacturer (typically 2-8°C).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Acceptable
Specimens:
• Human serum sample, collected following venipuncture.
• Preferred volume: Minimum 1 mL serum.
• Samples should be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and visible
particulate matter.
Stability:
• Serum samples must be stored at 2-8 °C and analyzed within 7
days of collection.
• If the analysis is delayed beyond 7 days, samples should be
stored at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens compromised due to incorrect collection, transport,
visible contamination, or delays in processing beyond specified
stability.
1. PROCEDURE Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, calibrators, and controls to room temperature
(15-25°C).
• Ensure the ImmunoCAP 250 instrument is calibrated and has
passed routine maintenance checks.
• Verify the integrity of the reagent kit (unexpired and stored
correctly).
Execution:
• Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes if
particulate matter is visible.
• Load the required volume of serum sample, calibrators, and
controls into the appropriate wells of the ImmunoCAP tray.
• Follow on-screen instructions to complete the loading of the
instrument.
• Start the run ensuring all patient information is correctly input into
the system.
Quality Control:
• Analyze Low, Medium, and High controls along with patient
samples in each run.
• Verify the control measurements fall within the acceptable range
before proceeding with patient sample results.
Reporting Results:
• Review the results generated by the ImmunoCAP 250 instrument.
• Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification.
• Results outside the reference interval should be flagged for
review.
• Report results in kU/L according to the following classification:
◦ Class 0: < 0.35 kU/L
◦ Class 1: 0.35 – 0.70 kU/L
◦ Class 2: 0.71 – 3.50 kU/L
◦ Class 3: 3.51 – 17.5 kU/L
◦ Class 4: 17.6 – 50.0 kU/L
◦ Class 5: 50.1 – 100 kU/L
◦ Class 6: > 100 kU/L
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgE (kU/L): < 0.35 kU/L (negative indicating no significant
sensitization)
• The results must be interpreted by qualified personnel in
conjunction with clinical findings and patient history.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the ImmunoCAP
250 as specified.
• If controls fall outside the acceptable range, re-run the assay and
check for potential issues such as improper reagent storage,
pipetting errors, or instrument malfunction.
• Document any troubleshooting steps undertaken and inform the
supervisor.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Ensure all results and QC data are accurately documented in LIS.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates,
instrument calibration logs, and maintenance schedules.
