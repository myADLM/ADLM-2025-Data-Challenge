Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Kidney Stone Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure standardized, accurate, and
precise analyses of kidney stones in the laboratory. This SOP
outlines the procedures to be followed in the analytical phase for
correct identification and quantification of chemical components
present in kidney stones after they have been collected, received,
and accessioned.
Responsibility:
Designated staff including laboratory scientists and technologists are
responsible for carrying out the procedures outlined in this document,
ensuring quality control processes are followed and results are
accurately reported.
2. DEFINITION
Kidney stone analysis refers to the chemical analysis of calculi or
stones from the kidney to determine their composition, which aids in
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of future kidney stones.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 Pre-Analytical Considerations:
• Ensure stones received have been properly cleaned and dried
• Check all specimens for proper labeling with patient ID and
accession number
• Inspect stones visually to document size, color, shape, and
texture
3.2 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Analytical balance
• Mortar and pestle
• Nitric acid
• Hydrochloric acid
• Qualitative test kits for component identification (e.g., calcium,
oxalate, uric acid, cystine, phosphate)
• Spectrophotometer (optional per laboratory capacity)
• Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), if available
• Gloves, lab coat, face shield, and other personal protective
equipment (PPE)
• pH strips and distilled water
3.3 Analytical Procedure:
A) Sample Preparation:
• Record weight and dimensions of each stone. Use analytical
balance for precise measurement.
• Crush a portion of each stone using a mortar and pestle to a fine
powder to ensure homogeneity.
B) Wet Chemical Analysis:
1. Calcium Test:
◦ Dissolve a portion of powder in 1mL of diluted hydrochloric
acid.
◦ Follow the qualitative test kit instructions specific to calcium
detection.
◦ Document the presence or absence of calcium.
2. Oxalate Test:
◦ Dissolve a portion of powder in nitric acid and heat the
solution.
◦ Use the qualitative test kit for oxalate as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Record observations.
3. Uric Acid Test:
◦ Conduct an ammonium molybdate test with stones finely
powdered and react with the test reagent.
◦ Observe potential color change indicative of uric acid
presence.
4. Cystine Test:
◦ Dissolve powdered stone in 1mL of hydrochloric acid.
◦ Follow cystine test kit protocol.
◦ Note results.
5. Phosphate Test:
◦ Dissolve a portion of the powder in nitric acid.
◦ Conduct phosphate analysis using test strips or reagent kits.
◦ Record the results.
C) Instrumental Analysis:
1. Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR):
◦ Prepare sample by pressing roughly 1-2 mg of powder in a
potassium bromide (KBr) pellet.
◦ Scan the pellet using the FTIR instrument calibrated for
kidney stone analysis.
◦ Compare the spectra against reference spectral library for
identification.
◦ Note and document stone composition by primary and
secondary components.
2. Spectrophotometry:
◦ When applicable, dissolve powder in recommended
solvents.
◦ Measure absorbance of prepared solution according to
specific element/compound absorption spectra.
◦ Compare data to standard curves for quantification.
3.4 Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of analysis to
ensure accuracy.
• Perform instrument calibration checks regularly.
• Document all control results and ensure they are within
acceptable limits before reporting patient test results.
3.5 Reporting Results:
• Compile all data and confirm findings with the primary analyzer
and one additional technologist for inter-laboratory verification.
• Enter results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Interpret results referencing the normal and abnormal ranges,
providing comprehensive reports to the requesting physician.
• Critical findings (e.g., presence of cystine, high calcium) should
be documented and immediately reported to the supervising
pathologist and/or attending physician.
4. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves, lab coat, safety glasses/face shield when
handling kidney stones and chemicals.
• Follow proper waste disposal protocols for any hazardous
chemicals.
• Ensure proper training on handling acids and other reagents is
provided.
