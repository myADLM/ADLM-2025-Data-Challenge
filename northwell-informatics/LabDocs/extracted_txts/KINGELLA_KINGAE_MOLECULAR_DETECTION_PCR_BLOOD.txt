Standard Operating Procedure: KINGELLA KINGAE,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the molecular detection of
Kingella kingae in clinical blood specimens using PCR (Polymerase
Chain Reaction). This protocol ensures accurate and reproducible
results while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the
analytical process.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the PCR analysis according to this protocol. All deviations and any
issues encountered during the procedure should be promptly
reported to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Kingella kingae: A Gram-negative bacterium commonly associated
with osteoarticular infections in young children. Detection is crucial
for timely diagnosis and treatment.
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A molecular technique used to
amplify and detect specific DNA sequences from the pathogen.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Blood
• Collection Container: EDTA or Sterile blood collection tubes
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Transport: Specimens must be transported to the laboratory
immediately at 2-8°C.
• Storage: If not processed immediately, specimens may be stored
at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• DNA Extraction Kit (validated for use with blood specimens)
• PCR Master Mix containing:
◦ Primers specific for Kingella kingae
◦ Taq DNA Polymerase
◦ dNTPs
◦ Buffer solution
• Positive Control: DNA known to contain Kingella kingae
• Negative Control: Nuclease-free water
• Micropipettes and sterile, DNase/RNase-free pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Sterile PCR tubes or microplates
• Laboratory-approved disinfectants
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Preliminary steps:
◦ Ensure all materials and equipment are clean and
disinfected.
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Isolation of DNA:
◦ Follow the DNA Extraction Kit instructions to extract DNA
from the blood specimen.
◦ Ensure complete lysis of cells for maximum yield.
◦ Elute the DNA in nuclease-free water or elution buffer
provided in the kit.
◦ Quantitate DNA and store at -20°C if not used immediately.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Preparation of PCR Controls:
◦ Prepare a positive control using the known Kingella kingae
DNA.
◦ Prepare a negative control using nuclease-free water.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Thaw PCR reagents on ice and gently mix by pipetting up
and down.
◦ Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions, including all necessary
components (primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs, and buffer).
◦ Aliquot the PCR Master Mix into sterile PCR tubes or a PCR
microplate.
◦ Add extracted DNA (template) samples, positive control, and
negative control to the assigned tubes/wells.
◦ Mix gently and briefly centrifuge to ensure all liquid is at the
bottom of the tube/well.
3. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Program the thermal cycler as follows:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Place the tubes or plate in the thermal cycler and start the
run.
C) Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare a 1-2% agarose gel with an appropriate nucleic
acid stain (e.g., ethidium bromide).
◦ Load the PCR products, along with a DNA ladder, into the
gel wells.
◦ Run the gel at 100-120V until the dye front moves an
adequate distance.
◦ Visualize the bands using a UV transilluminator or gel
documentation system.
2. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Compare the amplification products to the positive control
and DNA ladder.
◦ A positive result for Kingella kingae will show a band at the
expected size.
◦ Absence of a corresponding band in the negative control
confirms no contamination.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
• Document all control results and take corrective actions if controls
fail to perform as expected.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive and negative results should be reviewed by a qualified
technologist.
• Results should be reported following laboratory guidelines,
ensuring timely and accurate communication to the requesting
physician.
1. REFERENCE
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA Extraction Kit and PCR
reagents.
• Relevant scientific literature for Kingella kingae PCR detection.
Note: Proper laboratory safety and contamination control
protocols must always be followed.
