Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase
KINGELLA KINGAE, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the molecular detection of Kingella
kingae via PCR, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
This SOP is intended for trained laboratory personnel responsible for
performing PCR-based molecular testing. It is the responsibility of the
lab personnel to follow this SOP rigorously to ensure the quality and
accuracy of the results. Any deviations, deficiencies, or issues must
be reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
Kingella kingae: A bacterium that is an important cause of infections
in children, such as osteoarticular infections, bacteremia, and
endocarditis.
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A molecular technique used to
amplify and detect DNA sequences.
Verification/Validation: Ensuring equipment, reagents, and processes
are functioning correctly and producing reliable results.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System or
equivalent.
• Kingella kingae-specific primers and probes.
• Nucleic acid extraction kits (Qiagen or equivalent).
• PCR master mix (containing Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2).
• Molecular grade water.
• Positive and negative controls.
• Microcentrifuge tubes.
• Pipette tips with aerosol barriers.
• PCR plates and adhesive film.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Thermal cycler.
Steps:
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the specimen has been properly collected, labeled, and
accessioned.
2. Proceed with nucleic acid extraction using the appropriate
extraction kit. a. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for sample
processing. b. Elute the extracted nucleic acid in the
recommended buffer and store at −20°C until ready for PCR.
B. PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. a. Include Kingella kingae-specific primers and
probes.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR plates.
3. Add the extracted nucleic acid samples into the wells containing
the PCR master mix.
4. Include positive control (DNA known to contain Kingella kingae)
and negative control (molecular grade water).
C. PCR Amplification
1. Seal the PCR plate with adhesive film.
2. Place the plate into the real-time PCR detection system.
3. Set up the thermal cycling conditions: a. Initial denaturation:
95°C for 5 minutes. b. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds. c.
Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute. d. Repeat steps b and
c for 40 cycles.
D. Data Analysis
1. After the PCR run, analyze the amplification data using the
associated software. a. Verify the amplification curve to
determine the presence of Kingella kingae DNA. b. Compare
the samples to the positive and negative controls for validation.
E. Documentation
1. Record all data in the laboratory’s PCR log, including sample
IDs, controls, and amplification results.
2. Review and verify results by the technologist.
3. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) in
accordance with site-specific guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform a minimum of one positive and one negative control for
each PCR run.
• Use calibrated equipment for pipetting and amplification.
• Verify reagents are within expiry dates and store as per
manufacturer recommendations.
• Bi-Weekly: Compare results of known positive and negative
controls to assess consistency.
• Monthly: Validate equipment performance and reagent efficiency
using documented procedures.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for entering results into the
LIS. Critical values must be communicated to the relevant clinical
personnel immediately.
