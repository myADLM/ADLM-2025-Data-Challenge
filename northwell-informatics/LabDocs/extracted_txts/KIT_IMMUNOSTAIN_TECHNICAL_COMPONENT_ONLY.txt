Analytical Phase: KIT Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. Purpose: To establish a standardized procedure for the
processing and staining of slides using the KIT immunostain
technique, ensuring consistent and reliable results for
diagnostic interpretation.
2. Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists and histotechnicians are responsible for
carrying out the staining procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP and ensuring the accuracy and precision of staining
procedures.
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Slides should be cut to a thickness of 3-4 microns.
• Ensure the sections are placed on positively charged or coated
slides for optimal tissue adhesion.
1. Reagents and Supplies:
• Primary antibody: Anti-KIT antibody.
• Detection system: EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB).
• Microscope slides.
• Cover glass.
• Xylene.
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%).
• Deionized water.
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC) buffers (e.g., PBS).
• Antigen retrieval solution (Citrate buffer or EDTA).
• Hematoxylin.
• Mounting medium.
1. Equipment:
• Automated IHC stainer or Manual staining setup.
• Water bath.
• Incubator.
• Brightfield microscope.
• Microtome.
1. Procedure: A. Slide Preparation:
• Bake FFPE tissue sections on slides in an oven at 60°C for 1
hour.
• Deparaffinize slides in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
• Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
70%, 5 minutes each).
• Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
• Preheat retrieval solution to 95-99°C in a water bath.
• Immerse slides in the preheated antigen retrieval solution for 20
minutes.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse in PBS or appropriate IHC buffer (3 changes, 5 minutes
each).
C. Blocking:
• Incubate sections with blocking solution (e.g., normal serum or
protein block) for 10 minutes at room temperature.
• Drain excess solution, do not rinse.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply diluted primary anti-KIT antibody to sections.
• Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature or follow the
manufacturer's recommended incubation time.
• Rinse in PBS or IHC buffer (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
E. Detection System:
• Apply secondary antibody (part of the EnVision+ System or
equivalent HRP detection system).
• Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse in PBS or IHC buffer (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
• Apply chromogen (DAB) and incubate until brown color develops
(typically 5-10 minutes, monitor visually).
• Rinse slides in deionized water to stop the reaction.
F. Counterstaining:
• Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse thoroughly in deionized water.
• Blue slides in ammonium hydroxide or tap water for a few
seconds to enhance contrast.
G. Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%, 2 minutes each).
• Clear in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
• Apply cover glass with mounting medium.
1. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Verify that the staining quality of the controls is appropriate before
reporting patient results.
1. Reporting Results:
• Slides are reviewed under a brightfield microscope.
• Technical components only; the results are to be interpreted by a
pathologist or designated medical professional.
• Document and record any procedural anomalies and corrective
actions taken.
1. References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the anti-KIT antibody and detection
system.
• Current immunohistochemistry guidelines and literature.
1. Safety and Troubleshooting:
• Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling biological
specimens and reagents.
• If staining issues arise (e.g., weak signal, nonspecific staining),
review antigen retrieval steps, antibody dilutions, and incubation
times, and consult quality control checks.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
accurate and reproducible results necessary for the diagnostic
interpretation of KIT immunostaining.
