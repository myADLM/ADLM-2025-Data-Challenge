Analysis, Quantitative (Analytical Phase)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of the KIT P.ASP816VAL Variant Analysis, Quantitative test,
ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis, documentation, and verification of results as specified in
this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol and for addressing any issues that arise during the
procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
• KIT P.ASP816VAL: A specific variant in the KIT gene associated
with certain hematologic malignancies.
• Quantitative Analysis: Measuring the amount of variant present
in the sample.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Real-Time PCR instrument
◦ Laboratory microcentrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents:
◦ KIT P.ASP816VAL-specific primers and probes
◦ Taq polymerase and master mix
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Extraction kits for nucleic acids (validated for the specific
sample type)
• Supplies:
◦ PCR plates/tubes
◦ Optical adhesive covers
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Accepted Specimens: Blood, bone marrow aspirates, or other
validated sample types.
• Collection: Follow standard procedures for sample collection and
labeling.
• Storage: Store samples at 2-8°C for short-term storage or -80°C
for long-term storage.
• Preparation: Extract nucleic acids using validated extraction kits.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the nucleic acid
extraction kit.
2. Ensure the integrity and quantity of nucleic acid.
3. Store extracted nucleic acids at -20°C until processed.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice.
◦ Vortex and briefly centrifuge reagents before use.
2. Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Prepare a master mix according to the reaction volume and
number of samples, including controls.
◦ Typical components may include: Taq polymerase, dNTPs,
buffer, primers, probes, and nuclease-free water.
3. Plate Setup:
◦ Add the master mix to each well of the PCR plate/tube.
◦ Add the extracted nucleic acid to each well.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Seal the plate/tube with appropriate covers.
4. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Program the Real-Time PCR instrument with the specific
cycling conditions for the KIT P.ASP816VAL assay.
◦ Typical thermal cycling conditions include initial
denaturation, followed by 35-40 cycles of denaturation,
annealing, and extension.
C. Data Acquisition and Analysis:
1. Run the PCR:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the Real-Time PCR instrument.
◦ Start the run as per the software instructions.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the amplification plots and determine the
quantitative value using the instrument's software.
◦ Compare sample data with the standard curve generated
from the positive control.
3. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
• Perform internal quality controls as specified.
• Validate new reagent lots and any new equipment before use.
• Document all quality control measures and deviations.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Review Ct values and ensure they fall within the expected
range for both positive and negative controls.
◦ Confirm that the negative control does not show
amplification.
◦ Calculate the variant quantification based on the standard
curve.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Enter the quantitative results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Verify results are within the reportable range.
◦ Include any relevant comments or interpretations.
4. Critical Results:
◦ Follow institutional policy for reporting critical results.
5. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of each analytical run, including:
◦ Sample identification
◦ Reagent lot numbers
◦ Instrument ID
◦ Results and any deviations or issues encountered
