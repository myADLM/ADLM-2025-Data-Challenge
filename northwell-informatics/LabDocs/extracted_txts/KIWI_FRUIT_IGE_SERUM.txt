Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for KIWI FRUIT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to provide accurate and reliable
processing and analysis of serum samples for the detection of
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to kiwi fruit allergen. This protocol
ensures consistency, accuracy, and compliance with laboratory
standards and regulations.
2. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
◦ 3-5 mL of serum obtained from a properly collected blood
sample using a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Centrifuge the specimen within 2 hours of collection to
separate the serum. Store serum at 2-8°C if testing is to be
performed within 7 days; otherwise, freeze at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
◦ Specimens received in non-serum separator tubes (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
◦ Specimens that have not been properly labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP
250)
• IgE Calibration Standards
• IgE Control Materials (Negative and Positive Controls)
• Specific allergen reagent kits for kiwi fruit (e.g., ImmunoCAP
specific IgE KIWI FRUIT)
• Disposable pipettes and tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
safety goggles
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C) and freezer storage (-20°C or below)
4. PROCEDURE:
Preparation and Setup:
1. Calibration and Control:
◦ Perform instrument calibration using IgE calibration
standards according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Run quality control samples (negative and positive controls)
to ensure the analyzer is functioning correctly. Record all
results in the QC log.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature if
necessary.
◦ Mix each serum sample gently by inversion before use.
◦ Load properly labeled serum samples into the sample rack
of the immunoassay analyzer.
Running Test:
1. Loading Reagents:
◦ Verify that the specific allergen reagent kit (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP specific IgE KIWI FRUIT) is within the
expiration date.
◦ Load reagent cartridges into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Program the analyzer with the required test parameters for
KIWI FRUIT specific IgE.
◦ Initiate the run cycle and ensure the analyzer processes
each sample according to the predefined protocol.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any errors or interruptions during
the run. Take appropriate corrective actions as per the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
Result Interpretation:
1. Result Validation:
◦ After the run, retrieve the results from the analyzer.
◦ Validate results by comparing control values to the
acceptable range mentioned in the control material package
insert.
◦ Any deviation in control results should prompt a re-
evaluation of the analyte results.
2. Reporting:
◦ Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Results should include:
▪ Patient identification
▪ Test performed (KIWI FRUIT specific IgE)
▪ Result in kUA/L
▪ Reference interval: <0.35 kUA/L (considered negative)
◦ Notify the clinician of any critical or unexpected results
following laboratory protocols.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure that each batch run includes both positive and negative
controls.
• Perform instrument maintenance and cleaning as per the
manufacturer's schedule.
• Record all maintenance activities and any corrective actions taken
in the maintenance log.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability of test results.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• This test is specific for detecting IgE antibodies to kiwi fruit
allergen. Cross-reactivity with other allergens may occur and
should be interpreted in clinical context.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the accuracy of
results.
