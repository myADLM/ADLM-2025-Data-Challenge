Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Known 45,X Mosaicism Reflex Analysis using Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) on Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for
performing reflex analysis for known 45,X mosaicism using
FISH on whole blood samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
the FISH analysis and generating accurate and reproducible
results. All laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this
SOP, ensuring proper handling of specimens and
documentation of results.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Whole blood collected in heparin or EDTA anticoagulant.
Specimen must be kept at room temperature and should be
processed within 48 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving beyond 48 hours after collection.
• Specimens arriving without collection date/time indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence Microscope
• Incubator
• FISH probes specific for chromosome X centromere and
chromosome Y regions
• Hybridization chamber
• Wash buffers
• Counterstaining reagents (DAPI)
• Pipettes
• Glass slides
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Specimen
1. Label the specimen and document receipt in the
laboratory.
2. Verify specimen suitability and log any unacceptable
conditions following internal policies.
B. Cell Culture and Harvesting
1. Set up whole blood cultures according to laboratory protocol. 2.
Incubate the cultures for 72 hours at suitable conditions. 3. Stop the
culture with colcemid and prepare for cell harvesting. 4. Perform
hypotonic treatment and fixation of cells.
C. Slide Preparation and Hybridization
1. Prepare glass slides with metaphase spreads. 2. Apply the specific
FISH probes to the slides and cover with a coverslip. 3. Place slides
in a hybridization chamber and follow the probe hybridization
protocol. 4. Wash slides to remove unbound probes and counterstain
with DAPI.
D. Microscopy and Analysis
1. Examine slides under the fluorescence microscope. 2. Count 200
metaphases and record the number of cells with the 45,X signal
pattern versus normal signal patterns. 3. Verify the presence of
mosaicism according to the criteria established.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch.
◦ Verify proper hybridization signal for control slides before
analyzing patient samples.
◦ Document the QC results and take corrective action if
controls fail.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Document the findings thoroughly, including the percentage
of cells showing the 45,X signal pattern.
◦ Generate a laboratory report following site-specific
guidelines, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
◦ Include any limitations or discrepancies in the analysis.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal interval: Absence of mosaicism (0% cells showing 45,X
pattern).
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the FISH probe package insert for specific limitations
concerning cross-reactivity, background noise, and
hybridization efficiency.
5. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
◦ Maintain logs for specimen reception, slide preparation,
hybridization, analysis, and QC results.
◦ Archive all records according to laboratory protocols.
