1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
preparation, examination, and interpretation of Potassium
Hydroxide (KOH) preparations for detecting fungal elements in
clinical specimens.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
preparing, examining, and reporting KOH preparations. All personnel
must adhere to this protocol to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT Acceptable specimens:
• Skin scrapings
• Nail clippings
• Hair specimens
• Other relevant clinical samples as requested by the ordering
physician
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens that are dry, contaminated, or improperly labeled
• Specimens not delivered to the laboratory within specified time
limits for viability (not to exceed 24 hours post-collection if
refrigerated, or according to specific specimen requirement
parameters)
1. KIT/EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• KOH solution, 10-20% concentration
• Glass slides and cover slips
• Forceps, scalpel, and other collection tools
• Inoculating loop or sterile applicator sticks
• Microscope with 10x and 40x objectives
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Labels and requisition forms
1. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Preparation
2. Ensure proper identification of sample, ensuring it matches the
requisition form.
3. Transfer a small amount of specimen to a clean glass slide
using forceps or a sterile applicator stick.
4. Add 1-2 drops of KOH solution (10-20%) directly onto the
specimen on the slide.
5. Gently place a cover slip over the specimen, avoiding bubbles.
B. Incubation and Clearing Time
1. Allow the preparation to stand at room temperature for
approximately 15-30 minutes to let the KOH clear the
keratinized material around the fungal elements. For thicker
specimens, enhance clearing by gently warming the slide over
a low heat source (e.g., flame or hot plate) or incubate at 37°C.
C. Microscopy Examination
1. Place the slide on the stage of the microscope and focus using
the 10x objective.
2. Perform a comprehensive scan over the entire preparation
looking for evidence of fungal elements.
3. Switch to 40x objective for better resolution as needed.
4. Identify and note the presence of hyphae, pseudohyphae, yeast
cells, or other fungal structures.
D. Reporting and Interpretation
1. Document the findings on the laboratory report form, specifying
whether fungal elements were observed or not observed.
2. Use the following terminology:
◦ Positive: Presence of fungal elements (specify type if
identifiable)
◦ Negative: No fungal elements observed
3. Include any relevant observations, such as the number and
types of fungal structures observed.
4. Sign and date the completed laboratory report form for
verification.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Regularly verify the concentration and effectiveness of KOH
solution.
• Conduct bi-weekly or monthly quality control checks by testing
known positive and negative samples.
• All microscopes should undergo routine maintenance and
calibration checks.
• Include proper documentation for quality control checks and any
corrective actions taken.
1. SAFETY AND BIOSAFETY
• Follow appropriate biosafety and infection control protocols,
including the use of PPE.
• Discard used slides and cover slips in a biohazard container.
• Ensure proper hand hygiene and surface disinfection protocols
are followed after handling specimens.
1. LIMITATIONS
• KOH preparations may lack sensitivity; therefore, false-negative
results are possible.
• The presence of excess debris or inadequate specimen clearing
may hinder visualization.
• The procedure does not differentiate between fungal species;
additional identification techniques may be required.
