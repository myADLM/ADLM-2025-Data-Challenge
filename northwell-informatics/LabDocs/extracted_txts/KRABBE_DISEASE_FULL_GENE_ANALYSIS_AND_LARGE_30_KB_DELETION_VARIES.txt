Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for KRABBE DISEASE,
FULL GENE ANALYSIS AND LARGE (30 KB) DELETION, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed instructions for
the full gene analysis and detection of large (30 kb) deletions in the
GALC gene for diagnosing Krabbe disease. This SOP ensures that
consistent and accurate results are obtained for all patient samples.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated staff to perform the
analysis following this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure
adherence to the protocol and to take corrective actions when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood: 5-10 mL collected in an EDTA (lavender top)
tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples not collected in EDTA tubes.
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens.
• Specimens stored at incorrect temperatures or transported
inappropriately.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 24-48 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours.
• Frozen: Unacceptable, as freeze-thaw cycles may degrade
nucleic acids.

1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Obtain the patient’s blood sample.
2. Perform DNA extraction using a commercially available DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
4. Document the DNA concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio)
in the laboratory notebook.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Full Gene Amplification:
◦ Design specific primers to cover the entire GALC gene.
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix containing DNA, primers,
dNTPs, and a suitable polymerase.
◦ Load the reaction mix into a PCR thermal cycler.
◦ Perform initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Conduct 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Annealing at the optimized temperature for 30 seconds.
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Store PCR products at 4°C until further analysis.
2. Large Deletion Detection:
◦ Design primers flanking the 30 kb deletion region.
◦ Prepare and run PCR reaction as described above.
◦ Resolve PCR products on an agarose gel to identify the
presence of large deletions.
◦ Confirm results using qPCR or another appropriate method
if necessary.
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with an appropriate gel stain.
2. Load the PCR products and a DNA ladder onto the gel.
3. Run the gel at 100-120 V for sufficient time to resolve the
bands.
4. Visualize the bands under UV light and document the results
with a gel imaging system.
D) Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Subject purified DNA to capillary electrophoresis or NGS as per
the laboratory protocol.
3. Analyze the sequencing data using bioinformatics tools to
identify mutations, insertions, deletions, or any large deletions
up to 30 kb in the GALC gene.
4. Compare results to reference sequences and databases for
annotation of detected variants.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and review the sequencing and deletion analysis data.
• Interpret the findings based on database references and clinical
significance.
• Generate a comprehensive report including detected mutations,
deletions, and their potential clinical implications.
• Verify and validate the report by a designated supervisor before
issuance.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure accurate transcription.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing run.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment used in the
analysis.
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly intra-lab comparisons and
validations according to established protocols.
• Monitor QC results and troubleshoot any drift or abnormalities.
1. REFERENCES
• GALC gene information and mutation database.
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction, PCR amplification,
and sequencing kits.
• Relevant literature and guidelines on Krabbe disease genetic
testing.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain detailed records of all assays, reagent lot numbers,
specimen handling, and data analysis.
• Ensure all logs and documents comply with CLIA requirements
and are readily accessible for audits.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Address PCR amplification failures by reviewing primer design
and DNA quality.
• Resolve sequencing issues by confirming sequencing reaction
setup and DNA purity.
• Consult with a senior technologist or laboratory supervisor for
complex or repeated issues.
This SOP provides the framework for consistent and validated
analysis for Krabbe disease, ensuring accuracy and reliability in
patient diagnostics. Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all
personnel involved in the testing process.
