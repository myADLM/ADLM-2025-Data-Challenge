Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for KRAS Somatic
Mutation Analysis in Peritoneal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for generating results for KRAS
somatic mutation analysis in peritoneal fluid specimens. The purpose
is to ensure accurate and reliable detection of KRAS mutations using
appropriate molecular techniques.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
KRAS mutation analysis according to this SOP, ensuring the
accuracy and reliability of the results, documenting all procedures,
and taking corrective action when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Peritoneal fluid collected aseptically using standard procedures.
• Specimens should be sent to the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection or stored at 4°C if transport times exceed 2 hours.
• Minimum volume required: 10 mL peritoneal fluid.
3.2. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 24 hours after
collection.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens contaminated with blood clots or other impurities.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents (primers, master mix)
• Thermal cycler
• KRAS mutation detection kit (e.g., Roche cobas KRAS Mutation
Test)
• Capillary electrophoresis equipment (e.g., ABI Prism 310 Genetic
Analyzer)
• Peritoneal fluid container (sterile)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation:
1. Document specimen receipt, including time, date, and
condition.
2. Centrifuge peritoneal fluid at 2000 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer supernatant to a clean tube and discard precipitate.
4. Use an appropriate protocol for DNA extraction from the
supernatant.
5.2 DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for the DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer and assess the purity
(A260/A280 ratio should be between 1.8 and 2.0).
3. Document DNA concentration and purity.
5.3 PCR Amplification:
1. Set up PCR reactions using specific primers for KRAS
mutations.
2. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Include appropriate positive and negative controls.
4. Run PCR with the following cycling parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes (35 cycles)
5.4 Mutation Detection:
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR clean-up method.
2. Perform mutation analysis using appropriate KRAS mutation
detection kits and follow the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Analyse using capillary electrophoresis equipment.
5.5 Results Interpretation:
1. Evaluate electropherograms for presence of KRAS mutations.
2. Document mutation status (wild type or mutant) and specify
type of mutation detected.
3. Verify and validate results according to laboratory protocols.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Material:
• Use KRAS positive control sample and wild type control in each
PCR run.
• Include an extraction blank to monitor for contamination.
6.2 Procedures:
• Validate each new batch of reagents and primers.
• Document all control results and take corrective actions for any
deviations outside acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Results Documentation:
• Input results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure technologist review and verification of results.
7.2 Critical Results:
• Notify the appropriate clinician of any positive mutation findings
immediately.
• Document the notification in the LIS.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• KRAS mutation results are reported as either "Wild Type" or
"Mutant" specifying the identified mutation (e.g., G12D, G12V,
etc.).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the product insert for individual reagent limitations and
mutation detection accuracy.
