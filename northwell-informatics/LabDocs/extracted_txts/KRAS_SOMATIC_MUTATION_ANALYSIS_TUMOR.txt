KRAS Somatic Mutation Analysis, Tumor - Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for analyzing KRAS
somatic mutations in tumor samples using PCR and
sequencing methods.
Responsibility: All steps must be performed by trained personnel
certified in molecular pathology techniques. It is the responsibility of
all laboratory staff to identify any issues affecting the analysis and
report them to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue blocks or
unstained slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly fixed in formalin.
• Specimens with insufficient tumor content (<20% tumor cells).
• Specimens without proper identification or requisition forms.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (FFPE-specific)
• PCR reagents and primers specific for KRAS gene exons 2, 3,
and 4
• Thermocycler
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• PCR cleanup kit
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Sequencing analyzer (e.g., Sanger sequencer, Next Generation
Sequencer)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A. DNA Extraction:
2. De-paraffinize FFPE tissue sections by incubation in xylene,
followed by ethanol washes.
3. Use a tissue scraper to collect and place tissue in a
microcentrifuge tube.
4. Follow the protocol of the DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic
DNA from the microdissected tissue.
B. PCR Amplification of KRAS Gene:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Add primers specific to exons 2, 3, and 4 of the KRAS gene to
the master mix.
3. Add extracted DNA (50-100 ng) to each PCR reaction.
4. Run the PCR using the specified thermocycler conditions.
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare agarose gel and set up electrophoresis apparatus.
2. Load PCR products alongside a DNA ladder and run
electrophoresis.
3. Visualize bands under UV light to confirm successful
amplification.
D. PCR Cleanup:
1. Use a PCR cleanup kit to purify amplified DNA products as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
E. Sequencing:
1. Quantify purified PCR products using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
2. Prepare sequencing reactions using the purified PCR products
and specific KRAS primers.
3. Load reactions into sequencing analyzer and run per system-
specific guidelines (e.g., Sanger sequencing or NGS).
F. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze sequencing data using appropriate bioinformatics
tools.
2. Identify mutations in the KRAS gene by comparing sequences
to the reference KRAS sequence.
3. Validate significant mutations by re-sequencing if necessary.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing batch.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all instruments (e.g.,
thermocyclers, sequencers).
• Periodically verify the accuracy of sequencing results by external
proficiency testing.
1. REPORTING RESULTS A. Interpretation:
• Review sequencing data to identify known pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, and benign variants.
• Utilize curated databases and literature to classify novel variants.
B. Recording:
• Document results including the identified KRAS mutations, if any,
in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include control results and observed anomalies.
C. Review and Verification:
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a certified molecular
pathologist.
• Follow site-specific protocols for reporting and documenting
results.
• Communicate critical findings immediately to the clinician or
pathologist in charge.
1. REFERENCES
• Latest scientific literature and guidelines on KRAS Mutation
Analysis.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all reagents and equipment used.
• Laboratory’s Quality Assurance Manual.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL Follow institutional
guidelines for the disposal of hazardous materials, including
biological specimens, chemicals, and reagents. Ensure the use
of appropriate PPE during all procedures.
End of Protocol
This SOP provides a comprehensive framework for the analytical
phase of KRAS somatic mutation analysis in tumor samples. If there
are any deviations or challenges, they should be documented and
addressed following the institution's corrective action protocols.
