Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analysis of Labile
Bound Copper in Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the step-by-step procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for labile bound copper in serum samples. This
protocol ensures accurate and reliable measurements follow
standardized laboratory practices and comply with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for processing the
serum samples and performing the analysis according to this SOP.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a clot activator tube (red or gold
top).
• Alternate: Serum collected in a plasma separator tube (PST).
Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for 24 hours at room temperature
(15-25°C).
• Stable for 48 hours when refrigerated (2-8°C).
• For extended storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C
or below and are stable for up to 6 months.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• Centrifuge capable of at least 1000g.
• Atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) or Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).
• Laboratory glassware (volumetric flasks, pipettes, etc.).
• Water bath.
Reagents:
• Deionized water.
• Calibrated copper standards.
• Diluent or matrix modifier (e.g., ammonium acetate).
• Acidic solution for protein precipitation (e.g., trichloroacetic acid).
Supplies:
• Calibration curve materials.
• Quality control materials at two levels (normal and abnormal).
• Sample cups or tubes.
• Pipette tips.
1. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Upon receipt, inspect the serum sample.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1000g for 10 minutes to separate
serum from clot.
2. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Aliquot 200 µL of serum into a labeled test tube.
◦ Add 400 µL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to the serum
aliquot. This step precipitates serum proteins and releases
labile bound copper.
3. Centrifugation:
◦ Vortex the mixture briefly to mix thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 1500g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube, being careful
to avoid the precipitate.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Calibration Procedure:
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for calibrating the atomic
absorption spectrometer (AAS) or ICP-MS.
◦ Prepare a series of copper standards (e.g., 0.1 µg/L to 10
µg/L) using deionized water.
2. Generating Calibration Curve:
◦ Run each standard through the instrument.
◦ Construct a calibration curve by plotting the concentration of
standards against their respective absorbance or intensity
values.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Running Samples:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each
analytical batch.
◦ Analyze the prepared sample supernatants, recording the
absorbance or intensity for each.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include at least two levels of quality control materials
(normal and abnormal) within each batch.
◦ Verify that the QC results fall within the established
acceptable range. If they do not, investigate and resolve the
issue before proceeding.
3. Result Calculation:
◦ Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of
labile bound copper in each sample.
◦ Multiply the absorbance or intensity by the appropriate
calibration factor derived from the standards.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all sample information, including patient ID, sample
ID, preparation details, and results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure results are verified and appropriately flagged for any
critical or out-of-range values.
2. Verification:
◦ The technologist will review and verify the results before
they are transmitted to the LIS.
◦ All critical values must be communicated following the
laboratory's Critical Values Policy.
3. Quality Control and Method Limitations
A. Internal Quality Control:
• Perform daily quality control checks.
• Record QC data and review for any deviation from established
ranges.
B. External Proficiency Testing:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the analytical method.
Method Limitations:
• Be aware of potential interferences from hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus.
• Ensure proper handling and processing to avoid contamination or
degradation of serum samples.

ICP-MS.
