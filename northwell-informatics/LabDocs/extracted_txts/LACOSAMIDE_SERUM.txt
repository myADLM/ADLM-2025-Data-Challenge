Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating LACOSAMIDE, SERUM Results
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and efficient analysis of
Lacosamide in serum samples using High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC).
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform Lacosamide serum analysis within the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
as outlined in this SOP. Supervising personnel are responsible for
validating and ensuring that the procedures are correctly followed.
1. DEFINITIONS
Lacosamide: An antiepileptic drug used in the treatment of partial-
onset seizures. HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, a
technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and
quantify each component in a mixture.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• HPLC system with UV detector
• Analytical Balance
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Water Bath (optional, depending on specimen requirements)
• Glass vials
• Micropipettes and tips
• Lacosamide reference standard
• Mobile phase: Acetonitrile and water (70:30 v/v)
• Reagents: Methanol, Acetonitrile, Deionized water, Internal
standard solution (if applicable)
• Disposable gloves, laboratory coats, safety glasses
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Serum Collection:
• Collect blood samples in red-top tubes (no anticoagulant) or SST
tubes.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the blood tube at 2000-2500 rpm for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum into a properly labeled clean glass vial.
Storage:
• Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24
hours. For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Control Material:
• Include a known concentration of Lacosamide in the serum (high
and low) as quality controls. Storage:
• Store quality controls at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24 hours or
freeze for longer-term storage. Use:
• Include quality controls in each run of the HPLC analysis. If
controls are out of range, the run should be repeated, and
corrective measures must be taken.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and materials are at room temperature.
2. Prepare mobile phase by filtering and degassing the solution of
Acetonitrile and water (70:30 v/v).
3. Calibrate the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Prepare the Lacosamide standard and quality control solutions.
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow all serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. Pipette 500 µL of serum into a clean glass vial.
3. If using an internal standard, add a fixed volume of internal
standard solution to the serum sample and mix thoroughly.
4. Add 1 mL of methanol to precipitate proteins.
5. Vortex the mixture for 1-2 minutes.
6. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new clean vial and
evaporate to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas.
8. Reconstitute the residue in 200 µL of mobile phase.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Inject 20 µL of sample, standard, and quality control solutions
into the HPLC system.
2. Set the UV detector to a wavelength of 210 nm.
3. Run the HPLC system according to the program set for the
analysis of Lacosamide.
4. Analyze the peak areas and retention times to quantify
Lacosamide concentrations in the serum samples using the
standard calibration curve.
Post-Analytical:
1. Verify system suitability by ensuring the control samples fall
within the acceptable range.
2. Review and validate the results obtained.
3. Document any deviations or errors encountered during the
analysis and the corrective actions taken.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Report the serum Lacosamide concentration in µg/mL.
• Critical results must be reviewed by a clinical pathologist and
communicated to the requesting healthcare provider as per
laboratory guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC system.
• Specific kit inserts and method sheets.
• Relevant clinical and technical literature on Lacosamide serum
analysis.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete the HPLC Analysis Logbook with all pertinent
information, including date, time, sample identification,
technologist's initials, and any observations or deviations.
• Ensure that all run logs, quality control data, and calibration
curves are kept in the laboratory for the required retention period.

This protocol assumes that the reader has a fundamental
understanding of laboratory practices and the use of HPLC systems.
Adjustments and specific method validation steps may be needed
based on the laboratory's equipment, standards, and clinical
requirements.
