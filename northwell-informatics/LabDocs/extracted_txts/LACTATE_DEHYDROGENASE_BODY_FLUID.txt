1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures required in
the analytical phase of generating results for Lactate Dehydrogenase
(LDH) in body fluids. This includes specimen handling, equipment,
reagents, quality control, calibration, analytical procedures, and result
reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing LDH
testing according to this protocol. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any issues affecting test results and report them to the
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Preferred specimen types: Pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, synovial
fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and any other body fluid as
specified by the physician.
• Specimens must be collected aseptically and transported to the
laboratory in a sealed, sterile container.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination or particulate matter.
• Specimens collected in unsterile containers or showing signs of
leakage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
3.1 Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• LDH assay instrument (e.g., Roche Cobas c 702)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Test tubes and racks
3.2 Reagents:
• LDH reagent kit (e.g., Roche LDH reagent)
• Calibrators
• Quality control materials (Normal and abnormal control levels)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Handling:
• Upon receipt, verify that the specimen is correctly labeled with
patient identification, collection date, and time.
• If necessary, centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 rpm for 10
minutes to obtain a clear supernatant.
4.2 Calibration:
• Perform instrument calibration according to the manufacturer's
instructions using the provided calibrators.
• Ensure calibration results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with testing.
4.3 Quality Control:
• Perform quality control checks daily using normal and abnormal
control materials.
• Document QC results, and verify that they are within acceptable
ranges before analyzing patient specimens.
• Troubleshoot any QC failures according to established protocols.
4.4 Analytical Testing Procedure:
1. Prepare the LDH reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Set up the LDH assay instrument and ensure it is operating
correctly.
3. Select appropriate test settings for LDH analysis.
4. Pipette the body fluid specimen into the designated test wells.
5. Initiate the LDH analysis on the instrument.
6. Review the instrument results, ensuring no instrument errors
are indicated.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
5.1 Result Verification:
• Verify the accuracy of results by checking QC data and instrument
printouts.
• Ensure results are within expected reference intervals for the
specific body fluid tested.
5.2 Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and review results for any flags or critical values.
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider of any critical results as
per laboratory policy.
5.3 Reference Ranges:
• Reference ranges should be specific to the type of body fluid
tested and stored in the LIS for reference.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
6.1 Maintain sample integrity by checking for any signs of hemolysis,
contamination, or clotting. 6.2 If sample integrity is questionable,
consult with a supervisor before reporting results.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS
7.1 Document all critical results and follow laboratory policy for
reporting such results to healthcare providers. 7.2 Adhere to repeat
critical values guidelines if applicable.
