Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase for Determining Lactate Dehydrogenase
(LDH) Levels in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary to
determine the Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in body fluids in
order to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of various medical
conditions. This procedure ensures accurate, reproducible, and
timely results, conforming to lab quality standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to:
• Follow the steps outlined in this procedure for the determination of
LDH levels.
• Verify and document results.
• Perform necessary quality control and maintenance on
equipment.
• Report any deviations or issues to the supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN
Type:
• Acceptable body fluids include pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial
fluids.
Collection:
• Specimen should be collected in a sterile container.
• A minimum volume of 1 mL is required for the analysis.
• Ensure no contamination occurs during collection.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately.
• If delay is unavoidable, refrigerate at 2 – 8°C.
• Specimens are stable for up to 72 hours under refrigeration.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or contaminated.
• Specimens in unacceptable or non-sterile containers.
• Specimens not labeled with identification and collection time.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Clinical Chemistry Analyzer capable of measuring LDH (e.g.,
Roche Cobas c501)
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• LDH reagent set specific for the clinical chemistry analyzer
• Calibration and Quality Control materials
Supplies:
• Sterile collection containers
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Labels and markers for specimen identification
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens.
2. Verify that the clinical chemistry analyzer is calibrated according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Ensure that quality control (QC) materials have been run and
are within acceptable ranges for the LDH assay.
Steps:
1. Specimen Preparation: 1.1. Centrifuge the specimen at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes if it contains visible particulate
matter. 1.2. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean tube for
analysis.
2. Load Specimens: 2.1. Label each aliquot with the patient ID,
date, and type of body fluid. 2.2. Load specimens into the
clinical chemistry analyzer according to the instrument's
guidelines.
3. Analysis: 3.1. Select the LDH assay on the clinical chemistry
analyzer. 3.2. Start the run and allow the analyzer to process
the samples. 3.3. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages
or alerts during the run.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION:
• Perform calibration with each new lot of reagents and after any
major maintenance on the analyzer.
• Analyze QC materials at two different levels (normal and
abnormal) at the beginning of each shift, after reagent changes,
and if there are any discrepancies.
• Document all QC results and ensure they are within the
acceptable ranges; investigate and resolve any QC failures before
proceeding with patient samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review all results generated by the clinical chemistry analyzer.
• Verify results by comparing QC results and ensuring no major
deviations.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Highlight critical results and report them immediately according to
site protocols.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals for LDH in body fluids should be established
and verified by the laboratory.
• Typical reference values might vary depending on the type of fluid
and the patient population.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure samples are not hemolyzed as red blood cells contain
LDH.
• Contaminated or improperly stored specimens may yield
inaccurate results.
• Consult clinical analyzer and reagent-specific instructions for any
known interferences or limitations.
10. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the clinical chemistry analyzer and
LDH reagent set.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards and protocols.
11. RELATED DOCUMENTS:
• SOP for Specimen Collection and Handling
• SOP for Quality Control Procedures
• Incident Reporting Protocols
12. REVIEW/REVISION HISTORY:
• Document reviewed and approved by Laboratory Supervisor on
[current date].
By following these steps, laboratory personnel ensure accurate and
reliable determination of LDH levels in body fluids, supporting
effective clinical decision-making.
