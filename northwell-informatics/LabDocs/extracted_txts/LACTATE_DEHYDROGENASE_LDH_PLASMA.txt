STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to provide the
protocol for the quantitative determination of Lactate
Dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma using a suitable analytical
method.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Plasma collected using lithium heparin or EDTA as
anticoagulant.
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL plasma.
• Stability: Plasma is stable for up to 3 days at 2-8°C. If not tested
within this period, store plasma at -20°C or lower until analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• LDH reagent kit
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of running LDH
• Calibrators and quality control (QC) materials
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENTS
• Lactate Dehydrogenase Reagent Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions
• Calibrators appropriate for the LDH assay
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal levels)
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
2. Collect whole blood and centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain plasma.
3. Transfer plasma to a clean, labeled tube to avoid hemolysis,
which can interfere with the assay.
4. Ensure proper storage conditions for plasma samples until
analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibrators and quality control materials according to
the instructions provided by the manufacturer.
2. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators.
3. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift, after
calibration, and following any instrument maintenance.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions
for LDH testing.
2. Load plasma samples, calibrators, and quality control materials
onto the analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer to run the LDH assay.
4. Ensure the analyzer conducts the assay according to the
predefined method parameters. This typically involves
measuring the conversion of lactate to pyruvate accompanied
by the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, monitored at 340 nm.
5. Verify that the analyzer prints out or records all results.
D. Verification and Documentation:
1. Review quality control results to ensure they fall within
expected ranges before accepting patient results.
2. Compare patient sample results with established reference
intervals: 125-220 U/L (Note: reference intervals may vary
based on the population or methodology; adjust accordingly).
3. Document any deviations, corrective actions, or instrument
maintenance conducted during the analytical process.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify that all QC results are within acceptable limits.
6. Issue patient sample results through the laboratory information
system (LIS).
7. Notate any abnormal or critical values, following laboratory
protocol for the communication of critical results.
8. Flag results that require follow-up or immediate attention and
notify the appropriate healthcare provider if necessary.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis: Red cell LDH can significantly increase plasma LDH
results; avoid hemolyzed samples.
• Lipemia and icterus can interfere with LDH measurements; refer
to manufacturer’s guidelines for detailed interference information.
• Other method-specific limitations should be referenced from the
manufacturer's insert.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for the LDH Reagent Kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
calibration and quality control.
• Laboratory-specific reference manuals and procedural guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT
2. Quality control materials must be analyzed alongside patient
samples according to laboratory and manufacturer protocols.
3. Staff must demonstrate proficiency in performing the LDH
assay through periodic competency assessments.
4. Maintain thorough documentation of calibration, maintenance,
QC, and any corrective actions taken for quality assurance
purposes.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accuracy, precision,
and reliability of LDH test results for effective patient care and
diagnosis.
