Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Lactate
Dehydrogenase (LDH), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the quantitative determination of Lactate
Dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum samples using enzymatic methods.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the biochemical analysis of serum for LDH
activity in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to perform
LDH testing accurately and to ensure that results are reported timely
and accurately. Laboratory supervisors must ensure that personnel
are properly trained and competent in performing this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum collected in a clot activator (red-top) or SST (serum
separator) tube.
• The serum sample should be free of hemolysis and icterus.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• EDTA, heparin, or citrate plasma.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer
• LDH reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure the serum specimen is adequately centrifuged to
provide a clear supernatant.
2. Inspect the serum specimen for any signs of hemolysis. Discard
any hemolyzed samples as they may lead to falsely elevated
results.
Reagent Preparation:
1. NDH reagent kit should be used according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare working reagents as per reagent kit instructions.
3. Calibrators and controls should be prepared as indicated by the
manufacturer.
Instrument Setup:
1. Turn on the chemistry analyzer and allow it to perform system
checks.
2. Load the LDH reagent onto the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Perform a blank measurement to ensure the analyzer is zeroed.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the instrument using the provided calibrators as per
the analyzer's instructions.
2. After calibration, run quality control samples at different levels
(e.g., low, medium, high) to ensure the accuracy and precision
of the assay.
3. Ensure that QC results fall within the acceptable range before
analyzing patient samples.
Sample Analysis:
1. Load the serum samples onto the analyzer rack.
2. Input the required information into the analyzer, including
patient identification and test parameters.
3. The analyzer will automatically aspirate the sample, mix it with
the reagent, and measure the absorbance changes associated
with LDH activity.
4. The results will be calculated based on a standard curve or
calibration.
Reporting Results:
1. Validate the results obtained from the analyzer by comparing
them to the acceptable reference intervals and quality control
values.
2. Any results that fall outside the reference range or show
potential errors should be re-evaluated.
3. Enter the validated results into the laboratory information
system (LIS) and ensure they are correctly reported to the
relevant healthcare provider.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals for LDH activity may vary depending on the
method used. Typically,
• Adult: 135 - 225 U/L
• Pediatric Patients: Reference range may vary and should be
established by the lab.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Ensure that all quality control procedures are followed as per
the reagent and instrument manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Perform routine maintenance on the chemistry analyzer as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Record all quality control and maintenance activities in the
appropriate logs.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can significantly increase LDH levels, leading to
inaccurate results.
• Proper handling of samples is crucial to avoid hemolysis and
contamination.
• Specific interfering substances that may affect the LDH assay
should be documented in the assay's product insert.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for use for both the chemistry analyzer
and the LDH reagent kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on LDH analysis.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
reliable measurement of LDH levels in serum, aiding in the diagnosis
and monitoring of clinical conditions.
