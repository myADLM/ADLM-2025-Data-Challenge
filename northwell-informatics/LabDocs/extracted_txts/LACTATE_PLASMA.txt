Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Plasma Lactate Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines procedures for the collection, processing, analysis,
and reporting of plasma lactate levels. The goal is to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results while maintaining patient safety
and laboratory efficiency.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the testing of plasma lactate in clinical
settings and is intended for use by qualified laboratory personnel
trained in the operation of relevant analytical equipment.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
accurately, report any deviations to the supervisor, and ensure proper
maintenance of equipment and documentation:
• Laboratory Technologists: Conduct plasma lactate testing
following the SOP.
• Supervisors: Oversee the adherence to SOP and address any
deviations or issues encountered during testing.
4. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Container: Sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate (grey-
top) collection tube.
• Preferred Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of plasma.
• Stability: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C for not more than 8
hours; if longer storage is needed, freeze at -20°C.
Specimen Collection:
• Draw blood aseptically using an appropriate collection tube.
• Immediately mix by gentle inversion of the tube to ensure proper
anticoagulation.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory under refrigerated
conditions if analysis is not performed immediately.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Blood gas analyzer or suitable clinical chemistry analyzer (e.g.,
ABL90 or equivalent)
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C for long term storage)
• Micropipettes
• Plasma Lactate standards and controls
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing:
• Upon arrival, record specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Centrifuge the blood at 1500-2000 g for 10-15 minutes to
separate plasma within 30 minutes of collection.
• Transfer the plasma to a clean, labelled tube.
• If testing will be delayed for more than 8 hours, freeze the plasma
sample immediately.
B) Analysis:
• Prepare and calibrate the analyzer as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Perform a quality control (QC) check using plasma lactate control
materials at least once per shift or per run.
• If QC results fall outside the specified limits, identify and correct
the issue before proceeding with patient samples.
C) Plasma Lactate Measurement:
• Load the plasma sample onto the analyzer.
• Enter patient and test details into the analyzer.
• Initiate the lactate assay as per the instrument’s protocol.
• After analysis, retrieve the results and review for any flags or error
messages.
D) Quality Assurance:
• Ensure all controls fall within the manufacturer’s specified ranges.
• If discrepancies arise, investigate and resolve before releasing
patient results.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions taken, if any.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results according to laboratory protocol.
• Enter verified results into the LIS.
• Critical results must be communicated to the appropriate clinical
personnel immediately and documented.
• Non-critical results should be reported through the standard
laboratory reporting system.
Reference Intervals:
• Plasma Lactate Normal Range: 0.5 – 2.2 mmol/L
• Critical Values: < 0.5 mmol/L or > 4.0 mmol/L (adjust as per
laboratory policy).
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis or sample contamination can interfere with accurate
lactate measurement.
• Prolonged stasis during venipuncture can lead to falsely elevated
lactate levels.
• Ensure proper handling and storage of specimens to prevent
glycolysis.
