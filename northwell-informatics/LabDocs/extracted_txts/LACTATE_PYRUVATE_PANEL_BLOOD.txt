Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lactate/Pyruvate Panel, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating lactate and pyruvate results from blood specimens in
order to ensure accurate and reliable measurements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all medical laboratory scientists and technical
staff involved in the processing and analysis of blood specimens for
lactate and pyruvate measurement.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated staff are responsible for performing blood lactate
and pyruvate analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring proper training of staff
and adherence to this SOP.
• Laboratory staff are responsible for identifying any issues during
analysis, reporting them, and taking corrective actions as
necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate tubes or pre-heparinized syringes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of blood.
• Specimen Handling: The blood specimen should be placed on
ice immediately after collection to prevent metabolic activity.
• Stability:
◦ Lactate: Stable for up to 30 minutes at room temperature, 2
hours on ice.
◦ Pyruvate: Stable for up to 30 minutes on ice.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are clotted.
• Specimens with noticeable hemolysis.
• Specimens not received on ice.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Lactate Analyzer: Calibrated and maintained according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Pyruvate Assay Kit: Store reagents as per manufacturer's
recommendations.
• Centrifuge: Calibrated and capable of maintaining appropriate
temperatures.
• Pipettes and Tips: Calibrated and suitable for micro-sampling.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Specimen Preparation
1. Reception:
◦ Verify the specimen's identification against the requisition
form.
◦ Ensure the specimen meets the acceptance criteria.
◦ Document the receipt in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Processing:
◦ Place the blood specimen immediately on ice if it was not
already done.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 4°C for 10 minutes at 2000-3000
rpm to separate plasma.
◦ Pipette the plasma layer carefully into a clean, pre-labelled
microcentrifuge tube, avoiding disturbing the cells layer.
Maintain the plasma on ice till analysis.
6.2. Lactate Measurement
1. Calibration and QC:
◦ Calibrate the lactate analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions before use.
◦ Run quality control materials (low, normal, high) to ensure
the analyzer accuracy.
◦ Document results in QC logs and must be within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
2. Analysis:
◦ Use a pipette to draw up an appropriate volume of plasma.
◦ Introduce the plasma sample into the lactate analyzer.
◦ Record the lactate concentration provided by the analyzer.
◦ Document the results in the LIS.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If quality control fails, recalibrate the analyzer and repeat
QC.
◦ If the sample analysis fails (e.g., due to an error message),
re-extract and rerun a new aliquot of plasma.
6.3. Pyruvate Measurement
1. Calibration and QC:
◦ Prepare the necessary reagents and calibrate the pyruvate
assay kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Run control samples (low, normal, high) to verify assay
performance.
◦ Document control results and ensure they fall within
acceptability criteria.
2. Analysis:
◦ Pipette the plasma into the reaction wells as indicated by
the kit.
◦ Follow the incubation and reaction settings provided in the
kit’s instructional manual.
◦ Measure the absorbance using the spectrophotometer set to
the correct wavelength.
◦ Calculate the pyruvate concentration using the provided
standard curve or calculator function integrated into the
instrument.
◦ Document results in the LIS.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• All instruments and reagents utilized must be within their
calibration/expiration dates.
• Daily instrument checks and documentation are mandatory before
running patient samples.
• Weekly inter-laboratory comparison with a reference laboratory to
ensure consistency of results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the results entered into the LIS.
• Verify against expected ranges and repeat tests if necessary due
to outliers or QC issues.
• Results must be reviewed by a senior technologist or supervisor
before release.
• Notify clinicians/customer service of any critical values
immediately following the laboratory’s protocol for critical results.
9. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Assess for hemolysis or any visible abnormalities.
• If identified, document as "Sample compromised; repeat test
needed" and follow-up for a new sample.
