Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LACTATE/PYRUVATE
PANEL, BLOOD Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To describe the standard procedure for performing blood lactate/
pyruvate analysis ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing tests
following the procedure accurately, recording results, and ensuring
corrective actions are taken when required.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in a heparinized syringe.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be processed within 15 minutes of collection to
ensure optimal stability.
• For delayed processing, specimens should be placed on ice
(2-8°C) immediately and tested within 30 minutes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens with significant air bubbles.
• Specimens received in non-approved containers (e.g., non-
heparinized syringes).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Heparinized blood gas syringes with electrolyte balanced heparin.
• Ice bath.
• Blood gas analyzer capable of lactate/pyruvate measurement.
• Centrifuge (for plasma separation if needed).
• Quality control materials for lactate/pyruvate.
5. PROCEDURE
Specimen Collection:
1. Collect blood via venipuncture using heparinized syringes.
2. Ensure minimal delay between collection and transfer of
specimen to ice.
Specimen Handling:
1. Transport the sample to the laboratory on ice immediately after
collection.
2. Log the specimen receipt time and condition into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
Sample Analysis:
1. Mix the specimen thoroughly by rolling the syringe between
hands to ensure homogeneity.
2. Remove any visible air bubbles by expelling them from the
syringe.
3. Insert the syringe sample into the blood gas analyzer.
4. Select the lactate/pyruvate panel from the menu on the
analyzer.
5. Allow the analyzer to process the sample.
Reporting Results:
1. Review the results for accuracy and completeness.
2. Document the results in the LIS.
3. Verify the results against QC data.
4. Report any critical values immediately to the attending
physician or healthcare provider and document this
communication.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control checks with designated materials
at appropriate intervals (daily or as per laboratory protocol).
• Document QC results in the relevant log according to site-specific
guidelines.
• If QC falls outside acceptable limits, take corrective actions:
◦ Recalibrate the analyzer.
◦ Re-run the QC material.
◦ Assess possible interfering factors.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the blood gas analyzer manual for specific sample and
method limitations.
• Improper specimen handling, delayed analysis, and air
contamination can affect the accuracy of lactate/pyruvate
measurements.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Lactate: 0.5–2.2 mmol/L
• Pyruvate: 70–140 µmol/L
• Ratios and calculation values as per specific method calibration.
9. CRITICAL VALUES
• Lactate: >4.0 mmol/L
• Pyruvate: Exceeds method-specific thresholds
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In case of analyzer malfunction, refer to the manufacturer's
manual for troubleshooting steps.
• If sample integrity is in question (e.g., hemolysis), assess via
centrifugation and decide on re-collection if necessary.
• Any unresolved issues should be escalated to the on-call
laboratory supervisor.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• All records of specimen receipt, processing, analysis, QC, and
results should be maintained according to laboratory protocol and
regulatory requirements.
• Critical results must be communicated, documented, and
managed as per laboratory policy.
12. REFERENCES
• Analyzer user manual.
• Laboratory's internal procedural documents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and regulatory standards.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed regularly and updated based on
new methodologies, equipment updates, and quality improvement
initiatives. Ensure compliance with all regulatory and accreditation
requirements.
