Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for LACTATE/PYRUVATE PANEL, CSF
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Lactate/Pyruvate Panel using CSF
specimens. This will ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability in
the test outcomes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated clinical laboratory scientists
(CLS) and technologists to perform the analysis using standardized
procedures and ensure quality control measures are adhered to.
3. DEFINITIONS
• CSF: Cerebrospinal Fluid.
• Lactate: An organic compound produced during anaerobic
metabolism.
• Pyruvate: An intermediate product in the metabolism of
carbohydrates and proteins.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Clean tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Analytical balance
• Refrigerated centrifuge (if needed)
• Dry ice/Freezer (-20°C or lower for storing specimens)
• Lactate pyruvate enzymatic assay kits
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Quality control materials (commercially available controls)
5. REAGENTS
• Lactate reagent set:
◦ Lactate oxidase
◦ Peroxidase
◦ Color reagent
• Pyruvate reagent set:
◦ Pyruvate oxidase
◦ Hydrogen peroxide
◦ Enzyme buffer
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen:
◦ CSF samples using an aseptic technique.
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
◦ Collection Tube: Sterile, non-additive tubes.
• Handling and Transport:
◦ Properly label the specimen with patient identifiers.
◦ Transport the CSF sample to the laboratory immediately on
ice.
• Storage:
◦ If immediate analysis is not possible, store the sample at
-20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Allow reagents and CSF samples to come to room temperature
before analysis.
B) Lactate Assay:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples before patient specimens.
◦ Document values and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw CSF sample if previously frozen.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 2000-3000 rpm for 5 min if
particulate matter is present.
◦ Aliquot 0.2 mL of CSF into a clean tube.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 0.2 mL of lactate reagent to each sample and mix.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Measure absorbance at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer.
4. Calculation:
◦ Compare the absorbance of the sample to the standard
curve.
◦ Record and document the lactate concentration.
C) Pyruvate Assay:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control tests as outlined above.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Use the remaining aliquot from lactate testing if volume
permits, or prepare a new aliquot following the same steps.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 1.0 mL of pyruvate reagent to the CSF sample tube.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Measure absorbance at 540 nm using a calibrated
spectrophotometer.
4. Calculation:
◦ Compare the measured absorbance to the standard curve
for pyruvate.
◦ Record and document the pyruvate concentration.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks using commercial controls with known
concentrations of lactate and pyruvate at the beginning of each
testing session.
• Document and verify QC results are within permissible limits
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Results are reviewed and verified by the designated technologist.
• Ensuring all critical results are addressed immediately according
to the laboratory's critical result policy and reported to the
healthcare provider.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with accurate lactate and
pyruvate measurements.
• Avoid using specimens with significant air contamination or visible
clots.
