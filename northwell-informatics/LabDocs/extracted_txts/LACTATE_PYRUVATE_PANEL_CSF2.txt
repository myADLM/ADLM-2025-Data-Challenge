Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Lactate/
Pyruvate Panel in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
analyzing the lactate/pyruvate panel in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to
ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results. This procedure
includes guidelines for specimen handling, equipment calibration,
analytical method, quality control, and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing lactate/
pyruvate analysis to follow these procedures and maintain the
integrity of the analytical results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that staff are trained on this SOP and that all required
documentation is completed accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Central or lumbar CSF collected in a red top tube without
anticoagulant.
• Specimens should be transported on ice immediately after
collection and processed within 30 minutes to ensure the stability
of the analytes.
• Hemolyzed and clotted specimens are unacceptable and must be
rejected.
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
appropriate columns for lactate and pyruvate separation.
• Centrifuge capable of maintaining 4°C.
• Refrigerated storage area (2-8°C) for samples and reagents.
• Standard laboratory glassware and micropipettes.
• Temperature-controlled water bath for enzyme reactions
(optional).
Reagents:
• Lactate reagent kit.
• Pyruvate reagent kit.
• Calibrators and controls from a validated source with known
concentrations of lactate and pyruvate.
• Quality control materials (Low, Medium, High) specific for lactate
and pyruvate.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, ensure CSF specimens are on ice.
2. Record the specimen accession number, patient details, and
collection time.
3. Centrifuge the CSF samples at 4°C for 10 minutes at 1,000 x g
to remove particulate matter.
4. Aliquot the clear supernatant into labeled tubes.
B. Analytical Method:
1. Prepare the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring correct column and mobile phase
conditions.
2. Calibrate the HPLC system using lactate and pyruvate
standards at different concentrations. Verify calibration by
running quality control samples.
3. Inject 10 µL of each CSF sample into the HPLC system.
4. Run each sample in duplicate to ensure accuracy.
5. Record the retention times and peak areas for lactate and
pyruvate.
C. Interpretation:
1. Calculate the concentration of lactate and pyruvate in each
sample using the calibration curve.
2. Verify that duplicate runs are within acceptable variation limits
(i.e., within 5%).
3. If the concentrations of any samples fall outside the expected
range or demonstrate high variability, repeat the analysis.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (Low, Medium, High) at the
beginning and end of each run and after every 10 samples.
2. Ensure quality control results are within the established
acceptable range. Investigate and resolve any deviations prior
to proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document all quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review and verify all results before reporting.
6. Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
7. Flag any critical values and notify the requesting physician
immediately.
◦ Critical values: Lactate > 4.0 mmol/L, Pyruvate > 0.3 mmol/
L.
8. Report results according to site-specific guidelines and ensure
all required documentation is completed.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Lactate: 1.0 – 2.5 mmol/L
• Pyruvate: 0.05 – 0.15 mmol/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Limitations are described in the respective reagent kit inserts and
include potential interferences from substances that may be present
in CSF. Hemolysis and prolonged storage before analysis may result
in elevated lactate and pyruvate levels.

This concludes the SOP for the Lactate/Pyruvate Panel in CSF
analysis. It is crucial to follow each step carefully to ensure accurate
and reliable results. Staff should be trained periodically to maintain
proficiency and recognize any deviations in the procedure.
