STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Lactate Pyruvate
Panel, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for plasma Lactate and Pyruvate levels,
ensuring accurate and high-quality results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff will perform the analytical
phase following this SOP.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of Lactate Pyruvate Panel, Plasma testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Venous blood collected in heparinized tubes (dark green top).
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory immediately and
kept on ice to prevent degradation.
• Plasma should be separated and placed in cryovials within 30
minutes of collection, kept frozen at -20°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Blood collected in non-heparinized tubes.
• Specimens left at room temperature for more than 30 minutes.
• Hemolyzed or clotted specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Centrifuge
• Cryovials
• Ice and cooling materials (for transport)
• Lactate and Pyruvate assay kits (e.g., enzymatic method kits from
Roche or equivalent)
• Spectrophotometer or equivalent analytical instrumentation
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-Analytical Steps:
• Ensure all samples are collected, labeled, and transported
according to specimen requirements.
• Record date and time of sample collection and separation in the
accession log.
5.2 Plasma Separation:
• Centrifuge blood specimens at 4°C for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm to
separate plasma from cells.
• Carefully transfer plasma into pre-labeled cryovials.
• Store plasma samples at -20°C until further analysis.
5.3 Analytical Procedure:
• Retrieve plasma samples from the freezer and thaw at 4°C.
• Prepare the working reagent as specified in the assay kit protocol.
Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
• For lactate analysis: a. Pipette plasma into reaction wells
according to the assay kit instructions. b. Follow kit instructions for
reagent addition and incubation. c. Measure absorbance at the
specified wavelength using the spectrophotometer. d. Record
results.
• For pyruvate analysis: a. Similarly, pipette plasma into reaction
wells designated for pyruvate analysis. b. Add appropriate
reagents and incubate. c. Measure absorbance at the specified
wavelength using the spectrophotometer. d. Record results.
5.4 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with each batch to ensure precision
and accuracy of results.
• Acceptable ranges for control samples must be pre-determined
and adhered to.
• Document QC results in the log sheet and verify against
established criteria.
1. POST-ANALYTICAL STEPS
6.1 Result Verification:
• Cross-check results for any potential errors or discrepancies.
• Calculate final concentrations based on the standard calibration
curve provided by the assay kit.
• Review and interpret results according to reference intervals.
6.2 Reporting:
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by qualified personnel
before reporting.
6.3 Documentation:
• File all assay worksheets, QC logs, and instrument printouts for
future reference.
• Maintain detailed records of any corrective actions performed
during the assay.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Regular equipment maintenance and calibration must be conducted
according to manufacturer recommendations. Adhere to all internal
and external quality assurance protocols to ensure ongoing accuracy
and reliability of test results.
