Standard Operating Procedure for Lactic Acid, Plasma Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps for the
accurate and efficient analysis of lactic acid in plasma samples within
the clinical laboratory setting.
2. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Blood collected in sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate (gray top)
tubes, or lithium heparin (dark green top) tubes.
• Plasma should be separated from cells within 15 minutes of
collection.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory on ice to
reduce glycolysis and processed promptly.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted or hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate or lithium heparin tubes.
• Plasma not separated from cells within 15 minutes of collection.
• Specimens received more than one hour after collection, if not
properly refrigerated.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate (gray top) tubes, or lithium
heparin (dark green top) tubes
• Ice for specimen transport
• Lactic acid assay kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Pipettes and tips
• Spectrophotometer or analyzer (manufacturer-specific)
• Calibrators and controls for lactic acid
• Plasma separation equipment (e.g., microcentrifuge, if needed)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Verify that all reagents and supplies are within their expiration
date and stored properly.
2. Ensure that the spectrophotometer or analyzer is calibrated per
the manufacturer’s instruction.
B. Specimen Handling:
1. On receipt of the plasma sample, place the tube on ice if not
already chilled.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1,500 g for 10 minutes to separate
the plasma.
C. Analysis:
1. Prepare reagents as outlined by the manufacturer’s lactic acid
assay kit instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of plasma sample into the reaction
vessel.
3. Add the assay reagents to the plasma sample per the kit
instructions.
4. Incubate the mixture at the specified temperature and time as
per the assay kit instructions.
5. Read the absorbance or signal generated using a
spectrophotometer or analyzer.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run lactic acid controls (both high and low levels) prior to,
during, and post-analysis of patient samples.
2. Verify the control results align within the established acceptable
ranges.
3. If control results are out of range, troubleshoot the issue per the
manufacturer’s instructions before proceeding with further
analysis.
E. Result Verification:
1. Review and verify the raw analytical data.
2. Confirm that the results fall within the expected clinical range.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. If values fall outside the critical ranges or testing issues occur,
repeat analysis and consult supervisor if needed.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily calibration and control checks based on the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS after verification.
• Critical values must be reviewed, verified, and communicated to
the appropriate clinical personnel following laboratory policy.
• Record any deficiencies or anomalies observed during the
analysis and report them to the supervisor.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Lactic Acid, Plasma:
◦ Normal: 0.5-2.2 mmol/L
◦ Critical values: >4.0 mmol/L
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s assay kit insert for any specific
limitations inherent to the reagent pads and instrumentation.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product insert for lactic acid assay kit.
• Laboratory policy reference materials for specimen handling and
critical value reporting.
10. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing, verifying,
and reporting the analytical results for lactic acid in plasma samples
as outlined in this SOP.
