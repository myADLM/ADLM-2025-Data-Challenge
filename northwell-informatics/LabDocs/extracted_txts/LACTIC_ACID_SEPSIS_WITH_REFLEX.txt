Protocol for Analytical Phase of Lactic Acid Testing in
Sepsis with Reflex
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for the measurement
of lactic acid levels in suspected sepsis cases with reflex testing. The
objective is to ensure accurate and timely results for the diagnosis
and management of sepsis.
2. DEFINITIONS
Lactic Acid: A product of anaerobic metabolism, elevated levels are
indicative of hypoperfusion and potential sepsis. Reflex Testing:
Automatic follow-up testing based on predetermined criteria specific
to lactic acid results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Arterial or venous blood collected in a
heparinized blood gas syringe or lithium heparin tube.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of blood.
• Stability: Must be analyzed within 30 minutes of collection. Keep
specimen on ice if not analyzed immediately.
• Unacceptable Specimens: EDTA, sodium citrate, and
hemolyzed samples.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Blood Gas Analyzer (ABL90)
• Heparinized blood gas syringes or lithium heparin tubes
• Ice for transport if needed
• Calibration materials and quality control solutions
5. PROCEDURES
Step 1: Specimen Collection and Handling
• Collect blood sample ensuring minimal exposure to air to prevent
lactic acid level alteration.
• Expel any air bubbles in the syringe, cap the syringe, and mix
thoroughly by rolling between hands for 5 seconds.
• Transport immediately to the laboratory on ice if not processed
within 30 minutes.
Step 2: Analyzing the Specimen
• Verify patient identification and label match.
• Perform external QC checks on the analyzer as per standard
quality control protocols.
• Load syringe into the ABL90 blood gas analyzer.
• Follow the analyzer's prompts to ensure correct sample
processing.
• Allow the analyzer to complete the lactic acid measurement.
Step 3: Reflex Testing Criteria
• Initial Lactic Acid Result Annotation:
◦ If initial lactic acid level is >2 mmol/L, proceed with reflex
testing.
◦ Utilize additional reflex tests such as repeat lactic acid
measurement, blood cultures, and other relevant biomarkers
under sepsis protocol.
• Reflex Testing Procedure:
◦ Draw new sample if required, ensuring appropriate handling to
avoid preanalytical errors.
◦ Analyze the second sample following the same procedure as
the first.
◦ Record findings and results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
Step 4: Reporting Results
• Review and finalize lactic acid results:
◦ If critical results are obtained, follow protocol for immediate
physician notification.
• For reflex testing results, denote and interpret according to
hospital-specific guidelines.
• Results are transmitted automatically from analyzer to LIS and
manually verified before releasing to electronic health record
(EHR).
Step 5: Quality Control
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly QC checks as prescribed by
the analyzer manufacturer.
• Document all QC activities including corrective measures for any
out-of-bound results.
• Calibration and maintenance logs should be maintained for
traceability and compliance.
6. INTERPRETATION AND ACTIONS
• Lactic Acid Level <2 mmol/L: Generally considered within
normal limits.
• Lactic Acid Level 2–4 mmol/L: Indicates potential sepsis; initiate
reflex testing and clinical reassessment.
• Lactic Acid Level >4 mmol/L: Indicates severe sepsis or septic
shock; urgent medical intervention and continued monitoring
required.
Reflex Testing Confirmed Diagnosis and Actions:
• Ensure completion of all additional reflex tests.
• Follow clinical guidelines for the management of sepsis based on
test results and clinical presentation.
• Notify relevant medical staff and update patient records in the
EHR.
