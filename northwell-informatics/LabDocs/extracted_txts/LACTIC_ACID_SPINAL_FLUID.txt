Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analysis of Lactic Acid in
Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized steps for
the accurate and reliable analysis of lactic acid levels in spinal fluid
samples. This SOP ensures consistency, reliability, and traceability of
analytical results while maintaining compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all CLIA-certified laboratory personnel authorized
to perform lactic acid analysis on spinal fluid specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the analysis.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring protocol compliance and
addressing any deviations or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
4.1 Specimen Collection
• Specimen Type: Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid, CSF)
• Collection Container: Red stopper tube
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of clear CSF
4.2 Specimen Handling
• Handle CSF specimens with care to avoid contamination and
hemolysis.
• Centrifuge specimens to ensure they are clot-free.
4.3 Specimen Storage
• Analyze CSF samples immediately upon collection for best
results.
• If delayed, store CSF at 2-8°C and analyze within 2 hours of
collection.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately to
minimize delays.
4.4 Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens received in incorrect containers or with insufficient
volume.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or contamination.
• Specimens that are clotted or have not been handled according to
specified guidelines.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Automated analyzer capable of performing lactic acid
analysis (e.g., ABL90 or equivalent)
• Reagents: Lactic acid reagent kit as specified by the manufacturer
• Supplies: Centrifuge, pipettes, red stopper tubes
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Instrument Preparation
• Ensure that the analyzer is calibrated and quality control checks
are up to date before running patient samples.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for setup and operation of
the analyzer.
6.2 Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge the CSF specimen to remove any cellular debris, if
necessary.
• Ensure the sample is free from any clots or visible contamination.
6.3 Analysis
• Load the CSF specimen onto the analyzer. Ensure proper
identification by verifying patient details and accession number.
• Run the analysis as per the analyzer’s operating procedure for
lactic acid.
• Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts during the
process.
6.4 Quality Control
• Perform quality control using standard QC material as specified
by the manufacturer guidelines.
• Record all QC results and ensure that they fall within acceptable
limits before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
6.5 Result Documentation
• Record the lactic acid concentration obtained from the analyzer.
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and review for accuracy before verification.
• Report results as specified in site-specific guidelines.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS from the analyzer.
• Verify and review the results prior to releasing.
• In case of critical results, follow the laboratory protocol for
reporting critical values to the appropriate healthcare provider.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly checks as specified in the Quality
Control section.
• Regularly validate the solution pack and sensor cassette on the
analyzer.
• Maintain detailed records of QC activities, calibration,
maintenance, and any discrepancies noted during the analysis.
9. REFERENCES
• Reference product insert for the lactic acid reagent kit used.
• Manufacturer’s manual for the analyzer.
• CLIA regulations and standards for laboratory operations.
10. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP must be reviewed annually and as needed by the
laboratory director or designated review authority. Feedback and
recommendations for revision are encouraged to maintain
compliance and improve accuracy.
This protocol ensures consistent and accurate analysis of lactic acid
in spinal fluid, aligning with recognized standards and laboratory best
practices.
