Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Lactic Acid in Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of lactic acid in
whole blood samples. Ensuring proper sample handling, accurate
and precise measurement, quality control, and appropriate
documentation to produce reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
procedure as defined. It is the responsibility of all staff involved to
identify and report any deficiencies or issues that may affect the
quality or accuracy of the test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood sample collected in a lithium-heparin blood gas
syringe or a heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST).
Specimen Handling:
• After collection, ensure that the blood specimen is adequately
mixed and all air bubbles are expelled.
• The specimen should be transported to the laboratory
immediately, preferably using a pneumatic tube system or by
hand.
Stability:
• Blood samples for lactic acid analysis must be analyzed within 15
minutes of collection to prevent metabolism of lactate by blood
cells which can alter the results.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with significant air bubbles (greater than 10% of
specimen volume).
• Samples received in anticoagulants other than heparin.
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens from vacutainers that are partially filled or not
adequately mixed.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ABL 90 or comparable blood gas analyzer with lactic acid
measurement capabilities.
• Heparinized blood gas syringes or heparinized vacutainers.
• Quality control materials (3 levels).
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Processing:
1. Ensure all specimens are free of clots and air bubbles, mixed
thoroughly, and transported to the analysis area promptly.
2. If needed, centrifuge a small aliquot to check for the presence
of hemolysis or other integrity issues.
3. Place the whole blood specimen on the blood gas analyzer.
Analyzing the Sample:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for loading the sample
into the analyzer.
2. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and within acceptable
operating parameters.
3. Initiate the analysis.
Quality Control:
1. Perform internal quality control checks as per analyzer
manufacturer guidelines and laboratory protocols:
◦ Three levels of QC material are analyzed according to a
predetermined schedule.
◦ Record and review QC results.
2. If QC fails, repeat the QC analysis. If failure persists,
investigate and resolve the issue before proceeding with patient
testing.
3. Document all QC activities and corrective actions.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed by the
technologist.
2. Verify the results:
◦ Check for any flags or error codes from the analyzer.
◦ Compare the results with expected clinical ranges and
review for any abnormalities.
3. Record any issues and actions taken in the analyzer logs.
Documentation:
• Document the date, time of analysis, technologist initials, and any
comments related to sample integrity or analysis issues.
Critical Results:
1. If the lactic acid result exceeds the critical threshold defined by
laboratory policy, follow established protocols for reporting
critical values, including immediate notification of the physician
or designated healthcare provider.
2. Document the notification in the LIS as per laboratory protocol.
Sample Integrity:
• Should sample integrity be compromised (e.g., hemolysis), use
best judgment in reporting results or request a new specimen if
necessary.

8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Bi-weekly and monthly QC checks using patient samples and
control materials as detailed in the laboratory's quality control
protocols.
• Maintain documentation of all QC activities in the laboratory’s
records for audit and review.
