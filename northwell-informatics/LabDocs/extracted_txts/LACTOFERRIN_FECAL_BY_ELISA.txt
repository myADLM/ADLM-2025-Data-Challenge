STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results of Lactoferrin, Fecal by
ELISA
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of fecal lactoferrin using the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay) method to ensure consistent, reliable, and
accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel performing the ELISA
for Lactoferrin in fecal samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical process as described in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring personnel are trained
and for addressing any discrepancies or deviations from the SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Fresh or frozen fecal samples placed in
clean, leak-proof containers.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples that are improperly labeled,
leaking, or visibly contaminated.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Plate Reader (with appropriate filters)
• Micropipettes and Tips
• ELISA Kit for Lactoferrin detection
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
• Absorbent Paper
• Laboratory Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (gloves, lab coat, safety
glasses)
6. REAGENT PREPARATION
• ELISA Kit Components: Prepare reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Store all reagents as specified in the
kit instructions to maintain stability and effectiveness.
• Wash Buffer: Dilute concentrated wash buffer with distilled or
deionized water according to manufacturer’s instructions.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation: Thaw frozen fecal samples at room
temperature. Homogenize samples thoroughly before use.
Prepare sample dilutions as specified in the kit manual.
2. Coating and Blocking:
◦ Add appropriate volume of capture antibodies to each well.
Incubate as specified.
◦ Remove coating solution and wash wells with Wash Buffer.
3. Lactoferrin Detection:
◦ Add diluted fecal samples, standards, and quality controls to
designated wells.
◦ Incubate for the recommended period at room temperature
as per kit instructions.
4. Washing: After incubation, wash wells multiple times with Wash
Buffer to remove unbound substances.
5. Enzyme Conjugate:
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate for the specified time as per kit protocol.
6. Washing: Wash wells thoroughly to remove unbound
conjugate.
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Allow color development by incubating in the dark at room
temperature.
8. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add Stop Solution to each well to halt the enzyme-substrate
reaction.
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
using the ELISA plate reader.
8. DATA ANALYSIS
• Analyze the results by plotting the standard curve and
determining the concentration of lactoferrin in each sample using
the OD values.
• Compare sample results against known standards for
concentration determination.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure assay
validity.
• Perform routine calibration and maintenance of the ELISA plate
reader as per equipment protocols.
• Document all quality control results and note any deviations with
corrective actions taken.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before reporting.
• Any critical or abnormal findings must be communicated to the
relevant healthcare provider promptly and documented
accordingly.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult the ELISA kit insert or relevant medical literature for specific
reference intervals for fecal lactoferrin.
12. LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Certain substances in stool may interfere with
accurate detection.
• Handling: Improprietary handling of samples may lead to
unreliable results.
