Protocol for Generating Results for LACTOFERRIN,
QUANTITATIVE, STOOL
1. PURPOSE
◦ To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative
analysis of Lactoferrin in stool samples using an automated
immunoassay system.
2. SCOPE
◦ This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the analysis of stool samples for the presence of
Lactoferrin.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assay, ensuring accuracy of results, and
documenting all quality control measures.
4. DEFINITION
◦ Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein present in various secretory
fluids, including stools, and elevated levels indicate
inflammation often associated with intestinal disorders.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Lactoferrin Quantitative Immunoassay Kit.
◦ Sample containers.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Calibrators and controls.
◦ Quality control materials.
◦ Log sheets.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/Acceptable: Stool samples collected in a clean,
dry, screw-capped container without preservative.
◦ Transport promptly at 2-8°C and process within 24 hours of
collection. If delayed, store at -20°C or lower.
7. UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS
◦ Specimens in preservative or fixative.
◦ Specimens that are not stored appropriately.
◦ Specimens that are leaking or visibly contaminated.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Collect stool sample in a clean, dry container.
2. Homogenize the stool sample thoroughly using a vortex
mixer.
3. Transfer an appropriate aliquot (approximately 0.5g or as
specified by the kit) to a labeled sample cup.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
5. Use the supernatant for analysis.
B. Instrument Preparation
1. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform the daily
maintenance checks as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the Lactoferrin Quantitative Immunoassay Kit onto
the analyzer.
3. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at room
temperature before use.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration using the calibrators provided with the
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run quality control samples (both negative and positive
controls) at the beginning of each shift and document the
results.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load the prepared sample into the designated sample
tray on the analyzer.
2. Input the sample identification number into the analyzer.
3. Initiate the run sequence according to the analyzer's
operating instructions.
4. Verify that the analyzer processes the sample correctly,
monitoring for any error messages.
E. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. The analyzer will generate quantitative results for
Lactoferrin.
2. Review results for quality control before validation.
3. If the quality control results are within acceptable limits,
validate the patient results.
4. Document the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review by a licensed technologist or
pathologist.
5. Report any results outside the established reference
ranges as abnormal and notify the requesting clinician
immediately, if indicated.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Established reference intervals should be verified and
documented based on the laboratory’s validation studies
and kit manufacturer’s guidelines.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Refer to internal quality control guidelines to ensure assay
performance.
• Document all quality control results, calibrator performances, and
any corrective actions taken for out-of-range controls.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the Lactoferrin Quantitative Immunoassay Kit insert for
specific reagent limitations and potential interferences.
