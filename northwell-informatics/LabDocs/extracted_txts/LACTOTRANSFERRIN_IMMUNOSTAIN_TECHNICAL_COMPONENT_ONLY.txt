STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Lactotransferrin Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the proper procedure and analysis of
Lactotransferrin Immunostain, including technical preparation,
staining, and result documentation process to ensure consistency,
accuracy, and reliability of results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Lactotransferrin (LTF) Immunostain: An immunohistochemistry (IHC)
staining technique used to detect the presence of Lactotransferrin
protein in tissue samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP during the technical component of the immunostain process.
The lab supervisor will oversee and ensure compliance with the
procedure. Any anomalies or discrepancies identified must be
reported immediately to the supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Positive control tissue samples
• Negative control samples
• Lactotransferrin antibody (primary antibody)
• Secondary antibody and detection system (e.g., horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody with DAB
substrate)
• Automated IHC staining instrument (if applicable)
• Microscope
• Staining reagents
• Buffer solutions and mounting medium
• Slides and cover slips
• Histology-grade labels
• Timer
• Logbook
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples.
• Unstained slides should be prepared and stored at room
temperature.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Ensure all necessary equipment and supplies are ready.
• Label slides with the appropriate patient identifier and test details.
• Prepare control slides containing known LTF-positive and
negative tissues.
6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Place slides in a series of xylene baths to remove paraffin wax.
• Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (e.g., 100%, 95%, 70%
ethanol) and then into distilled water.
6.3 Antigen Retrieval
• Heat slides in appropriate antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate
buffer, pH 6.0) using a microwave or a pressure cooker for an
optimized period and temperature.
• Allow slides to cool and rinse in distilled water.
6.4 Blocking
• Incubate slides with a blocking solution (e.g., 5-10% non-fat dry
milk in PBS) to prevent nonspecific binding.
• Rinse slides in PBS buffer.
6.5 Primary Antibody Application
• Apply the Lactotransferrin primary antibody to the slides.
• Incubate slides for the specified time at room temperature or as
recommended by antibody datasheet, typically 30-60 minutes.
• Rinse slides in PBS to remove unbound primary antibody.
6.6 Secondary Antibody and Detection
• Incubate slides with the secondary antibody conjugated to HRP or
similar detection enzyme.
• Incubate slides for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in PBS.
6.7 Chromogen Application
• Apply the chromogen (e.g., DAB substrate) to slides.
• Monitor color development under the microscope, which typically
occurs within 5-10 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
6.8 Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain with hematoxylin, if required, to enhance contrast.
• Dehydrate slides through ethanol series and clear in xylene.
• Mount coverslips with a mounting medium.
7. CONTROLS AND QUALITY CHECK
• Include a positive and a negative control with every batch to
validate staining procedures.
• Ensure consistent staining intensity across batches.
• Document specific control observations and outcomes in the
logbook with dates and technician initials.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Review completed slides under a microscope.
• Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
noting technical adequacy, control results, and any observed
abnormalities.
• Include date, time, and technician initials in the logbook.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If no staining is observed in the positive control slide, review
reagent expiration dates, antibody concentrations, and procedural
steps for potential deviations.
• If nonspecific staining is seen, optimize blocking conditions,
antibody dilutions, and washing steps.
• Report unresolved issues to the supervisor immediately.

Refer to the manufacturer’s datasheets for the Lactotransferrin
primary antibody and detection reagents.
11. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
• This SOP is reviewed annually by laboratory supervisors.
• Revisions are documented with date, description of changes, and
approvals.
