STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs)
Analytical Phase: LADYBEETLE MULTICOLORED ASIAN
(HARMONIA AXYRIDIS) IGE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analysis of
Ladybeetle Multicolored Asian (Harmonia Axyridis) IgE in patient
samples. This will ensure the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility
of the results.
RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory staff designated to perform the LADYBEETLE
MULTICOLORED ASIAN (HARMONIA AXYRIDIS) IgE assay are
responsible for adhering to this protocol. It is the responsibility of all
laboratory personnel to bring any deviations or issues to the attention
of their supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Ladybeetle Multicolored Asian (Harmonia Axyridis) IgE: An IgE
antibody specific for allergens from the multicolored Asian lady
beetle, a common cause of allergic reactions in sensitized
individuals.

◦ Coated microtiter plate
◦ IgE standard solutions
◦ Biotinylated detection antibody
◦ Streptavidin-HRP conjugate
◦ TMB substrate
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
Supplies:

1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Serum sample
• Preferred volume: 200 µL
• Stability: Stable at 2-8ºC for up to 7 days. For long-term storage,
freeze at -20ºC or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Ensure all reagents and equipment are at room temperature
before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and other reagents as per the kit
instructions.
3. Standard and Sample Preparation:
◦ Prepare standards by serial dilution in sample diluent.
◦ Dilute serum samples 1:5 in sample diluent (e.g., 20 µL
serum + 80 µL sample diluent).
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards and diluted samples to the
appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Aspirate and wash each well with wash buffer. Repeat the
wash process four times.
◦ Add 100 µL of biotinylated detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 45 minutes.
◦ Repeat the wash step.
◦ Add 100 µL of the Streptavidin-HRP conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Repeat the wash step.
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
5. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 15 minutes of stopping the reaction.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative controls in each run.
• Establish the standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards.
• Analyze Quality Control (QC) samples to ensure the assay is
performing correctly.
• Document and review all QC results to identify and rectify any
discrepancies.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze the data against the standard curve to determine IgE
concentrations.
• Report results in IU/mL.
• Review results for any inconsistencies or values outside expected
ranges. Confirm any outliers with a repeat test if necessary.
