Lambda Light Chain Immunostain -
Analytical Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures and guidelines for performing the
technical component of Lambda Light Chain Immunostaining to
ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable staining results on tissue
sections.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to immunohistochemistry (IHC) laboratory
personnel trained and authorized to perform Lambda Light Chain
Immunostaining procedures on tissue sections.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all IHC laboratory personnel to adhere to the
procedures detailed in this SOP. The IHC supervisor is responsible
for ensuring that staff are trained and maintaining compliance with
this protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections
• Specimen Size: Tissue sections should be cut onto microscope
slides at 3-5 micrometer thickness.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Primary Antibody: Anti-Lambda Light Chain primary antibody
• Detection System: EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB)
• Chromogen: 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Positive Control: Tissue known to express Lambda Light Chain
• Negative Control: Tissue known not to express Lambda Light
Chain or isotype control
• Antigen retrieval solution: Citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA pH 9.0
• Equipment: Automated stainer or manual staining setup,
humidified chamber, microwave/autoclave/pressure cooker for
antigen retrieval, microscope, coverslipper, water bath
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Cut and Mount Tissue Sections:
◦ Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 3-5 micrometer sections.
◦ Mount sections on positively charged slides.
2. Drying:
◦ Dry slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour.
6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize Slides:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene 3 times for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate:
◦ Immerse slides in 100% ethanol 2 times for 3 minutes each.
◦ Immerse slides in 95% ethanol 1 time for 3 minutes.
◦ Immerse slides in 70% ethanol 1 time for 3 minutes.
◦ Immerse slides in distilled water 2 times for 3 minutes each.
6.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Prepare antigen retrieval solution (Citrate buffer pH 6.0 or
EDTA pH 9.0).
◦ Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in
microwave/autoclave/pressure cooker according to
predetermined protocol (e.g., microwave at 90°C for 20
minutes).
◦ Cool slides to room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.4 Blocking
1. Block Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.5 Primary Antibody Application
1. Apply Primary Antibody:
◦ Place slides in a humidified chamber.
◦ Apply primary anti-Lambda Light Chain antibody to each
section.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides for 30 minutes at room temperature or as
specified by the antibody datasheet.
3. Rinsing:
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
6.6 Detection
1. Apply Detection Reagent:
◦ Apply secondary antibody or detection system (e.g.,
EnVision+ System-HRP).
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB substrate to each section.
◦ Monitor color development under the microscope (typically
3-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.7 Counterstaining
1. Apply Hematoxylin:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes.
◦ Rinse in tap water.
◦ Differentiate in 0.1% acid alcohol if necessary.
◦ Bluing by immersing in ammonia water or Scott’s tap water
substitute.
6.8 Dehydration and Clearing
1. Dehydrate:
◦ Immerse slides in 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
◦ Immerse slides in 95% ethanol for 1 minute.
◦ Immerse slides in 100% ethanol for 2 changes, 1 minute
each.
2. Clear:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
6.9 Coverslipping
• Apply mounting medium and coverslip slides.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Include known positive tissue on each slide
run.
• Negative Control: Include known negative tissue or isotype
control on each slide run.
• Documentation: Record the primary antibody lot number,
detection system lot number, chromogen lot number, and any
deviations from the standard procedure.
• Review: Pathologists or supervisors must review and approve all
stained slides for proper IHC staining and control reactions.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Staining results are interpreted and reported by a qualified
pathologist.
• Document technical staining quality, including any issues in the
Quality Control log.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to primary antibody datasheets, detection system guides, and
standard laboratory references for immunohistochemistry
procedures.
10. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all chemicals and biological materials according to their
safety data sheets (SDS).
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent
and accurate immunostaining results for Lambda Light Chain
Immunostains, supporting high-quality diagnostic interpretations.
