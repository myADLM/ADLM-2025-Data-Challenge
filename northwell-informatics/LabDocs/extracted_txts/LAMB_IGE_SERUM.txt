Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for LAMB, IGE, and SERUM
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reliable results for LAMB, IGE,
and SERUM. This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase, from specimen preparation to result generation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all designated staff to
follow the outlined procedures and ensure adherence to quality
control guidelines. Any issues should be reported to a supervisor
immediately.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplates
• ELISA Reader
• Incubators
• Microplate washer
• Reagents for LAMB, IGE, and SERUM assays
• Calibrators and controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN PREPARATION 4.1 Acceptance Criteria:
• Ensure specimens are labeled correctly and match requisitions.
• For LAMB and IGE:
◦ Acceptable specimens: Serum or plasma (EDTA).
◦ Tubes must be completely filled to maintain anaerobic
conditions.
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens should be avoided.
• For SERUM Assays:
◦ Acceptable specimens: Serum.
◦ Specimens must be centrifuged and clot-free.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that do not meet the acceptance criteria.
• Specimens with obvious contamination or excessive hemolysis.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens.
2. Allow specimens to reach room temperature before starting the
assay.
3. Mix specimens gently but thoroughly before aliquoting.
5.2 LAMB and IGE Assay:
1. Setup:
◦ Prepare microplates according to the kit instructions.
◦ Add calibrators, controls, and patient samples to the
appropriate wells as per the assay protocol.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate microplates at the specified temperature and
duration.
◦ Avoid light exposure if required by the assay protocol.
3. Washing:
◦ Use the microplate washer to perform the washing steps
strictly as recommended by the manufacturer.
4. Detection:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time.
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Use the ELISA reader to read absorbances at the specified
wavelength.
7. Quality Control:
◦ Include appropriate controls and calibrators in each assay
run.
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the acceptable range before
validating results.
5.3 SERUM Assay:
1. Setup:
◦ Prepare the assay reagents as per the assay instructions.
◦ Load the samples, calibrators, and controls into the
instrument.
2. Analyzing:
◦ Follow the instrument-specific protocol for the serum assay.
3. Reading Results:
◦ Record the results generated by the instrument.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples alongside patient samples.
◦ Validate results only if quality controls are within the
acceptable range.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and validate results before releasing them.
• Document any deviations or issues during the analytical process
and report to the supervisor.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control for each assay run.
• Keep records of all quality control results.
• Investigate and resolve any quality control failures before
proceeding with patient results.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for LAMB, IGE, and SERUM assay
kits.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Keep a record of all assay runs, including date, technologist’s
initials, and any deviations from the standard procedure.
• Maintain documentation for calibrators and controls used.
10. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• Follow the laboratory’s protocol for corrective actions in case of
equipment malfunction, quality control failure, or other issues
affecting assay performance.
• Document all corrective actions taken in the laboratory log.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the accurate and
reliable generation of LAMB, IGE, and SERUM results, maintaining
high standards of laboratory practice.
