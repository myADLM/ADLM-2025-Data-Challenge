LAMB'S QUARTER, IGE, SERUM TESTING PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to detail and standardize the
analytical phase of generating results for the LAMB'S QUARTER,
IGE, SERUM assay to ensure accurate and reliable results. This
procedure includes equipment preparation, reagent preparation,
assay performance, quality control, and result interpretation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay
and ensuring adherence to this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for monitoring the process and ensuring corrective
actions are implemented when necessary.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Siemens, or
equivalent)
• Lamb's Quarter specific IgE ImmunoCAP or equivalent reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific for the assay
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Specimen tubes (serum) pre-labeled with patient identifier
• Laboratory timer
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Freshly collected serum.
• Volume Required: Minimum of 0.5 mL serum.
• Handling and Stability: Serum samples must be handled at
2-8°C and are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated. For long-
term storage, serum should be aliquotted and stored at -20°C.
3.2 Preparation
• Verify the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated according to
manufacturer instructions.
• Prepare reagents and any required laboratory equipment
according to manufacturer instructions.
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
• Ensure all calibrators and controls are prepared and aliquotted
according to the manufacturer's specifications.
3.3 Assay Procedure
• Step 1: Load calibration standards, controls, patient specimens,
and assay reagents onto the immunoassay analyzer.
• Step 2: Follow the specific run protocol listed in the immunoassay
analyzer instruction manual.
◦ For ImmunoCAP or equivalent systems, typically, the
procedure includes sample dilution, incubation, and washing
steps.
• Step 3: Ensure the analyzer reads and records fluorescence or
chemiluminescent signal intensities and calculates IgE
concentrations.
• Step 4: Upon assay completion, evaluate run acceptability by
verifying that all quality controls are within the specified range.
3.4 Quality Control
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run high, low, and negative controls with each batch of
assays.
◦ Controls must fall within established manufacturer-provided
ranges for the assay to be valid.
◦ If controls fail, investigate potential causes (e.g., reagent
stability, instrument calibration) and do not report patient
results until resolved.
• External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs as available.
◦ Bi-monthly cross-comparisons with proficiency testing samples
should be logged and reviewed.
3.5 Result Interpretation
• Results are typically provided by the analyzer in kU/L (kilo units
per liter).
• Reference intervals specific to the population and determined by
the manufacturer should be used.
◦ Negative: < 0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline/Equivocal: 0.35 - 0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: > 0.70 kU/L
3.6 Result Reporting
• Record results electronically in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Verify results against quality control data before release.
• For specimens with results beyond the linear range, dilute the
serum sample appropriately and reanalyze.
Critical Results:
• High levels (>100 kU/L) should be verified, and critical values
communicated to the provider per institutional policy.
3.7 Documentation and Records
• Maintain detailed logs of all completed assays, including calibrator
and control data, as well as sample result printouts.
• Retain all documentation following institutional and regulatory
guidelines.
References:
• ImmunoCAP Product Insert (or equivalent)
• Manufacturer-specific analyzer manual
• Internal Laboratory Quality Standards
Notes:
• Always use appropriate PPE and follow biosafety procedures
when handling serum samples and reagents.
• Maintain adherence to all local and national regulations governing
laboratory testing and reporting.
By following this SOP, the laboratory will ensure reliable and accurate
assessment of Lamb's Quarter specific IgE levels in serum samples
with appropriate documentation and quality control practices in place.
