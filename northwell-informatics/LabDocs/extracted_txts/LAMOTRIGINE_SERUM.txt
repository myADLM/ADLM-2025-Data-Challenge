Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Title:
Analytical Procedure for Quantification of Lamotrigine in Serum
Effective Date:
October 2023
1. Purpose
To outline the standardized procedure for the accurate and precise
quantification of lamotrigine levels in serum samples using High-
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. This
protocol ensures reliable results that aid in therapeutic drug
monitoring in clinical settings.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff performing lamotrigine
serum level testing. It ensures consistency and compliance with
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) requirements.
3. Responsibility
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform sample analysis following
these guidelines.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to protocol, handle
troubleshooting, and oversee quality control.
• Quality Assurance Team: Monitor compliance and review quality
control data.
4. Equipment and Materials
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) with UV
detector
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Lamotrigine reference standard
• HPLC-grade solvents: Methanol, Acetonitrile, Water
• Serum sample tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Reagent vials
• Calibrated glassware
• Laboratory logbooks
5. Reagents
• Mobile phase: Pre-mixed HPLC-grade methanol:water (60:40 v/v)
• Calibration standards: Prepared from the lamotrigine reference
standard in methanol
• Internal standard (if applicable)
• Control samples: Known concentration of lamotrigine in serum
6. Safety Precautions
• Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE)—lab coat,
gloves, and safety goggles.
• Handle solvents and lamotrigine reference standards in a fume
hood.
• Dispose of waste according to the laboratory’s hazardous waste
disposal protocol.
7. Procedure
7.1 Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Requirement:
◦ Collect a minimum of 5 mL of serum from a patient's clotted
whole blood sample.
◦ Ensure samples are properly labeled with patient identifiers
and collection time.
◦ Serum should be separated from the clot as soon as
possible, ideally within 2 hours post-collection.
2. Preparation Steps:
◦ Centrifuge the serum sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to
ensure complete separation of serum from clot.
◦ Transfer the supernatant (serum) into a clean labeled vial.
7.2 Calibration and Controls
1. Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare calibration standards at multiple concentrations
(e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 µg/mL) by diluting the
lamotrigine reference standard in methanol.
◦ Store standards at 2-8°C when not in use.
2. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Include at least one high and one low lamotrigine
concentration in the quality control samples.
◦ Perform quality control at the beginning and end of each
analytical run and after every 20 samples.
7.3 HPLC Analysis
1. System Setup:
◦ Equilibrate the HPLC system with the mobile phase until a
stable baseline is achieved.
◦ Set the UV detector to 215 nm wavelength.
2. Injection and Analysis:
◦ Inject 20 µL of each calibration standard, quality control, and
serum sample into the HPLC system.
◦ Record retention times and peak areas for lamotrigine.
3. Data Collection:
◦ Analyze the peak area under each lamotrigine
chromatogram.
◦ Use calibration curve to quantify lamotrigine concentration in
serum samples.
7.4 Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
1. Temperature Control:
◦ Ensure the column temperature is stable per manufacturer’s
recommendation, typically around 25°C.
◦ Document any deviations in temperature and correct them
accordingly.
2. Peak Resolution:
◦ If peaks are not well-resolved, consider adjusting the mobile
phase composition or flow rate.
◦ Document any changes made to the protocol.
7.5 Documentation and Reporting
1. Results Documentation:
◦ Record sample identification, date, time, initials of analyzer,
peak areas, retention times, and calculated concentrations
in the laboratory logbook.
◦ Ensure all quality control results are within acceptable limits
before sample results are validated.
2. Reporting:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and verification.
◦ Notify the healthcare provider if levels are critically high or
low as per laboratory critical value policy.
7.6 Quality Control and Assurance
• Run calibration and control samples at scheduled intervals to
ensure instrument accuracy.
• Review QC data daily to ensure compliance with acceptable
performance standards.
• Investigate any deviations, implement corrective actions, and
document these in the QC log.
