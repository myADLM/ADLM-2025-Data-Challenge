Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Langerin Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the standardized and consistent
preparation and staining of tissue specimens for the detection of
Langerin using immunohistochemistry stains in the laboratory. This
protocol outlines the steps required to perform the technical
component of the Langerin immunostain, ensuring accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the Langerin immunostain procedures as described in this
SOP. All staff members should ensure compliance with this procedure
to maintain high standards of laboratory practice.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimens:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Corresponding unstained tissue sections mounted on
positively charged microscope slides (4-5 microns in
thickness).
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are not properly fixed.
◦ Frozen sections or inadequately processed tissues.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Drying oven
• Staining racks
• Humid chamber
• Microtome blades
• Positively charged slides
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Langerin primary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., secondary antibody and DAB substrate)
• Wash buffers (PBS, TBS)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
1. REAGENT PREPARATION AND STORAGE
• Langerin Primary Antibody:
◦ Store as indicated by the manufacturer. Typically stored at
2-8°C.
• Detection System:
◦ Prepare and store according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Buffers:
◦ Prepare PBS or TBS buffer fresh or store at room temperature
if pre-prepared.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Slides:
1. Cut 4-5 microns thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C.
3. Mount sections onto positively charged slides.
4. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour or place slides in a
drying rack at room temperature overnight.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Immerse slides in xylene (three changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate through a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%;
2 minutes each).
3. Wash slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using a microwave or
pressure cooker with an appropriate antigen retrieval buffer
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0).
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 2 minutes.
D. Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Encircle sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
2. Apply blocking solution and incubate as recommended,
typically for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Tap off excess blocking solution.
4. Apply the Langerin primary antibody and incubate as per the
manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., 60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humid chamber).
5. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer (3 changes, 2 minutes each).
6. Apply the detection system (secondary antibody, then DAB
substrate) following the manufacturer's protocol.
7. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer (3 changes, 2 minutes each).
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse thoroughly in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%, 100%; 1
minute each).
4. Clear in xylene (two changes, 1 minute each).
5. Mount with coverslip using appropriate mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform positive and negative control tissues with each run to
ensure staining specificity and sensitivity.
• Document any deviations of expected staining.
• Ensure all reagents are within expiration dates and properly
stored.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The technical component involves preparing and staining the
slides only. Results interpretation should be performed by a
qualified pathologist.
• Document and file staining and reaction conditions for each
specimen.
• Store slides appropriately until reviewed and finalized by the
interpreting pathologist.
