Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for LANGUST (LOBSTER), IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical process of measuring specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
antibodies against LANGUST (LOBSTER) in serum using a CLIA-
certified immunoassay platform, ensuring accurate and reliable test
results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel in the Immunology
Section responsible for performing and validating the IgE assays for
LANGUST (LOBSTER) on received serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay as per the protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring compliance and
ensuring that corrective actions are taken as needed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
4.1 Specimen Type: - Serum
4.2 Specimen Collection and Handling: - Freshly collected blood
specimens should be allowed to clot and then centrifuged to obtain
serum. - If not analyzed immediately, serum should be aliquoted and
stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C
or colder. - Ensure specimen tubes are properly labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
4.3 Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. - Specimens received in EDTA, citrate, or heparin tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment: - Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250 or
equivalent). - Centrifuge. - Pipettes and associated tips. - Vortex
mixer. - Thermometer for temperature monitoring of storage
conditions.
5.2 Reagents: - IgE calibration standard. - Control serum (positive
and negative controls). - Anti-human IgE conjugate. - Substrate
solution. - Wash buffer. - Stop solution.
5.3 Supplies: - Sample tubes. - Reaction cups. - Disposable gloves.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Calibration and Quality Control: - Perform calibration using IgE
calibration standards according to manufacturer’s instructions each
time a new reagent kit lot is opened or as required. - Run positive
and negative control serums with each batch of samples to ensure
the assay is performing correctly.
6.2 Sample Preparation: - Allow all reagents and samples to reach
room temperature before starting the assay (18-25°C). - Mix each
serum sample gently by inverting or using a vortex mixer.
6.3 Analytical Procedure: - Program the immunoassay analyzer
according to the specific IgE assay protocol for LANGUST
(LOBSTER). - Load the samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated positions on the analyzer. - Follow the analyzer's
instructions to start the assay, ensuring all washing steps are
performed as per the manufacturer's guidelines. - Upon completion,
review the results generated by the analyzer.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
7.1 Result Interpretation: - Compare patient sample results to the
calibration curve generated by the analyzer. - Results are generally
expressed in kU/L (kilounits per liter).
7.2 Reference Ranges: - Negative: < 0.35 kU/L - Borderline/
Equivocal: 0.35 – 0.70 kU/L - Positive: > 0.70 kU/L
7.3 Reporting Results: - Results are automatically transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) once verified by the
technologist. - For any results falling outside the normal range, add
appropriate comments and notify the attending physician if required. -
If there are any discrepancies or unusual findings, re-run the sample
and/or notify the supervisor for further action.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION
8.1 Documentation: - Record all calibration, control, and patient
sample results in the appropriate logbooks or LIS. - Document any
deviations from the standard procedure and the corrective actions
taken.
8.2 Quality Control: - Participate in external quality assessment
programs for IgE testing. - Perform internal quality control evaluations
bi-weekly by comparing results across different analyzers if available.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
9.1 Common Issues: - Low signal: Check reagents and analyzer for
proper functioning and expiration dates. - High background: Ensure
proper washing steps and avoid cross-contamination. - Invalid
results: Re-run the test and ensure sample integrity.
9.2 Corrective Actions: - Follow instrument-specific guidelines for
troubleshooting and consult the manufacturer’s technical support if
necessary.
