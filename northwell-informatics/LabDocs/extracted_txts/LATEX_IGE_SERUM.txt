Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for LATEX, IGE, SERUM
Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase procedure
for the LATEX, IGE, and SERUM tests to ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable generation of results. This procedure will cover
the analytical instruments used, the method of analysis, the steps to
be taken to ensure quality control, and the reporting of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All personnel performing LATEX, IGE, and SERUM testing must be
acquainted with this procedure and are responsible for adhering to
the outlined steps. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
ensuring that all staff follow this SOP and that corrective actions are
taken when necessary.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• LATEX, IGE, SERUM Analyzer (specify model, e.g., Phadia
ImmunoCAP 250)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubators
Reagents:
• Calibrators
• Control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Buffers and diluents
• Latex reagents
• IgE reagents
• Serum reagents
4. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Pre-Analytical Checks
1.1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are fit for use and have not
surpassed their expiration date. 1.2. Verify that the sample accession
numbers correlate with the work list.
Step 2: Specimen Preparation
2.1. Centrifuge serum samples at 1500-2000 RCF for 10 minutes to
obtain a clear supernatant. 2.2. Aliquot serum samples into
appropriately labeled tubes if necessary.
Step 3: Calibration
3.1. Perform calibration using the provided calibrators as required by
the instrument manufacturer, typically once per day or as needed.
3.2. Document calibrations in the Instrument Calibration Log.
Step 4: Quality Control
4.1. Run positive and negative control materials at the beginning of
each analytical run. 4.2. Document control results in the Quality
Control Log. 4.3. Verify control results fall within acceptable ranges. If
control results are out of range, do not proceed with specimen testing
until the issue is resolved. 4.4. Perform instrument maintenance
checks as outlined by the manufacturer.
Step 5: Analytical Procedure
5.1. Set up the analyzer with the appropriate assay kits for LATEX,
IGE, and SERUM. 5.2. Load the prepared serum samples into the
sample tray of the analyzer. 5.3. Program the analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions for each specific test to be performed.
5.4. Initiate the analysis run.
Step 6: Interpretation of Results
6.1. Once the run is complete, retrieve the results from the analyzer.
6.2. Review all results for any flags or errors. Repeat testing if
necessary. 6.3. Compare sample results to established reference
ranges for LATEX, IGE, and SERUM assays.
Step 7: Reporting Results
7.1. Transmit results from the analyzer to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). 7.2. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by the
technologist before reporting. 7.3. Critical or abnormal results should
be flagged in the LIS per laboratory policy.
Step 8: Post-Analytical Protocol
8.1. Store tested samples in a refrigerated environment at 2-8°C for
any potential retesting. 8.2. Perform end-of-day maintenance on the
analyzer, ensuring cleanliness and readiness for the next testing day.
8.3. Document all maintenance activities in the Instrument
Maintenance Log.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Control Frequency:
• Calibrator Checks: Daily or as per manufacturer's protocol
• Control Runs: At the start of each testing session, using both
positive and negative controls
Troubleshooting Steps:
5.1. If quality control materials are outside of expected ranges:
• Re-run the controls to confirm results.
• Check reagent integrity and calibration status.
• Perform additional troubleshooting as recommended by the
instrument manufacturer.
5.2. If instrument errors or flags occur:
• Refer to the instrument's error code guide and follow
recommended actions.
• Consult with laboratory supervisor for persistent or unclear issues.
• Document all corrective actions in the Corrective Action Log.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s User Manual for LATEX, IGE, SERUM Analyzer
(e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP 250).
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) Manual.
• Internal Quality Control and Maintenance Manuals.
• Current laboratory guidelines and regulations.
7. DOCUMENTATION
All activities involving the preparation, calibration, control verification,
test performance, result reporting, and maintenance must be
documented in the respective logs and retained as part of the
laboratory's records for quality assurance.
