Standard Operating Procedure for LDL Cholesterol,
Direct Measurement
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
method and processes for the analytical determination of Low-
Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol using a direct assay.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all staff responsible for
performing LDL Cholesterol, Direct testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to
follow this SOP when performing LDL Cholesterol, Direct
tests.
◦ It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that all staff
are trained and competent in performing the procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Accepted Specimen Type: Serum or plasma collected using
an SST (Serum Separator Tube) or Lithium Heparin tube.
◦ Preferred Volume: 1 mL of serum or plasma.
◦ Stability: Store specimens at 2-25°C for up to 5 days. For
long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Specimens that are hemolyzed, icteric or lipemic beyond
acceptable levels.
▪ Specimens in anticoagulants other than lithium heparin.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Analyzer: XYZ Automated Chemistry Analyzer
◦ Reagents: Direct LDL-Cholesterol Reagent Kit
▪ Reagent 1: Enzymatic pre-treatment reagent
▪ Reagent 2: Enzymatic reaction reagent
◦ Calibration Standards: Provided by the manufacturer
◦ Quality Control Material: Two-level control material (normal
and abnormal)
6. PROCEDURE A. Calibration:
1. Calibrate the instrument as per the manufacturer's
instructions using the provided calibration standards.
2. Calibration must be performed:
▪ With each new lot of reagents
▪ After major maintenance or repair of the analyzer
▪ As specified by the manufacturer's guidelines
B. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples, or at least once daily.
2. Perform quality control at two levels (normal and
abnormal).
3. Evaluate quality control results before running patient
samples. If controls are out of acceptable limits,
troubleshoot and resolve issues before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
4. Document all quality control results and any corrective
actions taken in the QC log.
C. Specimen Preparation:
1. Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature
before analysis.
2. Mix specimens gently by inversion.
D. Analytical Procedure:
1. Load specimens into the sample rack of the XYZ
Automated Chemistry Analyzer.
2. Select the Direct LDL-Cholesterol test mode on the
analyzer.
3. The analyzer will automatically mix, incubate, and
measure the LDL-Cholesterol concentration using the
provided reagents.
4. Results will be displayed and automatically transferred to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Reference Interval:
▪ <100 mg/dL: Optimal
▪ 100-129 mg/dL: Near or above optimal
▪ 130-159 mg/dL: Borderline high
▪ 160-189 mg/dL: High
▪ ≥190 mg/dL: Very high
◦ Verify and review all results before reporting.
◦ Critical values must be promptly communicated to the
requesting clinician as per the laboratory’s critical result
policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the Direct LDL-Cholesterol Reagent Kit insert for
specific limitations related to interfering substances and
assay performance.
◦ Ensure that specimens are not hemolyzed or lipemic to
avoid interference.

10. REVISIONS
• This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in methodology, equipment, or reagent
specifications.
