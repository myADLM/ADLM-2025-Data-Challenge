SOP: Analysis and Reporting of Direct LDL Cholesterol
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
Direct LDL Cholesterol levels using the Roche/Hitachi Cobas c501/
Modular Systems.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis and documenting all steps and results
according to this procedure. All staff are responsible for identifying
and flagging any results or equipment issues that may affect the
quality of the results and reporting them to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Specimen type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection tube: Serum separating tube (SST) or lithium-heparin,
EDTA plasma.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
Unacceptable:
• Samples that are lipemic, hemolyzed, or icteric beyond the
acceptable range.
• Specimens with inappropriate or missing patient identification.
• Samples older than 48 hours if stored at 2-8 °C or 6 months if
stored at -20 °C or below without prior testing.
Sample Handling:
• Centrifuge specimens within 2 hours of collection to separate
serum/plasma.
• Store serum/plasma at 2-8°C if testing is delayed for up to 48
hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C or colder for long-term storage.
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix well before
testing.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Roche/Hitachi Cobas c501/ Modular Systems.
• Direct LDL Cholesterol Reagent.
• Controls: Roche PreciControl ClinChem Multi 1 and 2.
• Calibrators: Roche Calibrator f.a.s. Lipids II.
• Pipettes and tips.
• PPE: Gloves, lab coat, and face shield.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration:
• Perform calibration using Roche Calibrator f.a.s. Lipids II on the
Roche/Hitachi Cobas c501/Modular Systems following the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Calibrate the instrument at least once a month or after reagent lot
changes.
• Document all calibration activities in the calibration log.
B) Quality Control:
• Analyze two levels of controls (PreciControl ClinChem Multi 1 and
2) at the beginning of each shift, after calibration, and after any
significant maintenance.
• Run controls after every 30 patient samples.
• Review control results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document QC results and any corrective action taken in the QC
log.
C) Patient Sample Analysis:
1. Load patient samples onto the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Select the Direct LDL Cholesterol testing method.
3. Follow the instrument prompts to initiate analysis.
4. The system automatically measures sample, processes, and
calculates LDL cholesterol levels.
5. Review automatic flags and error codes, if any, and take
corrective actions as specified in the troubleshooting section of
the user manual.
6. Document any corrective action taken.
D) Result Review and Reporting:
1. Verify all results, ensuring calibration and QC are within
acceptable limits.
2. If results fall within critical ranges, adhere to the laboratory's
protocol for critical values.
3. Report results via the LIS, ensuring they meet the following
reference intervals:
◦ Desirable Level: <100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L)
◦ Near/Above Optimal: 100-129 mg/dL (2.6-3.34 mmol/L)
◦ Borderline High: 130-159 mg/dL (3.35-4.12 mmol/L)
◦ High: 160-189 mg/dL (4.13-4.90 mmol/L)
◦ Very High: ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.91 mmol/L)
4. For results outside analytic measurement range, report values
as "<15 mg/dL" or ">600 mg/dL" dependent on the test system
limits.
5. Validate and release results through the LIS after ensuring all
data is accurate and complete.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the Roche Cobas c501
product insert for specific limitations related to Direct LDL
Cholesterol testing, including interference and analytical range.
7. MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance of the Roche/
Hitachi Cobas c501 following the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all performed maintenance activities in the
maintenance log.
• Address any instrument malfunctions immediately according to
troubleshooting protocols, and notify the supervisor.
