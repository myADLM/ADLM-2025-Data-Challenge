Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Lead in 24-
Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the accurate and precise
determination of lead concentration in a 24-hour urine specimen. This
protocol ensures the integrity of the sample, accurate instrument
performance, and reliable results, which are critical for patient
diagnosis and treatment decisions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel must adhere to this protocol.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and for
addressing any issues arising that may affect test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• 24-hour urine collection.
Collection and Storage:
• Collect urine for 24 hours in a container provided by the
laboratory, which contains a preservative (e.g., nitric acid).
• The collection container must be refrigerated during the collection
period if specified.
• Record the total volume of urine collected.
• Mix the collected urine thoroughly before aliquoting.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not well-mixed.
• Specimens collected without the proper preservative or not
refrigerated, if specified.
• Containers not labeled with patient identification and collection
time, date, and total volume.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Acid-washed glassware and plasticware
• Calibration standards
Reagents:
• Nitric acid for preservation and urine digestion
• Certified lead standards for calibration
• Calibration blanks and quality control (QC) standards
• Deionized water
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
2. Measure and record the total volume of the collected urine.
3. Aliquot a suitable volume (e.g., 10 mL) of the urine into an acid-
washed container.
4. Add an appropriate amount of concentrated nitric acid to the
aliquot for digestion (typically using a 1:1 to 5:1 ratio).
5. Digest the urine sample using a microwave digester or hotplate
as per the laboratory's validated method.
6. After digestion, dilute the sample to the required volume with
deionized water.
Instrument Calibration:
1. Prepare lead standard solutions by serial dilution from a
certified stock solution.
2. Prepare a calibration curve by analyzing these standards.
3. Include a blank and various concentrations covering the
expected range of lead in urine.
Sample Analysis:
1. Set up the ICP-MS or AAS according to the manufacturer's
instructions and validated parameters.
2. Verify the instrument calibration using QC standards.
3. Run QC samples to ensure system suitability before analyzing
patient samples.
4. Analyze diluted urine samples, ensuring any samples outside
the calibration range are re-diluted and re-analyzed.
5. Include internal standards or matrix-matching standards to
correct for potential matrix effects.
Quality Control:
1. Analyze QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
2. If QC results are out of the acceptable range, recalibrate the
instrument and rerun the patient samples.
3. Document all quality control measures and any corrective
actions taken.
6. RESULT CALCULATION AND VALIDATION
• Calculate the concentration of lead in the 24-hour urine specimen
using the instrument's software.
• Perform a final verification of results by reviewing the calibration
curve and QC results.
• Calculate the total lead excretion over 24 hours using the formula:
Total Lead (µg/24 hours) = Lead concentration
(µg/L) × Total urine volume (L)
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and verify all results.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
clinical review.
• Flag any critical or significantly elevated levels according to the
laboratory's reporting guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences from other metals may affect results and should be
considered and addressed by appropriate sample preparation.
• The accuracy of results may be impaired by improper sample
collection or preservation.
9. REFERENCES
• ICP-MS or AAS manufacturer’s user manual.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for trace
metal analysis.
• Relevant peer-reviewed journals and articles on lead exposure
and its health impacts.
