Protocol for the Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Lead,
Capillary, with Demographics, Blood
1. Purpose This protocol describes the steps to generate results
for lead testing in capillary blood samples. The steps include
sample preparation, analysis, result documentation, and
reporting, ensuring adherence to quality control standards.
2. Responsibility
◦ Laboratory scientists and technicians are responsible for
performing and documenting analytical steps.
◦ Supervisors ensure protocol compliance and resolve any
deviations or issues.
◦ All staff members ensure accurate data entry and timely
notification of abnormal results.
3. Specimen Requirements
◦ Collected capillary blood sample in accordance with SOP for
Specimen Collection.
◦ Preferred volume: 100 µL.
◦ Samples must be correctly labeled with patient
demographics: Name, Date of Birth, Collection Date, Time,
and Technician ID.
4. Analytical Procedure
A. Equipment and Reagents
◦ LeadCare Analyzer or any other CLIA-approved analyzer
calibrated for blood lead testing.
◦ LeadCare Test Kit or equivalent.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and
lab coat.
◦ Biohazard waste containers for disposal.
B. Quality Controls
◦ Use two levels of control material (low and high) with every
new lot of test kits and with each assay batch.
◦ Follow internal QC procedures and document results on the
QC log.
C. Sample Preparation
◦ Ensure capillary blood sample is at room temperature and
well mixed.
◦ Extract 50 µL of the sample using a micropipette.
D. Sample Analysis
◦ Turn on the LeadCare Analyzer and allow it to calibrate.
◦ Apply the sample to the test cartridge following the
LeadCare Test Kit instructions.
◦ Insert the cartridge into the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the analysis by starting the LeadCare Analyzer.
◦ Wait for the analyzer to process the sample and produce the
reading.
5. Calculating and Interpreting Results
◦ The LeadCare Analyzer will display the lead concentration in
µg/dL.
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
along with patient demographics.
◦ Compare results to the reference intervals:
▪ Reference Interval: <5 µg/dL
▪ Actionable/Abnormal Level: ≥5 µg/dL
6. Documentation and Reporting
◦ Ensure that the generated results are accurately entered
into the LIS along with patient demographics.
◦ Verify results by a qualified laboratory scientist or technician.
◦ Abnormal or critical results (levels ≥10 µg/dL) should be
promptly reported to the ordering physician and
documented.
◦ Print a hard copy of the result for the patient’s file if required.
7. Quality Assurance
◦ Perform daily calibration checks as specified by the
LeadCare Analyzer guidelines.
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
◦ Conduct regular instrument maintenance as per
manufacturer’s recommendations and document all
maintenance activities.
8. Troubleshooting
◦ If the analyzer does not function correctly, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the LeadCare Analyzer manual.
◦ For persistent issues, contact technical support and notify
the supervisor.
◦ Document any deviations or problems encountered during
the procedure and the corrective actions taken.
9. Safety Considerations
◦ Follow standard safety protocols including use of PPE.
◦ Dispose of biological waste in appropriately labeled
biohazard containers.
◦ Handle all reagents and samples according to the
laboratory’s chemical hygiene plan and bloodborne
pathogens standard.
