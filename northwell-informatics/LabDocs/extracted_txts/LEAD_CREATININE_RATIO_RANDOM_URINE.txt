Lead/Creatinine Ratio, Random Urine Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standard procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for the Lead/Creatinine
ratio in random urine samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated staff involved in the analysis of urine samples for Lead/
Creatinine ratio must adhere to these procedures to ensure accurate
and reliable results. Supervisors must ensure that all staff are trained
and compliance is maintained.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: – Preferred: 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean,
dry container without any preservatives. – Unacceptable: Specimens
arriving more than 24 hours after collection, specimens without
collection date/time indicated, or visibly contaminated specimens.
Stability: – Specimens should ideally be analyzed within 24 hours of
collection to ensure accuracy. If storage is necessary, samples
should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed within 72 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: – Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for lead analysis. –
Automated Urine Analyzer or appropriate equipment for creatinine
analysis.
Reagents: – Standard solutions for calibration of lead measurements.
– Reagents specific to creatinine analysis (as per the chosen
method).
Supplies: – Clean, dry containers for random urine collection. –
Pipettes for sample handling. – Calibration and quality control
solutions for both lead and creatinine measurements.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Bring all specimens to room temperature prior to analysis.
2. Mix urine sample thoroughly but gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot appropriate volume for lead analysis (e.g., 5 mL) and
creatinine analysis (e.g., 1 mL).
B) Lead Analysis:
1. Calibration: a. Prepare standard solutions for calibration
according to manufacturer’s instructions. b. Run calibration
standards on AAS or ICP-MS. c. Ensure calibration curve
meets acceptable criteria (e.g., R² > 0.99).
2. Sample Analysis: a. Pipette aliquot of urine sample into
appropriate container. b. Follow equipment instructions for lead
detection (e.g., digest sample if required). c. Perform analysis
and record lead concentration in µg/L.
C) Creatinine Analysis:
1. Calibration: a. Prepare standard solutions according to
manufacturer’s instructions. b. Run calibration standards on the
automated urine analyzer. c. Ensure calibration curve meets
acceptable criteria.
2. Sample Analysis: a. Pipette aliquot of urine sample into
appropriate container. b. Follow equipment instructions for
creatinine detection. c. Perform analysis and record creatinine
concentration in mg/dL.
D) Ratio Calculation:
1. Calculate the Lead/Creatinine ratio using the formula: Lead (µg/
L) / Creatinine (mg/dL)
2. Record and verify the ratio.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Run internal and external quality controls for both lead and
creatinine measurements: a. Daily Quality Control: Analyze
control samples at different levels (low, medium, high). b.
Record control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges. c. Investigate and correct any deviations or anomalies.
5. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of analytical
equipment according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Review, verify, and validate results prior to reporting.
8. Results should be automatically transmitted to the LIS and
reviewed by the technologist.
9. Report any critical values and inform the appropriate healthcare
provider.
Reference Intervals: – Lead: Refer to reference intervals provided in
product insert or established by the laboratory. – Creatinine: Refer to
reference intervals defined for patient demographics (e.g., age,
gender).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific product insert for limitations regarding lead and
creatinine detection.
