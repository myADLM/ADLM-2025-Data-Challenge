Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lead/Creatinine Ratio in Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized procedure for the analysis of lead
and creatinine in urine specimens to generate accurate and reliable
lead/creatinine ratio results for clinical interpretation.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the analysis
of urine specimens for lead and creatinine, ensuring adherence to
this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all laboratory staff
are adequately trained and that quality control measures are
followed.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the laboratory analysis of urine specimens
for the determination of the lead/creatinine ratio using atomic
absorption spectrometry and enzymatic creatinine assays.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: 10 mL of a random urine sample collected in a sterile
container.
• Unacceptable: Urine specimens with visible contamination,
insufficient volume, or without proper labeling of collection date
and time.
Handling and Storage:
• Transport specimens to the laboratory at 2-8°C.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 24
hours, or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Atomic Absorption Spectrometer
• Creatinine Analyzer (e.g., Jaffe method on automated chemistry
analyzer)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Water bath or heating block
Reagents:
• Lead standard solutions
• Matrix modifier for lead analysis
• Creatinine reagent kits
• Quality Control (QC) materials: controls with known
concentrations of lead and creatinine
Supplies:
• Sterile urine collection containers
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Analytical balance
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Lead Analysis (by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry) a.
Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Materials: i. Prepare
calibration standards for lead in urine in a range from 0 to 100 µg/L
using lead nitrate. ii. Prepare QC materials with low, medium, and
high concentrations of lead.
b. Sample Preparation: i. Centrifuge urine samples at 3000 RPM for
10 minutes to remove particulates. ii. Transfer the supernatant to
clean microcentrifuge tubes.
c. Analysis: i. Set up the atomic absorption spectrometer according to
the manufacturer's instructions. ii. Introduce blank, calibration
standards, and QC materials to establish the calibration curve. iii.
Run urine samples, calibration standards, and QC materials. iv.
Record absorbance readings and calculate lead concentrations using
the calibration curve.
5.2 Creatinine Analysis (by Enzymatic Assay) a. Preparation of
Calibration Standards and QC Materials: i. Prepare calibration
standards for creatinine in a range from 0 to 500 mg/dL using a
creatinine standard solution. ii. Prepare QC materials with known
creatinine concentrations.
b. Sample Analysis: i. Set up the creatinine analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions. ii. Run calibrators and QC materials to
generate the calibration curve. iii. Introduce urine samples to the
analyzer. iv. Record creatinine concentrations.
5.3 Calculation of Lead/Creatinine Ratio a. For each urine sample,
calculate the lead/creatinine ratio using the following formula: Lead/
Creatinine Ratio (µg/g) = (Lead concentration (µg/L) / Creatinine
concentration (mg/dL)) * 100
b. Document the results for clinical reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. QC Analysis: i. Run QC materials at the start of the day, and after
every 10 samples to ensure system accuracy and precision. ii.
Ensure QC results fall within the predefined acceptable ranges.
b. Corrective Actions: i. If QC results are outside acceptable limits,
perform troubleshooting steps as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
ii. Repeat the analysis for any affected samples after resolving any
issues.
c. Documentation: i. Record all QC results in the QC log. ii.
Document any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by the authorized personnel.
• Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician
according to laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE RANGES
• Lead: < 5 µg/dL (values may vary depending on age and sex)
• Creatinine: 40-300 mg/dL (values may vary depending on age
and sex)
• Lead/Creatinine Ratio: Values to be interpreted in conjunction with
clinical context and reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are free from hemoglobin, as hemolysis can
affect creatinine readings.
• Matrix effects can interfere with lead detection; therefore, an
appropriate matrix modifier is essential for accurate results.
