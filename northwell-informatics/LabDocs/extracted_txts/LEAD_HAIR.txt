Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Lead in Hair
Samples
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analysis of lead
concentrations in hair samples. The goal is to ensure accurate and
reliable results by following standardized methods and ensuring
quality control throughout the analytical process.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform
lead analysis according to this SOP and ensure all equipment is
calibrated and maintained.
• Supervisors must verify that all personnel are trained and
competent in performing this analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Analytical balance (accurate to 0.0001 g)
• Centrifuge
• Hot block digestion system
• Ultra-pure deionized water
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Hydrogen peroxide (trace metal grade)
• Certified hair reference material
• Plastic or glass digestion tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles
1. SAMPLE PREPARATION
3.1 Collection and Accessioning
• Hair samples must be collected as per the standard sample
collection procedure.
• Upon receipt, ensure that the samples are correctly labeled and
have accompanying documentation.
3.2 Washing and Drying
• Cut a small portion (approximately 0.5 g) from the received hair
sample.
• Wash the hair samples three times with ultra-pure deionized water
and once with acetone to remove any external contaminants.
• Allow the samples to air dry overnight at room temperature on a
clean surface.
3.3 Weighing
• Accurately weigh approximately 0.1 g of the washed and dried
hair sample using the analytical balance.
• Record the exact weight of the sample.
1. DIGESTION PROCEDURE
4.1 Prepare the Hot Block Digestion System
• Ensure the block temperature is set to 95°C.
• Place the digestion tubes in the block.
4.2 Digest the Hair Samples
• Add 5 mL of nitric acid (trace metal grade) to each digestion tube
containing the weighed hair sample.
• Cap the tubes and heat on the hot block at 95°C for 1 hour.
• Allow tubes to cool to room temperature.
4.3 Hydrogen Peroxide Addition
• Add 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide (trace metal grade) to each
cooled digestion tube.
• Return the tubes to the hot block for an additional 30 minutes at
95°C.
• Allow the tubes to cool completely before proceeding.
4.4 Final Volume Adjustment
• Transfer the digested sample solution to a 50 mL volumetric flask
and adjust the volume with ultra-pure deionized water.
• Mix thoroughly using the vortex mixer.
1. ICMP-MS ANALYSIS
5.1 Set Up the ICP-MS
• Verify that the ICP-MS is calibrated with appropriate calibration
standards and that the performance check is within acceptable
limits.
• Ensure that quality control samples such as blanks, replicates,
and certified reference materials are prepared and included in the
run.
5.2 Sample Introduction and Analysis
• Aspirate the digested hair sample solutions into the ICP-MS
system.
• Analyze the samples for lead content.
• Document any observations or anomalies during the analysis run.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Calibration Standards
• Prepare calibration standards at appropriate concentration
ranges.
• Run a calibration curve before sample analysis and verify linearity.
6.2 Quality Control Samples
• Include a minimum of one blank, one certified hair reference
material, and one replicate per batch of samples.
• Verify that quality control samples fall within acceptable ranges
before continuing with sample analysis.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
7.1 Data Analysis
• Analyze the data generated by the ICP-MS and compute the lead
concentrations in µg/g of hair.
7.2 Verification
• Review the results for accuracy and precision.
• Verify that each sample result is within the specified method
performance criteria.
7.3 Documentation and Reporting
• Compile the final report with lead concentrations and any
annotations regarding sample integrity or quality control.
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by the laboratory technologist before releasing the report.
1. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Ensure regular maintenance of the ICP-MS and calibration of all
analytical balances as per manufacturer guidelines.
• Document all maintenance and calibration activities.
