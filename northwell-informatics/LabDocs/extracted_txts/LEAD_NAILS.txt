Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lead in Nails
1. PURPOSE
To define the analytical procedure for the determination of lead levels
in nail samples utilizing the appropriate instrumentation and
methodologies to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this procedure
correctly. The laboratory manager is responsible for ensuring all staff
members are trained and competent in performing this procedure.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of nail samples for the
detection and quantification of lead.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS)
• Clean laboratory glassware (Digestion tubes, Pipettes, Volumetric
flasks)
• Microwave digestion system
• Analytical balance (capable of weighing to the nearest 0.0001g)
• Polypropylene or Teflon digestion vessels
• Certified reference materials and standards for lead
• Nitric acid (HNO3), ultra-pure
• Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ultra-pure
• Deionized water (18 MΩ)
3.2. REAGENTS PREPARATION
• Nitric Acid (10% v/v): Dilute ultra-pure HNO3 with deionized
water.
• Lead Standards: Prepare a series of standard lead solutions
from the certified stock solution for calibration.
3.3. SAMPLE PREPARATION
• Collection and Pre-treatment:
◦ Ensure nail samples are free from external contaminants.
Clean with a brush or wash with deionized water if necessary.
◦ Dry the samples at room temperature until constant weight is
achieved.
• Weighing:
◦ Weigh approximately 0.1-0.5 grams of nail material to the
nearest 0.0001g and record the weight.
• Digestion:
◦ Place weighed nail samples into digestion vessels.
◦ Add 5 mL of nitric acid and 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide to each
vessel.
◦ Seal the vessels and digest the samples using a microwave
digestion system according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(typical conditions: ramp to 180°C, hold for 20 minutes).
◦ Allow the vessels to cool down to room temperature before
opening.
• Dilution:
◦ Transfer digested sample solutions to volumetric flasks and
dilute with deionized water to a final volume (e.g., 50 mL).
3.4. INSTRUMENT CALIBRATION AND ANALYSIS
• Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS or AAS instrument using the prepared
lead standards.
◦ Run a blank sample and verify the instrument’s baseline
response.
◦ Analyze quality control samples (certified reference materials)
to ensure the accuracy of calibration.
• Sample Analysis:
◦ Introduce the diluted sample solutions into the ICP-MS or AAS
for analysis.
◦ Continuously monitor instrument stability and performance
throughout the analysis.
◦ Analyze samples in duplicates and incorporate quality control
samples at regular intervals.
3.5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data Processing:
◦ Calculate the concentration of lead in each sample based on
the instrument’s response and calibration curve.
◦ Convert the concentrations to appropriate units (e.g., µg/g of
nail material).
• Quality Control:
◦ Include results of duplicate analyses, blank samples, and
reference materials in the report.
◦ Ensure all quality control parameters are within acceptable
limits before finalizing results.
• Documentation:
◦ Record all observations, raw data, calculations, and results.
◦ Report the lead concentration values clearly, indicating any
instances where results are outside the acceptable limits or
require further investigation.
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Review instrument maintenance logs to ensure all equipment is
functioning correctly.
• If quality control samples fail to meet criteria, re-calibrate the
instrument and re-analyze the affected batch.
• Stay alert to contamination sources and ensure all glassware is
properly cleaned before use.
5. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the microwave digestion system.
• Instrumentation user manuals for ICP-MS or AAS.
• Relevant scientific literature on the digestion and analysis of nail
samples for lead content.
6. REVISION HISTORY
• Document the revision history, including dates of changes and
summaries of revisions.
