Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Lead Occupational
Exposure, Random Urine Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for lead occupational exposure in random
urine samples. This SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and timely
results compliant with laboratory standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP when performing the analytical procedures for lead occupational
exposure in random urine samples. It is also the responsibility of the
supervisory staff to ensure that all personnel are adequately trained
and that quality control measures are in place and followed.
1. DEFINITION
• Lead Occupational Exposure: The assessment of lead levels in
random urine specimens to monitor lead exposure in occupational
settings.
• Random Urine Sample: A urine specimen collected at any time
without time-specific considerations.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) with Graphite
Furnace
• Lead standard solutions
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high levels)
• Reagent-grade nitric acid (HNO3)
• Deionized water
• Urine collection containers
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Volumetric flasks
• Protective lab wear (gloves, lab coats, safety glasses)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Receive and log the random urine sample ensuring it has been
properly labeled and collected.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
3. Aliquot 5-10 mL of the urine into a new, labeled centrifuge tube.
4. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 RPM for 5 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
5. Carefully pipette the supernatant into a clean, labeled tube to
be used for analysis.
B. Standard and Quality Control Preparation
1. Prepare calibration standards of lead in urine matrix at
appropriate concentrations (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 µg/L).
2. Prepare quality control samples (QC) at low, medium, and high
lead concentration levels in urine matrix.
3. Store standards and QC samples at 2-8°C until use.
C. Instrument Calibration
1. Turn on the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and allow it
to warm up as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibrate the AAS using the prepared lead standard solutions.
3. Verify the calibration curve by running QC samples. The QC
results should be within ±2 standard deviations of the target
value before proceeding with sample analysis.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Set up the autosampler with the prepared urine samples,
standards, and QCs.
2. Program the AAS for lead analysis using graphite furnace
technique.
3. Analyze the urine samples by following the instrument’s
operational procedures.
4. Ensure that blank samples are run between each sample to
avoid contamination.
5. Capture and record the absorbance readings for each sample.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Calculate the concentration of lead in each urine sample using
the calibration curve generated from the standards.
2. Compare the QC results to the expected values to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the analysis.
3. Review sample results for any indication of process deviation or
outlier values.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
5. Conduct method validation and verification studies as required.
6. Analyze quality control samples with each batch of urine
samples to ensure consistent performance of the analytical
method.
7. If quality control results are out of acceptable range,
troubleshoot and correct any issues before analyzing patient
samples.
8. Maintain thorough documentation of all calibration, QC, and
patient sample analyses.
9. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
10. Document all steps of the procedure accurately in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
11. Verify and review all results before entering into the LIS for
reporting.
12. Report results as micrograms of lead per liter of urine (µg/L).
13. Ensure that any critical values are communicated promptly to
appropriate healthcare providers, following the established
laboratory protocol.
14. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Reference Interval for Lead in Urine: Less than 5 µg/L (adults not
occupationally exposed)

By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the reliability and
accuracy of lead occupational exposure testing, thereby contributing
valuable data for the assessment and management of individuals
exposed to lead in occupational settings.
