Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LEAD PROFILE
OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE - BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis of blood samples
to determine the lead concentration in individuals potentially exposed
to occupational lead.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and documentation according to these procedures.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
analytical procedure and notify the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL.
• Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days of collection. If long-term storage is required,
specimens may be frozen at -20°C for up to 3 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are clotted.
• Specimens collected in incorrect containers.
• Specimens that have not been stored properly or exceed the
stability period.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (GFAAS) or
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).
• Reagents: Lead standards, calibration solutions, matrix modifiers,
and diluents as specified by the instrument manufacturer.
• Disposable pipette tips.
• Parafilm or equivalent sealing material.
• Calibrated micropipettes.
• Analytical balance.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Instrument Preparation:
1. Ensure that the GFAAS or ICP-MS is calibrated and ready for
use according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Verify that all reagents and calibration solutions are prepared
and within their expiration dates.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Mix whole blood samples thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Transfer an aliquot of the sample to a clean, labeled tube if
necessary.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Using GFAAS:
◦ Pipette a specific volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the prepared whole
blood sample into the graphite tube.
◦ Add the recommended volume of matrix modifier.
◦ Proceed with the analysis according to the instrument’s
protocol for lead determination.
◦ Record and monitor the absorbance readings.
Using ICP-MS:
◦ Dilute the blood sample appropriately (e.g., 1:10 dilution)
with a diluent that includes an internal standard.
◦ Transfer the diluted sample into the ICP-MS auto-sampler.
◦ Proceed with the analysis according to the instrument’s
protocol for lead determination.
◦ Record and monitor the signal intensities.
2. Perform quality control checks with every batch of samples
analyzed, including running blank samples, low, medium, and
high-level controls to ensure the accuracy and precision of the
results.
3. Document any deviations from the standard procedure and any
corrective actions taken in the quality control log.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before being reported.
• Report the lead concentration in micrograms per deciliter (μg/dL)
according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Critical results (e.g., lead concentrations above established safety
thresholds) must be reported promptly to the healthcare provider,
following the laboratory’s critical results policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC: Analyze quality control materials alongside patient
samples on each run. Acceptable ranges for controls must be
established and documented. If QC results fall outside the
acceptable range, investigate the cause, and take corrective
actions.
• Proficiency Testing: Participate in external proficiency testing
programs to assess the accuracy and reliability of the lead testing
procedure.
1. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
blood lead testing.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the use of GFAAS or ICP-MS.
• Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines
for occupational lead exposure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Children: < 5 μg/dL
• Adults: < 10 μg/dL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis and incorrect storage conditions may affect the
integrity of the sample and the accuracy of the results.
• Interference from other metals in the matrix may affect the
accuracy of the ICP-MS analysis.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• All results, calibration data, QC results, and maintenance logs
must be documented and stored according to laboratory policy.
Review the complete manufacturer’s user manual, and safety
data sheets (SDS) for all reagents and refer to the laboratory’s
safety guidelines to ensure compliance with health and safety
regulations.
