Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Venous Lead Analysis
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis
of lead levels in venous blood samples, ensuring the
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained
in toxicological analysis to perform and document venous lead
analysis. Supervisors must ensure that all procedures are correctly
followed, and any discrepancies are addressed.
1. DEFINITION: Venous lead analysis involves measuring the
concentration of lead in venous blood samples to assess lead
exposure and potential toxicity.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• Specimen type: Venous blood
• Collection tube: Trace element-free (royal blue top with EDTA)
vacutainer tube
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Stability: Room temperature (15-25°C) for up to 24 hours;
refrigerate (2-8°C) if analysis is delayed beyond 24 hours, stable
for up to 7 days.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) or
Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS)
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Certified lead standards and control materials
• Acid-washed polypropylene tubes and containers
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for data entry and analysis
documentation
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Verify patient demographics and sample integrity upon receipt.
2. Confirm the sample volume is sufficient (minimum 1 mL of
whole blood).
3. Mix the blood sample by gently inverting the collection tube 10
times.
4. Aliquot 0.5 mL of whole blood into an acid-washed
polypropylene tube.
5. Add an appropriate volume of diluent (e.g., 1% nitric acid) to the
aliquot for dilution.
6. Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards by serially diluting the certified
lead standard to cover the expected range of lead
concentrations in the sample.
2. Run calibration standards before analyzing the patient samples
to generate a calibration curve.
3. Analyze quality control (QC) materials at low, medium, and high
concentrations to ensure instrument accuracy and precision.
4. Document all calibration and QC results, ensuring they are
within acceptable limits before proceeding with sample
analysis.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Load the prepared and diluted samples into the ICP-MS or
GFAAS according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Analyze each sample in duplicate to ensure result reliability.
3. Record the instrument readings and calculate the lead
concentration using the calibration curve.
4. Enter sample information and results into the LIS, including
patient demographics and any relevant clinical information.
5. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
• Compare the calculated lead concentrations to the established
reference ranges:
◦ Normal: <5 µg/dL
◦ Elevated: 5-19 µg/dL
◦ Concern: 20-44 µg/dL
◦ High: 45-69 µg/dL
◦ Critical: ≥70 µg/dL
• Identify and document any results falling within the critical range
for immediate clinical review and intervention.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Monthly inter-laboratory proficiency testing to ensure analytical
accuracy.
• Routine maintenance and performance checks of the analytical
instrument.
• Adherence to manufacturer protocols and internal SOPs for
instrument calibration and maintenance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review and verify all results before reporting.
• Enter verified results into the LIS for automatic transmission to the
patient's health record.
• Alert the requesting physician of any critical results immediately
using established communication protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain a logbook of all analyses, including sample identification,
preparation details, calibration, QC results, analytical results, and
result verification signatures.
• Store patient results and QC documentation according to
laboratory policy for the required retention period.
1. REFERENCES:
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
blood lead analysis.
• Manufacturer's instrument operation and maintenance manuals.
• Laboratory-specific analytical protocols and QA/QC procedures.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate and reliable analysis of venous lead levels, contributing to
effective patient care and management.
