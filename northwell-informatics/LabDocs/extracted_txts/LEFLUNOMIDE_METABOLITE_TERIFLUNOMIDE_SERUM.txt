Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Leflunomide Metabolite (Teriflunomide),
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for leflunomide metabolite (teriflunomide)
in serum samples. This includes the preparation of reagents, sample
preparation, instrumentation, quality control, and the reporting of
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform leflunomide metabolite (teriflunomide) assays
in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
and ensuring all procedures are followed accurately.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process,
troubleshooting, and ensuring quality control measures are in
place.
• Quality control personnel are responsible for monitoring and
documenting controls, ensuring calibration standards are met,
and verifying results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Processing: Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes, then centrifuge for
10 minutes at 1500 x g at room temperature.
• Storage: Separated serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours. For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
grade methanol, acetonitrile, water, and teriflunomide reference
standard.
• Supplies: HPLC system equipped with a UV detector, analytical
column, syringe filters, and serum separator tubes (SST).
6. INSTRUMENTATION AND CALIBRATION
• Use an HPLC system with a UV detector set at the appropriate
wavelength for teriflunomide (315 nm suggested).
• Calibrate the HPLC system using known concentrations of the
teriflunomide standard. Establish a calibration curve before
running patient samples.
• Perform routine maintenance on the HPLC system as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Thawing: If the serum samples are frozen, thaw them at room
temperature.
2. Filtration: Filter the thawed serum samples using syringe filters
prior to injection into the HPLC system.
B) Reagent Preparation
1. Mobile Phase: Prepare the mobile phase by mixing HPLC
grade methanol with water (60:40 v/v). Degas the mixture
before use.
2. Standards: Prepare a series of teriflunomide standards in
serum by diluting the stock solution to the desired
concentrations.
C) HPLC Analysis
1. System Preparation:
◦ Turn on the HPLC system and the UV detector.
◦ Allow the system to equilibrate with the mobile phase for at
least 30 minutes.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject the standard solutions first to establish a calibration
curve.
◦ Inject the filtered serum samples in duplicate.
3. Run Conditions:
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Injection volume: 20 µL
◦ Column temperature: 25°C
8. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibration Curve: Plot peak area versus concentration for the
standards to create a calibration curve.
• Quality Control: Run quality control samples (low, medium, high
concentration) with each batch of patient samples.
• Acceptance Criteria: Ensure the quality control samples fall
within ±15% of the target value. If QC fails, troubleshoot and rerun
samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review: Check calibration curve and QC results to confirm they
meet acceptance criteria.
• Result Calculation: Calculate the concentration of teriflunomide
in the serum samples using the calibration curve.
• Documentation: Document all findings, including QC results,
calibration curve parameters, and final concentrations.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Specimens with significant hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may
affect the accuracy of results and should be noted.
11. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC system.
• Consult recent publications and guidelines for therapeutic drug
monitoring of leflunomide metabolite (teriflunomide).
**Quality Assurance and Control
Annual proficiency testing and biannual internal audits will be
conducted to ensure ongoing accuracy and compliance with CLIA
standards. Any deviations from the procedure or quality control
failures must be recorded and reviewed by the lab supervisor for
corrective actions.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will be able to accurately
and efficiently measure leflunomide metabolite concentrations in
serum, ensuring high-quality patient care.
