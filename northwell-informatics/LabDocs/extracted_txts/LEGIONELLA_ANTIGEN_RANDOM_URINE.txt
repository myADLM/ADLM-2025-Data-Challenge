Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Legionella Antigen, Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps required to accurately
analyze and generate legionella antigen results in random urine
samples. The method employed ensures reliable detection of
Legionella pneumophila serotype 1 antigen, which is crucial for the
diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified and trained technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis and ensuring the quality and accuracy of the results. The
laboratory supervisor oversees the adherence to protocols and
manages any deviations or non-conformities.
3. SPECIMEN
3.1 Preferred/Acceptable:
• Specimen Type: Random urine sample.
• Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of freshly collected urine.
• Storage Condition: The sample should be refrigerated
immediately after collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to
24 hours before testing. If testing is delayed beyond 24 hours, the
specimen must be frozen at -20°C.
3.2 Unacceptable:
• Urine specimens that have been at room temperature for more
than 2 hours.
• Urine specimens received in leaking or unlabelled containers.
• Specimens contaminated with feces or foreign substances.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• Microcentrifuge
• Legionella urinary antigen test kit (e.g., BinaxNOW Legionella
Urinary Antigen Test)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Test tubes or microcentrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer (optional)
4.2 Reagents:
• Positive and negative control reagents provided with the test kit.
• Kit reagents stored as per the manufacturer's instructions (usually
room temperature or specified by the manufacturer).
4.3 Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Absorbent bench pads
• Laboratory marker
• Timer or stopwatch
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Verify that the sample meets the acceptance criteria outlined in
section 3.
2. If the urine sample is refrigerated, allow it to come to room
temperature before testing. Mix by vortexing briefly.
3. Gather all required supplies and ensure the test kit is within its
expiration date.
5.2 Testing:
1. Remove the test device from the sealed pouch and place it on a
flat surface.
2. Label the test device with the sample identification number.
3. Using a pipette, add the required volume of urine into the
sample well of the test device according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Start the timer and leave the test device to incubate for the
recommended period, typically 15 minutes.
5. After the incubation period, read the results by observing the
presence or absence of pink bands in both the control and test
regions.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
6.1 Positive Result:
• A pink line appears in both the control (C) zone and the test (T)
zone of the device.
6.2 Negative Result:
• A single pink line appears in the control (C) zone only.
6.3 Invalid Result:
• No line appears in the control (C) zone. The test is invalid and
must be repeated with a new device.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Each test device includes an internal procedural control. If the
control line does not appear, the test is considered invalid, and
the sample must be retested.
7.2 External Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative external controls once per new lot or
new shipment of test kits and as required by the laboratory’s
quality assurance program.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the results obtained for each sample and ensure they
conform to the manufacturer’s criteria for interpretation.
2. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS) or
laboratory report form, including patient identification and test
date.
3. For positive results, ensure the correct interpretation and
reporting of outcomes, indicating the presence of Legionella
antigen.
4. Ensure that any critical positive results are communicated
promptly to the appropriate clinical personnel.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Legionella antigen:
• Positive or Negative based on the presence or absence of a test
line.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific test kit's product insert for any limitations,
including issues that could lead to false-positive or false-negative
results.

By adopting and adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures
accurate, reliable, and timely results for legionella antigen testing in
random urine samples, thereby contributing to the effective diagnosis
and management of Legionnaires' disease.
