Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Legionella Antigen, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of Legionella pneumophila
serogroup 1 antigen in urine specimens.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform this
test according to the specified guidelines and ensure compliance with
quality control measures. Any deviations or issues should be reported
to the laboratory supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10-20 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a sterile container.
• Refrigerate specimen at 2-8°C if there is a delay in testing.
Specimen should be tested within 24 hours. If extended storage is
required, freeze the specimen at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens in non-sterile containers.
• Urine samples older than 24 hours that have not been
refrigerated.
• Samples with visible signs of contamination or prolonged
exposure to room temperature over 24 hours without freezing.
• Samples without appropriate labeling (e.g., patient name, date,
and time of sample collection).
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Legionella Urinary Antigen Test Kit (e.g., BinaxNOW® Legionella
Antigen Card or equivalent)
• Sterile pipettes or pipette tips
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, lab coat)
• Absorbent bench pads
• Positive and negative control materials provided with the test kit
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-Analytical Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and the test device are brought to room
temperature (15-30°C) before use.
◦ Don appropriate PPE.
◦ Ensure the work area is clean and free from contaminants.
3. Test Procedure:
1. Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions
provided with the Legionella Urinary Antigen Test Kit.
2. Label the test device with the patient identifier.
3. Using a sterile pipette, transfer exactly 120 µL of urine into
the sample well of the test device.
4. Start the timer according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(e.g., 15 minutes).
5. Read the test results within the specific time frame
recommended (e.g., between 15-30 minutes).
4. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Positive Result: A control line and a test line appear on the
test device. Even a faint test line should be considered
positive.
◦ Negative Result: Only the control line appears, with the
absence of a test line.
◦ Invalid Result: If the control line does not appear, the test is
considered invalid, and the test must be repeated with a
new device.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls provided in the test kit
with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Document all control results in the Quality Control log.
◦ If controls do not perform as expected (positive control
shows negative or negative control shows positive), do not
report patient results and troubleshoot the cause. Repeat
the entire procedure with new controls and kits as
necessary.
6. Post-Analytical Steps:
◦ Record and verify results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) or appropriate reporting format.
◦ Dispose of all biohazard waste, including used test devices,
pipettes, and urine specimens, following laboratory safety
guidelines.
◦ Clean and disinfect the work area at the end of the testing
session.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are manually entered or uploaded to the LIS.
• Positive and negative results must be reviewed and verified by a
technologist before reporting.
• Critical results should be immediately communicated to the
relevant healthcare provider following laboratory policy.
