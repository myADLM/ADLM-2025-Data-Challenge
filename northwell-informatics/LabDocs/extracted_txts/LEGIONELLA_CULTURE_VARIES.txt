Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Legionella Culture Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for analyzing
specimens for the presence of Legionella species in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This document describes the steps to accurately culture,
identify, and report Legionella species to ensure reliable and timely
results, following the analytical phase of specimen processing.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting Legionella
culture analysis in approved laboratory settings.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory staff are responsible for performing all procedures as
outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel are
trained and proficient in these procedures.
• Quality assurance personnel are responsible for maintaining
documentation and ensuring compliance with the protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Types
• Respiratory specimens (sputum, bronchial wash, bronchoalveolar
lavage)
• Tissue samples
• Water samples (cooling towers, hot tubs)
• Environmental swabs
Specimen Collection and Transport
• Collect specimens using aseptic techniques.
• Transport specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours at 2-8°C.
• If delayed, respiratory and tissue specimens should be stored at
2-8°C and processed within 48 hours.
• Water samples should be processed immediately or stored at
2-8°C for no longer than 24 hours prior to processing.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or lack collection
information.
• Specimens received in leaking containers.
• Specimens that have been stored improperly or beyond stability
limits.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Biosafety cabinet
• Incubator (35-37°C)
• Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract (BCYE) agar with and without
antibiotics (e.g., glycine, vancomycin, polymyxin B,
cycloheximide)
• Sterile loops and spreaders
• Centrifuge (for water samples)
• Microscopes
• Legionella latex agglutination or DFA kit (for confirmatory
identification)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment, reagents, and agar plates are ready.
2. Label agar plates with specimen identification and date.
B) Culturing
1. Respiratory and Tissue Specimens:
◦ Homogenize tissue specimens in sterile saline.
◦ Inoculate BCYE agar plates by streaking the specimen
using a sterile loop.
◦ Incubate plates at 35-37°C in a humidified atmosphere.
2. Water Samples:
◦ Centrifuge water samples at 2000 x g for 15 minutes.
◦ Decant supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 mL of sterile
saline.
◦ Inoculate BCYE agar plates using a sterile loop or spreader.
◦ Incubate plates at 35-37°C in a humidified atmosphere.
C) Incubation
• Incubate all cultures at 35-37°C for 7-10 days.
• Check plates daily starting on day 3 for growth of Legionella.
D) Examination and Identification
1. Daily Plate Examination:
◦ Inspect plates for colonies exhibiting typical Legionella
morphology (gray-white, ground-glass appearance).
◦ Record the presence or absence of colonies on each day of
the incubation.
2. Confirmatory Identification:
◦ Perform Gram staining on suspect colonies.
◦ Conduct confirmatory tests using Legionella latex
agglutination or DFA kit to confirm the presence of
Legionella species.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control strain of Legionella pneumophila on
each batch of plates prepared.
• Record and report quality control results daily.
• Retest any batch failing QC using a new set of reagents and
controls.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report positive Legionella results to the healthcare provider and
infection control services immediately.
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) with
appropriate annotations regarding the species detected and
confirmatory test results.
• Negative results should be reported after 10 days of incubation.
9. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
Legionella culture.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Legionella latex agglutination and
DFA kits.
• Relevant literature and local regulations for Legionella testing and
reporting.
10. ATTACHMENTS
• Legionella culture result log
• Quality control log
• Reference intervals for Legionella spp.
11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document the date of review and any modifications made to this
protocol.
Note: All laboratory personnel must be adequately trained and
familiar with safety protocols related to handling pathogenic
organisms such as Legionella species. Compliance with biosafety
guidelines outlined by appropriate health and safety regulations is
mandatory.
