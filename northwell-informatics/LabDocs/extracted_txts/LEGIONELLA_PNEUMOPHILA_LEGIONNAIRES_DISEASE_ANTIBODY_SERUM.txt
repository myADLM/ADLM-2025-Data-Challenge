Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Legionella Pneumophila (Legionnaires Disease),
Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedures for the detection and quantification of
Legionella pneumophila antibodies in serum samples to ensure
accurate and reliable results for aiding in the diagnosis of
Legionnaires' disease.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the test, documenting the procedures, and reporting the
results. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing the test
performance and results, overseeing quality control, and ensuring
adherence to this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Legionella pneumophila: A Gram-negative bacterium that is the
causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of
pneumonia.
Antibody: A protein produced by the immune system in response to
the presence of a pathogen, such as Legionella pneumophila.

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Legionella pneumophila antibody test kit (specify manufacturer
and product number)
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Centrifuge tubes
• Incubator
• Microplate reader
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory timer
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: Serum
• Preferred/acceptable: 5-10 mL of serum obtained through
venipuncture, stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or frozen at
-20°C for longer storage.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens, specimens
stored beyond stability limits without proper storage conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Turn on and calibrate all equipment according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves and lab coat.
3. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix
gently before use.
4. Prepare reagents and materials as specified in the test kit
instructions.
B. Serum Sample Processing
1. Label all necessary tubes and microplates clearly with patient
identifiers and test controls.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to obtain a clear supernatant.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new, labeled tube.
C. Testing Procedure
1. Following the specific kit instructions, add the required volume
of control serum, positive control, and serum samples to the
designated wells on the Plate.
2. Add the conjugate reagent to each well containing serum
samples as per the test kit protocol.
3. Incubate the plate at the required temperature and duration as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Wash the plate as specified in the kit instructions to remove
unbound substances.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well, and incubate according
to manufacturer guidelines.
6. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well in the
specified order and timing.
7. Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the absorbance values of the controls to validate the
test run:
◦ The positive control should fall within the reference range
provided by the kit.
◦ The negative control should be lower than the cut-off to be
considered valid.
2. Calculate the antibody concentration from the absorbance
values using the provided standard curve or conversion factor.
3. Record all readings and calculations meticulously in the
laboratory data log.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure test validity.
2. Results of controls must fall within the specified range, or the
run is considered invalid and must be repeated.
B. Troubleshooting
1. Identify any outliers or aberrant results. Repeat the assay for
confirmation.
2. Should repeated errors occur, perform maintenance on the
equipment and check the reagent integrity.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Enter test results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
along with control data.
5. Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist or supervisor before release.
6. Report critical or positive results immediately to the responsible
healthcare provider following the laboratory’s notification
protocols.
7. RECORD KEEPING
8. Maintain all records of test runs, including control results and
patient results, as per the laboratory's record retention policy.
9. Document any discrepancies, corrective actions taken, and
quality control measures.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the test kit insert for limitations specific to the Legionella
pneumophila antibody detection method used, including potential
cross-reactivity, sample interference, and factors affecting test
performance.
