1. PURPOSE
To define the standardized procedure for the molecular detection of
Legionella species in clinical specimens using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR).
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, data analysis, and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred specimens:
• Lower respiratory samples (e.g., sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage,
tracheal aspirates)
• Water samples for environmental testing
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be processed as soon as possible upon
receipt in the laboratory.
• Store at 2-8°C if processing is delayed less than 24 hours; for
longer storage, freeze at -70°C.
Unaccepted specimens:
• Specimens received in media with antibiotics or formalin.
• Samples received in unsterile containers or visibly contaminated.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
• PCR Master Mix (commercially available or generated in-house)
• Primers and Probes specific for Legionella species
• PCR-grade water
• Positive and Negative Controls
• Molecular grade pipette tips, centrifuge tubes, and reaction plates
• Real-Time PCR Instrument
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Preheat water bath or heating block to 55°C.
2. Aliquot patient specimen into a sterile, RNase and DNase-free
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Following the manufacturer's instructions, proceed with the
extraction kit to isolate nucleic acids.
4. Elute the DNA in the provided elution buffer or PCR-grade
water.
5. Measure the concentration and purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer (optional but recommended).
6. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until PCR setup.
4.2 PCR Setup
1. Preparation of PCR Master Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice.
◦ Prepare the master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, which typically includes:
▪ PCR buffer
▪ Magnesium chloride (MgCl₂), if not included in the buffer
▪ dNTP mix
▪ Primers and probes specific for Legionella
▪ Taq polymerase
▪ PCR-grade water to adjust final volume
2. Adding Master Mix to PCR Wells:
◦ Dispense appropriate volume (e.g., 20 µL) of master mix
into each well of a PCR plate or tube.
3. Addition of DNA Samples:
◦ Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to the appropriate wells
containing master mix.
◦ Include required controls (positive control, negative control,
no-template control).
4. Seal the PCR Plate:
◦ Use optical adhesive film to seal the PCR plate.
4.3 Real-Time PCR Program
1. Set up the real-time PCR instrument with the following cycling
parameters:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Amplification (40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds
2. Enter and verify the setup for fluorescence data collection.
4.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Review Amplification Curves:
◦ Confirm that the positive control shows exponential
amplification and that no amplification is observed in the
negative or no-template control.
2. Threshold Setting:
◦ Set the threshold line to distinguish between positive and
negative samples based on control results.
3. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Positive for Legionella: Sample shows exponential
amplification and crosses threshold line, as observed in the
positive control.
◦ Negative for Legionella: Sample does not show amplification
signal.
4.5 Reporting Results
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Positive results should be reported as "Legionella DNA detected."
• Negative results should be reported as "Legionella DNA not
detected."
• Include any comments on the quality or limitations of the sample if
applicable.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure the validity of the results.
• Document control results in the appropriate logbook.
• If controls do not perform as expected, do not report patient
results. Troubleshoot the issue, repeat the assay, and document
corrective actions taken.
