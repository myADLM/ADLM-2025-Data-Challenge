Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Leishmaniasis
Agglutination, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
qualitative determination of anti-Leishmania antibodies in serum
through agglutination test methods. This test assists in the diagnosis
of Leishmaniasis.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to carry out
these procedures accurately and to document all findings according
to this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring all
procedures are followed correctly and any deviations are addressed
promptly.
2. SPECIMEN
2.1 Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL
• Stability: Specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens collected using anticoagulants other than those
specified.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Leishmaniasis Agglutination Reagent Kit (commercially available)
• Positive and Negative Control Sera (included in the kit)
• Agglutination Slides or Plates
• Disposable Mixing Sticks
• Timer or stopwatch
• Pipettes (calibrated)
• Serum tubes
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature prior
to testing.
• Mix all reagents and control sera gently but thoroughly before
use.
4.2 Test Procedure:
1. Label agglutination slides or plates with specimen identification.
2. Pipette 25 µL of the patient’s serum onto the test area of the
slide.
3. Add 25 µL of the Leishmaniasis Agglutination Reagent to each
test area.
4. Using a disposable mixing stick, mix the serum and reagent
thoroughly on the slide.
5. Perform the same procedure with positive and negative control
sera in their designated areas.
6. Gently rock the slide by hand for 2 minutes to mix the contents
uniformly.
7. Let the slide rest for an additional 2 minutes undisturbed.
4.3 Reading Results:
• After the incubation period, examine the slide visually for
agglutination using adequate lighting.
• Compare the test results with the positive and negative controls.
4.4 Interpretation of Results:
• Positive Result: Formation of clear agglutination indicates the
presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies in the serum.
• Negative Result: No agglutination suggests the absence of anti-
Leishmania antibodies.
• Invalid result: If control sera do not give expected results (positive
control shows no agglutination or negative control shows
agglutination), the test must be repeated.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
5.1 Internal Controls:
• Positive and Negative Controls included in each run.
• Controls must give expected agglutination results for the run to be
valid.
5.2 External Quality Control:
• Participate in an external proficiency testing program as available.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report findings according to laboratory guidelines.
• Record all positive, negative, and invalid test results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. LIMITATIONS:
• Test results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and
diagnostic findings to establish a diagnosis.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens can interfere with the test and
should not be used.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Leishmaniasis Agglutination
Reagent Kit
• Laboratory Safety and Maintenance Manuals
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
• Keep records of all temperature logs, maintenance reports, quality
control results, and patient test results for a minimum time period
as specified by regulatory authorities and laboratory policies.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including using
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and lab
coats.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious and
dispose of waste following biohazard protocols.
