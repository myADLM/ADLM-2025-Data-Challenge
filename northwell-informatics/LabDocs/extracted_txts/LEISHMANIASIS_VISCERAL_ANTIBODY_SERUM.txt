LEISHMANIASIS (VISCERAL) ANTIBODY, SERUM TEST
PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for VISERAL LEISHMANIASIS ANTIBODY,
SERUM tests to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow this protocol
and ensure accurate testing and reporting of results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol and for addressing any deviations or issues that arise
during testing.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL): also known as kala-azar, is a severe
form of leishmaniasis caused by protozoan parasites of the genus
Leishmania.
• Antibody: A blood protein produced in response to and
counteracting a specific antigen.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in red-top or serum-
separator tubes.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Unacceptable specimens: Any specimen that is hemolyzed,
lipemic, or contaminated. Specimens collected in tubes containing
anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Commercially available Visceral Leishmaniasis Antibody ELISA or
other immunoassay kits approved for diagnostic use.
• Calibrators and controls specific for the immunoassay kit.
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Timer.
• Deionized or distilled water.
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Pre-Testing:
1. Allow test reagents and patient specimens to reach room
temperature before testing.
2. Prepare and label necessary number of test tubes or wells for
calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
3. Check the integrity of the ELISA kit and ensure it is within its
expiration date.
B. Specimen Handling:
1. Centrifuge the collected serum sample if required (e.g., if debris
is present).
2. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean labeled tube for
analysis.
C. Test Procedure:
1. Add the appropriate amount of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum specimens to the designated wells according to the kit
instructions.
2. Proceed with the assay procedure as outlined in the kit insert,
including incubation times and order of reagent addition.
3. Wash microplate wells as specified in the kit instructions to
remove unbound substances.
4. Add enzyme-conjugate reagent and incubate as per kit
protocol.
5. Wash the wells again as described in the kit protocol.
6. Add the substrate solution and incubate until color development
is apparent.
7. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
8. Read the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader at
the specified wavelength.
D. Calculation of Results:
1. Calculate the average absorbance of the calibrator, control, and
patient specimens.
2. Construct a standard curve by plotting the average absorbance
of each calibrator versus its corresponding antibody
concentration.
3. Determine the antibody concentration of the patient specimens
by interpolating their absorbance values from the standard
curve.
E. Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of control materials (positive and
negative) in each run.
2. Verify that control results fall within specified limits before
reporting patient results.
3. If controls fail, the run is invalid, and troubleshooting and
corrective action must be performed.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reported in units as specified by the kit instructions
(e.g., arbitrary units or concentration).
• Positive interpretation: Indicative of exposure to and/or current
infection with visceral Leishmaniasis. Results may need
confirmation with further clinical evaluation or additional testing
methods.
• Negative interpretation: No detectable levels of VL antibodies in
the serum sample.
• Equivocal results: Retesting is recommended.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the specific ELISA kit insert for reference ranges for the
determination of positive, negative, or equivocal results. These
ranges should be validated for your laboratory-specific population.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other pathogens may lead to false-positive
results.
• The test should be used as a part of the diagnostic process
considering both clinical and other laboratory findings.

leishmaniasis serological testing.
1. TECHNICAL SUPPORT
• For any technical issues or inquiries, consult the kit manufacturer
or contact the designated laboratory supervisor or technical
support team.
This SOP must be reviewed and approved annually or whenever
changes are made to the procedure or associated materials.
