Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generation of Results for LEMON, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
accurate and reliable analysis of Lemon, Immunoglobulin E (IgE),
and Serum specimens in the laboratory. This procedure details the
handling of specimens, preparation, analyte measurement, quality
control, and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis as defined in this procedure. All laboratory staff must ensure
adherence to the SOP and report any deviations or concerns to the
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
LEMON: Refers to a specific analyte or test parameter. Please refer
to specific laboratory equipment and method documentation for
detail. IGE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody measured for various
allergic conditions and immune responses. SERUM: Refers to the
liquid portion of blood, post clotting, used in various biochemical
assays.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Specimen Requirements:
LEMON: Serum or plasma, collected in an SST (serum-separating
tube) or heparinized tube. IGE: Serum, collected in an SST or plain
red-top tube. SERUM: General serum processing for biochemical
analysis requires SST or plain red-top tube.
Specimen Stability:
LEMON: Optimal specimen analysis within 7 days at 2-8 °C, or
frozen at -20 °C for longer storage. IGE: Optimal specimen analysis
within 7 days at 2-8 °C, or frozen at -20 °C for longer storage.
SERUM: Optimal specimen analysis within 7 days at 2-8 °C, or
frozen at -20 °C for longer storage.
Reject Criteria:
Unlabeled specimens. Samples with visible hemolysis. Samples not
stored/transported at proper temperature conditions. Samples without
specified collection dates/times.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Standard Laboratory Equipment:
Centrifuges, pipettes, test tubes, SST tubes, Heparin tubes.
Analytical instruments specific to Lemon, IgE, Serum assays (refer to
instrument manual). Reagents specific to Lemon, IgE, Serum assays
(refer to assay kit documentation).
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
Ensure all equipment and reagents are prepared as outlined in the
respective instrument or kit manual. Allow reagents to come to room
temperature if stored at cooler temperatures.
Measurement:
For LEMON:
Load prepared specimen onto designated analyzer. Follow
manufacturer's instructions for operation and measurement.
Document results.
For IGE:
Load prepared specimen onto designated analyzer. Follow
manufacturer's instructions for operation and measurement.
Document results.
For SERUM:
Load prepared specimen for serum analysis based on required
biochemical assay. Follow manufacturer's instructions for operation
and measurement. Document results.
Quality Control:
Ensure proper functioning of instruments by running standard QC
material. Refer to quality control SOP specific to each analyte and
follow guidelines.
Reporting Results:
Review results and ensure they meet quality control standards. Enter
results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS). Results must be
verified by a trained technologist prior to release.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
Run quality control material with each assay batch. Kenlor Industries
– 2 Levels: 3 x 10mL Negative QC and Positive QC. Cat. # 210306

Advance (#975)
Procedure:
Perform quality control according to site-specific guidelines. Record
all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable ranges. If QC
fails, do not release patient results and notify supervisor for
troubleshooting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific assay or instrument documentation for method
limitations and troubleshooting.
