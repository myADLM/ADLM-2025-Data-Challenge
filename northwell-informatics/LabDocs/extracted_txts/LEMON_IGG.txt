Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating LEMON IGG
Results
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of generating LEMON IGG
results in the laboratory following established protocols.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of LEMON IGG tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the LEMON
IGG analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring compliance with the SOP.
• Quality Control Personnel: Responsible for validating the
precision and accuracy of the analysis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen Type: Human serum
• Specimen Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube
(SST). Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature,
then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000-1300 g.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8° C for up to 48
hours. For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°
C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader
• Microplate washer
• Incubator (37° C)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• LEMON IGG ELISA kit (including standards, controls, wash buffer,
substrate, and stop solution)
• Distilled water
6. PROCEDURE 6.1 Preparation and Setup
1. Verify that all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
Document calibration and function tests.
2. Prepare the work area by cleaning and organizing all materials.
3. Thaw serum specimens and reagents at room temperature
before starting the assay.
6.2 Assay Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare wash buffer per ELISA kit instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before use.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Label microplate wells according to the layout plan.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient sera into
the appropriate wells.
◦ Tap the microplate gently to ensure proper mixing.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37° C for 1 hour.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash each well with the prepared wash buffer using the
microplate washer, repeating for a total of 3 washes.
Remove any remaining wash buffer by tapping the plate on
paper towels.
5. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
◦ Cover and incubate for 30 minutes at 37° C.
6. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells as described in step 4.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well. Gently tap the plate
to mix.
9. Reading:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader set to 450 nm (reference filter at 620-650 nm is
optional but recommended).
6.3 Result Calculation
1. Create a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their concentrations.
2. Determine the concentration of LEMON IGG in patient samples
by extrapolating from the standard curve.
6.4 Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of tests.
2. Accept or reject results based on QC performance criteria.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify results before releasing.
3. Report critical results immediately to the ordering physician or
as per laboratory's reporting guidelines.
8. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer's instructions for LEMON IGG ELISA Kit.
2. Quality control and calibration logbooks.
9. DOCUMENTATION
1. Record all observations, deviations, and corrective actions in
the appropriate logbooks.
2. Maintain records as per regulatory requirements.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
1. SOP will be reviewed annually or as required by regulatory
changes.
2. Document revisions with date and detailed description.
