Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Lentil,
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Lentil-specific IgE testing and general Serum
analysis in the CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures consistent and
accurate testing, resulting in reliable data for patient diagnosis and
treatment.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Lentil-specific IgE: A test detecting the presence of IgE antibodies
specific to lentil proteins, used in evaluating allergic responses.
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody involved in allergic reactions.
• Serum: The liquid portion of blood that remains after clotting, used
for various biochemical analyses.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the
outlined procedures accurately, document all necessary information,
and report findings according to laboratory protocols.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Lentil-specific IgE:
◦ Specimen type: Serum
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL
◦ Stability: Serum must be tested within 7 days of collection
when stored at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C
or lower.
• General Serum Analysis:
◦ Specimen type: Serum
◦ Volume requirements: Dependent on specific tests being
performed (refer to test-specific requirements)
◦ Stability: Serum must be tested within 7 days of collection
when stored at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C
or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with incorrect labeling or missing collection date/time
• Samples received in inappropriate tubes or beyond acceptable
stability timeframe
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzers (e.g., Phadia or similar
platforms)
• Calibrators and Controls specific to IgE and serum analysis
• Pipettes, tips, and other sample handling supplies
• Centrifuge for serum separation
1. PROCEDURE
A. Lentil-specific IgE Testing:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and controls
have been run according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Allow serum samples stored at refrigerated temperatures to
come to room temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix thoroughly but gently before aliquoting to avoid foaming.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load samples into the immunoassay analyzer along with
required reagents and calibrators.
◦ Select 'Lentil-specific IgE' test from the analyzer's menu.
◦ Run the test following the system's operational procedures.
◦ Document the testing time, date, and analyzer used.
4. Results Interpretation:
◦ Review results for consistency with control values and
manufacturer’s thresholds.
◦ Report positive results when IgE levels exceed the
established cutoff indicating sensitization.
B. General Serum Analysis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure analyzers (biochemistry, immunoassay, etc.) are
calibrated and necessary controls have been run.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Allow serum samples stored at refrigerated temperatures to
come to room temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix thoroughly but gently before aliquoting to avoid foaming.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load samples into the appropriate analyzer based on the
specific tests ordered.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for test selection and
execution.
◦ Document the testing time, date, and analyzer used.
4. Results Interpretation:
◦ Verify results against control and reference ranges.
◦ Review for any abnormalities or critical values requiring
immediate reporting.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control material at designated intervals (daily, bi-
weekly, or monthly) as per specified guidelines.
◦ Ensure QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with sample testing.
• External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs for both lentil-
specific IgE and general serum analysis.
◦ Document and review results regularly to ensure compliance
and accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed for validity and consistency. Any abnormal
findings or critical values should be flagged and reported following
laboratory protocols. Utilize laboratory information systems (LIS) for
data entry, review, and verification.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to manufacturer’s product inserts for specific analytical
procedures, reagent handling, and quality control criteria.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain records of all tests performed, including calibration, control
results, sample identification, testing date/time, and analyst initials.
Ensure proper documentation of any discrepancies, corrective
actions, and maintenance undertaken.
This protocol aims to ensure efficient, consistent, and accurate
testing during the analytical phase for Lentil-specific IgE and general
serum analysis, thereby supporting optimal patient care through
reliable laboratory results.
