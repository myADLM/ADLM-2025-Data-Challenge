STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Procedure Title: Generating Results for Lentil-specific
Immunoglobulin G (Lentil IgG) Assay
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
Lentil-specific Immunoglobulin G (Lentil IgG) levels in patient serum
samples. This method is used to support allergy testing and to
monitor immune response to lentil allergens.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure is applicable to the laboratory personnel qualified to
perform the Lentil IgG assay using the specified Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that this SOP is followed
and for addressing any deviations or anomalies.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS:
• Lentil IgG ELISA kit (manufacturer specific, ensure lot number
and expiration date are documented)
• Serum samples (specimens already accessioned)
• Calibrators and controls (provided by the ELISA kit)
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Laboratory incubator set to 37°C
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Wash buffer, Substrate solution, and Stop solution (provided by
the ELISA kit)
• Microplate washing system (optional)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. DEFINITIONS:
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay): A plate-based
assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying soluble
substances like proteins, peptides, antibodies, and hormones.
• Lentil-specific IgG: Immunoglobulin G antibodies specific to
lentil proteins, indicating the immune response to lentil allergens.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation and Handling:
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before use.
2. Dilute serum samples as specified in the kit instructions (e.g.,
1:100 dilution) in sample diluent buffer.
3. Prepare calibrators and controls as directed by the kit insert.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of diluted samples, calibrators, and controls
into the appropriate wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Duplicate or triplicate measurements are recommended for
accuracy.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
◦ During incubation, ensure the plate is covered to prevent
evaporation.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer to
remove unbound reagents. If using an automated plate
washer, follow the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of HRP-conjugated secondary anti-IgG antibody
to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
5. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing steps as described above to remove
unbound secondary antibody.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes
or until adequate color development is observed.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
◦ The color in the wells should change from blue to yellow.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
C) Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Generating the Standard Curve:
◦ Plot the absorbance values of the calibrators against their
corresponding concentrations to generate a standard curve.
2. Calculating Sample Concentrations:
◦ Use the standard curve to determine the IgG levels in
patient samples by interpolating their absorbance values.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Check that controls fall within the acceptable ranges as
provided by the manufacturer. If controls do not meet
criteria, investigate and repeat assay if necessary.
4. Reporting Results:
◦ Transfer data to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify results prior to reporting.
◦ Reference intervals and interpretive criteria should be
followed according to the latest clinical guidelines and
described in the insert.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include internal quality controls in each batch.
• Perform calibration checks regularly as per manufacturer
instructions.
• Ensure pipetted volumes are accurate and regularly calibrate
pipettes.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times during sample handling and
assay procedures.
• Follow all biosafety guidelines and proper waste disposal
methods for biohazardous materials.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Lentil IgG ELISA kit.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards for non-infectious samples handling
and processing (refer to relevant laboratory guidelines).
10. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain assay logs, instrument maintenance logs, and calibration
records.
• Record all deviations from this protocol and actions taken to
rectify any issues.
By following this SOP, the generation of Lentil IgG assay results will
be standardized, accurate, and reliable. The protocol must be
reviewed and updated regularly to ensure compliance with new
guidelines or improvements in method and technology.
