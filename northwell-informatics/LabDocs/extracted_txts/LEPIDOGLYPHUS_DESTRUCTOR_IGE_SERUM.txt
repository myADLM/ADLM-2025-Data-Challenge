Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LEPIDOGLYPHUS
DESTRUCTOR, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and precise determination
of Lepidoglyphus destructor (LD) specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
levels in human serum. The procedure includes preparation,
execution, and post-analytical steps to ensure consistent and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay according to this SOP.
• The Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for reviewing and
ensuring adherence to the protocol and taking corrective actions
when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Preparation:
• Collect blood in a serum-separating tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for 5 days when stored at 2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, freeze serum at <-20°C. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with results
and should be avoided.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin)
are not acceptable.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• LD-specific IgE assay kit
• Calibrators and controls provided with the assay kit
• Microtiter plates or automated analyzer tailored for IgE detection
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Plate washer and reader (if applicable)
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
Reagent Storage:
• Store reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Do not use reagents past their expiration date.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, calibrators, controls, and samples to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Label microtiter wells or tubes according to the assay layout,
including sample identification, calibrators, and controls.
B) Analytical Steps:
1. Preparation of Standards and Controls:
◦ Prepare a series of standards with known concentrations of
LD-specific IgE.
◦ Include both positive and negative controls.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add an appropriate volume (as specified in the kit insert) of
standards, controls, and serum samples to the designated
wells or tubes.
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate (provided in the kit) to all wells or
tubes.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate at the specified temperature and time (usually
37°C for 1-2 hours) to allow antigen-antibody binding.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells or tubes multiple times with the wash buffer
(as specified in the kit) to remove unbound materials.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well or tube.
6. Color Development:
◦ Incubate for the specified time until the color develops.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well or tube to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
8. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength
(usually 450 nm) using a plate reader.
◦ Ensure the measurement is taken within the recommended
time frame after stopping the reaction.
C) Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Calculation of Results:
◦ Calculate the LD-specific IgE concentration in the serum
samples using the standard curve generated from the
calibrators.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that control samples fall within the acceptable range
established by the assay kit to validate the run.
◦ If controls fall outside the acceptable range, investigate and
resolve the issue before reporting patient results.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Range:
• Normal reference range for LD-specific IgE levels should be
provided in the kit insert.
Procedure for Reviewing Results:
• Technologists will review and validate results against controls and
calibrators.
• Report results according to the laboratory's reporting protocol,
ensuring all critical values are communicated promptly.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform internal quality control with each assay batch.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs for continuous
monitoring of assay performance.
• Document all quality control activities, including corrective actions
taken.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow institutional safety guidelines and biosafety protocols.
• Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, and eye protection)
when handling specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to institutional policies.
