Standard Operating Procedures for the Analytical Phase:
LEPTIN Testing
1. Purpose To outline the procedures for analyzing, generating,
and reporting leptin test results from serum or plasma samples.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
a. Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
b. Collection Tubes:
• Serum: SST (Serum Separator Tube)
• Plasma: EDTA (Purple Top) or Lithium Heparin (Green Top)
c. Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum or plasma.
d. Handling and Storage:
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection.
• If the specimen cannot be analyzed within 2 hours, it should be
refrigerated at 2 - 8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C/-80°C.
e. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants other
than EDTA or Lithium Heparin.
• Specimens with a high level of lipemia.
1. Equipment and Reagents
a. Equipment:
• Automated immunoanalyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott Architect)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and Freezer (-20°C/-80°C)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
b. Reagents:
• Leptin assay kit/reagents (specific to the immunoanalyzer being
used)
• Quality control (QC) materials (low, medium, and high levels)
• Calibrators specific to the leptin assay being used
1. Procedure
a. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix by gentle
inversion.
2. Centrifuge all specimens at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
b. Assay Setup:
1. Load calibrators, quality control materials, and patient samples
onto the analyzer according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before loading
onto the analyzer.
3. Enter patient demographics and sample IDs into the analyzer.
c. Running the Assay:
1. Following the manufacturer's instructions for the use of the
leptin assay kit.
2. Perform a calibration run if required by the reagent lot or
analyzer software.
3. Run quality controls at low, medium, and high levels to ensure
the assay is operating within acceptable limits.
4. Load and start the patient sample run.
d. Data Monitoring and Troubleshooting:
1. Review QC results:
◦ If QC results are within acceptable ranges, proceed with the
sample run.
◦ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
immunoanalyzer and assay kit instructions before continuing
with patient samples.
2. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or flags during the
assay run.
3. If any issues arise, follow troubleshooting protocols provided by
the manufacturer, including re-running samples if necessary.
4. Reporting Results
a. Verification:
1. Verify all results meet quality control standards.
2. Review and approve results within the laboratory information
system (LIS).
b. Interpretation: Reference intervals for leptin will be provided by
the manufacturer's package insert or established laboratory reference
ranges.
c. Reporting: Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS
upon approval and will be reported to the patient’s electronic medical
record (EMR).
d. Critical Result Handling: Report any critical results as per
laboratory policy and document communication to the physician or
relevant healthcare provider.
1. Quality Control
a. Frequency:
• Run QC materials at the beginning of each shift and with each
batch of patient samples.
b. Materials:
• Use manufacturer-provided QC materials or third-party controls
as per lab policy.
c. Documentation:
• Record all QC results, including lot numbers and expiration dates
of controls, on a QC log.

Ensure all procedural steps align with manufacturer instructions
provided in the leptin assay kit package insert and the
immunoanalyzer user manual. Modify protocol according to specific
laboratory policies and regulatory requirements.
