Protocol for Leptospira IgM Detection in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of Leptospira
IgM in human serum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) method.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and verifying the Leptospira IgM detection protocol.
Staff must ensure adherence to the standard operating procedures
and report any discrepancies to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Collection and Handling:
◦ Collect blood specimen and allow to clot at room
temperature.
◦ Centrifuge at 1000-1300 g for 10-15 minutes.
◦ Transfer serum using a sterile pipette into a labeled
secondary tube.
◦ Store the serum at 2-8°C if not immediately tested, or freeze
at -20°C for long term storage.
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants such as
EDTA, citrate, or heparin.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
◦ ELISA washer or manual washing materials.
◦ Micropipettes and tips (calibrated and sterile).
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Stopwatch or timer.
◦ Leptospira IgM ELISA kit (commercially available). •
Contains microtiter plates coated with Leptospira antigens. •
Conjugate solution (anti-human IgM HRP). • Wash buffer. •
Substrate solution (hydrogen peroxide/TMB). • Stop solution
(0.5 M sulfuric acid). • Positive and negative controls.
3. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature.
◦ Set up microtiter plates according to the ELISA kit
instructions.
◦ Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution as
required.
b) Adding Standards, Controls, and Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and serum sample to
the designated wells.
◦ Incubate for the specified time at 37°C (commonly 60
minutes) ensuring adequate moisture and temperature
control.
c) Washing:
◦ Aspirate the wells using an ELISA washer or manually.
◦ Wash the wells with the provided wash buffer (typically 3-5
cycles).
◦ Ensure complete removal of wash buffer after each cycle.
d) Conjugation:
◦ Add 100 µL of anti-human IgM HRP conjugate solution to
each well.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for specified time (commonly 60 minutes).
e) Substrate Reaction:
◦ Aspirate and wash the wells as described.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for the specified
time (commonly 10-20 minutes).
f) Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Gently mix by tapping the plate.
g) Reading the Plates:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.
◦ Record and analyze the readings as per the kit’s instructions
and lab-specific guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens.
◦ Ensure controls and standards fall within the manufacturer’s
acceptable range.
◦ Repeat testing if controls fail to yield expected results.
5. RESULT REPORTING
◦ Calculate the results according to the ELISA kit’s guidelines.
◦ Report positive and negative results based on the calculated
cutoff values.
◦ Annotate any deviations or observations related to the
specimen integrity or test performance.
Reference Intervals:
◦ Negative: < Cut-off value.
◦ Positive: ≥ Cut-off value.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Possible cross-reactivity with other infections.
◦ False negatives with samples collected in early infection
stages.
