Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Lettuce-specific IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
analysis of lettuce-specific IgE in serum samples utilizing the
specific immunoassay platform. These procedures are intended
to ensure accurate and precise results which are essential for
effective patient diagnosis and management.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical process for detecting lettuce-
specific IgE in serum samples using an immunoassay
technique.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure to ensure quality and reliability of the test results.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Human serum
◦ Collection: Blood should be collected by venipuncture into
a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
◦ Storage:
▪ Refrigerate at 2-8°C if the analysis will be performed
within 72 hours.
▪ Freeze at -20°C or lower if storage exceeds 72 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia® 250, IMMULITE
2000)
◦ Reagents and kits specific for lettuce IgE (e.g., Phadia
ImmunoCAP® IgE)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific for the immunoassay
◦ PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
◦ Centrifugation: Centrifuge blood samples at 1500-3000 x g
for 10-15 minutes to separate serum if not using an SST.
◦ Aliquoting: Aliquot the required volume of serum into
labeled micro-centrifuge tubes if not directly analyzed.
◦ Storage: Store the aliquoted serum appropriately until
analysis.
B. Instrument Preparation
◦ Calibration: Perform instrument calibration using
manufacturer-provided calibrators. Ensure calibration is
valid before proceeding.
◦ Quality Control: Run quality control samples (high and low)
according to the laboratory’s quality control policy to verify
system performance. Document the results.
C. Assay Procedure
◦ Loading Specimen:
▪ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and
mix gently.
▪ Load appropriate volume of the serum sample,
calibrators, and controls into specified positions on the
instrument.
◦ Assay Execution: Follow the instrument’s standard protocol
for lettuce-specific IgE measurement, ensuring all
procedural steps are followed as per manufacturer
guidelines.
◦ Completion: Once the run is complete, review raw data and
check for any flagged results indicating issues such as high
background or sample integrity problems.
7. RESULT REVIEW AND VERIFICATION
◦ Data Review: Examine quality control data to ensure they
meet acceptable limits. Review patient results for any
inconsistencies.
◦ Result Calculation: Verify that the analyzer has correctly
calculated the serum IgE concentration.
◦ Verification: A second technologist or supervisor should
verify the results before they are reported.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Units: Report results in kilo-international units per liter (kIU/
L).
◦ Reference Range:
▪ Less than 0.1 kIU/L: Negative
▪ 0.1-0.34 kIU/L: Indeterminate
▪ 0.35 kIU/L and above: Positive
◦ Critical Results: Follow standard laboratory protocols for
reporting critical values if necessary.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Daily QC: Run QC samples at the beginning of each day or
assay batch.
◦ Documentation: Document QC results in the QC log. If QC
results fall outside specified limits, do not proceed with
patient sample analysis and follow troubleshooting
procedures.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, or gross microbial contamination may
affect the assay results.
◦ Strict adherence to the storage and handling requirements
for reagents and specimens is necessary.
