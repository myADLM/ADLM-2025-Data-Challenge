Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Processing Lettuce IgG
Tests
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedures necessary to generate and report
results accurately and efficiently for Lettuce IgG tests. The goal is to
ensure consistent, reliable, and valid results that contribute to the
accurate diagnosis and management of patients.
2. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure and to ensure adherence to all protocols for quality
control, data accuracy, and result reporting. Any issues encountered
during the process must be documented and reported to the
supervisor.
3. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Human serum
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Storage and Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if
analysis is to be performed within 7 days. For long-term storage,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Lettuce IgG ELISA kit: includes microwell plate coated with lettuce
protein antigens, enzyme conjugate, substrates, and wash
buffers.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Timer.
5. Quality Control
• Use positive and negative controls from the Lettuce IgG ELISA kit
with each batch of assays.
• Quality control samples must fall within the acceptable range
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
• Record all QC data and review it to ensure all parameters are
within acceptable limits before reporting patient results.
6. Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Thaw and mix specimens, controls, and reagents as per kit
instructions.
2. Assign a unique identifier to each sample and record their
positions in the provided microplate layout.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and patient sample to
the appropriate wells on the microplate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times with the wash buffer provided in
the kit to remove unbound substances. Remove all wash
buffer by tapping the plate on a clean paper towel after the
final wash.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate into each well.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Second Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step to remove excess conjugate.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature
(18-25°C) for 10-15 minutes, or until the wells reach an
appropriate color development.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the enzyme
reaction. The color changes from blue to yellow.
C. Detection
1. Read the absorbance of the wells at 450 nm within 30 minutes
of adding the stop solution using a microplate reader.
7. Calculations
• Determine the mean absorbance for each standard, control, and
sample.
• Construct a calibration curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their concentrations.
• Use the calibration curve to determine the concentrations of
Lettuce IgG in patient samples.
8. Reporting of Results
• Ensure all results are within the calibration curve. Any value falling
outside the curve's range must be retested after suitable dilution
of the sample.
• Report the Lettuce IgG concentrations in arbitrary units (AU/mL)
or appropriate units as per the assay requirements.
• Critical results and significant findings should be reviewed and
verified by the supervising technologist before being reported to
clinicians.
9. Interpretation and Reference Ranges
• A defined range should be utilized to interpret the Lettuce IgG
results. These might be:
◦ Negative: < X AU/mL
◦ Indeterminate: X to Y AU/mL
◦ Positive: > Y AU/mL [Exact values to be defined based on kit
manufacturer’s specified range]
10. Method Limitations
Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for detailed information on
limitations, potential interferences, and cross-reactivity associated
with the assay.
11. References
Refer to the manufacturer's Lettuce IgG ELISA kit instruction manual
and any other relevant laboratory guidelines.
By maintaining strict adherence to the preceding steps, laboratory
personnel can produce accurate, reliable results that support
improved patient outcomes.
