Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LEUKEMIA AND
LYMPHOMA IMMUNOPHENOTYPING - TECHNICAL ONLY
1. PURPOSE To outline the technical procedure for generating
results for leukemia and lymphoma immunophenotyping using
tissue specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated technical staff are responsible
for carrying out this procedure. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring all procedures are correctly followed and documented.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Fresh or adequately preserved tissue
samples (lymph node, bone marrow, etc.) sent to the laboratory.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens not stored/transported in appropriate conditions.
◦ Specimens with no collection date or time indicated.
◦ Specimens exceeding stability limits (refer to preservation
guidelines).
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
◦ Flow cytometer
◦ Refrigerators (2-8°C)
◦ Incubators (37°C)
◦ Heating block if necessary
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and tips
Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Sheath fluid for flow cytometer
◦ Antibodies specific for leukemia and lymphoma markers
(e.g., CD markers)
◦ Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies
◦ Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS, FACS buffer)
◦ Fixation solution (e.g., 1-4% paraformaldehyde)
◦ Washing solution
◦ Tube labels
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: a. Ensure tissue samples are in
appropriate preservative and at the correct temperature. b.
Mince the tissue into small pieces if necessary using a sterile
scalpel. c. Transfer tissues into a buffer solution and gently
homogenize to create a single-cell suspension. d. Filter the
suspension through a cell strainer to remove debris. e.
Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300-500 x g for 5-10 minutes
at room temperature. f. Wash the cells twice with buffer
solution.
Staining Preparation: a. Aliquot an appropriate number of
cells into labeled flow cytometry tubes. b. Add the
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to each tube as required
and mix by vortexing. c. Incubate the tubes for the
recommended time and temperature (usually 30 minutes at
room temperature in the dark). d. After incubation, wash the
cells twice with buffer solution. e. Resuspend the cell pellet in
buffer or fixation solution as specified.
Flow Cytometry Analysis: a. Turn on the flow cytometer and
perform necessary startup procedures including priming and
calibration. b. Run quality control checks using control beads. c.
Load stained samples into the instrument and collect data. d.
Ensure the proper gating strategy is applied and markers are
correctly identified. e. Review the data for accuracy and
validate the results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run daily controls using pre-defined standards.
◦ Document all deviations and corrective actions taken.
◦ Perform instrument calibration and maintenance according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report raw data to the pathologist supervising the
immunophenotyping analysis.
◦ Enter data into Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
validation.
8. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
◦ Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
◦ Dispose of biohazard and chemical waste according to
institutional guidelines.

ensure compliance with the latest laboratory standards and
regulations.
