1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for leukemia and lymphoma phenotyping
using flow cytometry or other immunophenotyping methodologies,
ensuring accuracy and consistency in identifying leukemic and
lymphoid cells.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to perform leukemia and lymphoma phenotyping and ensure
accurate documentation and interpretation of the results. The
laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this procedure.
2. DEFINITION
Leukemia and Lymphoma Phenotyping: Process of identifying and
characterizing leukemic and lymphoid cells using flow cytometry or
other immunophenotyping techniques based on cell surface,
cytoplasmic or nuclear markers.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Peripheral blood (minimum 3 mL in EDTA or heparin tube)
• Bone marrow aspirate (minimum 1 mL in EDTA or heparin tube)
• Lymph node or tissue biopsy (transported in appropriate media)
Acceptable Specimens:
• Specimens transported at room temperature and processed
within 24 hours of collection in case of peripheral blood or bone
marrow aspirate.
• Biopsy specimens should be processed as soon as possible after
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or inadequately mixed specimens.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without
proper storage.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer equipped for multi-color analysis (e.g., BD
FACSCanto II or similar)
• Antibodies specific for leukemia and lymphoma markers (e.g.,
CD45, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD10, CD23, etc.)
• Flow cytometry tubes and sheath fluid
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge
• Lysis solution (e.g., ammonium chloride)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or similar buffer
• Appropriate storage media for tissue biopsies
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Sample:
1. Peripheral Blood/Bone Marrow Aspirate:
◦ Mix the sample gently before aliquoting.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of well-mixed sample into labeled flow
cytometry tubes.
2. Biopsy Specimen:
◦ Prepare single-cell suspension from the biopsy tissue.
◦ Transfer cells into flow cytometry tubes.
Antibody Staining:
1. Add predetermined volume of each appropriate antibody to the
sample in tubes.
2. Vortex mix each tube gently.
3. Incubate the tubes in the dark at room temperature for 15-20
minutes.
Lysis and Washing:
1. Add 2 mL of lysis solution to each tube.
2. Vortex and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
3. Centrifuge tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
4. Decant the supernatant and wash cells with 2 mL PBS.
5. Repeat centrifugation and decant supernatant.
Resuspension:
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of PBS.
2. Vortex to resuspend cells thoroughly.
Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Perform daily start-up and QC checks of the flow cytometer.
2. Acquire data for each tube in the flow cytometer.
3. Adjust settings and compensation based on the control
samples.
Data Analysis:
1. Analyze data using flow cytometry analysis software (e.g.,
FlowJo or FACSDiva).
2. Identify cell populations based on appropriate gating strategies.
3. Interpret data to determine the phenotypic profile of leukemic or
lymphoid cells.
Quality Control:
1. Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Troubleshoot and document any inconsistencies or QC failures.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Compile data and generate reports based on the analysis.
2. Provide results in a standardized format for verification by the
pathologist or clinician in charge.
3. Documentation must include sample identification, analysis
date, markers analyzed, and phenotypic profile results.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to site-specific reference values and pathological criteria for
interpretation.
7. REFERENCES
• Current protocols in the laboratory manual.
• Manufacturer's manuals and guidelines for flow cytometry
instruments and reagents.
• Relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature and consensus
guidelines by professional bodies (e.g., the International Society
for Laboratory Hematology).
8. REVIEW AND AMENDMENT
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required when new
protocols, equipment, or guidelines are introduced. Any amendments
will be documented and approved by the laboratory director.
