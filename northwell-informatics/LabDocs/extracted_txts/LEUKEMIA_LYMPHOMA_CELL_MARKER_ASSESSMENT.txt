Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
LEUKEMIA/LYMPHOMA CELL MARKER ASSESSMENT
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the assessment of
leukemia/lymphoma cell markers through flow cytometry to ensure
accurate and validated results are generated and reported in a timely
and consistent manner.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel performing leukemia/
lymphoma cell marker assessment in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
and ensure the accurate identification and characterization of cell
markers for leukemia and lymphoma samples.
4. DEFINITIONS
Leukemia/Lymphoma Cell Marker Assessment: A procedure using
flow cytometry to analyze the presence, quantities, and
characteristics of specific cell surface markers that help in diagnosing
and classifying leukemia and lymphoma.
5. MATERIALS
• Flow Cytometer (equipped with appropriate lasers and detectors)
• Leukemia/Lymphoma Marker Antibody Panels
• Fluorochrome-Conjugated Antibodies (FITC, PE, PerCP, APC,
etc.)
• Lysing Solution
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Flow Cytometry Tubes
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Sample Tracking System/Software
6. REAGENTS
• Pre-mixed antibody panels suitable for specific markers (e.g., CD
markers)
• Quality Control (QC) reagents and controls
• Sheath Fluid
• Compensation Beads (if applicable)
• Calibration Beads
7. SAMPLE PREPARATION
7.1 Specimen Requirements
• Peripheral Blood: Collected in K2 or K3 EDTA tubes.
• Bone Marrow Aspirate: Collected in heparinized tubes.
• Lymph Node or Other Tissue: Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA)
collected in a sterile container with RPMI media.
7.2 Sample Preparation Steps
• Verify patient information and sample integrity.
• Mix blood or bone marrow aspirate samples well.
• Label flow cytometry tubes with patient ID and other relevant
details.
8. PROCEDURE
8.1 Staining Procedure
1. Cell Count: Determine cell count using an automated cell
counter.
2. Aliquoting: Aliquot appropriate number of cells (e.g., 1 x 10^6
cells) into labeled flow cytometry tubes.
3. Blocking/Fixation (if required): Add blocking buffer to prevent
non-specific binding.
4. Primary Antibody Staining:
◦ Add appropriate volume of each fluorochrome-conjugated
antibody to the tubes.
◦ Incubate at room temperature or 4°C (depending on
antibody manufacturer instructions) in the dark for the
specified time (usually 15-30 minutes).
5. Lysis of Red Blood Cells: Add lysing solution to the tubes,
vortex gently and incubate for the required time as indicated by
the reagent kit instructions.
6. Washing: Centrifuge tubes at 300-400g for 5 minutes, discard
the supernatant, and wash cells twice with PBS.
7. Fixing/Storing Cells: Add PBS and fixative (if applicable), mix
and store samples if immediate analysis is not performed.
8.2 Flow Cytometric Analysis
1. Instrument Setup: Turn on the flow cytometer and initialize
instrument startup protocols.
2. Calibration and Control: Perform calibration using calibration
beads and adjust compensation settings using compensation
beads.
3. Sample Acquisition:
◦ Run Quality Control (QC) samples to ensure instrument
performance.
◦ Load patient samples and acquire data, ensuring data
collection until the total number of events per tube are met
(e.g., 10,000 events).
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Use appropriate software to analyze flow cytometry data.
◦ Apply gating strategies to identify positive cells and quantify
marker expression.
◦ Compare results to established reference ranges and
control samples.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify that all reagents are within expiration date and stored
according to manufacturer instructions.
• QC must be processed with each run to ensure the accuracy and
precision of results.
• Instrument check and maintenance should be performed as
scheduled.
• Use internal controls and reference materials to assure assay
performance.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure all patient demographics and sample details are
accurately recorded.
• Review analyzed data and verify interpretation with appropriate
pathology staff.
• Generate report including detailed results for each marker,
interpretation, and possible diagnostic information.
• Document and sign off by the laboratory supervisor or pathologist
before releasing the report.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Analysis is dependent on the quality of sample and antigen
expression.
• Inadequate sample volume or cell viability can affect results.
• High background or non-specific binding can lead to inaccurate
interpretations.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Specific to individual markers and panels used, as established by
validation studies.
• Reference intervals should be reviewed regularly and updated
based on current literature and internal data.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for flow cytometry reagents and
instruments.
• Current literature and guidelines on leukemia/lymphoma cell
marker analysis.
