Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Leukemia/Lymphoma
Immunophenotyping, Flow Cytometry, Tissue (Analytical Phase)
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for conducting leukemia and lymphoma
immunophenotyping using flow cytometry on tissue specimens to
ensure accurate and consistent results.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the immunophenotyping process. It is the responsibility
of the Laboratory Supervisor to ensure adherence to this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Fresh tissue sample obtained from lymph node, bone marrow, or
solid tumor.
• Specimens should be placed in RPMI-1640 medium or equivalent
within 1 hour of collection and transported to the laboratory on ice.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without
appropriate refrigeration.
• Specimens stored in formalin or other fixatives.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II) RPMI-1640 medium or
equivalent Flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1%
sodium azide) Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for target
antigens Lysis buffer (commercial or home-made) 7-AAD viability dye
or equivalent Controls: Known positive control cells and isotype
controls
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Mince tissue sample into small pieces using sterile scalpel and
forceps.
2. Transfer tissue to a sterile petri dish containing RPMI-1640
medium.
3. Homogenize tissue using a disposable tissue grinder or Dounce
homogenizer.
4. Pass the homogenized tissue through a 40µm cell strainer into
a sterile centrifuge tube to obtain a single-cell suspension.
5. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
6. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in flow
cytometry buffer.
7. Count cells and adjust concentration to 1 x 10^6 cells/mL.
B) Staining Procedure:
1. Aliquot 100µL of cell suspension (1 x 10^5 cells) into
appropriately labeled flow cytometry tubes.
2. Add appropriate titrated concentration of fluorochrome-
conjugated antibodies to each tube.
3. Include appropriate isotype controls and known positive
controls.
4. Incubate the tubes for 20-30 minutes at 4°C in the dark.
5. Wash the cells by adding 2mL of flow cytometry buffer,
centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes, and discard the
supernatant.
6. If using 7-AAD or equivalent for viability assessment, add 5µL
of the dye and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in
the dark.
7. Resuspend the cells in 500µL of flow cytometry buffer for
acquisition.
C) Acquisition and Analysis:
1. Perform instrument setup and calibration using manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Set compensation using single-color controls.
3. Acquire a minimum of 10,000 viable cell events using the flow
cytometer.
4. Use software to analyze data for expression of target antigens
and determine the immunophenotype of the leukemia/
lymphoma.
5. Verify and interpret results against established leukemia/
lymphoma cell marker profiles.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Run known positive and negative control samples with each
batch of specimen samples.
8. Verify flow cytometer performance using calibration beads daily.
9. Document and regularly review results from controls, and retain
all flow cytometry plots and data for reference.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Review individual flow cytometry data files.
12. Prepare a comprehensive report that includes cell count,
percentage of positive cells, and detailed immunophenotyping
results.
13. Where applicable, include interpretive comments based on the
immunophenotyping results.
14. Validate reports by a supervising clinical pathologist or
designated authority before results are released to the
physician.
