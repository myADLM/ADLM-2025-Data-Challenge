Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Leukemia/Lymphoma
Immunophenotyping by Flow Cytometry
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
immunophenotyping of suspected leukemia and lymphoma cases
using flow cytometry. This protocol provides guidelines on sample
preparation, staining, data acquisition, and analysis to ensure
consistent and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all trained laboratory personnel performing flow
cytometry-based immunophenotyping in the clinical laboratory. It
covers sample handling, reagent preparation, instrument setup, and
data analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and scientists are responsible for sample
processing, staining, acquisition, and initial data analysis.
Supervisors or senior scientists are responsible for reviewing and
validating the results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Immunophenotyping: A process used to identify cells based on
the types of antigens or markers on the cell surface or inside the
cell using antibodies tagged with fluorescent dyes.
• Flow Cytometry: A laser-based technology used to count and
profile cells in a fluid mixture by measuring the light scattering and
fluorescence emitted.
5. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• Specimens: Bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph node biopsies,
or other relevant tissue samples
• Fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies for CD markers of
interest (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD34, CD45, etc.)
• Flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.09% sodium
azide)
• Red blood cell lysis solution
• Tubes (e.g., 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes)
• Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto, Beckman Coulter, etc.)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Peripheral Blood and Bone Marrow:
◦ Collect blood specimens in EDTA tubes.
◦ Collect bone marrow aspirates in heparinized syringes or
EDTA tubes.
◦ Gently invert tubes to mix.
◦ Process the samples within 24 hours of collection.
2. Tissue Samples:
◦ Prepare a single-cell suspension from lymph node biopsies
or other tissue samples using mechanical dissociation or
enzymatic digestion.
◦ Filter the cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer to
remove debris.
B. Cell Counting and Staining
1. Cell Counting:
◦ Determine the cell concentration using a hemocytometer or
an automated cell counter.
◦ Adjust the cell concentration to 1-2 x 10^6 cells/mL with flow
cytometry buffer.
2. Antibody Staining:
◦ Aliquot 100 µL of the cell suspension into appropriately
labeled tubes.
◦ Add the recommended volume of fluorescently labeled
antibodies to each tube according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Vortex gently and incubate for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature in the dark.
3. Red Blood Cell Lysis (if applicable):
◦ Add 2 mL of red blood cell lysis solution to the tubes.
◦ Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
◦ Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200
µL of flow cytometry buffer.
C. Flow Cytometry Acquisition
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the flow cytometer and perform daily startup and
calibration procedures as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Set up the instrument with appropriate voltage and
compensation settings for the fluorochromes used.
2. Sample Acquisition:
◦ Place the stained samples on the flow cytometer sample
loader.
◦ Acquire at least 10,000 events per sample, focusing on the
lymphocyte gate.
◦ Save the data files for analysis.
D. Data Analysis
1. Software Setup:
◦ Use flow cytometry analysis software (e.g., FlowJo,
FACSDiva) for data analysis.
◦ Create gating strategies to identify different cell populations
based on forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and
specific CD marker expression.
2. Gating Strategy:
◦ Gate on the lymphocyte population based on FSC and SSC.
◦ Analyze the expression of specific CD markers within the
gated population.
◦ Compare the expression patterns to known profiles for
different types of leukemia or lymphoma.
E. Quality Control and Documentation
1. Quality Control:
◦ Use known positive and negative control samples to ensure
accuracy.
◦ Run regular maintenance and calibration checks on the flow
cytometer.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all sample details, reagent lot numbers, and
instrument settings.
◦ Review and validate results with a supervisor before
reporting.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Review:
◦ Review the gated populations for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Identify abnormal populations and potential leukemia/
lymphoma cells.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the data based on the specific CD marker
expression profiles.
◦ Prepare a detailed report with the findings and
interpretation.
3. Result Verification:
◦ Have all results reviewed and signed off by a supervisor or
senior scientist.
