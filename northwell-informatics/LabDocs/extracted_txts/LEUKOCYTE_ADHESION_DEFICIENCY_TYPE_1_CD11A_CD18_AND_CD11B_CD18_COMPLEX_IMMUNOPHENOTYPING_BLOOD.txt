Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Leukocyte Adhesion
Deficiency Type 1 (LAD-1), CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 Complex
Immunophenotyping, Blood
1. PURPOSE This SOP describes the procedure to conduct
immunophenotyping for diagnosing Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency
Type 1 (LAD-1) by analyzing the expression of CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1)
and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) on leukocytes in human blood. This
method will allow for accurate assessment and generation of results.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to laboratory technologists and other
designated personnel trained in flow cytometry and
immunophenotyping techniques for detecting LAD-1.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedure.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed correctly and for taking corrective action if necessary.
4. DEFINITION LAD-1 is a rare congenital disorder characterized by
the inability of leukocytes to adhere to the endothelium and migrate
to sites of infection due to defective or deficient CD18.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer
• Blood collection tubes (EDTA)
• BD FACS Lysing Solution or equivalent
• Fluorescently labeled antibodies: Anti-CD11a (LFA-1)-FITC, Anti-
CD18-PE, Anti-CD11b (Mac-1)-APC
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Collect blood sample in an EDTA tube.
• Process the blood sample within 24 hours of collection. Store at
2-8°C until processing.
6.2 Staining Protocol:
• Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into a polystyrene tube for staining.
• Add the following fluorescently labeled antibodies to the blood
sample:
◦ Anti-CD11a-FITC as per manufacturer's recommended
dilution.
◦ Anti-CD18-PE as per manufacturer's recommended dilution.
◦ Anti-CD11b-APC as per manufacturer's recommended
dilution.
• Vortex the tube gently to mix.
• Incubate the sample in the dark at room temperature for 20
minutes.
6.3 Red Blood Cell Lysis:
• Add 2 mL of BD FACS Lysing Solution or equivalent to the tube.
• Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes.
• Carefully decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL
of PBS.
• Centrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes, then decant the supernatant.
6.4 Flow Cytometry Analysis:
• Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of PBS.
• Acquire samples on a flow cytometer calibrated for the detection
of FITC, PE, and APC.
• Set appropriate gates to identify leukocyte populations (e.g.,
lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes).
• Measure and record the fluorescence intensities of CD11a,
CD11b, and CD18 on gated leukocyte populations.
6.5 Data Analysis:
• Analyze the expression levels of CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and
CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) using flow cytometry software.
• Compare the results with appropriate controls (e.g., healthy
donor, known LAD-1 patient).
• Calculate the percentage of leukocytes expressing CD11a/CD18
and CD11b/CD18.
• Record the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and the percentage
of cells positive for the markers.
6.6 Interpretation of Results:
• Decreased or absent expression of CD11a/CD18 and/or CD11b/
CD18 indicates a potential diagnosis of LAD-1.
• Comparative analysis with clinical presentations and other
laboratory findings should be performed for the final diagnosis.
• Reference ranges and acceptability criteria should be based on
established healthy donor values and published literature.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with known positive and negative controls
for each antibody stain.
• Ensure flow cytometer calibration daily before using.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report percentage of positive leukocytes and MFI for CD11a/
CD18 and CD11b/CD18.
• Include analytical interpretation and state whether results are
consistent with LAD-1.
9. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Blood samples: Store at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours.
• Antibodies: Store as per manufacturer’s instructions.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for antibodies and flow cytometry
reagents.
• Published guidelines and literature on the diagnosis and
management of LAD-1.
11. ATTACHMENTS
• Flow Cytometry Gating Strategy Diagram
• Quality Control Logs
• Temperature and Calibration Logs
This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
