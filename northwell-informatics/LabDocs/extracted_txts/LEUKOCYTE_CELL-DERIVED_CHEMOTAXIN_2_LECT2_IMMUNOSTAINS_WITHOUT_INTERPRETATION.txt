STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) LEUKOCYTE
CELL-DERIVED CHEMOTAXIN 2 (LECT2) Immunostains Without
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed
protocol for the analytical phase of generating results for Leukocyte
cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) immunostains without
interpretation. This SOP outlines the steps required to achieve
accurate and consistent LECT2 staining, documentation, and quality
control for analysis.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks or slides.
• Unacceptable: Frozen tissue specimens, incompletely fixed or
inadequately processed tissues, improperly labeled specimens.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated stainer: (e.g., Ventana BenchMark ULTRA, Dako
Autostainer, Leica BOND-III)
• Primary Antibody: Anti-LECT2 (clone [specify if known])
• Detection Kit: Suitable detection system (e.g., DAB, HRP-
conjugated secondary antibodies)
• Control Slides: Positive and negative control FFPE tissue sections
• Coverslipper
• Slide racks and trays
• Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Pre-Staining Preparation: a. Review and verify the specimen
requisition forms and relevant patient information. b. Select
appropriate FFPE tissue block and prepare 4-5 µm thick sections.
Mount sections onto positively charged microscope slides. c. Place
slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adherence to the slide.
4.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: a. Preheat automated slide
stainer as per the manufacturer’s instructions. b. Load slides into the
stainer and run deparaffinization and rehydration protocol using
sequential xylene and ethanol washes, followed by water rinse.
4.3. Antigen Retrieval: a. Perform antigen retrieval as per the specific
requirement for the LECT2 antibody (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or
EDTA buffer pH 9.0). b. Load the slides into preheated retrieval
solution and process in a pressure cooker, microwave, or steamer for
the recommended time (typically 20 min).
4.4. Immunostaining: a. Load slides back into the automated stainer.
b. Apply a peroxidase block to the tissue sections if needed to
quench endogenous activity. c. Incubate tissue sections with the
primary antibody (Anti-LECT2). Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for dilution and incubation times (typically 30-60 mins at
room temperature). d. Rinse slides with buffer solution (e.g.,
phosphate-buffered saline, Tris-buffered saline) to remove excess
primary antibody. e. Apply secondary detection reagent (HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody). Incubate as per manufacturer’s
instructions (e.g., 20-30 mins). f. Apply substrate-chromogen solution
(DAB or equivalent), and develop color as per manufacturer’s
instructions (typically 5-10 mins). g. Counterstain slides with
hematoxylin for approximately 1 minute and rinse with water.
4.6. Post-Staining Procedure: a. Dehydrate slides through graded
ethanol series and clear in xylene. b. Use coverslipper to coverslip
the stained slides with mounting medium.
4.7. Quality Control: a. Include positive and negative control slides
with each batch of staining. b. Examine control slides to ensure
proper staining and specificity. c. Record results and quality control in
the laboratory log.
5. QUALITY ASSURANCE
5.1. Internal Quality Control: a. Perform QC checks regularly using
positive and negative control tissues. b. Document any deviation from
expected results and take corrective actions as needed. c. Ensure
daily instrument maintenance per manufacturer’s guidelines.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results from LECT2 immunostaining will be documented and
provided without interpretation. All stained slides will be reviewed by
a trained pathologist or designated personnel for further diagnostic
interpretation as needed.
