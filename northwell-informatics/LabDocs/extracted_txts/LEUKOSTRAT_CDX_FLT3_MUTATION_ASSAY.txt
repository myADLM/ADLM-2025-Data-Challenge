Standard Operating Procedure for LEUKOSTRAT CDx FLT3
Mutation Assay
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for performing the
LEUKOSTRAT CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect
internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and tyrosine kinase
domain (TKD) mutations in the FLT3 gene in DNA extracted from
human blood or bone marrow specimens.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained
to perform the LEUKOSTRAT CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay within the
molecular diagnostics section of the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel performing the assay to follow this standard operating
procedure, ensure that all quality control criteria are met, and
maintain proper documentation.
4. DEFINITION FLT3 ITD: Internal Tandem Duplication in the FLT3
gene. FLT3 TKD: Tyrosine Kinase Domain mutations in the FLT3
gene.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Equipment and Supplies
• LEUKOSTRAT CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay Kit
• Thermal Cycler
• PCR consumables (e.g., tubes, plates)
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Calibrated micropipettes (2-20 µL, 20-200 µL, 100-1000 µL)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• UV spectrophotometer or equivalent for DNA quantification
• Positive and Negative control DNA
• Laboratory timer
5.2. Specimen Requirements
• Acceptable specimens include:
◦ Fresh blood or bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA or
ACD tubes
◦ Previously isolated DNA stored at -20°C to -80°C
• Minimum specimen volume: 5 mL of blood or 1 mL of bone
marrow aspirate.
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory under
refrigerated conditions (2-8°C) and should be processed within 24
hours of collection.
5.3. DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA from blood or bone marrow specimens using the
specified DNA Extraction Kit as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Measure DNA concentration and purity using a UV
spectrophotometer. Acceptable purity range (A260/A280): 1.8 -
2.0.
• Dilute DNA samples to a concentration of 10 ng/µL with nuclease-
free water.
5.4. PCR Amplification and Detection
• Place the LEUKOSTRAT CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay components
(reaction mix, primers/probes, enzyme) on ice.
• Prepare PCR reaction master mix as per the kit instructions,
including appropriate volumes of DNA template, positive and
negative controls.
• Distribute the master mix into PCR tubes or plate wells, ensuring
even distribution and avoiding cross-contamination.
• Seal the tubes or PCR plate and briefly centrifuge to ensure all
reagents are at the bottom of the wells.
• Load tubes or plate into the thermal cycler.
• Program the thermal cycler according to the cycling conditions
specified in the assay kit:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
• Post-amplification hold at 4°C until analysis.
5.5. Data Analysis and Interpretation
• Analyze PCR products using high-resolution melting curve
analysis or gel electrophoresis as outlined in the manufacturer's
protocol.
• Compare the melting curves or electrophoresis bands of unknown
samples to those of the positive and negative controls.
• Identify the presence of FLT3 ITD or TKD mutations based on the
established criteria provided in the kit instructions.
5.6. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to verify
assay performance.
• Repeat the assay if controls do not perform within the expected
range.
• Maintain documentation of control results and corrective actions.
5.7. Reporting Results
• Record results in the Laboratory Information Management System
(LIMS).
• Confirm positive results with repeat testing as necessary.
• Report results to the requesting clinician, including details
regarding the presence/absence of FLT3 ITD and TKD mutations.
5.8. Troubleshooting
• If unexpected results or errors occur, review the following:
◦ Reagent storage and expiration dates
◦ Calibration and maintenance of equipment
◦ Pipetting accuracy and technique
◦ DNA quality and quantity
◦ Reagents or equipment contamination
6. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all standard laboratory safety guidelines, including the use
of personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle reagents and specimens as potentially infectious
materials.
• Dispose of waste according to institutional biosafety protocols.

8. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a logbook of all processed specimens, including
specimen ID, date of extraction, PCR batch number, and results.
• Document all QC measures, including positive and negative
control results, troubleshooting steps, and corrective actions
taken.
