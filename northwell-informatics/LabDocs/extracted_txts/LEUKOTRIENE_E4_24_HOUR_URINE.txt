Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Leukotriene E4, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing
Leukotriene E4 in a 24-hour urine sample. It includes necessary
steps for preparation, sample processing, analysis, quality
control, and reporting to ensure reliable, accurate, and timely
results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for conducting the Leukotriene E4 assay on 24-
hour urine samples within the laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS Leukotriene E4 (LTE4): A chemical compound
derived from arachidonic acid used in the diagnosis and
monitoring of various inflammatory conditions. 24-hour urine
sample: Urine collected over a 24-hour period to obtain a
complete representation of metabolic and renal function.
4. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
technologists to follow this SOP accurately and ensure that
quality control measures are practiced to attain valid results.
Any deviation from this protocol must be documented and
reported to the supervisor.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Equipment and Supplies:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) system
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated urine samples
• 24-hour urine collection containers
• Leukotriene E4 Assay Kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Lab logbook
5.2 Sample Preparation:
• Confirm receipt and proper labeling of the 24-hour urine
collection.
• Mix the 24-hour collection container thoroughly to ensure
uniformity.
• Measure the total volume of the collected 24-hour urine and
record.
• Aliquot a portion of the sample (usually 50-100 mL) and
refrigerate it until analysis.
• Perform centrifugation (2000 x g for 10 minutes) to remove any
particulate matter from the urine.
5.3 Assay Preparation:
• Prepare reagents and standards as specified in the Leukotriene
E4 Assay Kit’s instructions.
• Prepare calibrators and controls to fall within the detection range.
5.4 Analytical Procedure (using ELISA as an example):
• Add appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and urine
samples to the wells of the ELISA microplate.
• Incubate the plate according to the kit instructions.
• Wash the plate as specified to remove unbound material.
• Add any secondary reagents or substrates as per the protocol of
the kit.
• Measure optical density at the specified wavelength using a plate
reader.
5.5 Analytical Procedure (using HPLC as an example):
• Prepare HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Inject prepared urine samples, standards, and controls into the
HPLC system.
• Record chromatograms and peak areas.
• Analyze data and compare results with standards to quantify
LTE4 concentration.
5.6 Quality Control:
• Run controls (both low and high) with each assay batch.
• Evaluate quality control results prior to patient sample testing.
• Recalibrate the assay if control results fall outside the expected
range.
• Document all quality control results in the lab logbook as well as
corrective actions if necessary.
5.7 Reporting Results:
• Calculate the concentration of Leukotriene E4 in the 24-hour urine
samples using the standard curve.
• Normalize the concentration obtained to a 24-hour urine output
basis (e.g., ng/24 hours).
• Record the finalized results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review.
• Results must be reviewed and validated by a senior technologist
or supervisor before releasing to the ordering healthcare provider.
5.8 Reference Intervals:
• Refer to laboratory's determined reference intervals or
manufacturer’s recommendations for healthy control ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s insert
(ELISA/HPLC) for specific limitations regarding the detection
range, cross-reactivity, and potential assay interferences.
