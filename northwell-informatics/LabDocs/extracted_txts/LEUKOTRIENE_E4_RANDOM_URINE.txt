Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Leukotriene E4, Random, Urine
1. Objective
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
testing for Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) in random urine samples. The
objective is to ensure accurate and precise measurement of LTE4
levels in urine, following all regulatory and laboratory standards.
1. Scope
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis and reporting of LTE4 levels in urine samples within the
laboratory.
1. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform LTE4 analysis on urine
samples using appropriate instrumentation and techniques, and
document all activities.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure adherence to this protocol,
monitor quality control, and verify results before releasing.
• Quality Control Unit: Oversee quality control procedures, address
out-of-range results, and manage equipment calibration and
maintenance.
1. Specimen Requirements
◦ Preferred Specimen: 5-10 mL of random urine collected in a
sterile container.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen: Samples with visible
contamination, leakage, or improper labeling. Samples
stored improperly (beyond indicated period or temperature).
2. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Analytical Instrument: Liquid Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS) system or ELISA reader.
◦ Reagents: LTE4 assay kit specific reagents and internal
standards, high-purity solvents.
◦ Supplies: Sterile urine collection containers, pipettes, tubes,
LC-MS or ELISA plates, calibration standards and control
materials.
3. Quality Control
◦ Use positive and negative control samples during each
analytical run.
◦ Employ at least two levels of LTE4 quality control material.
◦ QC materials should be prepared and handled according to
manufacturer's guidelines and laboratory procedures.
◦ Verify calibration and control results before sample analysis.
4. Calibration and Validation
◦ Calibrate LC-MS or ELISA systems using standards
provided by the assay kit.
◦ Validate new batches of reagents with quality control
samples.
◦ Perform instrument validation and maintenance as per
manufacturer’s protocol.
5. Analytical Procedure
A. Preparation
◦ Thaw and room temperature equilibration: Allow urine
samples and controls to equilibrate to room temperature if
frozen.
◦ Vortex and Centrifuge: Mix samples thoroughly and
centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
B. Instrument Setup
◦ LC-MS: Set up the column, mobile phase, and detector with
appropriate LTE4 method parameters (flow rate,
temperature, gradients).
◦ ELISA: Coating, washing, blocking steps as per the kit
instruction manual.
C. Sample Preparation (if using LC-MS)
◦ Pipet appropriate volume of urine into extraction tubes.
◦ Add internal standard and vortex.
◦ Process as per solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid
extraction method.
D. Sample Analysis
◦ Inject prepared samples and controls into the LC-MS or load
onto ELISA plate.
◦ Follow the run protocol ensuring no delays that affect
sample integrity.
◦ Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of the
batch.
6. Result Calculation and Review
◦ Calculate LTE4 concentration from calibration curves and
instrument readings.
◦ Review the QC results for each batch:
▪ If QC results are within the acceptable range, proceed
with patient sample analysis.
▪ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot, recalibrate,
and reanalyze samples.
◦ Review results for consistency and plausibility; flag any
questionable results.
7. Reporting Results
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify all manually transcribed results for accuracy.
◦ Review results by a second technologist or supervisor if
required.
◦ Report LUT E4 levels according to lab standards and
reference intervals.
8. Safety and Waste Disposal
◦ Follow laboratory safety guidelines for working with
biological specimens and chemical reagents.
◦ Dispose of waste materials (e.g., used ELISA plates,
extraction solvents) in accordance with environmental health
and safety regulations.
