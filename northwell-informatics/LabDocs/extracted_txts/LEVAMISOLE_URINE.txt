LEVAMISOLE, URINE - Analytical Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for analyzing urine samples for
the presence of levamisole, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• 20 mL freshly collected urine in a sterile, appropriate container.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory after more than 24 hours
post-collection.
• Specimens without a recorded collection date/time or without
proper labeling.
• Specimens with visible contamination or severe hemolysis.
Note: If the sample has been refrigerated, bring to room temperature
prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Analytical balance.
Reagents:
• LC-MS grade methanol.
• LC-MS grade acetonitrile.
• Deionized water.
• Levamisole reference standard.
• Internal standard (e.g., diazepam).
Supplies:
• Sterile urine collection containers.
• 12 x 75 mm disposable culture tubes.
• LC-MS vials with caps.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Levamisole control samples, low and high concentration levels
(prepared in-house or commercially available).
Storage:
• Store control samples at -20°C. Quick thaw at room temperature
prior to use.
Procedure:
• Run levamisole control samples with every batch of patient
samples.
• Ensure controls fall within established ranges before reporting
patient results.
• Record control results in the quality control log.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure the urine sample is at room temperature.
2. Vortex mix the urine sample for 60 seconds.
Extraction:
1. Pipette 1 mL of urine into a 12 x 75 mm disposable culture tube.
2. Add 20 µL of the internal standard solution to the urine sample.
3. Add 3 mL of LC-MS grade acetonitrile to the tube to precipitate
proteins.
4. Vortex the tube for 60 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the tube for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean LC-MS vial using a pipette.
Analysis:
1. Inject 10 µL of the sample onto the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Set the LC-MS/MS parameters according to established
protocols for levamisole detection (refer to instrument manual
for specific settings).
Data Interpretation:
1. Compare the sample retention time and mass spectra to those
of the levamisole reference standard.
2. Quantify levamisole concentration using the ratio of the analyte
peak to the internal standard peak.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Verify the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. Report levamisole concentration in ng/mL.
6. Include comments on sample integrity if issues are noted during
analysis.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Levamisole is typically detected in urine samples from patients
with recent exposure.
• No established reference interval for levamisole in urine (report
detected vs. not detected).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High protein or hemolysis may affect the extraction efficiency.
• Specificity of the LC-MS/MS method to ensure levamisole is
accurately identified.
1. REFERENCES
• LC-MS/MS system manual and protocol for operation.
• Levamisole reference material specifications.
• Research literature on levamisole metabolism and detection in
urine.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to correctly
perform the analytical procedure and ensure quality control measures
are adhered to. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results and
addressing any deviations from established protocols.
