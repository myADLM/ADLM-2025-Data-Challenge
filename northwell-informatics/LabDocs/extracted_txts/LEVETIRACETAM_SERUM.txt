Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Levetiracetam, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the analysis of
Levetiracetam (Keppra) levels in serum, ensuring the accuracy
and precision of results to support clinical decision-making.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all staff in the clinical
laboratory responsible for the analysis of Levetiracetam levels
in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and implementing corrective actions when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Collection: Serum collected in a plain red-top or serum-separator
tube (SST).
• Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum is stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C; for longer
storage, freeze at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV
Detection
• HPLC Columns specific for Levetiracetam analysis
• HPLC Grade solvents (Water, Methanol, Acetonitrile)
• Levetiracetam Certified Reference Standard
• Internal Standard (as specified by method)
• Calibration materials and quality control (QC) samples
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vials and caps for HPLC
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
3. Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled vial.
4. If necessary, aliquot and freeze the serum at -20°C until ready
for analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards of Levetiracetam in serum matrix
at concentrations spanning the expected serum levels.
2. Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations
within the calibration range.
3. Include an internal standard in all calibration and QC samples
as well as unknown specimens.
C) HPLC Analysis:
1. Equilibrate the HPLC system with mobile phase until the
baseline is stable.
2. Inject calibration standards in duplicate to establish a calibration
curve.
3. Inject QC samples to ensure the system is performing within
acceptable limits.
4. Inject a blank (serum matrix without Levetiracetam) to check for
carryover.
5. Inject patient serum samples in duplicate.
6. Perform a calibration check after every 10 patient samples or
as needed.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Identify Levetiracetam peaks based on retention time and UV
detection parameters.
2. Calculate the concentration of Levetiracetam in serum samples
using the calibration curve.
3. Run controls and compare to target values to ensure accuracy.
4. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Review chromatograms for each sample to ensure acceptable
peak shape and resolution.
• Verify all QC results fall within specified limits before reporting
patient results.
• Enter results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify for accuracy.
• Any critical values must be reported immediately to the ordering
physician as per laboratory protocol.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Sample hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with results.
• Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and QC materials are stored and
used as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of HPLC equipment
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Document daily performance checks, maintenance activities, and
calibration results.
• Review and address any out-of-control QC results immediately
following laboratory SOPs.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the HPLC and column used.
• Clinical guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of
Levetiracetam.
• Peer-reviewed literature on validation and analytical performance
of Levetiracetam assays.
Note: Deviations from this SOP require approval from the laboratory
supervisor or director. This SOP is subject to regular review and will
be updated as necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory
requirements and best practices.
