Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lidocaine, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a procedural guideline for the analytical phase of
generating accurate and reliable results for serum lidocaine levels. It
encompasses preparation, analysis, documentation, and result
verification.
Responsibility: The assigned technologist is responsible for carrying
out the procedure for serum lidocaine analysis and ensuring that all
aspects are performed according to this SOP. It is also the
responsibility of the technologist to flag any discrepancies or errors to
their supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic agent used to treat cardiac
arrhythmias and for local anesthesia. Monitoring serum levels of
lidocaine is important for proper dosing and to avoid toxicity.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red or gold-top tube.
• Specimen Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within
2 hours of collection and refrigerated if not analyzed immediately.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens, as well as specimens collected in tubes containing
anticoagulants like EDTA, citrate, or heparin.
Equipment and Reagents:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Mass Spectrometry (MS)
• Calibrators and controls
• Lidocaine assay reagent kits
• Internal Standards
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Sample preparation reagents (such as solvents and buffers)
• Quality Control (QC) materials
Procedure: A) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to thaw completely at room temperature if
previously frozen.
2. Centrifuge the serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
3. If using an HPLC system: a. Pipette a specified volume of
serum (e.g. 100 µL) into a labeled test tube. b. Add the internal
standard (as per reagent kit instructions or determined by the
laboratory). c. Add the appropriate volume of protein
precipitating reagent (such as acetonitrile or methanol). d.
Vortex the mixture and centrifuge it at 10,000 rpm for 10
minutes. e. Transfer the clear supernatant to HPLC vials for
injection.
4. If using a Mass Spectrometry system: a. Follow similar steps as
above but adhere strictly to the MS reagent kit instructions for
solvent use and sample preparation.
B) Analysis:
1. Ensure the HPLC or MS system is appropriately calibrated and
quality controls are passed.
2. Set the instrument parameters according to the method
developed for lidocaine analysis.
3. Inject the prepared samples into the instrument.
4. Monitor the analysis run to ensure system performance and
identify any malfunction.
C) Data Management:
1. Collect and review the chromatograms or mass spectra for
each sample.
2. Confirm the peak identification and quantitation using the
internal standard.
3. Document any discrepancies or unusual findings during the run.
D) Quality Control and Validation:
1. Run QC samples alongside patient specimens in each batch.
2. Accept or reject runs based on QC results.
3. Document all QC results including any required corrective
actions.
4. RESULT REPORTING
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the analyzing
technologist.
• Ensure results are transmitted and documented accurately in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Any critical results should be communicated to the appropriate
healthcare provider immediately following laboratory protocols.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic range: 1.5-5.0 µg/mL
• Toxic level: >5.0 µg/mL
Report any results outside the reference intervals to the ordering
physician or appropriate clinical personnel promptly.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for lidocaine assay reagent kits.
• HPLC/MS instrument user manual.
• Applicable clinical laboratory standards and guidelines (e.g.,
CLSI, CAP).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a Temperature Monitoring Log for all equipment.
• Maintain a QC Log including any deviations and corrective
actions.
• Retain all analytical data and reports as per laboratory policy for
future review and audit.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icteric samples can interfere with
lidocaine levels.
• Matrix effects in serum samples might require additional method
validation steps.
Adherence to this SOP will ensure accurate and reliable results for
lidocaine serum levels, aligning with clinical and regulatory
standards.
