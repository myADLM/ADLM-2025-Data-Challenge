Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for LIME, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating laboratory results for LIME (Liver Induced Metabolic
Enzyme), IGE (Immunoglobulin E), and SERUM (routine serum
analysis). This ensures accurate, reliable, and timely results that
adhere to CLIA standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this procedure, ensuring equipment and reagents are
properly maintained and calibrated, documenting observations, and
taking corrective actions as necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
LIME:
• Sample Type: Serum or plasma
• Collection Tube: Lithium heparin (green top) or Gel Separator
Tube (SST - gold top)
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL
• Stability: 8 hours at room temperature; 24 hours refrigerated at
2-8°C
IGE:
• Sample Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Gel Separator Tube (SST - gold top)
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL
• Stability: 24 hours at room temperature; 7 days refrigerated at
2-8°C
SERUM:
• Sample Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Gel Separator Tube (SST - gold top)
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL
• Stability: 48 hours at room temperature; 7 days refrigerated at 2-8
°C
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment Preparation:
• Verify that the analyzers and equipment used for LIME, IGE,
SERUM are calibrated and functional.
• Perform daily checks of temperature-dependent equipment,
including refrigerators and freezers.
• Ensure all reagents and calibrators are not expired and are
prepared according to manufacturer instructions.
B. Sample Handling:
• Retrieve sample from storage and ensure proper identification.
• For refrigerated samples, allow them to come to room
temperature before processing.
• Centrifuge specimens for at least 10 minutes at 1500-2500 rpm to
obtain clear serum.
C. Performing the Assays: LIME:
1. Label and prepare test tubes accordingly.
2. Load serum or plasma samples into the automated analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Ensure control samples are run to verify the accuracy of the
assay.
4. Document all observations and perform any corrective actions if
necessary.
IGE:
1. Label and prepare test tubes accordingly.
2. Use the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method
for IGE.
3. Aliquot serum samples and add them to the ELISA plate wells
following the kit instructions.
4. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength as mentioned
in the protocol.
5. Verify control results and document observations.
SERUM:
1. Label and prepare test tubes accordingly.
2. Load serum samples into the automated chemistry analyzer.
3. Run routine biochemical tests as per standard analyzer
protocols.
4. Ensure control samples are run to verify the accuracy of the
assay.
5. Record all observations and perform corrective actions if any
issues arise.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC on each new reagent lot or shipment received and
document results.
• Internal QC should be run at the start of each analysis batch and
when changing reagents.
• Use control materials specific for LIME, IGE, and routine serum
tests.
• Compare QC results against established ranges, and investigate
any deviations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results according to lab-specific protocols.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• For any atypical results, follow necessary steps to notify clinicians
as per lab protocols.
• Document any discrepancies and corrective actions taken.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• LIME: Reference intervals as per latest established guidelines.
• IGE: Reference intervals as per latest established guidelines.
• SERUM: Each serum test component to be reported with
established reference intervals (e.g., Glucose, Electrolytes, etc.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer product inserts for specific limitations of
the assays and reagents used for LIME, IGE, and routine serum
tests.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If quality control fails, halt testing and investigate the source of the
problem.
• Recalibrate equipment and rerun samples as needed.
• Consult supervisors for further action if corrective measures do
not resolve the issue.
