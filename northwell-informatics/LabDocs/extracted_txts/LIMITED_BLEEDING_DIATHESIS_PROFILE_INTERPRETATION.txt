1. Purpose
To ensure the accurate and efficient generation of results for the
Limited Bleeding Diathesis Profile Interpretation. This protocol
outlines the steps for the analytical phase, which includes the
preparation, testing, quality control, and result reporting of the
patient's specimens for coagulation parameters.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing coagulation
tests including PT, APTT, fibrinogen, and Factor VIII assays at
[Laboratory Name].
3. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the tests as per procedure,
ensure proper documentation, and report any issues.
• Quality Control Manager: Monitor quality control, review test
performance, and address any deviations.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP, review results,
validate findings, and report any issues to the management.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Citrated plasma (blue top tube)
• Volume: A minimum of 3 mL of blood per tube
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 4 hours at room
temperature. If testing is delayed, plasma should be separated
and stored at -20°C. Thawed samples should not be refrozen.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Clotted samples, hemolyzed
samples, lipemic samples, or improperly labeled specimens.
5. Equipment and Reagents
• Equipment:
◦ Coagulation Analyzer (e.g. Sysmex CS-2500)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes
• Reagents:
◦ PT Reagent (e.g. Innovin)
◦ APTT Reagent (e.g. Actin FSL)
◦ Fibrinogen Reagent (e.g. Clauss Fibrinogen)
◦ Factor VIII Assay Reagent
6. Procedure
A. Preparation and Calibration
1. Daily Equipment Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the coagulation analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Document calibration results in the Equipment Calibration
Log.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions, ensuring that they are within the expiry date.
◦ Record lot numbers and expiry dates in the Reagent Log.
B. Specimen Processing
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge collected citrated blood samples at 1500 x g for
15 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Transfer the plasma into labeled aliquot tubes using a clean
pipette.
2. Loading and Testing:
◦ Load the plasma samples onto the coagulation analyzer.
◦ Perform the PT, APTT, fibrinogen, and Factor VIII assays
using the following test procedure:
▪ PT Test: Add PT reagent to the plasma and measure
clotting time.
▪ APTT Test: Add APTT reagent and calcium chloride to
the plasma and measure clotting time.
▪ Fibrinogen Test: Add thrombin reagent to the plasma
and measure the rate of fibrin formation.
▪ Factor VIII Assay: Perform using a one-stage clotting
assay.
C. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run Normal and Abnormal control plasmas at the beginning
of each shift.
◦ Analyze Quality Control (QC) materials after calibration,
after replacing reagents, and periodically throughout the
day.
◦ Record QC results in the Quality Control Log and ensure
they fall within acceptable ranges.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in an External Quality Assessment Scheme
(EQAS) and handle samples as per the program guidelines.
D. Result Validation and Reporting
1. Validation:
◦ Review all test results to ensure they are within the defined
reference ranges.
◦ Validate any results showing abnormal findings by re-
running the test or performing confirmatory tests as
necessary.
2. Reporting:
◦ Document final results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Report critical values immediately to the requesting
physician as per the laboratory’s critical value policy.
7. Reference Intervals
• Prothrombin Time (PT): 11-13.5 seconds
• Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT): 25-35 seconds
• Fibrinogen: 200-400 mg/dL
• Factor VIII Activity: 50-150%
8. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and clotting in the specimen can affect test
results.
• Ensure proper handling and processing of samples to prevent
pre-analytical errors.
9. References
• Instructions and inserts for PT, APTT, fibrinogen, and Factor VIII
reagents.
• Manufacturer’s manual for the coagulation analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
