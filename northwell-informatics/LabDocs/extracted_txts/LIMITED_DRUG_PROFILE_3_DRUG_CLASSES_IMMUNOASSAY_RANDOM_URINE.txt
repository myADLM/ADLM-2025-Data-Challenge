Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Limited Drug Profile, 3 Drug
Classes, Immunoassay, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for analyzing and generating
results for limited drug profile testing, affecting three drug classes
using an immunoassay method on random urine samples. Our goal
is to ensure accurate, reproducible, and reliable results while
maintaining regulatory compliance and laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
Laboratory staff is responsible for performing the analysis,
documenting results, and ensuring that all procedures are followed
according to this SOP. A designated supervisor ensures adherence to
protocols and corrects any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Randomly collected urine sample, 30-50 mL, provided no later
than 24 hours post-collection when stored at 2-8°C.
• Specimens in urine collection cups specifically designed for drug
testing, ensuring no adulteration.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples older than 24 hours if stored at 2-8°C.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
• Urine samples diluted or collected using non-standard methods
(e.g. shared containers).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (with appropriate cartridge)
• Pipettes
• Urine collection cups
• Calibrators and controls specific to the drug classes being tested
• Quality Control (QC) materials (Positive and Negative)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
2. Receiving and Preparation:
◦ Verify sample identification against the requisition form.
◦ Ensure the sample has been properly handled and stored.
◦ Bring the sample to room temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly without introducing
bubbles.
3. Preparing Controls and Calibrations:
◦ Prepare all calibration standards and QC materials as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure QC materials and calibrators are brought to room
temperature prior to use.
◦ Perform calibration procedures as required by the analyzer
at the start of each analytical batch.
4. Testing Procedure:
◦ Use a pipette to fill the test cartridge with the urine sample.
◦ Place the test cartridge in the immunoassay analyzer
following the device-specific instructions.
◦ Initiate the test cycle. Ensure the analyzer is running the
correct assay program for the drugs to be tested.
5. Result Interpretation:
◦ The analyzer will provide a digital readout indicating whether
each targeted drug class is positive or negative.
◦ Validate the results against internal QC checks. Positive
controls must produce positive results, and negative
controls must produce negative results.
◦ Repeat the test if QC results fall outside acceptable ranges.
6. Troubleshooting:
◦ If the analyte result falls outside expected QC ranges,
recalibrate the analyzer and rerun the QC samples.
◦ For repeated errors, consult the supervisor and implement
corrective actions as required, according to established
procedures.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a technologist to ensure
consistency.
• Report results according to laboratory policy, ensuring patient
confidentiality is preserved.
• Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
including any deviations, corrections, or repeats required.
• Add commentary if necessary, such as 'interference suspected –
confirmatory test recommended.’
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine QC checks at the beginning of each day, with
each new batch of reagents, and whenever results are in doubt.
• Use both positive and negative controls to confirm assay
performance.
• Record and evaluate control results in the QC log.
• Investigate and rectify any QC failures immediately.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES
• Instrument Maintenance: Perform regular maintenance as
required by the analyzer manufacturer.
• Deviations: In case of deviations, troubleshoot according to the
device manual and notify the supervisor.
• Documentation: Record any irregularities, steps taken to resolve
issues, and final outcomes in the maintenance log.
