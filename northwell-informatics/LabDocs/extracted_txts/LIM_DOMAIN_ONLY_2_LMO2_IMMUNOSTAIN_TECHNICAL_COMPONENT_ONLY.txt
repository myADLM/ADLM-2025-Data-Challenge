Standard Operating Procedure for LIM Domain Only 2 (LMO2)
Immunostain: Technical Component
1. PURPOSE To describe the procedure for the immunostaining of
LIM Domain Only 2 (LMO2) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue sections to ensure consistent and
reliable results for diagnostic use.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the staining and documenting all
results following this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any irregularities and bring them to the attention of a
supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN FFPE tissue sections on glass slides.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• LMO2 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB (Diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Mounting medium
• Positive control slides
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Staining rack
• Incubator or oven
• Light microscope
• Humidified chamber
• Cover slipping station
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation of FFPE Sections
2. Section the FFPE tissue blocks at 4 micrometers using a
microtome.
3. Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and pick up onto
glass slides.
4. Dry sections at 60°C for 1 hour in an incubator or oven.
B. Deparaffinization & Rehydration
1. Immerse slides in 3 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides in decreasing alcohol series:
◦ 2 changes of 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate method (heat-
induced or enzymatic) specific for the LMO2 antibody. Follow
the manufacturer's recommendations for the antigen retrieval
solution and method.
D. Immunostaining
1. Wash sections in PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating in 3%
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 10 minutes.
3. Wash in PBS for 5 minutes.
4. Apply blocking solution (e.g., 5% BSA in PBS) for 20 minutes to
reduce non-specific binding.
5. Incubate sections with LMO2 primary antibody diluted in
antibody diluent (as recommended by the manufacturer)
overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.
6. Wash sections in PBS for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
7. Incubate with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30
minutes at room temperature.
8. Wash sections in PBS for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
9. Apply DAB substrate to sections and incubate until desired
staining is achieved (usually 2-10 minutes).
10. Rinse sections in distilled water for 2 minutes.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in distilled water.
3. Perform a rinse in 95% ethanol for differentiation if required.
4. Dehydrate through graded ethanols (95% and 100%) for 2
minutes each.
5. Clear sections in xylene for 3 changes of 2 minutes each.
6. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
F. Quality Control
1. Include positive control slides with tissues known to express
LMO2 along with each staining run.
2. Ensure negative control (absence of primary antibody) is
included to check for non-specific binding.
3. Review control slides to ensure appropriate staining before
interpreting patient samples.
4. REPORTING RESULTS Document the presence and
localization of LMO2 staining within tissue sections. Staining
intensity and pattern should be assessed and recorded by a
qualified pathologist.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak or absent staining: Verify the antibody and reagent storage
conditions; check for appropriate antigen retrieval method.
• Non-specific staining: Optimize blocking steps; use a higher
dilution of the primary antibody.
• Excessive background: Increase washing steps; ensure all
reagents are properly rinsed off; verify the specificity of the
secondary antibody.

the LMO2 antibody and secondary reagents for detailed
information on antibody dilution, incubation times, and antigen
retrieval methods.
2. REVISION AND DOCUMENT CONTROL This SOP is subject
to revision as needed to improve the staining quality or due to
changes in protocols. All changes will be documented and
reviewed by senior laboratory personnel.
Note: This SOP is intended for use within a clinical laboratory
environment for diagnostic purposes. Laboratory personnel must
ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and guidelines.
