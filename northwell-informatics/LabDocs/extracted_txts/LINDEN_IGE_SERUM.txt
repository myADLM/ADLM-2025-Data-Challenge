STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR LINDEN, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing
serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels using the LINDEN method. This
will ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the generation of
IgE results from serum specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff (qualified medical laboratory scientists)
are responsible for conducting the analysis and ensuring adherence
to this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for oversight
and addressing any issues that arise during the procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
LINDEN Method: A specific analytical method for the quantification
of serum IgE levels. IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated
with allergic responses and certain infections.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Serum separator tube (SST) or plain red top
tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Transport and Storage: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory at 4°C (refrigerated). Serum should be separated from
cells within 2 hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days if not immediately analyzed. For long-term storage, freeze
the serum at -20°C or lower.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C and
up to 6 months at -20°C or lower.
Reagents and Equipment:
• LINDEN IgE assay kit
• Calibrators and controls (provided with the kit)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Distilled water
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., graduated cylinders, beakers)
Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare reagents as per the instructions
provided with the LINDEN IgE assay kit. Ensure all reagents
are at room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Calibrator Preparation: Reconstitute calibrators and controls
as directed. Prepare appropriate dilutions if necessary.
Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Setup: 1.1. Label the microplate according to the layout
specified in the assay protocol. 1.2. Add 100 µL of calibrators,
controls, and patient serum samples to the designated wells.
2. Incubation: 2.1. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified
time (typically 1 hour) as mentioned in the assay protocol.
3. Washing: 3.1. Wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer to
remove unbound materials.
4. Detection: 4.1. Add the detection antibody or enzyme-
substrate mixture as specified. 4.2. Incubate the plate again for
the specified time at 37°C.
5. Signal Development: 5.1. After the incubation period, add the
stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
6. Reading the Plate: 6.1. Measure the absorbance of each well
using a microplate reader at the specified wavelength (typically
450 nm).
7. Calculation of Results: 7.1. Generate a standard curve using
the absorbance values of the calibrators. 7.2. Determine the
IgE concentration of patient serum samples by comparing their
absorbance values with the standard curve.
Quality Control:
• Run quality controls with each assay batch to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of results.
• Results for controls must fall within the expected ranges provided
by the manufacturer.
• If controls fall outside the expected ranges, do not proceed with
result reporting. Investigate the cause and re-run the assay if
necessary.
Reporting Results:
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Report results as IU/mL (International Units per Millilitre).
Reference Intervals:
• Normal reference interval for serum IgE: ≤100 IU/mL
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the LINDEN IgE assay kit insert for individual reagent
limitations and specific interferences that may affect assay
performance.

Notes:
• Ensure proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
during the procedure.
• Follow all safety guidelines for handling biological specimens and
hazardous materials.
