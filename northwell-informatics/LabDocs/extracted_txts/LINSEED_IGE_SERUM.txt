Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for LINSEED, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for analyzing
LINSEED, IGE (Immunoglobulin E), in serum samples within the
laboratory to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures detailed in this SOP for the analysis of LINSEED and IGE
in serum samples, ensuring the quality and accuracy of test results
comply with pertinent standards.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
a. Specimen Type: - Serum - Collect blood in a serum separator
tube (SST). - Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature before centrifugation. - Centrifuge the tube at 1500g for
10 minutes to separate the serum. - Ensure no hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus which can interfere with test results.
b. Specimen Stability: - Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis
will be performed within 72 hours. - For longer storage, freeze
samples at -20°C or colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment: - Centrifuge - Calibrated pipettes - LINSEED and IGE
assay instrumentation (e.g., ELISA reader) - Computer system with
LIS (Laboratory Information System) compatibility
b. Reagents and Supplies: - Commercial LINSEED and IGE assay
kits (e.g., ELISA kits) - Quality control materials (Negative and
Positive controls) - Calibration standards - Microplates - Disposable
pipette tips
5. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation: - Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room
temperature (20-25°C) before beginning the assay procedure. -
Ensure all instrumentation is calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
b. Assay Procedure: 1. Sample Preparation: - Pipette the required
volume (typically 100 µL) of serum sample, control, and calibrator
into the corresponding wells of the microplate.
2. **Addition of Reagents:**
- Add the appropriate conjugate reagent to each well (volume as specified by the kit manufacturer).
- Incubate the microplate for the required time at room temperature or specific temperature as detailed in the reagent kit instructions.
3. **Washing:**
- Wash the wells according to the reagent kit instructions to remove any unbound substances.
4. **Substrate Addition:**
- Add the substrate solution to each well.
- Incubate the microplate as per the reagent kit instructions (generally at room temperature, away from direct sunlight).
5. **Stopping Reaction:**
- Add the stop solution to each well after the defined incubation period.
6. **Reading Results:**
- Measure the absorbance of each well using an ELISA reader at the specified wavelength.
7. **Calculation and Reporting:**
- Calculate the concentrations of LINSEED and IGE using the calibration curve generated from the calibrator values.
- Record all results, including controls, on the LIS.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Internal Quality Control: - Run negative and positive controls
with each batch of samples. - Verify that control results fall within the
predetermined acceptable range. If controls are outside the
acceptable range, investigate and resolve before reporting patient
results.
b. External Quality Control: - Participate in external quality
assurance programs to ensure ongoing accuracy of test results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Data Review: - All results must be reviewed and verified by a
certified technologist before being reported. - Cross-check patient
demographics and ensure the accuracy of identification numbers
prior to reporting.
b. Reporting Format: - Results should be reported in the LIS with
appropriate reference ranges. - Critical values should be flagged and
communicated immediately to the clinician.
