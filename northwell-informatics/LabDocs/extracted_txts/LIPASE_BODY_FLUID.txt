Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lipase, Body Fluid
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the steps and procedures for analyzing lipase in
body fluids, generating accurate and reliable results, and ensuring all
corrective actions are taken when necessary. This SOP will provide
guidelines on the handling, preparation, and analysis of the body fluid
samples for lipase measurement.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of body fluids for the determination of lipase activity
using designated analytical instruments. This procedure ensures
quality and consistency in the analytical phase of lipase testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing results,
maintaining equipment, and ensuring the adherence to this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instrument: Automated chemistry analyzer capable of
measuring lipase
• Reagents: Lipase reagent kits compatible with the chemistry
analyzer
• Controls and calibrators supplied by the reagent kit manufacturer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, eye
protection
• Standard laboratory glassware and pipettes
• Incubator (if required by procedure)
5. SPECIMEN COLLECTION, HANDLING, AND STORAGE
• Body fluid samples including ascitic fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial
fluid, etc.
• Specimen tube: Sterile container devoid of any preservatives
anticoagulants that could interfere with the analysis
• Specimen volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL
• Storage: If not analyzed immediately, store body fluid samples at
2-8°C and analyze within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze
samples at -20°C. Ensure samples are completely thawed and
mixed well before analysis if applicable.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Calibration of Instrument
• Perform the calibration of the analyzer following the
manufacturer's instructions using the provided calibrators.
• Document calibration data in the calibration log.
6.2. Quality Control
• Include quality control samples (low, normal, high) with each
batch of test samples.
• Run QC samples before testing patient samples.
• Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding. Take corrective action if QC results are out of range
(recalibrate, troubleshoot, replace reagents, etc.).
6.3. Sample Preparation and Analysis
• Ensure samples are at room temperature before testing.
• Mix samples thoroughly but gently to avoid foaming.
• Load samples onto the chemistry analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Enter patient identifiers and other relevant information into the
system.
• Select the appropriate lipase assay method to initiate testing.
6.4. Instrument Operation
• The analyzer will automatically perform the lipase assay based on
the loaded reagents and programmed method.
• Monitor the analyzer during the run to ensure proper functioning.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results for accuracy and consistency.
• Verify that all QC results are within acceptable ranges.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring patient confidentiality is maintained.
• Report critical values immediately to the appropriate clinical
personnel as per laboratory policy.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the lipase result falls outside the reference range or if there are
inconsistencies, repeat the assay. If discrepancies persist,
investigate possible sources of error (e.g., instrument malfunction,
expired reagents, specimen integrity).
• Document all troubleshooting actions and outcomes.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC results, sample analyses,
and corrective actions.
• Ensure that all documentation is clear, accurate, and complete.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the analytical instrument and
reagent kits.
• Laboratory's Quality Control and Assurance Manual.
11. REVISION AND REVIEW
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as needed to
remain compliant with the latest standards and procedures.
