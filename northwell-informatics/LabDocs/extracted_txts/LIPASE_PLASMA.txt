Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
LIPASE Analysis in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of lipase levels in plasma samples in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This ensures consistent and accurate results, maintaining
the highest quality standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing lipase
analysis using the designated analytical equipment and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the duty of all laboratory personnel to understand and follow this
SOP. The responsibility includes handling patient specimens, running
the assay, performing necessary quality control, and properly
handling any issues that arise during the analytical process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma collected in lithium heparin tubes.
• Alternatively: Plasma collected in EDTA or sodium heparin tubes.
Stability:
• Plasma specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is
performed within 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze plasma samples at -20°C or lower,
avoiding repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Analytical Equipment:
◦ Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Siemens Dimension)
2. Reagents:
◦ Lipase reagent kit specific for the analyzer used.
◦ Calibration standards provided by the reagent manufacturer.
◦ Quality control materials (high, medium, and low levels
where applicable).
3. Supplies:
◦ Sample cups or sample tubes compatible with the analyzer.
◦ Disposable pipette tips.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform daily quality control before beginning the analysis of
patient samples.
2. Run three levels of control materials (high, mid, and low) at the
start of each day and after every major maintenance or reagent
change.
3. Document and review QC results. Ensure they fall within the
acceptable range specified by the manufacturer. If QC fails,
troubleshoot the cause before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
Calibration:
1. Calibrate the analyzer per the manufacturer's recommendation
using the provided calibration standards.
2. Document the calibration process and results.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature and mix
gently by inversion.
2. Centrifuge plasma samples if there are any visible particulates
or to clarify the specimen (3000 RPM for 10 minutes).
Analytical Method:
1. Load the prepared plasma samples, calibrators, and QC
materials onto the analyzer.
2. Select the lipase assay program on the analyzer.
3. Ensure all sample identifiers are correctly entered in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) or directly on the analyzer
before starting the run.
4. Initiate the analysis according to the analyzer’s operation
manual.
Post-Analysis:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer for any flags or
errors.
2. Verify the results against the calibrators and quality control.
3. Address flagged results by repeating the analysis on a fresh
aliquot or using a backup analyzer if available.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verified results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
2. Review and validate patient results in the LIS before releasing
them to the electronic medical record (EMR).
3. For critical results that fall outside the reference range, follow
the lab's protocol for notifying the healthcare provider
immediately.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Refer to the manufacturer's reagent insert for specific limitations
and interferences.
2. Hemolysis, high bilirubin levels, or lipemia may interfere with
the assay results.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
1. Maintain all records of calibration, quality controls, patient
results, and any troubleshooting performed in the appropriate
logs.
2. Retain records as per regulatory requirements and lab policy.
