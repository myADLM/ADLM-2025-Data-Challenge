Protocol for Analytical Phase: Generating Results for LIPASE in
Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analysis of lipase in
random urine samples to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for the analysis of lipase in
random urine samples and must ensure that all steps are performed
according to this standard operating procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type:
• Random urine sample.
Collection and Transportation:
• Collect a random urine sample in a sterile, leak-proof container.
• Ensure the container is properly labeled with the patient’s
information and the date and time of collection.
• Transport the sample to the laboratory as soon as possible,
preferably within 1 hour of collection.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, store the sample at 2-8°C
and analyze within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine samples that are improperly labeled.
• Urine samples that have been stored for more than 24 hours if not
refrigerated.
• Urine samples that are visibly contaminated or have significant
particulate matter.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Clinical chemistry analyzer capable of lipase analysis.
• Centrifuge.
• Standard laboratory glassware and plasticware (pipettes, tubes,
etc.).
Reagents:
• Lipase assay kit approved for use with urine samples.
• Calibrators and controls recommended by the assay kit
manufacturer.
• Quality control materials for lipase.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, calibrators, and control materials to room
temperature before use.
2. Ensure the clinical chemistry analyzer is calibrated and
performing within acceptable limits according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube, avoiding any
sediment.
C. Analysis:
1. Load the lipase assay reagents, calibrators, controls, and urine
sample into the clinical chemistry analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Program the analyzer for urine lipase analysis, ensuring correct
input of sample type and method parameters.
3. Run the urine samples alongside quality control and calibrator
materials.
D. Quality Control:
1. Include internal quality control samples with each batch of tests.
2. Verify that control results are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
3. If control results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
the issue, repeat controls, and do not release any patient
results until controls are within range.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the results generated by the clinical chemistry analyzer
for any flags or errors.
2. Validate results by comparing them with the quality control and
calibrator outcomes.
3. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Report results according to the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for urine lipase should be specified based
on the assay kit manufacturer’s guidelines or validated using in-
house data.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the lipase assay kit insert for specific method limitations and
potential interferences.
8. DOCUMENTATION
1. Document all steps performed during the analysis, including
any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions taken.
2. Maintain records of quality control results, calibration curves,
and patient results.

• Manufacturer’s User Manual for the Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.
10. REVIEW PROCEDURES
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in the method or reagents used.
By following this protocol, laboratory technologists can ensure the
accurate and efficient analysis of lipase in random urine samples,
maintaining adherence to quality standards and providing reliable
results for patient care.
