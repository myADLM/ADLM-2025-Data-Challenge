Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Lipase, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the enzymatic
determination of lipase activity in serum samples, ensuring accuracy
and consistency of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in
analyzing serum lipase levels.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the test
according to this procedure and for verifying the accuracy and validity
of the results. It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to
identify and report any issues affecting the integrity of the test.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Appropriate serum separation tube (e.g., SST,
Clot Activator)
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
• Handling:
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
before centrifugation.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 RCF for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
• Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 7 days if the analysis
will be delayed.
◦ For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Beckman Coulter)
• Lipase reagent kit (validated for use on the analyzer)
• Calibrators and Quality Control materials
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample cups/analytical vessels
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
6. PROCEDURE
Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiry date and properly
stored.
Calibration:
• Perform calibration using provided calibrators before running
patient samples.
• Follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions for calibration.
• Validate the calibration curve by running quality control materials
at low, medium, and high concentrations.
Quality Control:
• Run two levels of control materials (normal and pathological) with
each batch of patient samples.
• Document QC results in the Quality Control Log.
• Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples. Investigate any QC failures
following the laboratory’s QC failure protocol.
Sample Analysis:
• Load the patient serum samples into the analyzer sample rack.
• Input the test parameters into the analyzer.
• Follow the specific steps required by the analyzer to ensure
proper processing:
◦ Verify patient identification and test request
◦ Ensure sample integrity (no hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus that
could affect the results)
• Start the analysis sequence as defined by the specific analyzer's
operational manual.
Interpretation of Results:
• Ensure that the analyzer completes the run without errors.
• Review and validate the generated data.
• Re-run any samples that yield an error code or exhibit flagged
results for confirmation.
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring all data entries are accurate.
Reporting Results:
• Report patient results within the expected reporting timeframe.
• Reference Interval: Typically 13-60 U/L (this may vary by method
and instrument used).
• Ensure that results are reviewed and validated by the technologist
before being released.
7. REPORTING CRITICAL RESULTS
• Critical values: Lipase results above 3 times the upper limit of the
reference interval should be considered critical.
• Immediate notification must be provided to the patient’s
healthcare provider following the laboratory’s critical results
reporting policy.
• Document the notification details (name of provider, time of
notification, personnel notifying) in the LIS.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the assay,
leading to falsely elevated or suppressed results. Consider
sample integrity and verify where necessary.
• Refer to the specific lipase reagent kit insert/IFU (Instructions for
Use) for detailed limitations and anticipated interferences.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Lipase reagent kit.
• Analyzer operation manual (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter).
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards and guidelines (e.g., CLSI
guidelines).
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all actions are properly documented in the appropriate
logbooks or electronically as per laboratory protocols.
• Track reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
• Maintain calibration and quality control logs for compliance
reviews and audits.
This SOP ensures a consistent and standardized approach for the
accurate measurement of serum lipase levels, contributing to patient
care quality and diagnostics accuracy. This protocol should be
revised periodically according to updates in guidelines and
technological advancements.
