Standard Operating Procedure: Lipid Analysis in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analysis of lipid levels in body fluids at the laboratory, to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing lipid
analysis according to the procedures outlined in this document. All
staff must ensure adherence to these guidelines to maintain the
integrity and accuracy of test results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated lipid analyzer or manual lipid testing kits
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Test tubes
• Glove, lab coat, and other PPE required
• Body fluid samples (CSF, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, etc.)
• Quality Control materials (Commercial lipid QC solutions)
• Reagent kits specific to lipid analysis
• Calibrated thermometers for temperature monitoring
• Liquid waste disposal containers
• Data recording sheets or LIS system access
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• Specimens collected in appropriate sterile tubes without additives
or in tubes containing specific additives as per the lipid analysis
guidelines.
• Specimens must be processed and transported to the laboratory
immediately for analysis.
• Specimens must be kept at 2-8°C if there is a delay in processing.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 2 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
• Specimens that have been contaminated with external
substances.
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or other physical integrity
issues that could interfere with lipid analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Upon receipt of the body fluid specimen, verify that it is properly
labeled with patient identification and collection time.
2. Inspect the specimen for integrity (free from hemolysis,
contamination, lipemia).
3. Record the specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
B) Processing
1. If required, centrifuge the specimen at 1000-1500 rpm for 10
minutes to obtain clear supernatant.
2. Pipette the supernatant carefully without disturbing any
sediment.
3. Prepare aliquots of the specimen for analysis based on the
testing kit or automated analyzer requirements.
C) Lipid Analysis
1. Follow manufacturer-specific instructions detailed in the reagent
kit or analyzer manual.
For Automated Lipid Analyzer: i. Load reagent cartridges and
specimens into the analyzer. ii. Start the analysis cycle as per
the machine instructions. iii. Record all parameters, including
temperature, reagent volume, and identification codes.
For Manual Lipid Testing Kits: i. Mix specified volume of
reagent with specimen according to the kit guidelines. ii.
Incubate samples for the time specified in the kit instructions. iii.
Measure absorbance or concentration levels using
spectrophotometric readings. iv. Record the results carefully.
2. Analyze quality control materials alongside patient specimens
to ensure accuracy.
3. Document the results from the analysis in LIS and preliminary
findings.
4. Perform troubleshooting steps if any results fall outside of
acceptable ranges.
D) Quality Control
1. Include commercial lipid QC solutions in every batch of tests to
validate precision and accuracy.
2. QC results should fall within the specified acceptable ranges;
otherwise, investigate the cause and repeat the test.
3. Log all QC results, including detailed corrective steps taken for
any deviations.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review and verify all test results according to laboratory
standards and protocols.
6. Enter finalized data into the LIS system.
7. Print reports if necessary and ensure proper documentation.
8. For critical results, follow lab policies in notifying the appropriate
healthcare personnel immediately.
9. Use specific mnemonic entries to detail any issues observed
during analysis.
10. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
11. Verify sample integrity before reporting: i. Assess hemolysis
levels using centrifugation if needed. ii. Document any factors
that may affect the results. iii. Provide comments or notes
regarding sample conditions and potential interferences.
12. CRITICAL RESULTS
13. Report critical lipid values directly to the responsible healthcare
provider following laboratory reporting protocols.
14. Any critical value documentation should be clear and include
date, time, and staff initials.
15. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer-specific reagent kit or analyzer manual for
limitations specific to their procedures. Ensure results comply with
test limitations and consider these before final reporting.

1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This protocol is subject to periodic review and updates to maintain
compliance with the latest clinical standards and technological
advancements. All staff must be trained on updates to ensure
effective implementation.
