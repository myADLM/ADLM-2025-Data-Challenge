Lipid Panel Testing Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
lipid panel tests to ensure accurate and timely results for the
assessment and management of lipid metabolism and associated
disorders.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting lipid panel tests following this SOP to ensure consistency,
accuracy, and reliability. All laboratory staff must recognize and report
any anomalies affecting test results to supervisors immediately.
1. DEFINITION
The lipid panel tests include measurements of Total Cholesterol,
High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-Density
Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C), and Triglycerides.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Preferred Specimen:
• Fasting serum or plasma sample collected in a red-top tube for
serum or a green-top tube (lithium heparin) for plasma.
• Fasting is recommended for at least 9-12 hours before sample
collection.
3.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Non-fasting samples.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Samples stored beyond stability times without proper
preservation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas® 6000 or
equivalent).
• Total Cholesterol Reagent.
• HDL-C Reagent.
• LDL-C Reagent.
• Triglycerides Reagent.
• Calibrators and controls specific to lipid testing.
• Deionized water.
• Quality control material.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is functioning correctly and reagents are
within expiration dates.
• Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform daily maintenance and calibration as outlined in the
instrument-specific SOP.
5.2 Assay Protocol:
1. Centrifuge the fasting blood sample at 1500-2000 g for 10
minutes to separate serum/plasma.
2. Label and aliquot the serum/plasma for analysis.
3. Load the serum/plasma samples, reagents, calibrators, and
controls onto the analyzer.
4. Select the lipid panel profile on the analyzer software.
5. Initiate the run according to the instrument's operating
procedures.
5.3 Analyte Measurement Ranges and Calculations:
• Total Cholesterol: Measured enzymatically.
• HDL-C: Direct measure via homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric
method.
• LDL-C: Calculated using the Friedewald formula unless direct
measurement is indicated: LDL-C = Total Cholesterol - HDL-C -
(Triglycerides/5).
• Triglycerides: Measured enzymatically.
5.4 Troubleshooting:
• If results fall outside quality control limits or if discrepancies occur,
repeat the test with fresh reagents and controls.
• Refer to instrument troubleshooting guides for specific error codes
or technical issues.
• Notify the supervisor immediately if issues cannot be resolved.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Run two levels of commercially available controls (low and high)
every 8 hours of testing.
• Ensure QC results fall within the predetermined acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Document all QC results, and take corrective actions for QC
failures before analyzing patient samples.
6.2 External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs and record results as
required.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results.
• Report lipid panel results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) following laboratory protocols.
• Provide critical values to the ordering physician immediately, and
document the communication according to critical result policies.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Total Cholesterol: <200 mg/dL (Desirable)
• HDL-C: ≥ 60 mg/dL (Optimal)
• LDL-C: <100 mg/dL (Optimal)
• Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL (Normal)
(Reference values may vary depending on the specific population
and clinical guidelines.)
1. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
Maintain logs for instrument maintenance, calibrations, QC data, and
testing records for a minimum period as mandated by regulatory
authorities.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the instrument and reagent package inserts for specific
procedures and limitations. Guideline references from CLIA, CAP,
and other accrediting agencies. Clinical recommendations and
updates from reputable organizations including the American Heart
Association (AHA) and National Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP).
This ensures that all steps are followed correctly, that quality control
procedures are adhered to, and that results are accurate and reliable.
