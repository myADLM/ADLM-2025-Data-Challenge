STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE LIPID PANEL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to accurately and
efficiently measure and report the concentration of lipid
components (Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL
Cholesterol, and Triglycerides) in serum samples using an
automatic microplate reader.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel working in the
clinical laboratory responsible for conducting serum lipid panel
tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the technologist
performing the test to ensure proper handling and analysis of
serum samples, as well as accurate documentation and
reporting of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS A. Preferred: • Serum collected
in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST) • Properly
labeled with patient identification and date/time of collection B.
Unacceptable: • Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples •
Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes • Samples that have
been frozen and thawed more than once
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES A. Reagents: • Enzymatic reagent
kits for Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Cholesterol,
and Triglycerides • Manufacturer quality control material B.
Supplies: • Calibrators and controls specific to lipid testing •
Automatic microplate reader • Microplates and pipettes • Timer
6. EQUIPMENT • Automatic microplate reader • Centrifuge •
Pipettes • Refrigerator at 2-8°C for reagent storage
7. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
8. Centrifuge collected blood samples to separate serum.
9. Ensure serum is clear and free from particulates.
10. Aliquot the required amount of serum for testing.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration using provided calibrators as per
manufacturer instructions.
2. Run quality control material at low, medium, and high
concentrations before patient samples.
3. Record and evaluate QC results. If controls are out of range,
troubleshoot before proceeding.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Follow manufacturer instructions for reagent preparation and
assay procedure.
2. Load the required volume of reagents and prepared serum into
respective wells in the microplate.
3. Incubate plates as per manufacturer instructions, ensuring
precise timing.
4. Measure absorbance using the automatic microplate reader.
5. Calculate concentrations of lipid components using the reader's
software.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS A. Expected Reference
Intervals: • Total Cholesterol: < 200 mg/dL • HDL Cholesterol: >
40 mg/dL • LDL Cholesterol: < 100 mg/dL • Triglycerides: < 150
mg/dL B. Interpretation: • Compare patient results to reference
intervals and flag abnormal results. • Document any critical or
abnormal values and follow appropriate procedures for
reporting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING A. Quality
control materials should be run for each batch of samples
processed. B. If QC results do not meet acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot as necessary: • Recheck calibrations, reagent
integrity, and equipment functionality. C. Document all
troubleshooting steps and corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS A. Review and verify results in the
laboratory information system (LIS). B. Ensure critical values
are communicated to the appropriate healthcare providers as
per laboratory policy. C. Record final verified results in the
patient’s record.
9. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION A. Perform routine
maintenance on the automatic microplate reader as
recommended by the manufacturer. B. Follow the calibration
schedule and calibrate the equipment as required. C.
Document all maintenance and calibration activities.
10. LIMITATIONS A. Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere
with assay results. B. Ensure samples have not been subjected
to multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
11. REFERENCES A. Manufacturer's reagent kit inserts and
instructions. B. Laboratory policy and procedure manuals.
12. SIGNATURE AND APPROVALS This SOP has been reviewed
and approved by the laboratory director or authorized
personnel.
