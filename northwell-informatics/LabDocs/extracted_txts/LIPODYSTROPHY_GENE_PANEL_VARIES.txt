1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analysis
and interpretation of specimens for the Lipodystrophy Gene Panel
using next-generation sequencing (NGS). This protocol aims to
ensure accurate, high-throughput genetic analysis for diagnosing
lipodystrophy and to outline steps to ensure quality control, data
validation, and result reporting.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all specimens received in the laboratory
that have been collected, received, and accessioned for
Lipodystrophy Gene Panel testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the steps in this procedure accurately. Supervisors must ensure that
staff follow this procedure and perform regular quality checks.
Personnel must also handle the experimental data with strict
confidentiality and according to HIPAA guidelines.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Next-Generation Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, Thermo Fisher
Ion Torrent)
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• Lipodystrophy Gene Panel reagents (e.g., custom-designed gene
panel kits)
• Quantification and quality assessment devices (e.g., Qubit
Fluorometer, TapeStation)
• PCR and Library Preparation Kits (e.g., KAPA Library Preparation
Kit)
• Thermocycler
• Bioinformatics software for NGS data analysis
• Computer and applicable software for data analysis and results
reporting
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tubes, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
• Extract genomic DNA from the received sample using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Quantify the extracted DNA using a Qubit Fluorometer and
assess the quality using TapeStation.
B) Library Preparation and Target Enrichment:
• Dilute the extracted DNA to the required concentration for library
preparation.
• Prepare the DNA libraries using the KAPA Library Preparation Kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Include DNA
fragmentation, end-repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and library
amplification steps.
• Perform target enrichment using the custom-designed
Lipodystrophy Gene Panel. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions
for hybridization-based capture of target regions.
C) Sequencing:
• Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS sequencing platform
(e.g., Illumina MiSeq) according to the instrument manufacturer’s
protocols.
• Set up the sequencing run parameters, ensuring appropriate
settings for read length and depth necessary for accurate variant
detection.
D) Data Analysis:
• After sequencing, raw data (FASTQ files) will be generated
automatically.
• Use bioinformatics software to perform alignment of the raw
sequences to the human reference genome (GRCh38).
• Detect variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/
deletions) using appropriate variant calling tools (e.g., GATK).
• Annotate detected variants with clinical significance using publicly
available databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD) and proprietary
pipelines.
• Filter variants based on quality metrics, depth of coverage, and
clinical relevance.
E) Quality Control:
• Include appropriate negative and positive controls in the
sequencing run.
• Assess the quality metrics of sequencing runs, including read
depth, coverage uniformity, and on-target rates.
• Confirm identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants with
Sanger sequencing or other orthogonal methods if needed.
F) Reporting Results:
• Compile the final report, including detailed information on
identified variants, their predicted effect, and clinical significance.
Confirmatory results (if any), quality metrics, and interpretation
notes should be included.
• Review and sign-off by the lab director or a qualified geneticist.
• Deliver the report securely to the referring clinician or ordering
entity.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control must be implemented at all stages of the procedure:
• Use validated DNA extraction and library preparation methods.
• Ensure sequencing metrics meet acceptable thresholds.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of all equipment.
• Regularly review and update bioinformatics pipelines and
databases.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpretation of the identified variants should follow the American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for
the interpretation of sequence variants.
1. REPORTING GUIDELINES
• Ensure accuracy and confidentiality of patient results.
• Results should be reported in conjunction with a licensed genetic
counselor or a qualified clinical geneticist.
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for consistency and regulatory
compliance.

• Manufacturer's Instructions for DNA extraction, library preparation
kits, and sequencing instruments.

• Relevant literature on lipodystrophy-associated genetic variants.
• Internal Quality Control SOPs and validation records.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The test may not detect variants outside the targeted regions.
• Low-quality DNA samples may affect the accuracy of sequencing
results.
• Interpretation is limited to known variant databases; novel variants
require further clinical correlation and validation.
This SOP ensures a high standard of technical performance and
reliable results for Lipodystrophy Gene Panel Testing. Adherence to
these guidelines supports clinical diagnostics and guides patient
management by healthcare professionals.
