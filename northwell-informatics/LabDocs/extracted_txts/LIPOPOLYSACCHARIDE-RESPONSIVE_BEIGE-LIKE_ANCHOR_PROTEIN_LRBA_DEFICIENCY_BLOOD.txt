STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR GENERATING
RESULTS FOR LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-RESPONSIVE BEIGE-
LIKE ANCHOR PROTEIN (LRBA) DEFICIENCY, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a detailed
protocol for the analytical phase of generating results for
Lipopolysaccharide-Responsive Beige-Like Anchor Protein (LRBA)
Deficiency in blood specimens. LRBA deficiency is a rare
immunodeficiency disorder, and accurate diagnostic testing is crucial
for its effective identification and management.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all personnel involved in the analysis of
blood samples for the detection of LRBA deficiency in the laboratory.
This includes, but is not limited to, medical laboratory scientists and
technologists who have been trained in molecular and flow cytometry
techniques.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Staff: Responsible for performing the analytical
procedures as defined in this SOP and accurately documenting
the results.
• Supervisory Staff: Responsible for verifying the accuracy of the
results, ensuring that the procedures are strictly followed, and
handling any deviations or issues that arise during the process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Fresh whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 5 mL of blood is required to
ensure adequate volume for analysis.
• Specimen Stability: Blood samples should be stored at 2-8°C
and analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Flow Cytometer
• RT-PCR Machine
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes
• LRBA Antibodies (for Flow Cytometry)
• RNA Extraction Kit
• Reverse Transcription Kit
• PCR Master Mix
• Positive and Negative Controls
6. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction
1. Label RNA extraction tubes with appropriate patient
identification details.
2. Pipet the required volume of sample into each labeled tube.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the RNA extraction kit
to isolate RNA from the blood sample.
4. Assess RNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
B. Reverse Transcription
1. Prepare the reverse transcription reaction mix using the
provided kit. Include reagents such as reverse transcriptase,
dNTPs, buffer, and RNA template.
2. Label RT tubes and aliquot the reaction mix into each tube.
3. Incubate the tubes at the recommended conditions as per the
kit’s instructions.
4. Store synthesized cDNA at -20°C if not immediately proceeding
to PCR.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix containing the PCR Master Mix,
forward and reverse primers for LRBA, cDNA template, and
nuclease-free water.
2. Label PCR tubes with appropriate patient identification.
3. Aliquot the PCR reaction mix into each tube.
4. Place tubes in the PCR machine and run the program
according to the recommended cycling conditions for LRBA
detection.
D. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare agarose gel and set up the gel electrophoresis
apparatus.
2. Load the PCR products with appropriate markers.
3. Run gel electrophoresis and visualize bands using a UV
transilluminator.
4. Document results.
E. Flow Cytometry Analysis (if applicable)
1. Label flow cytometry tubes with appropriate patient
identification.
2. Stain blood samples with LRBA antibodies and incubate as per
the antibody manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Wash and resuspend cells in flow cytometry buffer.
4. Acquire data on the flow cytometer.
5. Analyze data using flow cytometry software, and document
results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of RNA
extraction, reverse transcription, and PCR amplification.
• Ensure the flow cytometry machine is calibrated and perform daily
quality checks as per protocol.
• Document all quality control activities and maintain records.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify the accuracy of the results.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Validate and sign off reports as per standard laboratory
procedures.
• Notify the requesting clinician of any critical or unusual results
immediately.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling blood specimens.
• Utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Handle all reagents and equipment according to safe laboratory
practices and manufacturer’s instructions.
