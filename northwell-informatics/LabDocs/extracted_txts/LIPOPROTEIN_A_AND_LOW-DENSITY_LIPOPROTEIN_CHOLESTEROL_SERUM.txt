Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LIPOPROTEIN (a) AND
LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
This procedure outlines the analytical steps for the measurement of
Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol [LDL-
C] in serum samples using standardized laboratory techniques. The
objective is to provide accurate and reliable results to support clinical
diagnoses and patient management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring quality controls are within acceptable limits, and
reporting results accurately. All laboratory personnel must report any
issues encountered to a supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot completely (minimum 30 minutes) at room
temperature and then centrifuge according to laboratory
guidelines.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Grossly lipemic or icteric samples.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated chemistry analyzer.
• Commercial reagents kits for Lipoprotein (a) and Low-Density
Lipoprotein Cholesterol by manufacturer (e.g., Siemens, Roche).
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal levels).
• Calibrators as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Timer.
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the analyzer with the provided calibrators following
the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run three levels of quality control (QC) material to verify the
analyzer performance.
3. Ensure quality control results are within the acceptable range
before proceeding with patient samples.
B. Lipoprotein (a) Analysis:
1. Prepare serum samples, reagents, and quality controls
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the samples, calibrators, and QC materials onto the
analyzer.
3. Set the analyzer to the Lipoprotein (a) program/method.
4. Perform the analysis following the standard operating
procedures of the analyzer.
5. Verify the results against the QC ranges. If QC results are out
of range, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and rerun the QC and sample.
C. Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Analysis:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and quality controls have
been run and are within acceptable ranges.
2. Load the serum samples onto the analyzer.
3. Set the analyzer to the LDL-C program/method.
4. Perform the analysis per the standard operating procedures of
the analyzer.
5. Verify the results, ensuring QC results are within the acceptable
range. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines and rerun QC and sample.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
2. Flag any abnormal results according to laboratory protocols.
3. Critical results must be communicated to the relevant
healthcare provider and documented appropriately.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Lipoprotein (a):
• Normal: <30 mg/dL (may vary according to population and
method, refer to the reagent insert for specific reference intervals)
Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C):
• Desirable: <100 mg/dL
• Near optimal: 100-129 mg/dL
• Borderline high: 130-159 mg/dL
• High: 160-189 mg/dL
• Very high: ≥190 mg/dL
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Quality control materials must be run at the beginning of the shift,
after every calibration, after reagent changes, and at intervals as
defined by the laboratory's QC plan.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect test
results.
• Patient preparation and collection techniques can influence
results.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for specific limitations
related to the reagents used.
