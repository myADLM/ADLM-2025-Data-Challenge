Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Lipoprotein(a), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantitative determination of
lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels in serum samples using an automated
immunoassay system. This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results to assist in the assessment of cardiovascular
risk.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedure as outlined, ensuring the proper handling and use of
reagents and equipment, and reporting the results. Supervisors are
responsible for training personnel, overseeing the correct
implementation of the procedure, and addressing any deviations or
issues.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• Serum obtained from a blood sample collected in a plain red-top
tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Ensure blood is allowed to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes and then centrifuged to obtain serum.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately
and must be analyzed within 48 hours of collection if refrigerated.
For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens not labeled with collection date and time, or those
exceeding the stability limits.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Dimension).
• Centrifuge
• Pipette and tips
Reagents:
• Lipoprotein(a) assay reagents and calibrators.
• Quality control materials (low, normal, and high).
Supplies:
• Plain red-top tubes or serum separator tubes (SST).
• Sample cups compatible with the immunoassay analyzer.
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure specimen integrity (absence of hemolysis, lipemia,
icterus).
2. Centrifuge SST tubes for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 g to
separate serum.
3. Transfer the clear serum to secondary labeled sample cups if
necessary.
Analyzer Setup:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated correctly; perform calibration if
needed using provided calibrators.
2. Load assay reagents and quality control materials into the
analyzer.
3. Perform daily maintenance checks according to manufacturer
guidelines.
Running the Assay:
1. Load serum samples into the appropriate sample racks or
sample cups designated on the analyzer.
2. Initiate the assay run on the analyzer, adhering to the specific
instructions provided by the manufacturer.
3. Monitor the assay process and ensure there are no errors or
alerts during the run.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials (low, normal, high) alongside
patient samples to assess assay performance.
2. Accept runs only if quality control results are within acceptable
limits. Investigate and resolve any deviations before reporting
patient results.
3. Document quality control results in the appropriate log.
Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify all patient results on the analyzer.
2. Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Ensure results are accurately reported according to site-specific
guidelines.
4. Critical results must be communicated to the responsible
clinician immediately per laboratory policy.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult the reagent package insert and laboratory guidelines for the
specific reference intervals applicable to the lipoprotein(a) assay
being used.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's product insert for details on specific
method limitations, including potential interferences and critical assay
parameters.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Internal quality control materials as specified.
Procedure:
• Use quality control material according to manufacturer guidelines.
• Document QC performance, investigate failures, and take
corrective actions as specified.
