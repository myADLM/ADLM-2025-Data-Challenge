Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Lipoprotein Metabolism
Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for a Lipoprotein Metabolism Profile, Serum,
ensuring accuracy, precision, and compliance with regulatory
requirements.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel involved in performing the
Lipoprotein Metabolism Profile assay are responsible for adhering to
this SOP. It is the duty of laboratory supervisors to ensure compliance
and address any procedural discrepancies.
1. DEFINITIONS
Lipoprotein Metabolism Profile: A diagnostic test to evaluate lipid and
lipoprotein fractions in the serum, including Total Cholesterol (TC),
High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-Density
Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C), Very Low-Density Lipoprotein
Cholesterol (VLDL-C), and Triglycerides (TG).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Fasting serum
◦ Volume Required: 2-5 mL
◦ Collection Tube: Serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top
tube
◦ Stability: Specimen is stable for up to 7 days when
refrigerated (2-8°C). For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemical analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU)
• Calibrators and controls specific for lipoprotein metabolism profile
• Reagents for measuring TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, and TG
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for data entry and result
verification
1. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrations:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions
using provided calibrators.
◦ Perform calibration verification at the start of each analytical
run.
2. Quality Controls:
◦ Run at least two levels of control (normal and abnormal
range) before patient samples.
◦ Verify control results fall within the acceptable range
provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Document control results and take corrective actions if
controls are out of range.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Allow collected blood to clot at room temperature (15-30
minutes).
◦ Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a clean labeled tube and refrigerate
(2-8°C) if not analyzing immediately.
C) Analytical Process:
1. Load Samples:
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and quality controls onto
the analyzer per the instrument’s instructions.
◦ Ensure samples are appropriately identified and barcoded in
the LIS.
2. Assay Run:
◦ Select the Lipoprotein Metabolism Profile from the
analyzer’s test menu.
◦ Start the analytical run according to the instrument protocol.
3. Result Verification:
◦ Review the generated results for Total Cholesterol, HDL,
LDL, VLDL, and Triglycerides.
◦ Check for any flags or error messages and address them
accordingly.
◦ Confirm that quality control measurements within range
corroborate patient results.
D) Interpretation of Results:
1. Reference Ranges:
◦ Total Cholesterol: <200 mg/dL
◦ HDL: >40 mg/dL (Males), >50 mg/dL (Females)
◦ LDL: <100 mg/dL
◦ VLDL: 2-30 mg/dL
◦ Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL
2. Calculation:
◦ Utilize the Friedewald formula for calculating LDL-C if
triglycerides are <400 mg/dL: LDL-C = TC – HDL-C – (TG/5)
◦ For TG >400 mg/dL, use direct LDL measurement.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Entry and Verification:
◦ Input lipoprotein metabolism profile results into the LIS.
◦ Verify correctness against analyzer printout.
2. Flagging Abnormal Results:
◦ Manually flag abnormal values in the LIS.
◦ Add comments if read off limits or QC indicated interference.
3. Critical Values:
◦ Call critical results to the patient caregiver as per laboratory
policy and document the call.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Regular proficiency testing to ensure consistency and accuracy.
• Enrollment in an External Quality Assessment (EQA) program.
• Record and retain all calibration and QC data.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's user manual for automated analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on lipoprotein analysis
methodology.
