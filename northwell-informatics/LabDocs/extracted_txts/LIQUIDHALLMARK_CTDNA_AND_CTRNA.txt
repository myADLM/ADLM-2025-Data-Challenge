Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
LiquidHallmark ctDNA and ctRNA Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for generating and reporting results
for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA)
using LiquidHallmark technology. This process is essential for
ensuring accurate and reliable genomic profiling of ctDNA and ctRNA
from patient blood samples.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel
to perform the analytical procedures accurately and document all
steps rigorously. Supervisors must ensure that all staff adhere to this
SOP and identify any quality issues.
1. DEFINITIONS
• ctDNA: Circulating tumor DNA, the small fragments of DNA shed
from tumor cells into the bloodstream.
• ctRNA: Circulating tumor RNA, the RNA molecules shed from
tumor cells into the bloodstream.
• LiquidHallmark: The technology platform used for the analysis of
ctDNA and ctRNA.

1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation a. Retrieve blood samples that have been
properly collected, labeled, and accessioned. b. Perform lysis of
blood cells to release cell-free DNA/RNA using the specified
extraction kit. c. Separate plasma by centrifugation at 1600 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C. d. Transfer the supernatant to fresh tubes without
disturbing the buffy coat layer.
4.2 Nucleic Acid Extraction a. Follow extraction kit protocols for
isolating ctDNA and ctRNA from plasma samples. b. Use magnetic
bead purification for high-quality nucleic acid isolation. c. Quantify
extracted ctDNA using a fluorometric method to ensure sufficient
concentration and purity. d. Store the isolated ctDNA and ctRNA at
-80°C until further analysis.
4.3 Library Preparation and Quantification a. Use sequencing library
preparation kits that are optimized for LiquidHallmark assays. b.
Perform adapter ligation, indexing, and PCR amplification according
to the kit's protocol. c. Purify PCR products using magnetic bead
purification. d. Quantify the prepared libraries using qPCR-based
quantification methods to ensure accurate loading on the NGS
instrument.
4.4 Sequencing a. Load prepared libraries onto the LiquidHallmark
sequencing instrument following the manufacturer’s instructions. b.
Run the NGS instrument with appropriate settings for ctDNA and
ctRNA analysis. c. Monitor instrument performance and sequencing
run quality metrics.
4.5 Data Analysis a. Transfer raw sequencing data to the
bioinformatics analysis platform. b. Utilize the bioinformatics pipeline
to align reads, call variants, and annotate target genomic regions. c.
Perform quality control checks to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
4.6 Interpretation and Reporting a. Review bioinformatic analysis
results and identify clinically significant variants according to
established guidelines. b. Generate a final report that includes
detailed annotation of detected variants, with clinical significance
categorized. c. Ensure the report is reviewed and verified by a senior
molecular pathologist before releasing.
4.7 Quality Control and Documentation a. Include appropriate
positive, negative, and no-template controls with each run. b.
Document all steps in the laboratory information management system
(LIMS). c. Review quality control metrics after each run and address
any deviations from the acceptable range by retesting if necessary.
1. SAMPLE STORAGE AND RETENTION a. Store remaining
aliquots of plasma, isolated ctDNA, and ctRNA samples at
-80°C. b. Maintain records of sample storage locations,
handling, and disposal methods for long-term tracking.
