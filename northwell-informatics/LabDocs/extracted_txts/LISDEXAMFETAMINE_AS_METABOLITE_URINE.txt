Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for
LISDEXAMFETAMINE AS METABOLITE, URINE
1. PURPOSE: To ensure accurate and reliable analysis of
Lisdexamfetamine and its metabolites in urine samples in
compliance with laboratory standards.
Responsibility: Designated and trained laboratory technologists are
responsible for performing, documenting, and verifying the analysis
according to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL of freshly voided urine sent to the laboratory within 6 hours
of collection.
• Urine collection must be midstream to avoid contamination.
• If collected in a BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Tube,
specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C with an ideal
volume of 7-9 mL.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory greater than 6 hours after
collection (for non-preserved specimens).
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory without a collection date/time
label.
• Specimens with insufficient volume (< 5 mL).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Urine calibrators and controls
• Vortex mixer
• Sample preparation reagents and extraction solvents
• Centrifuge tubes
• Disposable pipettes
1. PROCEDURE: 4.1 Pre-Analytical Processing:
• Verify specimen integrity and acceptance criteria.
• Centrifuge urine specimen at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
• Transfer supernatant to a labeled clean tube.
4.2 Sample Preparation:
• Add 1 mL of the urine sample to the extraction tube.
• Add internal standard according to method validation protocols.
• Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
• Follow validated extraction procedure, such as liquid-liquid
extraction (LLE) or solid-phase extraction (SPE), including
required solvents and conditions stipulated in the method.
4.3 Analysis:
• Inject aliquot of prepared sample into the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
according to the standard instrument operation procedures.
• Ensure proper calibration and quality control measures are in
place and functioning correctly.
4.4 Instrumentation and Data Analysis:
• Utilize the appropriate ionization techniques and mass-to-charge
(m/z) transitions specific to Lisdexamfetamine and metabolites.
• Apply the validated analytical method developed and documented
for this specific assay.
• Calculate concentrations based on calibration curve and correct
for any dilution factors employed during preparation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run calibrators and quality controls with each batch of samples.
• Ensure results fall within acceptable ranges defined in the method
validation report.
• Continuously monitor instrument performance via regular
maintenance schedules and daily QC checks.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review and validate calculated results through Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are clearly documented, including any out-of-range
QC results and the corrective actions taken.
• Transmit results to patient records and notify the ordering
physician promptly of any critical values.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• The assay is specific to Lisdexamfetamine and its primary
metabolites.
• Refer to the method validation for recognized interferences and
limitations.

The above SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and compliance with
laboratory standards for the analysis of Lisdexamfetamine and its
metabolites in urine specimens.
