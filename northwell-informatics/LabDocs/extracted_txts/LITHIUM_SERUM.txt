Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Analysis of Lithium in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides a detailed procedure for the analytical phase
of generating results for lithium in serum to ensure accuracy,
precision, and consistency in laboratory testing.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of serum lithium levels in the
clinical laboratory setting. It is intended for use by qualified laboratory
personnel trained in lithium analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis following this
SOP, ensure quality control, and record and report results.
• Supervisors: Monitor compliance with the SOP, review results,
and handle any issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Collect blood in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Allow blood to clot and centrifuge within 2 hours of collection to
separate serum.
• Lithium collection needs to be on fasting blood sample, preferably
after 12-hour fasting.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in lithium heparin tubes.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzers: Lithium-specific analyzer (e.g., Cobas c501, Beckman
Coulter AU480).
• Reagents: Lithium standards and control materials.
• Calibrators: Provided by manufacturer.
• Quality control materials: Two levels of control, high and low.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Serum tubes.
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Allow the blood specimen to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm to
separate the serum.
2. Sample Aliquoting:
◦ Aliquot serum into a clean test tube if necessary.
◦ Avoid any hemolysis and ensure serum is clear.
Analyzing Procedure:
1. Equipment Calibration:
◦ Perform a calibration procedure according to the
manufacturer's instructions using provided calibrators.
◦ Verify calibration validity by running low, medium, and high
control samples before patient sample testing.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Load the aliquoted patient samples onto the analyzer.
◦ Follow analyzer instructions for proper placement and
settings.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Select the lithium assay procedure on the analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis for the loaded samples.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that quality control samples are run with patient
samples.
◦ Review control results to ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
5. Data Recording:
◦ Enter results from the analyzer into the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
◦ Validate patient results by verifying the quality control results
were within acceptable limits.
◦ Any results falling outside the acceptable range should be
reviewed by a supervisor and appropriate corrective actions
taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Review and verify results before releasing.
• Report critical values according to laboratory policy, ensuring
immediate notification to the requesting physician if the lithium
levels are outside therapeutic ranges:
◦ Critical Low: < 0.6 mmol/L
◦ Critical High: > 1.5 mmol/L
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSAY VALIDATION
• Run two levels of control (low and high) with each batch of patient
samples.
• Review control charts daily to identify trends or shifts.
• If quality control results are out of the acceptable range,
troubleshoot the analyzer, reagents, and controls. Recalibrate if
necessary and repeat QC testing.
• Validate new reagent lots or calibration changes by performing
correlation studies.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Samples with very high lipid content or extensive hemolysis may
interfere with the assay and should be processed with caution.
• Results should be interpreted considering the patient's clinical
condition and history.
