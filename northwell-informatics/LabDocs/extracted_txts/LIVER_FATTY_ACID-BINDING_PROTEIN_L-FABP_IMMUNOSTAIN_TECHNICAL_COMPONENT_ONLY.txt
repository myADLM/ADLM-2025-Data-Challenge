Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Liver Fatty Acid-Binding
Protein (L-FABP) Immunostain - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures and
guidelines for the analytic phase for generating results of Liver Fatty
Acid-Binding Protein (L-FABP) immunostain.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified technical staff to perform this
immunostain and document the results as per the protocol. All staff
should be vigilant about any procedural deviations that may affect the
quality of the assay and report them to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Liver Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (L-FABP) is an immunohistochemical
stain used to identify the presence of L-FABP in tissue samples,
which can be indicative of various liver conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sample: i. Ensure that tissue samples are
properly fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. ii. Cut tissue
sections at 3-4 microns thickness using a microtome. iii. Mount
sections on positively charged glass slides. iv. Bake slides at 60°C for
at least 30 minutes prior to staining.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration: i. Deparaffinize slides by
placing them in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes. ii. Rehydrate slides through
graded ethanol solutions: - 2 changes of 100% ethanol x 3 minutes
each - 95% ethanol x 3 minutes - 70% ethanol x 3 minutes iii. Rinse
slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval: i. Immerse slides in preheated antigen retrieval
solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer pH 8.0). ii. Heat
slides in a microwave for 20 minutes at a medium power setting. iii.
Allow slides to cool gradually for 20 minutes at room temperature. iv.
Rinse slides in distilled water, followed by PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
D) Blocking: i. Apply a protein block solution to cover the tissue
sections and incubate for 10 minutes to block non-specific binding
sites. ii. Rinse the slides in PBS for 2 minutes.
E) Primary Antibody Application: i. Dilute the primary L-FABP
antibody according to manufacturer’s instructions. ii. Apply the diluted
primary antibody to the tissue sections and incubate at room
temperature for 30-60 minutes or as specified.
F) Washing: i. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes to remove
unbound primary antibody.
G) Secondary Antibody Application: i. Apply secondary antibody (e.g.,
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) conjugated with a detection enzyme
(typically HRP) and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. ii.
Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
H) Detection: i. Apply DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate solution
and monitor the development of the stain under a microscope until
desired intensity is achieved. ii. Stop the reaction by rinsing in
distilled water.
I) Counterstaining and Mounting: i. Counterstain with hematoxylin for
2 minutes. ii. Rinse slides in tap water to remove excess hematoxylin.
iii. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions: - 70% ethanol x 3
minutes - 95% ethanol x 3 minutes - 2 changes of 100% ethanol x 3
minutes each iv. Clear slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes. v. Mount
coverslips using permanent mounting media.
J) Quality Control: i. Ensure that positive and negative control slides
are included in the batch to validate the staining procedure. ii.
Examine slides under the microscope to confirm the presence and
intensity of L-FABP staining. iii. Document any discrepancies or
deviations observed during staining.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be documented meticulously, capturing information
such as intensity and localization of staining. The technologist
responsible for staining must relay the results to the pathologist for
interpretation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
To verify the integrity of the staining process, include known positive
and negative control tissues. Ensure consistent reagent performance
and maintain a log of control results for trend analysis. Any QC
failures should be addressed immediately with appropriate corrective
measures, ensuring re-analysis if necessary.
