SOP: Liver/Kidney Microsome Type 1 Antibodies (LKM1) Testing
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for the accurate
detection and measurement of liver/kidney microsome type 1
antibodies (LKM1) in serum samples. This test aids in the diagnosis
of autoimmune hepatitis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in a red-top tube (no
additives) or serum separator tube (SST). A minimum volume of 5 mL
is required. Samples should be centrifuged within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable: Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or heparin
tubes. Hemolyzed samples or samples with significant contamination
are not acceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
• Centrifuge capable of spinning blood at 3000 rpm
• Pipettes and tips suitable for microplate dispensing
Reagents:
• LKM1 ELISA kit, including standards, controls, and substrates
Supplies:
• Micropipette tips, disposable gloves, laboratory coat, and safety
glasses
• Absorbent paper or tissue
• Deionized or distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
• Upon receiving the serum sample, verify the integrity and labeling.
• Ensure the serum is clear and free of any particulate matter.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C until ready for testing, but not longer
than 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
4.2 LKM1 ELISA Testing Procedure:
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
• Prepare the reaction wells as specified in the ELISA kit insert,
including wells for standards, controls, and samples.
4.2.1 Washing Steps:
• Wash the plate wells as per the kit instructions ensuring to avoid
cross-contamination.
• Dry the wells after the final wash step by tapping the plate onto
absorbent paper.
4.2.2 Addition Steps:
• Utilize appropriate micropipette tips to add sample and reagent
volumes as specified in the ELISA kit.
• Follow the incubation times and temperatures exactly as stated in
the kit insert.
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples into designated wells.
2. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour while gently rocking (if specified by the kit insert).
3. Wash the wells as instructed.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.
6. Wash the wells as instructed.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate for 20 minutes in the dark.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
4.3 Reading Results: - Using the microplate reader, measure the
absorbance of each well at 450 nm. - Record the optical density (OD)
values of the standards, controls, and patient samples.
4.4 Calculating Results: - Plot the concentration of the standards
against their corresponding absorbance values. - Utilize linear
regression or appropriate software to generate a standard curve. -
Calculate the concentration of LKM1 antibodies in patient samples by
comparing their OD values to the standard curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of controls (positive and negative) with
each assay run.
• Ensure that the controls fall within the acceptable range before
releasing patient results.
5.2 Calibration and Validation: - Verify the calibration and
performance of the microplate reader regularly (monthly) and
following manufacturer’s guidelines. - Validate new lots of reagents
by running parallel tests with the previous lot.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report the concentration of LKM1 antibodies in IU/mL or
appropriate units as indicated by the ELISA kit.
◦ Notify the clinician of any values outside the reference range
and document appropriately.
Reference Intervals:
◦ Negative: < 20 IU/mL
◦ Borderline: 20-35 IU/mL
◦ Positive: > 35 IU/mL
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples can affect accuracy.
◦ Specimens frozen and thawed multiple times may yield
unreliable results.
◦ Ensure samples are free from interference that might affect
absorbance readings.
