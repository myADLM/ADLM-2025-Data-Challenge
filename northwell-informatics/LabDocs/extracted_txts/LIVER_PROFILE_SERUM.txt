Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Liver Profile, Serum Results
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for the Liver Profile,
Serum panel, which includes the analysis of enzymes and
substrates indicative of liver function and integrity.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical process of the Liver Profile, Serum including the
analytes: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate
Aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Gamma-
Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin,
and Albumin.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated and trained laboratory staff
to follow this procedure accurately. Supervisors should ensure
compliance and address any deviations or issues arising during
the analytical process.
4. DEFINITION
Liver Profile, Serum includes the following tests:
◦ Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)
◦ Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
◦ Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
◦ Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)
◦ Total Bilirubin
◦ Direct Bilirubin
◦ Albumin
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Automated Chemistry Analyzer
◦ Calibrators and controls specific for liver profile analytes
◦ Reagents and consumables specific to each analyte
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Calibrated traceable thermometers
◦ Disposable gloves and other PPE
◦ Primary and secondary containers for biohazardous waste
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Considerations
◦ Ensure that all received specimens are correctly labeled and
match with the accompanying requisition.
◦ Verify that serum samples are prepared according to lab
standards (e.g., coagulated blood, spun down for serum).
◦ Record any specimen conditions that may affect results
(e.g., hemolysis, lipemia).
B. Calibrations and Quality Control
◦ Perform calibration of the analytical instrument as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines before running patient samples.
◦ Run three levels of quality control for all analytes included in
the Liver Profile.
◦ Review quality control results to ensure they are within
acceptable ranges. Document any corrective actions taken if
controls fail.
C. Sample Analysis
◦ Load patient samples on the automated chemistry analyzer.
◦ Input necessary patient information into the analyzer’s
software.
◦ Select the appropriate Liver Profile protocol on the analyzer.
◦ Review initial results for any analyzer-generated flags and
investigate accordingly.
◦ Perform repeat testing if initial results fall outside known
reference or critical ranges.
D. Result Verification
◦ Cross-check analyzer results with established reference
intervals for each analyte.
◦ Validate corrected and repeat test results where applicable.
◦ Verify results for each analyte, ensuring there are no
discrepancies or inconsistencies.
◦ Document any critical results and follow the procedure for
critical value reporting.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Transfer validated results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Generate the final report and ensure it is reviewed by a
certified Medical Technologist or Pathologist.
◦ Report critical values immediately to the requesting clinician
as per laboratory policy.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
◦ Regularly review quality control trends and perform
corrective actions if necessary.
◦ Participate in proficiency testing for all liver profile analytes.
◦ Maintain records of instrument maintenance, calibrations,
and quality control for inspection and audit purposes.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals depend on the laboratory’s established
values and may need adjustment based on the population
served. General reference intervals are as follows:
◦ ALT: 7-56 U/L
◦ AST: 10-40 U/L
◦ ALP: 40-130 U/L
◦ GGT: 5-55 U/L
◦ Total Bilirubin: 0.1-1.2 mg/dL
◦ Direct Bilirubin: 0.0-0.3 mg/dL
◦ Albumin: 3.5-5.0 g/dL
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may alter the accuracy of ALT and AST
results.
• Interferences from lipemic or icteric samples should be
documented, and alternative methods should be considered if
necessary.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow biohazard safety protocols.
• Dispose of all biological, chemical, and sharp waste in appropriate
containers.
• Handle all reagents and samples with care, using personal
protective equipment (PPE).
1. RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain records of all test runs, quality control checks,
calibrations, and maintenance logs for a minimum period as per
regulatory requirements.
This SOP is subject to annual review and update to ensure
continuous improvement and adherence to regulatory guidelines.
