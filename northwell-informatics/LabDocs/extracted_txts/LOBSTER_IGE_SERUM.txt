Protocol for Generating Results for LOBSTER, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To establish and document the methodology,
accuracy, and procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for Lobster, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), Serum. Our goal is
to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and quality of patient results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel trained in the assays and
instrumentation will perform tests, document processes, and
verify results according to this protocol.
• Supervisors will oversee the adherence to the procedures,
ensuring any issues are corrected promptly.
1. DEFINITION LOBSTER, IgE, and serum assays generally refer
to tests conducted to measure specific allergen antibodies in
the blood serum of patients thought to have allergic
sensitizations or responses. The tests involve using specific
reagents, controls, and instrumentation.
2. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) and allowed to clot.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in incorrect tubes (e.g., heparin, EDTA,
etc.)
◦ Visible hemolysis
◦ Clotted specimens not centrifuged within specific time frames.
◦ Improperly labeled tubes.
• Transport: Serum specimens should be centrifuged, separated
within 2 hours of collection, and stored at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately. Serum is stable for 7 days refrigerated and for 6
months frozen at -20°C.
Reagents, Controls, and Supplies
• Commercial assay kit for IgE determination (specific brand and
product insert).
◦ Store reagents at 2-8°C.
◦ Do not use reagents past expiration dates.
◦ Thaw frozen controls before use and allow them to come to
room temperature.
• Standard laboratory supplies including pipettes, microcentrifuge
tubes, disposable gloves, lab coats.
Instrumentation
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (specify model and
manufacturer details).
Procedure:
1. Prepare the Sample:
◦ Centrifuge blood collection tube to obtain serum.
◦ Carefully transfer serum to labeled microcentrifuge tubes
avoiding cellular remnants.
◦ Thaw if previously frozen and bring to room temperature if
required.
2. Reagent and Machine Preparation:
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions found in the assay kit
insert for reagent preparation.
◦ Calibrate the Immunoassay Analyzer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure proper instrument functionality by checking for any
required maintenance or repairs.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer as specified in the assay kit instructions.
◦ Program the analyzer according to the assay protocol
provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer for any errors or
issues during the procedure.
4. Documentation:
◦ Record the date, time, and operator initials in the run log.
◦ Document any deviations from the standard protocol,
troubleshooting steps taken, and results obtained.
◦ Log temperatures and statuses of incubators, refrigerators
as related to reagent storage.
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative quality control samples with each batch
of patient samples.
• Document control results in the quality control log.
• Acceptable limits for controls must be determined and strictly
adhered to.
◦ If controls fall outside acceptable limits, do not report patient
results until issues are corrected and acceptable controls are
obtained.
◦ Follow instruments' internal quality control protocols as
outlined by manufacturer specifications.
Reporting Results:
1. Review Results:
◦ Verify raw data from the analyzer, and run tables ensuring
proper calibration and control values.
◦ Cross-check with established reference ranges.
2. Document Results:
◦ Input verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Note any irregularities or abnormalities.
◦ Report Critical Values per lab protocol, including immediate
notification to the physician if necessary.
3. Data Integrity:
◦ Ensure all data entries are double-checked for accuracy.
◦ Resolve any discrepancies (e.g., re-run samples if
necessary).
4. Interpretation and Comments in Report:
◦ Include relevant comments regarding any potential pre-
analytical, analytical, and post-analytical variables noted
during processing.
◦ Utilize standard reporting language and smart phrases as
required.
Reference Intervals: Refer to site-specific guidelines and
manufacturer documentation for reference intervals relevant to
Lobster, IgE specific allergen panels.
Method Limitations: Refer to the assay kit insert for details on
specific limitations, including cross-reactivity, potential allergens
interference, and specific instructions for specimen handling.

• Product insert of the specific assay kit used.
• Laboratory-specific standard operating procedures.
This protocol ensures that the analytical phase of testing Lobster,
IgE, Serum assays is performed diligently, with accuracy checks and
quality control embedded at each significant step.
