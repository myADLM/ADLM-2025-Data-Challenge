Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LONG QT SYNDROME
GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) Gene Panel, which varies
based on individual patient requirements. This procedure ensures
accurate and reliable results that aid in diagnosing LQTS, a condition
that can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to follow this SOP
for the analytical phase of the LQTS Gene Panel testing. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring compliance with this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Acceptable Specimens: - Peripheral blood collected in EDTA
tubes. - Saliva collected using an approved saliva collection kit. -
Buccal swabs collected using an approved buccal swab kit.
B. Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens not labeled appropriately
(lack of patient name, date of birth, collection date). - Specimens
showing signs of contamination or hemolysis. - Specimens collected
in unapproved containers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - PCR machine (Thermal Cycler) - DNA Sequencer
(Next-Generation Sequencing, NGS) - Centrifuge - Vortex Mixer -
Microplate Reader
Reagents: - DNA extraction kits - PCR reagents including primers
specific to LQTS genes. - Sequencing reagents including library
preparation kits.
Supplies: - Microcentrifuge tubes - Pipette tips (filtered and non-
filtered) - Plate seals - Ethanol (70% and 100%) - Gloves - Lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction: 1. Follow manufacturer’s protocol for DNA
extraction from blood, saliva, or buccal swabs. 2. Quantify the
extracted DNA using a Nanodrop or Qubit fluorometer. 3. Store the
extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for use.
B. PCR Amplification: 1. Design primers specific to the genes
associated with Long QT Syndrome. 2. Prepare PCR mix according
to reagent specifications. 3. Amplify the target regions using the
Thermal Cycler. 4. Verify amplification success using gel
electrophoresis.
C. Library Preparation: 1. Perform fragmentation and end-repair of
PCR products. 2. Ligate adapters as per the library preparation kit’s
instructions. 3. Purify the final library using magnetic beads. 4.
Quantify the library concentration using the Qubit fluorometer.
D. Sequencing: 1. Load the prepared library on the NGS platform. 2.
Follow the sequencing protocol provided by the manufacturer. 3.
Monitor the sequencing run for any issues or errors.
E. Data Analysis: 1. Use bioinformatics tools to align sequenced
reads to the reference genome. 2. Identify variants within the genes
associated with Long QT Syndrome. 3. Annotate variants using
clinical databases and determine potential pathogenicity.
F. Result Verification: 1. Review sequencing data and variant
analysis. 2. If necessary, perform Sanger sequencing to validate the
variants detected by NGS. 3. Confirm the accuracy and
completeness of the results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Prepare a detailed report including the identified variants, their
potential effects, and clinical significance. B. Review and verify the
report with a senior technologist or geneticist. C. Send the report to
the ordering clinician through the LIS.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Perform regular maintenance of PCR machines and sequencers
according to manufacturer’s instructions. B. Use positive and
negative controls in each PCR batch to ensure the reliability of the
results. C. Participate in external quality assessment schemes for
genetic testing periodically.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer instructions and the specific LQTS gene panel
insert for any limitations in the amplification and sequencing process.
Ensure to validate and provide accurate results by following stringent
quality control protocols.
