Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lorazepam (Ativan), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the accurate and precise analysis
of Lorazepam (Ativan) in serum, ensuring quality results for patient
diagnosis and management.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP exactly as written. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
technologists are competent and that this SOP is followed
accordingly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Instructions:
• Collect blood in a plain red-top tube or an SST (serum separator
tube).
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge and separate serum as soon as possible.
• If using an SST, ensure the gel barrier does not come into contact
with the analyte.
Transport Conditions:
• Maintain specimen at 2-8 °C during transport.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8 °C.
• For long-term storage, serum can be frozen at -20 °C for up to 1
month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate or
EDTA tubes.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours post-collection, if not
frozen.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detection.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Analytical balance.
• Refrigerator (2-8 °C).
• Freezer (-20 °C).
Reagents and Supplies:
• HPLC grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile).
• Deionized water.
• Lorazepam standard solution.
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high).
• Mobile phase (e.g., mixture of acetonitrile and water with 0.1%
formic acid).
• Calibration curve standards.
• Sample vials and caps.
• Syringes and filters for sample preparation.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration Curve:
• Prepare a series of calibration standards of known Lorazepam
concentration using serum matrix.
• At least five points ranging from 10 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL are
recommended.
• Analyze standards using the HPLC system and plot the
calibration curve.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations with each batch of patient samples.
• Acceptable limits for QC samples should be within ±2 standard
deviations of the known concentration.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples if frozen and bring them to room
temperature.
2. Vortex the serum sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 200 μL of serum into a labeled sample vial.
4. Add 800 μL of acetonitrile (for protein precipitation) to the vial.
5. Vortex the vial for 30 seconds to mix thoroughly.
6. Centrifuge the vial at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial.
8. Filter the supernatant through a 0.2 μm syringe filter into an
HPLC vial.
9. Cap the vials tightly.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Ensure the column is equilibrated with the mobile phase.
3. Inject 20 μL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system.
4. Begin the chromatographic run following established HPLC
parameters (e.g., flow rate, gradient elution program).
5. Monitor the retention time for Lorazepam; it should match that
of the standard.
Data Analysis:
1. Identify the Lorazepam peak based on retention time.
2. Quantitate the Lorazepam concentration in patient sera by
comparing the peak area to the calibration curve.
3. Review QC results to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the Lorazepam concentration into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify all results before releasing.
• Report critical values following the laboratory's critical value
reporting protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Lipemic, hemolyzed, or icteric samples may affect assay
performance.
• Cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines should be
considered.
• Ensure proper maintenance of HPLC equipment for accurate
results.
