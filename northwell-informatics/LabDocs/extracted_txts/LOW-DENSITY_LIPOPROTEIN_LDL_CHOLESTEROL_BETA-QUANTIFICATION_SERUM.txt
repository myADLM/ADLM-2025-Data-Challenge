Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LDL Cholesterol, Beta-
Quantification, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, beta-
quantification, in serum. Accurate and reliable results are essential
for the appropriate clinical management of patients with lipid
disorders and cardiovascular risk assessments.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel performing the
LDL cholesterol, beta-quantification test on serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of each designated technologist to perform the
LDL cholesterol, beta-quantification test according to this procedure
and to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube.
• Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum specimens should be separated from cells within
2 hours of collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
• Avoid hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus which can interfere with the
test.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• LDL Cholesterol, Beta-Quantification reagent kit
• Calibrators and quality control materials specific to the reagent kit
• Automated or semi-automated chemistry analyzer capable of
performing the test
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, and safety
glasses
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) at least daily, or as specified by the
reagent manufacturer.
• Two levels of control (low and high) must be run before patient
samples.
• QC results must be within the established range before reporting
patient results. Troubleshoot any QC failures and do not proceed
until QC is acceptable.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood specimen at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum from cells.
2. Transfer the serum to a labeled, clean container, avoiding
hemolysis and cell contamination.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
C) Instrument Setup:
1. Turn on the chemistry analyzer and perform any daily
maintenance or calibration procedures required by the
manufacturer.
2. Load reagents, calibrators, and QC materials into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
D) Sample Analysis:
1. Load patient serum samples into the analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer with the patient sample identifiers.
3. Initiate the test run according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Monitor the analysis to ensure proper functioning and no errors
occur.
E) Result Generation and Verification:
1. The analyzer will automatically calculate and display the LDL
cholesterol concentrations.
2. Review each result for any flags or error messages generated
during the analysis.
3. Verify and ensure all control results are within specified ranges
before validating patient results.
4. Document any corrective actions taken if QC results fall outside
acceptable limits.
5. RESULT REPORTING:
• Enter the LDL cholesterol results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Compare the results with established reference ranges:
◦ Optimal: <100 mg/dL
◦ Near optimal/above optimal: 100-129 mg/dL
◦ Borderline high: 130-159 mg/dL
◦ High: 160-189 mg/dL
◦ Very high: ≥190 mg/dL
• Report any critical values according to the laboratory's critical
value policy.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If the analyzer fails to produce valid results, refer to the
instrument's troubleshooting guide.
• Review and re-run controls to ensure the reagent and instrument
performance.
• If problems persist, contact the technical support for the analyzer
or reagent manufacturer.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Certain conditions such as high triglycerides, hemolysis, and
improper sample handling can interfere with the accuracy of the
test.
• Ensure that samples are properly processed and stored to
maintain their integrity.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the LDL cholesterol, beta-
quantification reagent kit.
• Instrument manual for the chemistry analyzer.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for lipid
testing.
1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• The SOP will be reviewed annually, or as needed, by the
laboratory manager or appointed personnel.
• All modifications and updates will be documented and
communicated to the laboratory staff.
