SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for LOW-
GRADE FIBROMYXOID SARCOMA (LGFMS), 16P11.2
(FUS OR TLS) REARRANGEMENT, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of tissue
specimens by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for the
detection of 16p11.2 (FUS or TLS) rearrangement associated with
Low-Grade Fibromyxoid Sarcoma (LGFMS).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
FISH analysis on tissue specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to ensure the
accurate preparation and analysis of specimens according to the
following procedures.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block or
properly prepared slides.
Acceptable Tissue Types:
• Tissue acquired from biopsy or surgical resection suspected of
LGFMS.
Storage and Stability:
• Store FFPE blocks at room temperature until ready for use.
Prepared slides must be stored at room temperature in a dry
place and are stable for up to one year.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microscope with fluorescence capabilities
• Hybridization oven
• Water bath
• Microtome
• Thermocycler
Reagents:
• Fluorescence-labeled DNA probes specific to FUS or TLS
rearrangement at 16p11.2
• Hybridization buffer
• Denaturation solution
• Post-hybridization washing solutions
• Counterstain (e.g., DAPI)
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Pipettes and tips
• Absorbent paper
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Slides:
1. Cut 4 µm sections from the FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
2. Place sections on positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides overnight at 56°C to ensure tissue adhesion.
Deparaffinization and Pretreatment:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by incubating in three changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol
solutions (100%, 95%, 70%, and distilled water) for 2 minutes
each.
3. Incubate slides in pre-warmed Pretreatment Solution at
95°C-98°C for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water and follow with 2X SSC for 5
minutes.
Proteolytic Digestion:
1. Treat slides with appropriate protease solution at 37°C for 10
minutes.
2. Rinse briefly in 2X SSC and then in distilled water.
3. Dehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol solutions
(70%, 95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each and air-dry.
Hybridization:
1. Apply 10 µL of prepared FISH probe mixture to the target area
on the slide.
2. Cover with a 22x22 mm coverslip and seal edges with rubber
cement.
3. Denature the probe and target DNA by incubating the slides at
75°C for 5 minutes.
4. Hybridize overnight in a humidified chamber at 37°C.
Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Remove coverslip and immerse slides in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40
at room temperature for 5 minutes.
2. Wash slides in 1X PBD at 75°C for 2 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in 1X PBD buffer at room temperature.
4. Air-dry in the dark.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to the target area and
coverslip.
2. Allow the slides to dry in the dark for 30 minutes before
analysis.
Microscopic Analysis:
1. Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filters.
2. Identify the regions of interest and assess the presence or
absence of 16p11.2 (FUS or TLS) rearrangements.
3. Count and record signals from at least 200 non-overlapping
interphase nuclei for each probe.
4. Interpret the results according to the supplied manufacturer's
criteria and guidelines.
Quality Control:
• Include appropriate positive and negative control slides in each
run to ensure the accuracy of the results.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
7. RESULT REPORTING
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Results indicating FUS or TLS rearrangement should be clearly
stated in the final report.
• Include an interpretation of the findings and relevant clinical
implications.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the FISH probe kit.
• Relevant literature and clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and
management of Low-Grade Fibromyxoid Sarcoma.
This procedure must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor before implementation and will be subject to regular
review and updates to ensure compliance with the latest standards
and practices.
