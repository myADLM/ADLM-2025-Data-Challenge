Standard Operating Procedure SOP 4: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Generating Results for Loxapine and 8-
Hydroxyloxapine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase to generate
accurate and reliable results for Loxapine (Loxitane) and 8-
Hydroxyloxapine from collected blood samples.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Blood samples collected in EDTA-containing
vacutainers.
• Alternative: Blood samples collected in heparin-containing
vacutainers.
Stability and Handling:
• Specimens must be kept on ice and transported to the laboratory
within 2 hours of collection.
• Upon arrival at the lab, specimens should be centrifuged
immediately at 4°C for 10 minutes at 3000 RPM.
• Plasma should be aliquoted into properly labeled containers and
stored at -20°C until analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge (refrigerated)
• Freezer (-20°C)
Reagents:
• Loxapine standards
• 8-Hydroxyloxapine standards
• Internal standards
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
Supplies:
• LC-MS/MS vials
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge tubes
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Plasma Extraction:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Pipette 500 µL of plasma into a labeled centrifuge tube.
3. Add 50 µL of internal standard solution to the plasma.
4. Add 1 mL of extraction solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) to the
mixture, vortex for 2 minutes.
5. Centrifuge at 4°C for 10 minutes at 3000 RPM.
6. Transfer supernatant to a new LC-MS/MS vial and
evaporate to dryness under nitrogen flow.
7. Reconstitute the residue in 200 µL of mobile phase (e.g.,
water:acetonitrile = 50:50).
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Instrument Setup:
1. Configure the LC-MS/MS system with appropriate LC
column, mobile phase, and flow rate.
2. Set the MS parameters for Loxapine and 8-
Hydroxyloxapine detection, including ionization mode
(positive), selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions,
and collision energy.
2. Calibration Curve:
1. Prepare calibration standards by serial dilution of stock
solutions to obtain a range of concentrations.
2. Inject calibration standards into the LC-MS/MS and
generate a calibration curve.
3. Sample Analysis:
1. Inject prepared samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Ensure the retention times, peaks, and transitions are
consistent with the standards.
3. Quantify Loxapine and 8-Hydroxyloxapine concentrations
using the calibration curve.
C. Quality Control
1. Internal Controls:
1. Include positive and negative control plasma samples with
each batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure that quality control samples fall within acceptable
limits set by the calibration curve.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for the format and validation
procedure. Ensure that all results are reviewed and verified by a
qualified technologist before reporting.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure to refer to LC-MS/MS instrument manual for any
limitations specific to the equipment.
• Ensure proper handling to minimize degradation of the analytes
during sample processing and storage.
