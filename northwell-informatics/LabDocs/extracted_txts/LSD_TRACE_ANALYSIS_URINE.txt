Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LSD Trace Analysis in
Urine
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the trace analysis of lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD) in urine samples, including the steps for specimen
preparation, testing, quality control, and reporting of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to perform LSD trace analysis in urine according to
this SOP, ensuring all steps are followed meticulously to
maintain the accuracy and reliability of results. The supervisor
is responsible for overseeing the process and addressing any
discrepancies or issues that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 10 mL freshly voided urine collected within 6
hours.
• Collected in a clean, sterile container.
• Refrigerate specimen if not analyzed immediately and bring to
room temperature prior to testing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine samples collected more than 6 hours prior to analysis
without refrigeration.
• Specimens without proper labeling (missing collection date/time,
patient identification).
• Specimen volume less than 10 mL.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with a
fluorescence detector.
• LSD reference standard.
• Mobile phase solutions (acetonitrile, water, buffer solutions).
• Sample preparation materials (centrifuge, pipettes, vials).
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Preparation: a. Mix urine sample thoroughly. b.
Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes. c. Transfer supernatant
to a clean vial. d. If necessary, dilute the sample with the mobile
phase.
3. HPLC Setup: a. Prepare the mobile phase and calibrate the
HPLC system. b. Set up the HPLC column and fluorescence
detector. c. Validate the system with the LSD reference
standard.
4. Sample Injection: a. Inject 100 µL of the prepared urine sample
into the HPLC system. b. Monitor and record the retention time
and peak area for LSD.
5. Data Analysis: a. Compare the sample peak to the reference
standard. b. Quantify LSD concentration in the urine sample
using calibration curves.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run two levels of quality control material (known LSD
concentrations) at the beginning and end of each batch analysis.
• Ensure the HPLC system is functioning correctly with acceptable
retention times and peak areas.
• Record QC results and take corrective actions as necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter quantified LSD results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Verify results according to the laboratory's reporting guidelines.
• Report critical results immediately to the requesting healthcare
provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No detectable LSD.
• Positive: Detectable LSD above the limit of quantitation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the HPLC system and
fluorescence detector manufacturer’s instructions for limitations
regarding sensitivity, specificity, and interference.

By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure reliable and
accurate measurement of LSD in urine specimens. This protocol is
essential for maintaining quality and consistency in LSD trace
analysis within the laboratory.
