Standard Operating Procedure: LUNG CANCER, ALK (2P23)
REARRANGEMENT, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to standardize the
procedure for the detection of ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement in
lung cancer tissue using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH).
This protocol outlines the steps necessary to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the processing and analysis of lung cancer tissue specimens for
ALK (2p23) rearrangement using FISH.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel performing this assay
must be adequately trained and deemed competent in FISH
techniques and the handling of lung cancer tissue specimens. It is
the responsibility of the designated supervisory staff to ensure
adherence to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung
cancer tissue
• Section Thickness: 4-5 µm
• Unacceptable Specimens: Poorly fixed, inadequately processed,
or inadequately stained tissue samples.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• FISH Probe targeting ALK (2p23) rearrangement
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets
• Hybridization buffer
• Denaturation buffer
• Wash buffer
• Mounting medium with DAPI (or other suitable counterstain)
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Thermocycler or hotplate for denaturation steps
• Humidified chamber
6. REAGENTS
• FISH probe specific for ALK (2p23) (commercially available)
• Preparation buffers (as specified by probe manufacturer)
7. PROCEDURE Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Deparaffinize FFPE tissue sections by placing slides in xylene
for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate the sections through a series of graded alcohols
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Pretreatment: 4. Digest the tissue sections with the enzyme solution
(e.g., pepsin) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5. Rinse
slides in distilled water and air dry completely.
Denaturation and Hybridization: 6. Apply 10 μl of ALK (2p23)
specific FISH probe to each tissue section. 7. Cover with a coverslip
and seal edges with rubber cement or equivalent. 8. Denature tissue
sections and probe together by placing slides on a hotplate or
thermocycler set at the temperature recommended by the probe
manufacturer (usually 72°C for 2 minutes). 9. Transfer slides to a
humidified chamber and incubate at 37°C overnight (12-16 hours) for
hybridization.
Post-Hybridization Wash: 10. Remove rubber cement and
coverslip. 11. Wash slides in the recommended wash buffer at the
temperature specified by the manufacturer. 12. Rinse slides in
distilled water.
Counterstaining: 13. Apply mounting medium with DAPI (or other
counterstain) to each slide. 14. Cover with a coverslip and allow to
dry.
8. MICROSCOPY AND ANALYSIS 15. Use a fluorescence
microscope to analyze the slides. Use appropriate filter sets for
detection of the fluorophores used in the ALK FISH probe. 16.
Evaluate at least 100 non-overlapping, intact interphase nuclei for the
presence of ALK rearrangement signals. 17. Interpretation: - Normal
(negative) result: Two orange/green fusion signals or adjacent
signals. - Abnormal (positive) result: One fusion signal and one or two
single orange or green signals (split signals indicating translocation).
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a known positive and negative control tissue with each
batch of patient specimens.
• Ensure that controls yield expected results before interpreting
patient results.
• Retain a permanent record of control results for traceability and
quality monitoring.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results electronically or manually on an appropriate
report form.
• Include the presence, absence, or percentage of cells
demonstrating ALK rearrangement.
• Review and sign off by a qualified pathologist prior to releasing
results.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for FISH Probe targeting ALK (2p23)
rearrangement.
• Laboratory Quality Control and Proficiency Testing guidelines.
12. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Proper disposal of hazardous waste according to institutional and
governmental regulations.
By adhering to these procedures, accurate detection of ALK (2p23)
gene rearrangement in lung cancer tissue can be ensured, aiding in
the diagnosis and therapeutic decisions for lung cancer patients.
