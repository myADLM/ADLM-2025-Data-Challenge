LUNG CANCER, RET (10Q11) REARRANGEMENT, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE: To identify the presence of RET (10q11)
rearrangement in tissue samples from patients with lung cancer
using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to ensure that the analysis is performed
accurately, results are generated, reviewed, and reported in a
timely manner according to the laboratory's standard operating
procedures.
3. SPECIMEN: Preferred/acceptable: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Unacceptable: Tissue
specimens not fixed in formalin or not embedded in paraffin.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES: • Fluorescence
microscope • FISH probes specific for RET (10q11)
rearrangement • Pretreatment solutions • Hybridization buffer •
DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counterstain • Coverslips •
Mounting medium
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Cut 3-4 µm thick sections from the FFPE tissue block and place
them on positively charged slides.
2. Deparaffinize the sections by incubating the slides in three
changes of xylene for 10 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate the tissue sections by sequentially immersing in
100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol for 5 minutes each.
4. Rinse the slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
B) Pretreatment:
1. Immerse the slides in a pretreatment solution and incubate at
95°C for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse the slides in distilled water to remove any residue.
3. Digest the tissue sections with a protease digestion solution for
10 minutes at 37°C.
4. Rinse the slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove
enzymatic activity.
C) Denaturation and Hybridization:
1. Apply the FISH probe mixture onto the target area of the tissue
section.
2. Cover the tissue section with a coverslip and apply
hybridization buffer around the edges to seal.
3. Denature the DNA by incubating the slides at 75°C for 10
minutes, then immediately transfer to a humidified chamber.
4. Hybridize overnight at 37°C.
D) Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Remove coverslips and wash the slides in 2X SSC (saline-
sodium citrate) at 73°C for 2 minutes.
2. Wash again in 2X SSC at room temperature for 5 minutes.
3. Rinse in PBS.
E) Counterstain and Mounting:
1. Apply DAPI counterstain to the tissue section.
2. Cover with a coverslip using an anti-fade mounting medium.
3. Allow the slides to dry in the dark.
4. ANALYSIS:
5. Observe the slides under the fluorescence microscope using
the appropriate filter sets for DAPI and the specific FISH
probes.
6. Evaluate a minimum of 100 non-overlapping tumor cell nuclei
for the presence of RET (10q11) rearrangement signals.
7. Score the presence of split red and green signals indicating a
positive RET rearrangement, or adjacent signals indicating a
negative result.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
9. Include a positive and negative control slide with each batch of
patient samples to ensure assay performance.
10. Review all control results to confirm their acceptability before
interpreting patient results.
11. Record any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure.
12. REPORTING RESULTS:
13. Document the presence or absence of RET (10q11)
rearrangement in patient samples.
14. Results will be reviewed and verified by a licensed pathologist
or designated laboratory technologist.
15. Report the results using the laboratory information system (LIS)
as per site-specific guidelines.
16. If RET rearrangement is detected, include a detailed description
of signal patterns observed.
17. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the manufacturer’s
instructions and specific probe insert for limitations related to
sensitivity, specificity, and interference.
18. REFERENCES: Manufacturer’s product insert for FISH probes
specific to RET (10q11) rearrangement.
