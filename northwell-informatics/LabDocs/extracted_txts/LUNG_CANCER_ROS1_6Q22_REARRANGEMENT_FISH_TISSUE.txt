Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for Lung
Cancer, ROS1 (6Q22) Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for detecting ROS1 (6Q22) rearrangements in
tissue specimens from potential lung cancer patients using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) methodology. Proper
specimen handling, hybridization, image capture, and result
interpretation will be detailed to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the medical
laboratory scientist to carry out this assay according to the
procedure described herein. The laboratory supervisor must
ensure that all personnel performing this procedure are properly
trained and that the equipment and reagents used are
appropriately maintained and validated.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks.
• Section Thickness: 4 μm tissue sections mounted on positively
charged slides.
• Storage: FFPE blocks and slides must be stored at room
temperature.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FISH workstation with a hybridization oven.
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters for the
fluorophores used in the FISH probe.
• ROS1 (6Q22) dual-color, break-apart FISH probe.
• Xylene, ethanol, and other routine histological mounting supplies.
• Hybridization, wash, and mounting buffers.
• DAPI counterstain.
• Coverslips and mounting medium.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinize the FFPE tissue sections by incubating in xylene
for 3 x 10 minutes.
2. Rehydrate the sections through graded ethanol solutions
(100%, 95%, and 70%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
B. Pre-treatment
1. Incubate slides in pretreatment buffer (e.g., per manufacturer's
guidelines) for 10 minutes at 98°C.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by a brief wash in 2x
SSC buffer.
C. Proteolysis
1. Incubate slides in protease solution (prepared according to
manufacturer instructions) at 37°C for 10-15 minutes.
2. Rinse in 2x SSC buffer for 5 minutes at room temperature.
D. Denaturation and Hybridization
1. Apply the ROS1 (6Q22) dual-color, break-apart FISH probe to
the target area of the tissue section.
2. Cover with a coverslip and seal edges with rubber cement.
3. Denature the tissue-probe mixture first at 75-80°C for 5 minutes
on a hotplate.
4. Hybridize the slides in a hybridization oven at 37°C for 16-24
hours.
E. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove coverslips and immerse slides in post-hybridization
wash buffer at 73°C for 2 minutes.
2. Wash slides briefly with 2x SSC buffer at room temperature.
F. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Add DAPI counterstain to each slide for nuclear staining.
2. Apply coverslip using appropriate mounting medium.
G. Imaging and Signal Detection
1. Use a fluorescence microscope equipped with the appropriate
filters to examine the slides.
2. Capture images from at least 20 non-overlapping tumor nuclei.
3. Signals:
◦ Red and green signals are evaluated. An unbroken signal
indicates a normal ROS1 gene.
◦ Split signals (red and green signals separated by at least 2
signal widths) or isolated signals without respective pairs
suggest a ROS1 rearrangement.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Interpretation Criteria:
• Normal: Majority of cells (90%) exhibit two fusion (yellow) signals.
• Positive: >15% of cells exhibit split red and green signals.
• Equivocal: 10-15% of cells with split signals; additional cells may
need evaluation or consensus review.
• Negative: <10% of cells exhibit split signals.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• A positive and negative control slide must be included in each run.
• Document each step in a laboratory log, including any deviations
or troubleshooting steps taken.
• Verify that fluorescence equipment is calibrated and maintained
per manufacturer instructions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the total number of cells analyzed, the number of normal
(fusion) and abnormal (split, isolated) signal arrangements.
• Finalize the report with the percentage of cells showing ROS1
rearrangement and the interpretation (positive, negative,
equivocal).
• Results should include any pertinent comments regarding sample
quality or deviations from SOP.
1. REFERENCES
• Include references to the manufacturer's kit instructions, relevant
peer-reviewed scientific literature, and regulatory guidelines (e.g.,
CLIA, CAP).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain complete records of calibration, maintenance, testing,
controls, and the results in accordance with laboratory protocols
and regulatory requirements.
Note: Always refer to the most updated version of kit and instrument
manufacturer instructions, ensuring compliance with the latest
regulatory standards and best practices.
