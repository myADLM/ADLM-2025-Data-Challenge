Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for LUPIN IgE Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE To ensure precise and accurate analysis of LUPIN-
specific IgE levels in serum samples using ELISA (Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or chemiluminescent
immunoassay techniques.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the LUPIN IgE serum testing in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing all steps
outlined in this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the accurate
and efficient implementation of this SOP and for troubleshooting
any deviations.
1. DEFINITION LUPIN-specific IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to
lupin allergens in the serum, indicative of an allergic response.
2. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Plate Reader or Chemiluminescent Analyzer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• ELISA or Chemiluminescent assay kit for LUPIN IgE
◦ Microtiter plates pre-coated with lupin proteins
◦ Conjugated anti-IgE detection antibody
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Calibrators/standards
• Timer
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Serum samples collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-
top tube.
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 7 days or
frozen at -20°C for long-term storage.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers or with
preservatives like EDTA, Citrate, or Heparin.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum. Ensure serum is free from particulates.
2. Aliquot the serum if necessary and store as per the stability
guidelines.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before the
assay.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided in the ELISA or
chemiluminescent assay kit for the following steps: a. Add
calibrators, controls, and serum samples to the designated
wells of the microtiter plate. b. Add the conjugated anti-IgE
detection antibody to each well. c. Incubate the plates at 37°C
for the specified time. d. Wash the wells thoroughly with wash
buffer to remove unbound materials. e. Add the substrate
solution and incubate per the kit instructions. f. Add the stop
solution (for ELISA) to halt the reaction if applicable.
3. Read the microtiter plate using the appropriate plate reader for
ELISA or chemiluminescent analyzer at the specified
wavelength or settings according to manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Record the results.
C) Result Calculation and Quality Control:
1. Generate a standard curve using the calibrators and calculate
the concentration of LUPIN-specific IgE in patient samples
using the obtained absorbance or signal values.
2. Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
assay performance.
3. Verify the quality control data. If controls are not within
predefined limits, troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record and report results in compliance with laboratory
guidelines.
• Include reference intervals in the report (typically <0.35 kUA/L for
non-allergic individuals; values may vary based on methodology
and population).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the assay
equipment to avoid erroneous results.
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens may affect the test
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens should be considered while
interpreting the results.
