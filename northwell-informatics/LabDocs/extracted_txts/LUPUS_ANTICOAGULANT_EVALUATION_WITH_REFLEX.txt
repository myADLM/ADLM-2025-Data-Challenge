Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Lupus Anticoagulant
Evaluation with Reflex Testing
1. PURPOSE To provide a clear, consistent methodology for the
analytical phase of Lupus Anticoagulant Evaluation with Reflex
Testing, ensuring accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the
analysis of Lupus Anticoagulant Evaluation within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to adhere to this SOP when performing
Lupus Anticoagulant Evaluation and any subsequent reflex
testing. Supervisors will ensure compliance and address any
deficiencies or issues that arise.
4. DEFINITION Lupus Anticoagulant (LA): An autoimmune
condition that increases the risk of blood clots. Reflex Testing:
Additional tests that are automatically triggered based on the
results of an initial test.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Requirements:
1. Preferred: Two 2.7 mL blue-top (sodium citrate) tubes.
2. Unacceptable: Clotted, hemolyzed, or sample transit time
exceeding recommended limits.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
1. Platelet-poor plasma (PPP): Centrifuge at 2500 x g for 15
minutes.
2. LA-sensitive aPTT reagent.
3. Normal pooled plasma (NPP).
4. High phospholipid reagent.
5. Calibrators and controls for LA testing.
C. Initial Lupus Anticoagulant Screening:
1. Prepare the PPP sample and reagents as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Perform the initial screening test using LA-sensitive aPTT
reagent.
3. Record time, date, and the initial of the personnel handling the
sample.
D. Interpretation of Initial Screening Results:
1. Compare patient results to NPP.
2. If the screening test is prolonged (greater than 8 seconds
beyond NPP), proceed to mixing studies.
3. If the screening test is within normal range, no reflex testing is
necessary and report “Negative for Lupus Anticoagulant.”
E. Mixing Studies:
1. Mix patient PPP with NPP in 1:1 ratio.
2. Incubate and repeat the LA-sensitive aPTT assay.
3. Interpret prolonged results per guidelines.
F. Confirmatory Testing:
1. Perform confirmatory testing with high phospholipid reagent.
2. Compare patient’s PPP response to the response of NPP.
3. If normalization occurs with high phospholipid reagent, confirm
the presence of Lupus Anticoagulant.
G. Reflex Testing:
1. Based on mixing and confirmatory results, perform additional
tests as needed including: a. Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time
(dRVVT). b. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies. c. Anti-beta2
glycoprotein I antibodies.
2. For positive confirmation, follow a second analysis after 12
weeks to reaffirm the persistence of Lupus Anticoagulant.
H. Quality Control:
1. Include controls with each batch to ensure test accuracy.
2. Review control results before releasing patient results.
3. Record control data meticulously on Quality Control Log.
I. Reporting Results:
1. Results should be reviewed by a designated technologist
before being released into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Results should include clear interpretation and diagnosis
comments based on the evaluation: "Positive for Lupus
Anticoagulant" or "Negative for Lupus Anticoagulant."
3. Document any instances of reflex testing and include
comprehensive details of tests performed and results observed.
J. Documentation:
1. Maintain complete records for each test performed including lot
numbers for all reagents used.
2. Ensure documentation for reflex testing triggers is clear and
comprehensible.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer's insert for
specific test kit limitations. Recognize biological variability and
pre-analytical conditions that might affect results.
