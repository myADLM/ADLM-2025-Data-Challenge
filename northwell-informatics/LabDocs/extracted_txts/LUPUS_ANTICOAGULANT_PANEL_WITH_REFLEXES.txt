LUPUS ANTICOAGULANT PANEL WITH REFLEXES SOP
1. PURPOSE
This protocol defines the steps and procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Lupus Anticoagulant Panel with
reflexes in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures accurate and
reliable test results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of licensed and qualified medical
laboratory scientists (MLS) to follow this standard operating
procedure (SOP). Supervisors must ensure adherence to the
protocol and handle any deviations or abnormalities.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Freshly collected citrated plasma (sodium citrate
3.2%)
• Volume: Minimum of 1.0 mL plasma
• Collection: Use a 4.5mL blue-top tube, ensuring a 9:1 blood to
anticoagulant ratio
• Stability:
◦ Unprocessed whole blood in blue-top tube: stable for up to 4
hours at room temperature
◦ Separated plasma: Freezable up to -20°C within 4 hours of
collection; stable for up to 2 weeks when stored at -70°C
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, clotted, or specimens
with an incorrect volume ratio
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents:
◦ aPTT reagent
◦ dRVVT reagent
◦ Mixing studies reagents
◦ Confirmatory reagents for lupus anticoagulant
• Supplies:
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Coagulation analyzer or appropriate manual coagulation
equipment
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Tubes and aliquot containers
1. EQUIPMENT
• Coagulation Analyzer (appropriate for performing aPTT and
dRVVT tests)
• Centrifuge (capable of attaining 1500g for plasma separation)
• Temperature-controlled water bath or heating blocks (37°C)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Pre-Analytical Steps:
• Pre-warm reagents and samples: Ensure all reagents, controls,
and plasma samples are equilibrated to room temperature
(15-25°C) before testing.
• Calibration and QC Check: Perform calibration and daily quality
control using low and high-level control materials. Accept QC
results before proceeding.
B. Initial Screening Tests:
• Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):
1. Pipette appropriate volume of plasma (per manufacturer’s
instructions).
2. Mix with aPTT reagent and incubate at 37°C for the
specified time.
3. Measure the clotting time using the coagulation analyzer.
• Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT):
1. Pipette appropriate volume of plasma.
2. Add dRVVT reagent and incubate at 37°C.
3. Measure the clotting time using a coagulation analyzer.
C. Reflex Confirmatory Testing: If screening tests indicate possible
presence of lupus anticoagulant:
• Mixing Studies:
1. Prepare 1:1 mix of patient plasma with normal pooled
plasma.
2. Perform aPTT and dRVVT using the mixed sample.
3. Interpret results to differentiate Lupus Anticoagulant from
other inhibitors (identify correction or persistence of
prolongation).
• Confirmatory Tests for Lupus Anticoagulant:
1. Repeat aPTT and dRVVT with high phospholipid reagent.
2. Perform interpretation based on correction after reagent
addition.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results Approval: Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by
an MLS.
• Documentation: Document time, date, reagent lot numbers, and
MLS performing the test.
• Result Interpretation: Compare the clot time of mixed and
confirmatory tests with the reference ranges to interpret results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Frequency: Perform quality control testing with each batch of
patient tests, at the beginning of each shift, or when changing
reagents.
• Results: Use manufacturer's acceptable ranges and plot results
in QC logs.
• Action: If QC results are out of range, investigate and resolve
issues before continuing patient testing. Document actions taken.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals provided by the reagent manufacturer or
established by the laboratory.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Lipemic, hemolyzed, or icteric samples can interfere with test
results.
• Ensure correct anticoagulant to blood ratio for accurate results.
