Standard Operating Procedure for Lupus Anticoagulant Profile
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) profile
interpretation in order to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results.
This includes testing for various components of the LA profile and
interpreting results in accordance with established guidelines.
Responsibility: Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting all steps in this procedure. It is the responsibility of
supervisors to review and validate all results.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• 3.2% sodium citrate plasma (preferably collected in light blue-top
tubes).
Specimen Collection:
• Collect at least two tubes of blood to minimize the impact of
underfilled tubes.
• Follow standard venipuncture technique and ensure tubes are
filled to the indicated level.
• Mix by gentle inversion (3-4 times) to ensure complete mixing with
anticoagulant.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500x g for 15 minutes within 30 minutes
of collection to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP).
Specimen Handling:
• After centrifugation, carefully pipette the top two-thirds of the
plasma into a clean tube within 1 hour of collection.
• Freeze the plasma aliquots at -70°C if not testing immediately.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples in tubes other than light blue
• Samples without proper labeling or not meeting collection criteria.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Reagents:
• Coagulometer or semi-automated coagulation analyzer suitable
for clotting assays.
• Commercially available lupus anticoagulant test kits (e.g., DRVVT,
APTT, dRVVT Confirm, Hexagonal Phospholipid Neutralization,
STA-Clot LA, etc.)
• Quality control materials specific to the assay.
• Calcium chloride solution.
• Platelet-poor plasma pooled normal plasma (PNP).
B. Pre-Analytical Checks:
• Ensure equipment calibration.
• Validate the expiration dates and storage conditions of reagents,
controls, and calibrators.
• Verify sample identification and integrity.
C. Analytical Steps:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and patient plasma to room temperature
before use.
2. Test Procedure: i. Screening/Test LA Profile:
◦ Perform the Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT) test
and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) with high
phospholipid concentration.
◦ Pipette reagents and patient plasma into the test wells
according to the reagent insert.
◦ Incubate and test as defined by the kit's insert, typically in
an automated or semi-automated coagulation analyzer.
ii. Confirmatory Tests:
◦ Perform confirmatory assays (e.g., dRVVT confirm or
Hexagonal Phospholipid neutralization) if the screening
assays are positive.
◦ Record clotting times, ensuring runs adhere to specified
incubation periods.
iii. Mixing Studies:
◦ In case of abnormal results, perform mixing studies using
patient plasma and PNP in 1:1 ratio to distinguish between
factor deficiency and inhibitor presence.
iv. Calculation and Interpretation:
◦ Record clotting times and calculate ratios as outlined in the
kit insert.
◦ Calculate the normalized ratio of patient plasma to PNP
controls.
3. RESULT REVIEW AND INTERPRETATION
• Compare test results with reference ranges and assay-specific
guidelines.
• Utilize the information from both screening and confirmatory tests
for diagnosis.
• Interpret results in conjunction with clinical data and patient
history. Presence of LA is indicated by prolonged clotting time that
corrects with phospholipid or confirmatory tests.
• Document and report the results according to laboratory reporting
guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure quality control material runs with each batch of tests.
• Comply with internal quality control measures including checking
control results fall within established ranges.
• Document all control runs and monitor long-term QC
performance.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Input all data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Preliminary analysis should be reviewed by technical personnel
and validated by a supervisor.
• Ensure results flagging, if any, according to critical values policy.
7. SAMPLE STORAGE AND DISPOSAL:
• Store retained samples under appropriate conditions (refer to
Specimen Handling section).
• Dispose of biohazardous material as per the laboratory's safety
guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Factor deficiencies, anticoagulant therapy, and other blood
disorders may impact LA profile tests.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's kit inserts and guidelines.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) documents.
• Peer-reviewed publications on Lupus Anticoagulant testing.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION:
• This SOP is subject to review and revision on an annual basis or
whenever a significant change in procedure is warranted.
