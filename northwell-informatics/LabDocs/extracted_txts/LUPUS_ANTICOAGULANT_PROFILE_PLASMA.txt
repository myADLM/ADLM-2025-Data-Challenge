Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Lupus Anticoagulant
Profile, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Lupus Anticoagulant Profile in plasma
samples. This includes preparation, analysis, quality control,
documentation and reporting.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this protocol and ensuring the accuracy and validity of the
results generated. It is the responsibility of all staff members to
identify any deficiencies during the testing process and bring them to
the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimens:
• Platelet-poor plasma obtained from citrated blood.
• Blood should be centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15 minutes within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens not processed within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimens exposed to extreme temperatures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge capable of achieving 1500 x g.
• Coagulation Analyzer.
• Pipettes and disposable tips.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Citrate anticoagulated plasma.
• Lupus Anticoagulant testing kit (e.g., Stago or equivalent).
• Quality Control materials specific to Lupus Anticoagulant.
• Reagent-grade water.
Storage:
• All reagents should be stored according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are at the recommended
temperature.
• Label all samples and controls clearly.
• Prepare platelet-poor plasma by centrifuging the citrated whole
blood at 1500 x g for 15 minutes. Remove plasma without
disturbing the buffy coat.
• Maintain plasma at 2-8°C until analysis, or freeze at -20°C if the
analysis will not be performed immediately.
4.2 Analysis
• Calibrate the Coagulation Analyzer according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Perform the test using the reagent kit specific for Lupus
Anticoagulant. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol closely.
• Pipette appropriate volumes of patient plasma and reagents into
the analyzer.
• Monitor the assay and record data meticulously.
4.3 Quality Control
• Run quality control samples as specified by the reagent kit. This
includes both positive and negative controls.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if QC results
fall outside acceptable ranges.
• If QC fails, repeat the assay and/or troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4.4 Documentation
• Record all patient results including any test run information (date,
time, operator initials).
• Ensure QC results are archived appropriately.
• Use laboratory information system (LIS) for results entry, review,
and verification by designated staff.
• Retain all original records as per laboratory policies.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Ensure patient sample results meet the criteria for validity as
described in the reagent kit’s package insert.
• Compare results against reference intervals provided within the
reagent kit and make documentation accordingly.
• Report results through the LIS.
• Add comments and interpretations as needed based on patient
results (e.g., presence or absence of Lupus Anticoagulant).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit’s insert for limitations pertaining to specific
test components. Possible interferences include:
• Hemolysis
• Lipemia
• Icterus
