Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Lupus Anticoagulant Profile: Technical Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the technical interpretation of the Lupus
Anticoagulant (LA) profile results, including the preparation,
processing, analysis, and validation of results in the clinical
laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedures outlined in this document.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues during the
testing and interpretation phases and report them to a supervisor.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring procedures
are performed correctly and that any corrective actions are
implemented.
1. DEFINITION
Lupus Anticoagulants are a type of antiphospholipid antibody
associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. The LA profile
typically includes screening tests such as the Activated Partial
Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time
(dRVVT), and confirmatory tests including mixing studies and
phospholipid neutralization steps.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
• Specimens must be collected in 3.2% sodium citrate tubes, mixed
by gentle inversion, and promptly sent to the laboratory.
• Plasma must be separated from cells within 4 hours of collection
by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 15 minutes after which the
plasma is aliquoted and frozen at -20°C or below if not analyzed
immediately.
B) Reagents and Supplies:
• Commercial LA Test Kits (e.g., Diagnostica Stago STA®-Staclot®
dRVV Screen and Confirm)
• Control samples (Positive and Negative)
• Calibrator plasmas
• Phospholipid-Responsive Interference Test (dRVVT confirmatory
reagents)
• Standard laboratory equipment including pipettes, centrifuge, and
analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CS-2500)
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Thaw plasma samples at 37°C in a water bath for 10 minutes
and mix gently by inversion.
2. Perform the aPTT, dRVVT screen, and confirmatory tests
according to the manufacturers' instructions included with the
respective kits.
a. aPTT:
• Pipette plasma and reagent into the cuvette and mix.
• Load cuvette into analyzer and record clotting time.
b. dRVVT and Confirmation:
• Pipette plasma into cuvette with dRVVT screen reagent, mix, and
incubate.
• Load cuvette into analyzer and record clotting time.
• Repeat using the dRVVT confirm reagent (phospholipid-rich).
1. Perform mixing studies if the initial aPTT or dRVVT is prolonged
to differentiate between an inhibitor and a factor deficiency:
• Mix patient plasma 1:1 with normal pooled plasma.
• Reassess aPTT and/or dRVVT.
1. Calculate the normalized ratio and the Rosner index or similar
calculation to interpret the mix results.
2. Record results, noting clotting times and any calculations. Use
the provided interpretation guidelines to determine the
presence of LA.
D) Quality Control:
• Each analytical run must include appropriate positive and
negative control samples to validate test performance.
• Check all equipment calibration and maintenance logs prior to
use.
• Document all deviations and corrective actions.
E) Reporting Results:
• Record all results on the appropriate results sheet and/or
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Document any findings of LA. The results should include the
screening, confirmatory, and mixing study results, with an
interpretive comment.
• If assay results are positive, indicate the presence of lupus
anticoagulant and classify as "LA positive."
• If any of the controls fail, do not report patient results. Investigate
and resolve the issue before processing.
F) Reference Ranges:
• Reference intervals are as provided in the reagent kit inserts or
established in-house.
• Typically, the cut-offs for positivity are set according to the
laboratory’s validated thresholds.
G) Method Limitations:
• The presence of anticoagulant therapy (e.g., heparin, warfarin,
DOACs) can affect results. Document any anticoagulant therapy
listed on the patient requisition and interpret results accordingly.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
results and should be avoided.
H) References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for use for Stago STA®-Staclot®
dRVV Screen and Confirm Kit.
• CLSI Guidelines for Lupus Anticoagulant Testing, H60-P.
• Internal validation and standard operating procedures specific to
the laboratory.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for the lupus anticoagulant profile,
contributing to the proper diagnosis and management of patients with
suspected antiphospholipid syndrome.
I) Troubleshooting:
• If unexpected results are obtained, re-run the assay with new
aliquots of the patient sample.
• Review calibrator and control results to ensure system
performance.
• Verify the integrity of reagents and instruments (e.g., perform
maintenance checks, recalibrate instruments).
J) Monitoring and Maintenance:
• Periodically review the performance of the assay, including inter-
assay and intra-assay precision, to ensure ongoing compliance
with established quality standards.
• Maintain a log of all quality control, calibration, and maintenance
activities for review and compliance purposes.
All staff performing this procedure should be adequately trained and
proficient in handling and interpreting lupus anticoagulant assays.
Regular competency assessments and continuous education are
recommended to maintain a high standard of diagnostic accuracy.
