1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for the immunostaining of
Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Beta using immunohistochemical
techniques, ensuring precise and reliable technical results for
subsequent diagnostic interpretation.
2. SPECIMEN: Acceptable specimen types include formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, or pre-mounted sections on
glass slides. All specimens should be well-preserved and void
of significant artifacts.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Drying oven
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer)
• Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution
• Blocking serum
• Primary antibody: Anti-LH Beta antibody
• Secondary antibody: Biotinylated anti-rabbit/mouse IgG
• ABC (Avidin-Biotin Complex) reagent
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Appropriate positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE: A. Preparation:
• Cut 4-5 µm thickness sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks using a microtome.
• Float sections on a water bath and pick them up on glass slides.
• Place slides in a drying oven at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper
adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in xylene 3 times for 5
minutes each.
• Rehydrate the slides by sequential immersion in 100% ethanol,
95% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and finally distilled water
for 5 minutes each.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in an appropriate
retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer) and heating in a microwave
or water bath for 10-20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes and rinse
with distilled water.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by treating slides with
hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3. Block non-specific binding by incubating slides in blocking
serum for 20 minutes.
4. Apply the primary antibody (Anti-LH Beta) and incubate in a
humidified chamber at room temperature for 1 hour.
5. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
6. Apply the secondary antibody (Biotinylated anti-rabbit/mouse
IgG) and incubate for 30 minutes.
7. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
8. Incubate slides with ABC reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for 30 minutes.
9. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
10. Develop color by immersing slides in DAB substrate solution
until a brown color develops (1-5 minutes).
11. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides in hematoxylin for appropriate differentiation
(approximately 1-2 minutes).
2. Wash in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate slides by immersing them sequentially in 70%
ethanol, 80% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 100% ethanol for 5
minutes each.
4. Clear slides in xylene 3 times for 5 minutes each.
5. Mount with coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Positive and negative control slides should be run with each batch
of staining to ensure the procedure's accuracy.
• Ensure that control slides display expected staining patterns
before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document any deviation from the standard staining pattern and
investigate potential technical issues.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• The stained slides will subsequently be reviewed by a qualified
pathologist for diagnostic interpretation.
• Any discrepancies or issues in the staining process must be
documented and reported to the laboratory supervisor for follow-
up.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions and guidelines provided with
antibodies and reagents used in the procedure.
• Relevant histopathology and immunohistochemistry textbooks
and peer-reviewed journal articles.
The procedure outlined ensures the technical aspect of LH Beta
Immunostain is reliably performed, providing quality results for
diagnostic purposes.
