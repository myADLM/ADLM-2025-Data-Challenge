Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH),
PEDIATRICS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE This SOP describes the procedure for the
quantitative determination of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) in
pediatric serum samples using the designated immunoassay
analyzer. This procedure includes preparation, analysis, quality
control, and reporting results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to be
familiar with and adhere to this SOP for generating accurate and
reliable LH results. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring all staff
are properly trained and compliant with this procedure.
1. DEFINITION Luteinizing Hormone (LH) is a hormone produced
by the anterior pituitary gland which plays key roles in
regulating the reproductive system.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type: Pediatric serum Preferred Collection: Blood collected in
an SST (Serum Separator Tube ) Volume: Minimum 1 mL of
serum Storage: Unprocessed or processed specimens should
be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or at -20°C for prolonged
storage. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis
• Specimens with severe lipemia
• Specimens arriving without proper identification or labeling
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer compatible for LH testing (e.g. Roche
Cobas e411)
• LH reagent kit
• Control materials (low, medium, and high)
• Calibrators
• SST tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators and freezers
• Traceable thermometer
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE Preparation:
2. Check specimen integrity. Reject any specimen which does not
meet the acceptable criteria.
3. Process the blood specimen by centrifuging the SST at 3000
RPM for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer serum to a labeled secondary tube if necessary.
Calibration:
1. Perform calibration as per manufacturer's instructions using a
fresh set of calibrators for each run.
Analysis:
1. Load the serum specimens on the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer for LH testing as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within
expiration dates and prepared correctly.
4. Run the specimens following the standard operating
parameters set by the analyzer.
Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality controls (low, medium, and high) at the
beginning of each batch, after each calibration, and at least
once per shift.
2. Acceptable ranges should align with the manufacturer's
specifications.
3. Document all QC results in the QC log.
4. If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
according to manufacturer’s guidelines and repeat QC testing
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
Reporting Results:
1. Results will automatically be transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) from the analyzer.
2. Review and verify results for each sample.
3. Flag any critical values that require immediate reporting to the
clinician as per laboratory policy.
4. Document any pertinent comments regarding specimen
handling, analysis, or quality control.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS Pediatric reference intervals will be
verified according to previous internal studies or reputable
external sources. Always refer to specific age-appropriate and
gender-specific reference values.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s product
insert for potential interferents and assay limitations.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING Refer to the Analyzer Operator’s Manual
for specific troubleshooting steps. Consult with the supervisor
or technical support as necessary.
8. SAFETY AND TRAINING Ensure compliance with all laboratory
safety protocols while handling specimens and reagents. Staff
must be trained in operation and maintenance of the specific
immunoassay analyzer used in LH testing.
