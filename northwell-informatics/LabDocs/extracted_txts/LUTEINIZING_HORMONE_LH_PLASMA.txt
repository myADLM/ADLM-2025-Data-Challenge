Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Luteinizing
Hormone (LH) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures necessary to generate accurate
and reliable results for Luteinizing Hormone (LH) levels in plasma
samples from patients. This SOP ensures consistency and
compliance with regulatory standards in the analytical phase of LH
testing.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory staff (technologists, technicians) are
responsible for performing the LH test, documenting results, and
troubleshooting any issues as per this procedure.
• The supervisor/lab manager ensures that all staff are trained and
competent in the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes
is the preferred specimen.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma samples should be tested immediately or stored at 2-8°C
and tested within 24 hours. If not tested within this time, plasma
should be frozen at -20°C or lower for longer storage, up to 3
months. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles as it may degrade the
sample.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens should be avoided.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA (except
SST when urgently required) are not acceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• LH Assay Kit (Manufacturer: [Manufacturer's Name], Catalog
Number: [Catalog Number])
• Calibrators and Controls
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader,
chemiluminescence analyzer)
• Micropipettes and tips
• LH specific reagent (if applicable)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Laboratory timer
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use both high and low-level controls (provided within the assay
kit) for each batch of samples to ensure the precision of the
assay.
• Document control results and verify they fall within the specified
acceptable range before processing patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation: a. Allow all reagents, calibrators, controls, and
patient samples to reach room temperature before beginning
the assay. b. Label all required assay tubes or wells clearly. c.
Arrange the required volume of plasma samples, calibrators,
and controls as directed by the assay kit manual.
3. Sample and Reagent Addition: a. Pipette a specific volume (as
indicated in the assay kit instructions) of calibrators, controls,
and plasma samples into designated wells of the assay plate. b.
Add LH-specific reagent (capture antibody or conjugate) to
each well as specified.
4. Incubation: a. Incubate the plate at the temperature and for the
duration specified by the assay kit. Typically this is done at
room temperature or 37°C. b. Ensure that the plate is covered
to avoid contamination and evaporation.
5. Washing: a. After incubation, wash wells thoroughly with the
provided wash buffer to remove unbound material. Follow the
number of washes recommended in the assay kit.
6. Detection: a. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate
as directed until a colorimetric change occurs. b. Add stop
solution to halt the reaction.
7. Measurement: a. Read the absorbance of each well at the
wavelength specified in the assay kit (e.g., 450 nm) using an
automated immunoassay analyzer.
8. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Create a standard curve by plotting absorbance values of
calibrators against their known concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of LH in plasma samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
• Ensure results for control samples fall within their specified
ranges before validating patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify patient results against established reference
ranges (depending on gender and phase of the menstrual cycle, if
applicable).
Reference Intervals may include:
• Adult Female:
◦ Follicular phase: 1.9-12.5 IU/L
◦ Ovulation phase: 8.7-76.3 IU/L
◦ Luteal phase: 0.5-16.9 IU/L
◦ Postmenopausal: 15.9-54.0 IU/L
• Adult Male:
◦ 1.24-8.62 IU/L
Any results falling outside of these ranges must be interpreted in the
relevant clinical context.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interfering substances such as high levels of rheumatoid factor,
heterophile antibodies, or some medications can affect the
accuracy of LH results.
• Hemolysis, icterus, or lipemic samples can cause inconclusive or
erroneous results.
• Review the manufacturer’s instructions for specific limitations
associated with the assay kit.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the assay kit manual and relevant clinical guidelines for
comprehensive details on the LH assay procedure and interpretation
of results. Further references should include:

By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure high-quality,
accurate reporting of LH levels in plasma samples, consistent with
the laboratory’s accreditation requirements and best practices.
