Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the precise steps necessary to ensure accurate,
reproducible generation of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) serum results,
using validated instrumentation and techniques according to
established laboratory standards.
1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to conduct
the LH assay, from sample preparation to result reporting. All staff
must adhere to this procedure to ensure accuracy and reliability of
test results. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the
adherence to these procedures and troubleshoot any issues that may
arise.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Serum obtained from venous blood collected
in SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-top tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum can be stored at 2-8°C up to 48 hours. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens should be avoided as they can interfere with assay
results.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• LH reagent kits (ensure they are stored according to
manufacturer’s recommendations)
• Calibrators and controls for LH
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge or standard laboratory centrifuge
• Automatic immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Advia Centaur, or equivalent)
1. Procedure
A. Preparation and Calibration of Analyzer
1. Power on and perform daily maintenance checks as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Verify calibration status of the analyzer. If calibration is due,
perform calibration using provided calibrators specific to the LH
assay.
3. Document calibration results in the instrument log.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Upon receipt, verify that samples meet the criteria mentioned in
the Specimen Requirements section.
2. Centrifuge collected blood tubes at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes to
obtain serum.
3. Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled secondary tubes if
necessary.
4. Thaw frozen samples completely and mix gently before
analysis.
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control materials at each level (low, medium, high)
before patient samples and with each new batch of reagents.
2. Compare QC results against predetermined acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results fall outside of acceptable limits, troubleshoot the
cause, take corrective action, and re-evaluate QC before
proceeding with patient samples. Document any corrective
actions taken.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Load patient samples, calibrators, and QC material into the
designated racks on the analyzer.
2. Program the assay sequence on the analyzer, inputting sample
IDs and corresponding test codes.
3. Initiate the automated analysis process as per the
manufacturer's protocol for the LH assay.
4. Confirm that the analyzer runs without error messages.
E. Result Review and Validation
1. After the assay is complete, review the results for each sample.
2. Validate the results by ensuring that QC results are within range
and all calibration standards were met.
3. Any sample results flagged by the instrument should be
reviewed manually and re-assayed if necessary.
4. Reporting Results
Transfer validated results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review or enter manually if required. Document and
sign off on printed reports if applicable.
1. Critical Results
Any critical LH results, defined according to laboratory policy, should
be flagged in the LIS and immediately communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider following established critical result
notification procedures.
