Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Lyme Antibody Modified 2-Tier with Reflex, Serum
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedures for the analytic phase of
generating results for Lyme Antibody Modified 2-Tier with
Reflex, Serum. This protocol ensures the accurate
performance, interpretation, and documentation of Lyme
serology testing.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedures accurately and documenting the results. A
laboratory supervisor ensures adherence to this protocol and
performs periodic reviews.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Lyme Antibody testing kits
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes with appropriate tips (10 µL - 1000 µL range)
• Serum separation tubes (SSTs)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Absorbent paper/towels
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in SST.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be tested within 7 days of collection if stored at
2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, specimens can be frozen at -20°C or
below for up to three months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-approved tubes (non-SST).
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation and Initial Testing:
1. Allow serum specimens and reagents to come to room
temperature before testing.
2. Use the automated immunoassay analyzer to perform the initial
Lyme IgM and IgG antibody ELISA tests according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Pipette 100 µL of patient serum into the designated wells of the
ELISA plate.
4. Add the appropriate volumes of controls and calibrators to the
designated wells.
5. Incubate the ELISA plate at 37°C for the required time (usually
30-60 minutes as specified).
6. Wash the plate as per the manufacturer's instructions (typically
3-5 times with wash buffer).
7. Add enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate for
the required time.
8. Wash the plate again and add substrate solution.
9. Allow the color to develop for the specified time, then stop the
reaction using the stop solution.
10. Read the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using the
ELISA reader.
B) Interpretation of Initial Results:
1. Calculate the ratio of the absorbance of patient samples to that
of the cut-off control.
2. Report results as either:
◦ Negative: if absorbance ratio is below the determined cut-
off.
◦ Indeterminate: if absorbance ratio is close to the cut-off and
needs further testing.
◦ Positive: if absorbance ratio is above the determined cut-off.
C) Reflex Testing (If necessary):
1. If initial ELISA results are Positive or Indeterminate for Lyme
IgM and/or IgG antibodies, proceed with confirmatory testing
using Western Blot analysis.
2. Using the Lyme Western Blot kit: a. Dilute patient serum as
indicated. b. Apply diluted serum to the Western Blot strips. c.
Incubate strips at the recommended temperature and time. d.
Wash strips and add enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody.
e. Develop the blot using the substrate solution. f. Read the blot
and compare the band pattern with the reference guide
provided by the manufacturer.
D) Quality Control and Reporting:
1. Ensure quality control tests are performed daily before patient
testing begins.
2. Document QC results in the QC log.
3. Review and validate patient results against quality control
results.
4. Report results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by a certified technologist.
E) Reference Intervals:
• Negative: No significant bands observed in the Western Blot
analysis.
• Positive: Presence of diagnostic bands as per the reference guide
(e.g., 2 out of 3 IgM bands or 5 out of 10 IgG bands required for a
positive result).
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Improper specimen handling or storage can affect test results.
• False positives may occur due to cross-reactivity with other
spirochetal diseases.
