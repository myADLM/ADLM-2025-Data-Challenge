Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase: Processing of Lyme CNS Infection IgG,
Antibody Index, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for processing
and generating results for Lyme central nervous system
infection IgG, antibody index, using spinal fluid specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY This procedure is to be performed by trained
laboratory technologists in the Serology department. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff
are appropriately trained and competent in performing this
procedure.
3. DEFINITIONS
◦ IgG: Immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody.
◦ Antibody Index: Ratio of IgG concentration in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) to that in serum, used for diagnosing CNS
infections.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
◦ Automated or manual ELISA (Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay) Reader
◦ IgG Antibody Index Kit (specific for Lyme CNS Infection)
◦ Calibrators and Controls provided with the kit
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
◦ Incubators set at 37°C
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Plate washer or manual washing materials
◦ Absorbent paper
◦ Timer
◦ Plastic tubes for serum and CSF aliquots
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Types: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum.
◦ Specimen Collection:
1. CSF: Collect in sterile containers. A minimum of 1 mL
is required.
2. Serum: Collect in serum separator tubes (SST) or red-
top tubes. A minimum of 1 mL is required.
◦ Storage and Stability:
▪ Store specimens at 2-8°C if they will be tested within 48
hours.
▪ For longer storage, aliquot and freeze specimens at
-20°C or lower.
▪ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Mix all reagents gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Prepare all necessary materials and equipment, ensuring
they are clean and in working order.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Label the microplate according to the standards, controls,
and samples to be tested.
2. Add appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and
specimens to the designated wells according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
C. Incubation and Washing:
1. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the specified time as
per kit insert (usually around 30-60 minutes).
2. Wash the plate according to the kit instructions, usually
with PBS or some other wash buffer. This may involve
multiple washing steps with a plate washer or manually.
D. Detection:
1. Add substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the
recommended time (typically 10-30 minutes).
3. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided
with the kit.
E. Reading Results:
1. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
2. Calculate the antibody index values according to the
formula provided with the kit instructions: [ Antibody Index
= \frac{\text{IgG concentration in CSF}}{\text{IgG
concentration in Serum}} ]
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
2. Ensure that control results fall within the acceptable
ranges provided with the kit manual.
3. Any deviation from expected control ranges must be
investigated, and the assay must be repeated if
necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are to be recorded and validated according to
laboratory protocols.
◦ Any positive results indicating Lyme CNS infection should
be reviewed by a laboratory supervisor and appropriately
flagged in the laboratory information system (LIS).
9. RESULT VERIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Cross-check the results with quality control data.
◦ Interpret results based on reference intervals provided by
the kit manufacturer.
◦ Report findings to the clinician as per laboratory reporting
guidelines.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Provided by the kit manufacturer and confirm with clinical
significance:
◦ Positive: IgG Antibody Index indicative of CNS infection
◦ Negative: IgG Antibody Index not indicative of CNS infection
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the kit insert for specific limitations.
• The tests are sensitive to proper handling of specimens and
reagents.
• Improper washing, incubation times, or specimen storage may
affect the results.
