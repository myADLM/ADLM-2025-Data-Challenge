Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Lyme Central Nervous System Infection IgG with Antibody Index
Reflex, Serum and Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE To establish standardized procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Lyme Central Nervous
System Infection IgG with Antibody Index Reflex in serum and
spinal fluid specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All qualified laboratory staff must adhere to
this protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor
to ensure compliance with this procedure and to address any
issues that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimens:
◦ Serum: Collect 5 mL of blood in a red-top tube, centrifuge to
separate serum, and store at 2-8°C if not immediately tested.
◦ Spinal fluid: Collect 1–2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a
sterile container and store at 2-8°C if not immediately tested.
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Specimens that are improperly labeled or without collection
date/time.
◦ Specimens that have been contaminated or are hemolyzed.
◦ Specimens that are not submitted within the required time
frame.
◦ CSF specimens that are not collected in sterile containers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits specific for
Lyme disease IgG antibodies.
• Calibrated microplate reader.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips (sterile).
• Laboratory refrigerator and freezer.
• Sterile tubes and containers for specimen handling.
• Controls (positive and negative) for quality assurance.
• Computer system for data entry and results analysis.
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
2. Ensure specimens have been properly received and
documented.
3. Allow serum and spinal fluid specimens to reach room
temperature.
4. Prepare reagents and ELISA plates according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
B. ELISA Testing
1. Add standards, positive controls, negative controls, serum, and
spinal fluid specimens into designated wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate as specified in the ELISA kit instructions.
3. Wash the plate as per the manufacturer's protocol.
4. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate.
5. Stop the reaction using the stop solution.
6. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
calibrated microplate reader.
C. Antibody Index Calculation
1. Calculate the antibody index (AI) using the formula:
AI = (CSF IgG / Serum IgG) / (CSF Total IgG / Serum Total IgG)
2. Use the provided software or manual calculation to derive the
index value.
3. Reflex testing: If the AI exceeds a certain threshold, perform
additional confirmatory tests as per laboratory policy.
D. Quality Control
1. Analyze controls with each batch of tests to ensure reliability.
2. Record control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
3. Perform corrective actions and re-test specimens if control
results are out of range.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter raw data and calculated results into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Report reflex testing outcomes if AI values are above the
diagnostic threshold.
• Communicate critical results promptly as per laboratory protocol.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for normal and elevated antibody index will be
determined based on established guidelines and manufacturer’s
recommendations.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results may be affected by hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
specimens.
• Ensure proper collection and handling of specimens to minimize
pre-analytical variability.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough records of each test, including specimens,
controls, raw data, and final results.
• Ensure documentation of corrective actions and re-testing in case
of quality control failure.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for ELISA kits
used.
• Current clinical guidelines and literature on Lyme disease testing
in the central nervous system.
Amendments
• This SOP is subject to periodic review and updates. Ensure
adherence to the most recent version.
