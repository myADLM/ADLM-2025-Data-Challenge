STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for LYME DISEASE ANTIBODY,
IMMUNOBLOT, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate
and consistently reliable identification and quantification of antibodies
against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease,
using the immunoblot method in serum specimens.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained
and authorized to perform Lyme disease antibody testing using the
immunoblot method.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to adhere to this SOP. It is also the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that staff are adequately trained and
competent to perform the test according to this procedure.
4. DEFINITION The immunoblot method involves separating proteins
by electrophoresis, transferring them to a membrane, and probing the
membrane with patient serum to detect the presence of specific
antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Specimen volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
• Specimen stability: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if
testing will be performed within 5 days. For longer storage,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Electrophoresis unit and power supply
• Nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes
• Borrelia burgdorferi antigen strips
• Blocking buffer
• Primary antibody (patient serum)
• Secondary antibody conjugated to a detectable label (e.g.,
enzyme or fluorophore)
• Substrate for enzyme or detection reagent
• Blotting system (e.g., incubator, shaker)
• Washing buffer (e.g., TBS-T)
• Positive and negative control serum
• Incubation trays
• Disposable pipette tips
• Pipettes
• Tweezers
7. PROCEDURE 7.1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment
Ensure that all reagents are brought to room temperature and
prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions. Verify the
calibration of pipettes and ensure the cleanliness of all equipment.
7.2. Gel Electrophoresis and Protein Transfer
1. Thaw the antigen strips at room temperature.
2. Block the membrane in blocking buffer for at least 1 hour at
room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
3. Assemble the electrophoresis unit, load the antigen strip, and
run the gel according to manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Transfer the proteins from the gel to the membrane using the
blotting system according to standard protocols.
7.3. Immunoblot Incubation
1. Place the membrane in a tray and incubate with the patient
serum (diluted appropriately, typically 1:100 or 1:200 in blocking
buffer) for 1-2 hours at room temperature with gentle agitation.
2. Wash the membrane 3 times for 5 minutes each with washing
buffer.
3. Incubate the membrane with the secondary antibody
conjugated to a detectable label for 1 hour at room temperature
with gentle agitation.
4. Wash the membrane 3 times for 5 minutes each with washing
buffer.
7.4. Detection and Interpretation of Results
1. Apply the substrate or detection reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Develop the blot and visualize the bands. This step might
involve exposing the membrane to a film or detecting the signal
using an imaging system.
3. Compare the patient serum bands with the positive and
negative controls. The presence of specific bands at
characteristic positions indicates the presence of antibodies
against Borrelia burgdorferi.
4. Interpret the results according to the established criteria (e.g.,
the CDC criteria for Lyme disease immunoblot).
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure assay performance.
2. Document any deviations from the expected control results and
take corrective actions.
3. If the test fails to work as expected (e.g., no bands are visible,
or non-specific binding occurs), repeat the procedure or consult
the manufacturer’s guidelines for troubleshooting.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the interpreted results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Report the results to the clinician, indicating whether the result
is positive, negative, or indeterminate, based on the band
pattern observed.

11. DOCUMENT CONTROL This SOP must be reviewed and
updated at least annually or whenever changes in methodology or
instrumentation occur.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure that the
results of Lyme disease antibody testing using the immunoblot
method are accurate, reliable, and relevant to patient diagnosis and
treatment.
