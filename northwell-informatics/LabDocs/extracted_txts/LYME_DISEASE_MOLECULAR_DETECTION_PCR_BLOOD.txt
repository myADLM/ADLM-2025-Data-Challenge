Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Lyme Disease, Molecular
Detection, PCR, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for detecting the presence of
Lyme Disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi in blood samples using
molecular detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The goal is
to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results in compliance with
current best practices.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated molecular laboratory
personnel to perform the procedure and document the results as
defined in this SOP. The laboratory supervisors should ensure that
procedures are followed, and any deviations are documented.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all blood samples submitted to the laboratory for
Lyme Disease detection through PCR analysis.
1. DEFINITIONS
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a molecular technique used to
amplify specific DNA sequences.
• Borrelia burgdorferi: The causative agent of Lyme Disease.
1. SPECIMENS
4.1 Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: 4mL blood in EDTA tube.
• Collect the blood sample aseptically to avoid contamination.
4.2 Specimen Acceptance:
• The sample must be labeled with patient identification, the date,
and the time of collection.
• Unacceptable specimens include those that are unlabeled,
improperly labeled, hemolyzed, or stored improperly before
arrival.
4.3 Specimen Storage:
• Store at 2-8°C if processing within 24 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be kept at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment:
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Centrifuge
• Biosafety Cabinet
• Micropipettes and tips
5.2 Reagents:
• Nuclease-free water
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR master mix (containing buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2, primers
specific for Borrelia burgdorferi, and Taq polymerase)
• Positive control (Borrelia burgdorferi DNA)
• Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the instructions provided in the DNA extraction kit to
isolate genomic DNA from 200µL of whole blood.
2. Elute DNA in 50µL of elution buffer.
3. Store isolated DNA at -20°C until PCR is performed.
6.2 PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the standard PCR protocol,
including specific primers for Borrelia burgdorferi.
2. In a PCR tube, add the following:
◦ 15µL of PCR master mix
◦ 5µL of extracted DNA (for each patient sample)
◦ 5µL of positive control DNA (in a separate tube)
◦ 5µL of negative control (nuclease-free water in a separate
tube)
3. Mix gently and briefly centrifuge the tubes to collect contents at
the bottom.
4. Load tubes in the PCR thermal cycler.
6.3 PCR Cycle Parameters:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes.
• 40 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes.
• Hold at 4°C.
6.4 Detection:
1. After PCR amplification, analyze the products using agarose
gel electrophoresis.
2. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide (0.5µg/mL).
3. Load 10µL of PCR product mixed with 2µL of loading dye into
the wells.
4. Run electrophoresis at 100V for approximately 45 minutes.
5. Visualize bands under UV light and document the results.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
7.1 Positive Result:
• The presence of a band at the expected molecular weight
(positive control band).
7.2 Negative Result:
• Absence of a band at the expected molecular weight (negative
control remains clear).
7.3 Invalid Result:
• Presence of band in the negative control or absence of a band in
the positive control.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
8.1 Positive and Negative Controls:
• Include a positive control (Borrelia burgdorferi DNA) and a
negative control (nuclease-free water) in each PCR run.
8.2 Reagent Storage and Handling:
• Store all reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles for reagents.
8.3 Documentation:
• Record the PCR run, controls' results, and patient results in the
laboratory log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
9.1 Review the results by a qualified technologist. 9.2 Enter the
results into the LIS, ensuring they are associated with the correct
patient. 9.3 Ensure critical or positive results are reported to the
requesting physician promptly.
