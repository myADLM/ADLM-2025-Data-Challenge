Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Protocol for Analytical Phase of LYME DISEASE Molecular
Detection via PCR
1. Purpose: To define the procedure for the analytical phase of
molecular detection of Lyme Disease using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) in the laboratory. This includes reagent
preparation, sample processing, PCR setup, reaction
conditions, result interpretation, and documentation.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing Lyme Disease
PCR testing are responsible for adhering to this SOP. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are followed and
any issues are resolved promptly.
1. Definitions: Lyme Disease: A bacterial infection caused by
Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted through tick bites. PCR:
Polymerase Chain Reaction, a molecular technique used to
amplify and detect DNA sequences.
2. Procedure:
A. Reagents and Supplies:
i) DNA Extraction Kit (as per manufacturer instructions) ii) PCR
Master Mix (as per manufacturer instructions) iii) Lyme Disease-
specific DNA primers and probes iv) Nuclease-free water v) Positive
control DNA (Borrelia burgdorferi) vi) Negative control (PCR-Grade
water or appropriate blank) vii) Thermal cycler/PCR machine viii)
Nucleic acid-free work area ix) Personal protective equipment (PPE)
B. Specimen Handling:
i) Specimen Types: Blood, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, or tissue
biopsies. ii) Specimen Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C for short-
term storage or -20°C for long-term storage. iii) Specimen
Processing: Extract DNA from specimens using the DNA extraction
kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
C. DNA Extraction:
i) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for extracting DNA from the
collected specimens. ii) Quantify and assess the purity of DNA using
a Nanodrop spectrophotometer or equivalent. iii) Aliquot and store
extracted DNA at -20°C until PCR setup.
D. PCR Setup:
i) Designate separate areas for reagent preparation, DNA extraction,
and PCR setup to prevent contamination. ii) Prepare the PCR Master
Mix as per manufacturer recommendations, including primers,
probes, and other necessary components. iii) Aliquot PCR Master
Mix into each PCR tube or well of a PCR plate. iv) Add specific
volumes of extracted DNA or controls to respective tubes or wells. v)
Ensure negative and positive controls are included in each run.
E. PCR Reaction Conditions:
i) Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions (example):
Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes Amplification (40 cycles):
Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 30
seconds ii) Ensure the thermal cycler settings match the
recommended conditions for the reagent kit used.
F. Post-PCR Analysis:
i) After the PCR run is complete, interpret the results using the
software provided with the thermal cycler. ii) Compare the
amplification curves of the samples with the positive and negative
controls. iii) Identify samples as positive or negative based on the
presence of amplification signals matching the positive control.
G. Quality Control:
i) Ensure that each PCR run includes negative and positive controls.
ii) Document and investigate any runs indicating contamination or
invalid results. iii) Routinely verify the performance of the PCR assay
using internal quality control materials.
H. Documentation:
i) Record all relevant information in the laboratory information system
(LIS), including sample identifiers, extraction details, PCR conditions,
and results. ii) Ensure that all records are reviewed and signed by a
designated supervisor. iii) Maintain a log of all reagents, lot numbers,
expiration dates, and quality control results.
I. Reporting Results:
i) Verify results in the LIS before reporting. ii) Record the presence or
absence of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in the specimen. iii) Include
appropriate result comments for any samples showing interference or
invalid results.
J. Troubleshooting:
i) If amplification is observed in the negative control, repeat the PCR
run. ii) If no amplification is observed in the positive control, verify the
reagent setup and thermal cycler settings, and repeat the assay. iii) In
case of recurrent issues, notify the supervisor and investigate
potential contamination sources or reagent failures.
