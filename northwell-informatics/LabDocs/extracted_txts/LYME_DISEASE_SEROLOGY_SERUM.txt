Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Lyme Disease Serology, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate
and efficient analysis of serum samples for Lyme disease serology
testing. This includes the preparation, testing, and quality control
necessary to produce reliable and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel conducting this test are responsible for
adhering to instructions outlined in this SOP. Supervisors ensure that
technicians are appropriately trained and that the SOP is followed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Serum.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a red or gold-top tube.
• Handling: Allow blood to clot at room temperature before
centrifugation.
• Volume: At least 1 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Serum is stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
◦ For longer storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C or colder.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Reader and
Washer.
• Micropipettors (20 µL - 1000 µL).
• Reagents and controls (as provided in the diagnostic kit).
• Microtiter plates.
• Test tubes and racks.
• Disposable gloves and lab coats.
• Absorbent paper.
• Biohazard waste containers.
• Timer.
5. REAGENTS
• Lyme Disease ELISA kit (including calibrators, controls,
conjugate, and substrate).
• Deionized water.
• ELISA wash buffer.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
• Each new kit lot must be validated by running positive and
negative controls along with patient samples.
• Include at least one positive control, one negative control, and
one blank in each run.
B. External Proficiency Testing:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs regularly.
• Verify results according to the proficiency testing provider’s
schedule.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing the Sample:
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature. Mix well before
testing.
• Ensure serum samples are free of hemolysis and lipemia as these
can interfere with test results.
B. Preparing the Reagents:
• Prepare wash buffer as per kit instructions.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the working
dilution of conjugate and substrate solutions.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Label the wells on the microtiter plate for standards, controls,
and samples.
2. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples in
duplicate to assigned wells.
3. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
4. Wash the wells 3 times with wash buffer, ensuring no liquid
remains in the wells.
5. Add 100 µL of conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
7. Repeat the wash step.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate to each well.
9. Incubate for 15 minutes in the dark.
10. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
11. Read the plate at 450 nm using the ELISA reader within 15
minutes of stopping the reaction.
D. Calculation of Results:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each duplicate.
• Construct a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Determine the concentration of antibodies in the samples by
comparing their absorbance to the standard curve.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Interpretation:
• The results are reported as positive, negative, or equivocal based
on the manufacturer's cut-off values.
• Positive and Negative controls must be included in each run and
their results must match the expected values.
B. Documentation:
• Record all test results, including controls and patient samples.
• Ensure documentation includes the test date, technician’s initials,
lot numbers of reagents used, and any deviations from the SOP.
C. Review and Verification:
• All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist or
supervisor before they are reported.
9. LIMITATIONS
• This assay is qualitative and does not measure the degree of
infection.
• Cross-reactivity with other spirochetes may yield false-positive
results.
• Negative results do not rule out Lyme disease, especially if
performed early after exposure.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s kit insert.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and laboratory best practices (e.g.,
CLSI guidelines).
• Current literature on Lyme disease serology testing.
11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all revisions with effective dates and changes made in
this section.
This SOP is effective as of [date] and will be reviewed annually or as
needed.
