Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for LYME
IgM and IgG, Whole Cell Sonicate, ELISA, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To detect Lyme disease antibodies (IgM and IgG) in human serum
utilizing the Whole Cell Sonicate ELISA method. These tests will be
performed on patient serum samples following receipt, accessioning,
and preparation for analysis.
Responsibility
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
ELISA procedure to detect Lyme disease antibodies according to this
SOP, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the test results. It is the
responsibility of all staff members to identify any deficiencies in the
testing process that may affect laboratory results and bring them to
the attention of a supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection:
• 5 mL of blood collected in a red or gold-top serum separator tube
Handling and Storage:
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
• Centrifuge the tube at 1,000–2,000 x g for 10 minutes to obtain
serum
• Transfer the serum into a clean, properly labelled plastic vial
• Store at 2–8°C if analysis is within 48 hours or freeze at -20°C if
the analysis is delayed beyond 48 hours
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with moderate to severe hemolysis
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants such as EDTA, heparin, or
citrate
• Specimens received more than 72 hours after collection without
adequate preservation
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA plate reader
• Microplate washer or manual washing equipment
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• Lyme disease IgM and IgG ELISA kit, whole cell sonicate
◦ Manufacturer: [Specify Manufacturer]
◦ Store according to the manufacturer’s specifications
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Distilled water
Supplies:
• 96-well ELISA plates
• Pipettes and tips
• Reservoirs
• Test tubes
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
2. Prepare washing buffer as specified in the ELISA kit insert.
3. Ensure the ELISA reader is calibrated and operates properly.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples, controls, and standards
to the appropriate wells. Run each sample in duplicate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Wash the wells 3-5 times with the prepared washing buffer to
remove unbound material.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
6. Wash the wells 3-5 times with washing buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate at room temperature for 20-30 minutes in the dark.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm on the ELISA plate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Result Interpretation:
• Calculate the mean optical density (OD) for the duplicates of
standards, controls, and samples.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of IgM and
IgG antibodies in the serum samples.
• Results are interpreted according to the manufacturer’s guidelines
for positive and negative thresholds.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Record QC results and verify that they fall within acceptable
ranges provided by the manufacturer.
• Note and take corrective actions if controls fall outside of
prescribed ranges.
External Controls:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs for Lyme disease
testing.
• Record results and adjust procedures based on feedback from
proficiency testing.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all results according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
• Positive results should be confirmed with supplementary testing
methods as defined by laboratory policy.
• Enter results promptly into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring the verification and review by designated
personnel.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there’s an inconsistency in the standard curve or control results,
review the assay steps, reagents, and equipment conditions.
• Consult the kit insert and manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for
specific issues related to the ELISA procedure.
• In case of persistent problems, notify the supervisor and cease
testing until resolved.
