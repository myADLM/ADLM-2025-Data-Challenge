Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LYMPH3CX ASSAY:
Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and Diffuse
Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), mRNA Gene Expression using
Nanostring, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of mRNA gene expression
for Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) using the Nanostring
LYMPH3CX Assay.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure in its entirety to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for verifying the adherence to
this protocol and addressing any deviations that occur.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Preferred Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or
unstained slides (5–10 µm thick)
B. Acceptance Criteria:
• Tissue blocks/slides must be properly labeled with patient
identifiers.
• Unstained slides: 5–10 slides (5–10 µm) placed on uncoated
slides and numbered sequentially.
• FFPE blocks should be accompanied by a pathology report.
C. Rejection Criteria:
• Incorrect or missing patient identifiers.
• Insufficient tissue quantity or quality.
• Specimens not adhering to cold chain requirements during
transport.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Nanostring Prep Station and Digital Analyzer.
◦ Nanostring LYMPH3CX Gene Expression Assay Panel.
◦ FFPE tissue extraction kits (as specified in the Nanostring
protocol).
◦ RNA extraction reagents and columns.
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Microcentrifuge.
◦ RNase-free water and tubes.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Temperature-controlled storage for reagents.
2. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction from FFPE Tissues:
• Deparaffinize tissue sections by placing slides in xylene followed
by graded ethanol solutions.
• Use an RNA extraction kit suitable for FFPE samples, following
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Quantify and assess the quality and purity of extracted RNA using
a spectrophotometer.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Prepare RNA samples at the concentration specified in the
Nanostring LYMPH3CX Assay protocol.
• Set up the hybridization reactions by combining the RNA with the
reporter and capture probes provided in the assay kit.
• Incubate the hybridization reactions at the recommended
temperature and duration.
C. Nanostring Assay Processing:
• Load the hybridized samples into the Nanostring Prep Station.
• Follow the instructions for automated processing, including
purification and immobilization on the cartridge.
• Transfer the cartridge to the Nanostring Digital Analyzer for data
collection.
D. Data Analysis:
• Collect raw data and process it using the Nanostring nCounter
Analysis software.
• Apply data normalization protocols as per the manufacturer's
recommendations.
• Generate expression levels for the target mRNA and calculate
gene expression ratios.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Routine calibration and maintenance of Nanostring
equipment should be performed and logged.
◦ Use positive and negative control samples provided in the
assay kit to validate each run.
◦ Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
◦ Validate new shipments and lot numbers of reagents before
using them for patient samples.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results should be reviewed and validated by a trained
technologist.
◦ Generate a detailed report, including the gene expression
levels and interpretative comments.
◦ Forward the report to the requesting clinician and store a
copy in the laboratory information management system
(LIMS).
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Use established reference intervals for normal and disease-
related gene expression levels provided in the Nanostring
LYMPH3CX Assay documentation.
◦ Interpret the results in the context of clinical data and other
diagnostic information.
4. LIMITATIONS
◦ RNA quality and quantity can significantly impact assay
performance.
◦ Variability in tissue handling and processing can affect
results.
◦ Referral to Nanostring LYMPH3CX Assay documentation for
known assay limitations and troubleshooting steps.
