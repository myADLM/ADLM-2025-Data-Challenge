Standard Operating Procedure Lymphocyte Proliferation to Anti-CD3/
Anti-CD28 and Anti-CD3/Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Flow Cytometry, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for processing and analyzing blood
samples for lymphocyte proliferation using flow cytometry with
specific stimulation by Anti-CD3/Anti-CD28 and Anti-CD3/
Interleukin-2 (IL-2).
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel trained in flow cytometry and
cell proliferation assays are responsible for following this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence and providing
necessary support.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Peripheral whole blood Collection Tube: Sodium
heparin (green top) tube Volume: Minimum 5 mL of whole blood
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature (18-25°C): Process within 6 hours of
collection.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Process within 24 hours if there is a delay in
processing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolysis or clotted specimens
• Specimens older than the stability period
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (with appropriate software for analysis)
• Sodium heparin blood collection tubes
• Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) without calcium and
magnesium
• Lymphocyte separation medium
• RPMI 1640 culture medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, L-glutamine, and antibiotics)
• Anti-CD3/Anti-CD28 antibodies conjugated to appropriate
fluorochromes
• Anti-CD3/IL-2 reagents
• Fluorescent antibodies against specific cell markers (e.g., CD4,
CD8)
• Flow cytometry tubes
• Centrifuge
• Incubator set to 37°C with 5% CO2
• Microplate reader or hemocytometer
• Humidified chamber for cell culture
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Label all tubes and prepare reagents.
2. Collect blood samples in sodium heparin tubes and transport to
the laboratory at room temperature or refrigerate as required.
3. Upon receipt of blood specimens, mix gently by inversion.
B) Lymphocyte Isolation:
1. Dilute whole blood with an equal volume of PBS.
2. Carefully layer blood over lymphocyte separation medium in a
conical centrifuge tube.
3. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature with
no brake applied.
4. Carefully aspirate the plasma layer and collect the mononuclear
cell layer into a new tube.
5. Wash isolated lymphocytes twice with PBS by centrifuging at
300 x g for 10 minutes and resuspend the final pellet in RPMI
1640 culture medium.
C) Cell Counting:
1. Prepare a dilution of the lymphocyte suspension and mix with
an appropriate cell viability dye.
2. Count viable cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell
counter.
3. Adjust the cell concentration to 1 x 10^6 cells/mL in RPMI 1640
culture medium.
D) Stimulation and Culture:
1. Aliquot equal volumes of the cell suspension into flow cytometry
tubes or wells of a 96-well plate. Each condition should have at
least duplicates.
2. Add the appropriate volume of Anti-CD3/Anti-CD28 antibodies
to the first set of tubes or wells and Anti-CD3/IL-2 reagents to
the second set.
3. Include control tubes with cells only and unstimulated cells to
account for baseline proliferation.
4. Incubate the tubes or plate in a humidified chamber at 37°C
with 5% CO2 for 72 hours.
E) Staining and Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. After incubation, wash the cells twice with PBS.
2. Stain cells with antibodies against specific cell markers (e.g.,
CD4, CD8) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Incubate the staining mix for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark.
4. Wash cells twice to remove unbound antibodies and resuspend
in PBS.
5. Analyze samples on the flow cytometer, ensuring to set
appropriate gating strategies to identify lymphocyte populations.
F) Data Acquisition and Analysis:
1. Acquire data using flow cytometer-specific software.
2. Analyze lymphocyte proliferation based on the percentage of
cells staining positive for specific markers.
3. Compare the proliferation rates between stimulated and
unstimulated controls.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls for each assay.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the flow cytometer and other
equipment.
• Validate new batches of reagents by performing retention studies.
• Ensure proper training and proficiency of personnel performing
the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist.
• Generate a comprehensive report including percentages of
proliferating lymphocytes and any deviations from expected
results.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
notify the requesting clinician as per site-specific protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Viability and functionality of lymphocytes can be affected by
improper handling or delayed processing of specimens.
• Ensure proper technique in sample preparation and staining to
avoid non-specific binding and background fluorescence.
