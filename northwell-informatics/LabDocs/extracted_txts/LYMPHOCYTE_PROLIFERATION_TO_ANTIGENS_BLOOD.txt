Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):
Lymphocyte Proliferation to Antigens,
Blood
1. PURPOSE
To measure the proliferative response of lymphocytes to specific
antigens and mitogens in blood samples. This protocol ensures
careful handling of specimens, precise measurement techniques, and
accurate reporting of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in cell culture, lymphocyte proliferation
assays, and flow cytometry or other proliferation measurement
methods are responsible for performing this procedure. Supervisors
ensure that all staff follow the protocol steps and every corrective
measure is taken promptly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Peripheral blood samples collected aseptically.
Collection:
• Use sterile techniques to collect venous blood into heparinized
blood collection tubes (green top).
• Minimum volume required is 10 mL.
Stability and Storage:
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours after collection.
• Store at room temperature until processing.
• Do not refrigerate or freeze whole blood samples.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or excessively delayed specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Laminar flow hood
• Centrifuge
• CO2 incubator set to 37°C, 5% CO2
• Multichannel pipettes
• Flow cytometer or other appropriate proliferation measurement
systems
• Microscope
Reagents:
• RPMI-1640 medium or other suitable lymphocyte culture media
• Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)
• Antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin)
• Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) as a positive control mitogen
• Specific antigens (e.g., Candida, Tetanus toxoid)
• Cellular proliferation markers (e.g., CFSE, [3H]-thymidine)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Trypan blue solution
Supplies:
• 96-well culture plates
• Microtubes
• Sterile pipette tips
• Parafilm
• Waste containers
5. PROCEDURE
A. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Isolation:
1. Collect the whole blood in heparinized tubes.
2. Dilute whole blood 1:1 with PBS in a 50 mL conical tube.
3. Carefully layer the diluted blood over 15 mL of Ficoll-Paque in a
50 mL tube.
4. Centrifuge at 400xg for 30 minutes at room temperature without
brake.
5. Carefully collect the PBMC layer using a pipette and transfer to
a new 50 mL conical tube.
6. Wash the PBMCs by adding PBS, centrifuging at 300xg for 10
minutes, and repeating for a total of two washes.
7. Resuspend cells in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS and
antibiotics.
B. Cell Proliferation Assay Setup:
1. Count isolated PBMCs and adjust to a final concentration of
1x10^6 cells/mL.
2. Aliquot 100 µL PBMC suspension (1x10^5 cells) into each well
of a 96-well culture plate.
3. Add 100 µL of each antigen or mitogen solution to specific wells
to achieve the desired final concentration:
◦ Positive control (PHA): 5 µg/mL
◦ Negative control: medium only
◦ Test antigens: appropriate concentrations
4. Cover plates with sterile lids or Parafilm.
C. Incubation:
1. Incubate plates at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator (5%
CO2) for 3-7 days depending on the antigen/proliferation
marker used.
2. Observe cultures daily to ensure no contamination and proper
cell health.
D. Measuring Proliferation:
1. [3H]-Thymidine Incorporation:
◦ At the endpoint, add 20 µL of [3H]-thymidine to each well (1
μCi/well).
◦ Incubate for an additional 12-24 hours.
◦ Harvest cells onto filter mats using a cell harvester, dry the
mats, and measure radioactivity using a scintillation counter.

2. CFSE Labelling (if using flow cytometry):
◦ Aim to label PBMCS with CFSE dye, following manufacturer
instructions, before setting up proliferation assay.
◦ Post-incubation, harvest cells, wash with PBS, and analyze
using a flow cytometer.
◦ Calculate the percentage of cells that have divided by
analyzing the dilution of CFSE dye.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure PBMCs isolated from blood samples are viable by using
Trypan blue exclusion test.
• Include positive and negative control wells in every experimental
run.
• Validate results with replicate wells and ensure acceptable
coefficient of variation (< 15%).
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record data from scintillation counting or flow cytometry
accurately.
• Analyze data using appropriate software or spreadsheets to
determine stimulation indices (SI).
• Report SI values >3 as a positive response to the respective
antigen.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Results are patient-specific; interpretations depend on clinical
context and comparison to appropriate controls.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Proliferation assays may be affected by the health of PBMCs,
storage times, and conditions of specimens.
• Results can be influenced by technical handling; thus strict
aseptic conditions must be maintained throughout the procedure.
