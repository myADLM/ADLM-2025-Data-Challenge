SOP for Lymphocyte Proliferation to Mitogens, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the determination of
lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen stimulation. This
assay measures the ability of lymphocytes to proliferate when
exposed to specific mitogens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
lymphocyte proliferation assay, including processing samples, setting
up cultures, monitoring cultures, and analyzing results. It is the
responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that all personnel are
trained and competent in performing the procedure.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL whole blood collected in a sodium heparin (green-top)
tube.
• Specimen should be processed within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Blood collected in tubes with anticoagulants other than sodium
heparin.
• Specimens that have been stored or transported outside of the
acceptable temperature range (2-25°C).
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post collection.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Sodium heparinized whole blood
• RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with:
◦ 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)
◦ 2 mM L-glutamine
◦ 100 U/mL penicillin
◦ 100 μg/mL streptomycin
• Mitogens (e.g., Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Concanavalin A
(ConA), or Pokeweed mitogen (PWM))
• 96-well tissue culture plates
• Cell culture CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2)
• Centrifuge
• 3[H]-thymidine or alternative proliferation assay dye (e.g., MTT,
AlamarBlue)
• Scintillation counter/plate reader
4. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation of Cell Suspension:
◦ Dilute whole blood 1:1 with RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with fetal bovine serum.
◦ Gently layer the diluted blood over a density gradient
medium (e.g., Ficoll-Paque).
◦ Centrifuge at 400 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Carefully remove the lymphocyte layer, dilute with
RPMI-1640 medium, and wash twice by centrifugation.
◦ Adjust cell concentration to 1 x 10^6 cells/mL in
supplemented RPMI-1640 medium.
2. Setting Up Cultures:
◦ Aliquot 100 μL of cell suspension (1 x 10^5 cells) into each
well of a 96-well tissue culture plate.
◦ Add 100 μL of mitogen solution to designated wells to reach
desired final concentration (e.g., 5 μg/mL PHA, 2.5 μg/mL
ConA, 1 μg/mL PWM).
◦ Include control wells with no mitogen (unstimulated wells).
◦ Ensure each condition is set up in triplicate or quadruplicate
wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Place the culture plate in a CO2 incubator at 37°C with 5%
CO2 for 72 hours.
◦ Avoid disturbing the plate during the incubation period.
4. Measuring Proliferation:
◦ At the end of the incubation period, add 1 μCi of 3[H]-
thymidine or the appropriate proliferation assay dye to each
well.
◦ Incubate for an additional 4-6 hours at 37°C.
◦ If using 3[H]-thymidine, harvest cells onto a glass fiber filter
and wash thoroughly.
◦ Measure the amount of incorporated radioactivity using a
scintillation counter.
◦ If using a non-radioactive method, follow the manufacturer's
instructions for reading the signal using a plate reader.
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate mean counts per minute (cpm) for each set of
triplicate or quadruplicate wells.
◦ Subtract the mean value of the unstimulated control wells
from each stimulated well to obtain the net cpm.
◦ Express results as stimulation index (SI), which is the ratio
of the mean cpm of stimulated wells to the mean cpm of
control wells.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run internal controls with every batch of samples.
• Ensure reagents are stored and used according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Verify the cell count and viability using trypan blue exclusion prior
to setting up cultures.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record raw cpm counts for each sample including:
◦ Unstimulated control wells
◦ Each mitogen-stimulated well
• Report the SI for each mitogen.
• Flag results with significant deviations or outliers.
• Clearly document any procedural anomalies or deviations.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are processed promptly post-collection to
preserve cell viability.
• Avoid contamination and maintain aseptic conditions.
• Results can be influenced by reagent quality, technician handling,
or patient health status.

Note: Revisiting and updating the SOP periodically is essential to
ensure compliance with the latest guidelines and best practices.
