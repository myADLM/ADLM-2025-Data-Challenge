Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LYMPHOCYTE
SUBPOP 10 Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
necessary to perform and document the analysis of
Lymphocyte Subpopulation 10 (LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 10)
using flow cytometry technique.
2. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to all instances where
LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 10 analysis is required in the
laboratory. It is intended for use by trained and authorized
personnel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Qualified Laboratory Staff: Perform and document all steps
according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure staff adherence to protocols and manage
any deviations or issues in the process.
1. PRECAUTION AND SAFETY
• Ensure adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE)
requirements, including lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses.
• Handle all reagents and samples with care, adhering to safety
guidelines and protocols for biohazardous materials.
1. DEFINITIONS
LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 10: A panel of markers used to identify and
quantify lymphocyte subsets in blood samples.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II)
• Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific to lymphocyte
markers (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8)
• Lysing solution
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Sample tubes (12 x 75 mm)
• Pipettes and tips
1. REAGENTS
• Specific fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for
LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 10
• Lysing buffer (10x concentrate)
• PBS (pH 7.2-7.4)
• Stabilized control cells for flow cytometry validation
• Sheath fluid
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Warm lysing buffer to room temperature.
3. Thaw control cells if stored frozen.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Label a set of required sample tubes with corresponding patient
information.
2. Add 100µL of whole blood to each tube.
3. Add 20µL of the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated antibody
to the corresponding tubes.
4. Vortex each tube gently to mix.
C. Incubation
1. Incubate samples for 15-30 minutes at room temperature,
protected from light.
2. Following incubation, add 2mL of lysing buffer to each tube to
lyse red blood cells.
3. Incubate for an additional 10 minutes at room temperature,
protected from light.
D. Washing
1. Centrifuge the tubes at 500xg for 5 minutes.
2. Carefully decant the supernatant.
3. Resuspend the cell pellet in 2mL of PBS.
4. Repeat the centrifugation and washing steps twice.
E. Acquisition and Analysis with Flow Cytometer
1. Prepare the flow cytometer for sample acquisition following the
instrument’s startup procedure and ensure the machine is
calibrated.
2. Verify that all control values are within acceptable ranges.
3. Adjust settings appropriately for the fluorochromes utilized.
4. Ensure proper compensation is set to avoid spectral overlap.
5. Acquire data for each sample tube, aiming for a collection of
10,000-50,000 lymphocytes.
6. Save the data files with appropriate nomenclature for further
analysis.
F. Data Analysis
1. Use flow cytometry analysis software to gate on lymphocyte
populations based on forward and side scatter properties to
exclude debris and non-lymphocytes.
2. Analyze the percentage and absolute counts of different
lymphocyte subsets (e.g., CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells).
3. Compare patient results with reference ranges.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include a set of control beads or prepared controls with known
marker values with each batch of samples analyzed.
6. Assess the daily performance of the flow cytometer using
manufacturer-provided QC procedures.
7. Document any deviation from protocol and corrective actions
taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Results that have been reviewed and validated should be
reported in the laboratory information system (LIS).
10. Ensure that results falling outside normal reference ranges are
flagged and reviewed by a pathologist or designated medical
professional.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Report site-specific reference ranges for each lymphocyte subset
(typically ranges are provided in the appendix or manufacturer's
insert).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that the instrument's calibration is current and that any
technical issues are addressed promptly.
• Store reagents and samples as specified to ensure their integrity
and performance.

• Manufacturer’s guidelines for flow cytometer operation
• CDC protocols for flow cytometry in clinical settings
• CAP Guidelines for Validating Flow Cytometry Process
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a file of all procedural records, including raw data files,
QC records, and maintenance logs for reference and audit
purposes.
All deviations from this protocol must be recorded and reported to the
supervising authority. Any changes to this SOP must be approved
and documented in the revision log.
