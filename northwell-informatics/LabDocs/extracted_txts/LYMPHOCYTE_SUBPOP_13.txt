Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Protocol: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Lymphocyte
Subpop 13
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
and reporting of lymphocyte subpopulations using flow cytometry to
ensure accurate and reliable results for clinical assessment. This
includes the identification and quantification of specific lymphocyte
subsets as part of diagnostic and monitoring procedures for immune
disorders, infections, and hematologic diseases.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis, document the results, and report findings following this
protocol. All staff must ensure adherence to quality control measures
to maintain data integrity and accuracy.
1. DEFINITIONS
Lymphocyte Subpop 13: Refers to a panel of specific markers used
to identify and quantify lymphocyte subsets, including but not limited
to T-cells, B-cells, and NK-cells.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum of 3 mL of whole blood.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection.
• Store at 2-8°C if processing is delayed.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Specimens older than 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II)
• Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for lymphocyte
markers (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, etc.)
• Lysing solution
• 1X PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline)
• Falcon tubes (12 x 75 mm)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
1. Label appropriate number of Falcon tubes for each sample and
control.
2. Add 100 µL of whole blood to each labeled tube.
5.2 Staining Procedure
1. Add 10 µL of each fluorochrome-conjugated antibody to the
corresponding sample tubes.
2. Vortex each tube briefly to mix.
3. Incubate the tubes for 15 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
5.3 Red Blood Cell Lysis
1. Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube.
2. Vortex and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
3. Centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
4. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell
pellet.
5. Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of 1X PBS.
6. Centrifuge again at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
7. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of
1X PBS.
5.4 Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Set up the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions, ensuring proper calibration and compensation
settings.
2. Load samples onto the flow cytometer.
3. Acquire data as per instrument-specific protocols, ensuring
acquisition of a minimum of 10,000 events per sample.
4. Save the data files on the laboratory information system (LIS)
for analysis.
5.5 Data Analysis
1. Use flow cytometry analysis software (e.g., BD FACSDiva) to
analyze the data.
2. Gate the lymphocyte populations based on forward scatter/side
scatter characteristics.
3. Identify and quantify specific lymphocyte subsets utilizing
fluorochrome-conjugated markers (e.g., CD3+CD4+ T-cells,
CD3+CD8+ T-cells, CD19+ B-cells, CD56+ NK-cells).
4. Perform quality checks and ensure the gating strategy is
accurate and reproducible.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Commercially available quality control material for flow cytometry
(e.g., BD Multi-Check Control). Storage:
• Store at 2-8°C as per manufacturer's recommendations.
Procedure:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch of
tests.
• Document and validate results prior to analyzing patient samples.
• If QC results are out of range, investigate and resolve issues
before proceeding.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
3. Report absolute counts and percentages of lymphocyte subsets
as per standard reporting guidelines.
4. Include any relevant comments or interpretations.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• CD3+ T-cells: 60-85%
• CD4+ T-cells: 30-62%
• CD8+ T-cells: 15-35%
• CD19+ B-cells: 4-13%
• CD56+ NK-cells: 5-15%
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for individual antibody
panels, as well as flow cytometry instrument limitations.
