Title: Standard Operating Procedure for Lymphocyte Subpopulation 7
(LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 7) Analysis
1. Scope and Purpose:
This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes the process of
analyzing and generating results for the Lymphocyte Subpopulation 7
(LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 7). This procedure ensures reliable and
accurate measurements of lymphocyte subpopulations to aid in
patient diagnosis and management.
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Specimen type: Peripheral blood.
◦ Collection tube: EDTA (lavender-top) tube.
◦ Specimen volume: Minimum 2 mL whole blood.
◦ Specimen storage: Maintain specimens at room
temperature (20-25°C); do not refrigerate/freeze.
◦ Specimen stability: Must be analyzed within 24 hours of
collection.
2. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Flow cytometer (validated for use with Lymphocyte
Subpopulation 7 analysis).
◦ Fluorescently labeled antibodies specific to markers present
on LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 7.
◦ Lysing solution (for red blood cell removal).
◦ Flow cytometry sheath fluid.
◦ Calibrated pipettes.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE).
3. Quality Control:
◦ Use commercial or in-house prepared control samples (both
positive and negative) to assess accuracy and precision.
◦ Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples.
◦ Review quality control data before reporting patient results.
◦ Ensure the flow cytometer is properly calibrated before
starting the analysis.
4. Procedure:
A. Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens and reagents.
2. Retrieve EDTA blood specimens and log into the laboratory information management system (LIMS).
B. Staining Procedure:
1. Mix blood specimens gently by inversion.
2. Label flow cytometry tubes for each patient and controls.
3. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into each tube.
4. Add 10 µL of fluorescently labeled antibodies specific for LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 7 and other markers of interest.
5. Vortex to mix and incubate the tubes in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes.
C. Red Blood Cell Lysis:
1. Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube.
2. Vortex to mix, incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 minutes.
3. Centrifuge tubes at 500g for 5 minutes.
4. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of sheath fluid.
5. Repeat the wash step one additional time for optimal removal of lysed red blood cells.
D. Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Transfer the resuspended cells to labeled flow cytometry tubes.
2. Run a blank tube to check for debris and count threshold.
3. Run control samples to establish proper gating and confirm the accuracy of the flow cytometer settings.
4. Acquire data for each patient sample, ensuring a minimum of 10,000 lymphocyte events are collected.
5. Monitor live acquisition for proper populations based on scatter and fluorescence properties.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Use appropriate software to analyze the flow cytometry data.
2. Apply gating strategies to identify LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 7.
3. Calculate the percentage and absolute counts of LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOP 7 within the lymphocyte population.
1. Reporting Results:
1. Carefully review and verify all data.
2. Enter and validate results in the LIMS.
3. Report results within established reference intervals
according to laboratory guidelines.
4. Notify the supervising technologist of any critical or
unexpected results for immediate review.
2. Method Limitations:
1. Ensure rapid analysis of fresh specimens as prolonged
storage may affect results.
2. Interpretation of subpopulation analysis must consider
clinical correlation.
3. References:
◦ Operational Manual for Flow Cytometer.
◦ Package inserts for fluorescently labeled antibodies.
◦ CAP and CLIA guidelines for flow cytometry practices.
By following these SOP guidelines, the laboratory ensures the
accurate identification and quantification of Lymphocyte
Subpopulation 7, which is crucial for patient diagnosis and treatment
plans.
