Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
TITLE: Analytical Phase for Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Antibody,
IFA (CSF) Referral Laboratory
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the standard procedures for analyzing CSF specimens for
Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) Antibody using Indirect
Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) testing at the referral laboratory.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing, analysis, quality control, and result reporting of LCM
antibody tests on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory technicians are responsible for adhering to this SOP in
the preparation and processing of CSF specimens.
• The designated supervisor ensures the accuracy and reliability of
test results and that all quality control procedures are followed.
• The referral laboratory is responsible for performing the IFA test
according to their protocols and providing results back to the
requesting laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
A. Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• CSF collected aseptically.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Collected in a sterile, leak-proof container.
B. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed or contaminated specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-sterile or inappropriate containers.
• Specimens displaying signs of severe degradation.
1. SPECIMEN TRANSPORT:
• Transport CSF specimens to the referral laboratory under
appropriate conditions to ensure specimen integrity.
• Use a cold pack to maintain a refrigerated temperature (2-8°C)
during transport.
• Ensure prompt shipping to avoid delays and maintain specimen
viability.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS:
• Referral laboratory procures and uses reagents and materials
validated for the IFA test.
• Specific reagents include FITC-labeled anti-human IgG, control
slides, mounting medium, and cover slips.
• Calibrated pipettes and slides.
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Identify and log the patient’s CSF specimen and ensure
appropriate labeling.
2. Prepare the specimen for transport by sealing it in a leak-proof
secondary container and placing it in a cold pack.
B. Shipment:
1. Arrange courier or shipping through a reliable refrigerated
transport service.
2. Include a completed test requisition form with relevant patient
and specimen details.
3. Ensure that shipping compliance with relevant biological
specimen transport regulations is maintained.
C. Referral Laboratory Testing Procedure:
1. Upon receipt, the referral laboratory logs and cross-checks the
specimen.
2. Process the specimen following their IFA testing protocols for
LCM antibody detection.
3. Perform indirect fluorescent antibody staining and microscopic
examination.
4. Record findings and verify against quality control standards.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
A. Internal Controls:
1. Perform regular quality control checks using control slides with
known positive and negative LCM sera.
2. Verify the FITC-labeled antibody reagent with an appropriate
control, as per the referral laboratory quality assurance
guidelines.
B. Proficiency Testing:
1. Participate in inter-laboratory proficiency testing programs to
ensure continuous accuracy.
2. Document and review results as part of Continuous Quality
Improvement (CQI).
3. RESULTS REPORTING:
4. Referral laboratory electronically or physically sends results
back to the requesting laboratory.
5. Review and verify the results according to the internal protocol.
6. Document the patient's results in the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) and notify the clinician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the package insert and technical specifications from the
referral laboratory's testing protocol for limitations associated with the
IFA test, such as potential cross-reactivity and sensitivity/specificity
details.

• Referral laboratory’s IFA testing manual.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for FITC-labeled anti-human IgG and
control references.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines for laboratory testing and
specimen handling.
By following this SOP, all involved personnel can ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for the Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis
Antibody, IFA (CSF) test, assisting in appropriate clinical
management of the patient.
