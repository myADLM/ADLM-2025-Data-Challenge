Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for LEF1 Immunostain
Analysis (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE:
To describe the procedures involved in the technical component of
LEF1 immunostaining, ensuring accurate and reproducible staining
results on tissue slides.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing LEF1
immunostain analysis in a clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing all
procedures as described.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all
personnel are adequately trained on this SOP and to monitor
compliance.
• All staff should immediately report any issues or deviations from
the procedure to their supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue with a
minimum thickness of 4 micrometers.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are improperly fixed, excessively
dried, or show visible artifacts affecting staining quality.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• LEF1 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (appropriate for the host of the primary
antibody)
• DAB substrate-chromogen solution
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Deionized water
• PBS buffer
• Coverslips and staining jars
6. EQUIPMENT:
• Microtome
• Incubator (37°C)
• Water bath (75°C)
• Immunostainer or manual staining kit
• Light microscope
• Timer
7. PROCEDURE:
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut FFPE tissue block into 4-micrometer sections using a
microtome.
◦ Place sections into a water bath at 75°C and collect onto
positively charged glass slides.
2. Drying:
◦ Air-dry slides at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Further dry slides in an incubator at 37°C for 1 hour or
overnight.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in xylene for 2 intervals of 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 5 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 5 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 5 minutes
3. Rinse in deionized water for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Preheat antigen retrieval solution until boiling.
2. Place slides in the solution and maintain at a sub-boiling
temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool down in the solution at room temperature
for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
D) Staining:
Manual method (if an automatic immunostainer is not available):
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply protein blocking solution over the tissue sections for
10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS buffer.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply LEF1 primary antibody to the sections and incubate
for 60 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody solution and incubate for 30
minutes.
◦ Rinse in PBS buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB substrate-chromogen solution and incubate for
5-10 minutes until the desired stain intensity develops under
microscope monitoring.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes for
counterstaining.
◦ Rinse thoroughly in deionized water.
◦ Differentiate in 1% acid alcohol for a few seconds, then rinse
in running tap water for blueing.
E) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through ethanol series (70%, 95%, and 100%)
for 2 minutes each.
2. Clear in xylene for 2 intervals of 5 minutes each.
3. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
F) Quality Control:
1. Use positive and negative control slides for each staining run.
2. Ensure staining quality is consistent, and no non-specific
staining is present.
G) Reporting:
1. After staining, submit slides to the pathologist for review.
2. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
staining process in the laboratory logbook.

slides for LEF1 immunostain.
