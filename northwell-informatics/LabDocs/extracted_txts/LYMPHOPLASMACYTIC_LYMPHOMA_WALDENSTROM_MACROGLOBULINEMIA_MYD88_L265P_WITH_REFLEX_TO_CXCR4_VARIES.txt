Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström
Macroglobulinemia (LP/WL), MYD88 L265P with Reflex to CXCR4
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the
analysis, interpretation, and reporting of MYD88 L265P
mutation status in patients suspected of Lymphoplasmacytic
Lymphoma/Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (LP/WL). This
protocol also covers reflex testing for the CXCR4 mutation if
MYD88 L265P mutation is detected.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the testing, ensuring competency, and verifying all results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood: EDTA anticoagulated blood (4-6 mL) collected
and kept at 4°C if processing is delayed beyond 24 hours.
• Bone marrow aspirate: EDTA anticoagulated (1-2 mL) collected
and kept at 4°C if processing is delayed beyond 24 hours.
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue: 5-10 unstained
sections, 5-10 microns thick.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Specimens not labeled with patient identifiers.
• Degraded, hemolyzed, or insufficient quantity samples.
• Specimens that have not been maintained within the stability
conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR instrument with appropriate software.
• qPCR probes and primers specific for MYD88 L265P and CXCR4
mutations.
• Nucleic acid extraction kits.
• Electrophoresis unit.
• Positive and negative control samples.
• General laboratory supplies including pipettes, gloves, and tubes.
• Software for data analysis and result interpretation.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction: i) For blood/bone marrow: a) Follow the
nucleic acid extraction kit protocol for extracting genomic DNA. b)
Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer and ensure the DNA
concentration is within the acceptable range (typically 10-50 ng/μL).
ii) For FFPE tissue: a) Perform deparaffinization and tissue digestion.
b) Extract genomic DNA following the recommended protocol for
FFPE samples. c) Quantify extracted DNA and assess quality.
B. PCR Amplification: i) Perform specific PCR amplification for the
MYD88 L265P mutation. Use controls to ensure validity. ii) Set up
reactions in a PCR instrument following the manufacturer's protocol.
iii) Run PCR cycles as specified in the protocol and validate the run
using internal controls.
C. Detection and Analysis: i) Analyze PCR products using
electrophoresis or real-time PCR amplification curves. ii) Confirm the
presence or absence of the MYD88 L265P mutation. iii) If MYD88
L265P mutation is positive, proceed to reflex testing for CXCR4
mutations.
D. Reflex Testing for CXCR4: i) Follow the same extraction
procedures if a new sample preparation is required. ii) Perform PCR
amplification for CXCR4 mutations. iii) Analyze and interpret results
similarly to MYD88 L265P testing.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Compare patient results with positive and negative controls.
• Interpret findings consistent with mutation status, cross-check for
any potential errors.
• Document all findings and ensure they are correct before
transmitting them to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls during each run.
• Ensure all equipment receives routine maintenance check-ups.
• Participate in external proficiency testing as required.
• Document any discrepancies and perform root cause analysis
when necessary.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Verify DNA quality if amplification fails.
• Confirm equipment calibration and function.
• Re-run the test with new reagents if contamination or technical
issues are suspected.
• Re-extract DNA if necessary.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all relevant biosafety and biohazard guidelines.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
• Dispose of all clinical specimens and laboratory waste according
to safety protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• Relevant scientific literature, PCR kit inserts, and instrument
manuals.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all samples processed, results obtained, and quality
control metrics.
• Maintain detailed records in both paper and digital formats.
• Ensure SOP compliance and update procedures as needed.
By following this standard operating procedure, the analytical phase
for generating results for Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia, MYD88 L265P with reflex to
CXCR4, can be performed accurately and consistently, ensuring
high-quality and reliable patient testing.
