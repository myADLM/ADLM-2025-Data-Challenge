Sample Protocol: Analytical Phase of LYNCH SYNDROME
PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE: This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for a Lynch Syndrome Panel. This
includes the preparation, processing, and analysis of patient samples
to detect mutations in the relevant genes associated with Lynch
Syndrome.
2. SCOPE: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the analysis of samples for Lynch Syndrome Panel testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for sample preparation,
processing, and analysis.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the technical work,
troubleshooting, and ensuring compliance with protocol
requirements.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Lynch Syndrome Panel: A genetic test panel designed to detect
mutations in genes associated with Lynch Syndrome (e.g., MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM).
• PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A technique used to amplify
DNA sequences.
• Sequencing: The process of determining the order of nucleotides
in DNA.
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Verify each sample against the requisition form and ensure it is
properly labeled.
2. Extract DNA from blood or tissue samples using a standardized
DNA extraction kit (refer to DNA Extraction SOP).
3. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR reactions according to the specific primer sets for
the Lynch Syndrome panel.
2. Set up the reaction mix as follows:
◦ 25 µL of PCR Master Mix
◦ 2 µL of Forward Primer (10 µM)
◦ 2 µL of Reverse Primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of DNA template (50 ng/µL)
◦ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 µL
3. Load the PCR reactions into the thermal cycler and run the
following program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 58-62°C (depending on primer set) for 30
seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or another
suitable DNA stain.
2. Load PCR products and a DNA ladder into the wells of the gel.
3. Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 30-45 minutes.
4. Visualize the gel under UV light and document the results.
D) DNA Sequencing:
1. Clean up the PCR products using a PCR purification kit (refer to
PCR Product Purification SOP).
2. Perform Sanger sequencing or Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) based on the laboratory’s capability.
3. Prepare sequencing reactions according to the manufacturer's
instructions for the sequencing platform used.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Upload raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline.
2. Align sequences against the reference genome and identify
variants.
3. Annotate variants using a variant annotation tool.
4. Interpret the results based on known pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, benign, and uncertain significance variants in
Lynch Syndrome-associated genes.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Prepare a comprehensive report including:
◦ Patient identification information
◦ Gene(s) tested and associated variants
◦ Interpretation of variants (pathogenicity, clinical relevance)
◦ Recommendations for follow-up testing or genetic
counseling
2. Review and verify the final report by a designated specialist in
molecular genetics.
3. Transmit the final report to the referring physician and retain a
copy in the patient’s record.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Record and monitor quality control metrics including DNA yield,
PCR efficiency, and sequencing quality scores.
3. Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
1. Variants outside the regions covered by the primer sets will not
be detected.
2. Low-quality DNA samples may result in failed PCR amplification
or sequencing.
8. SAFETY:
1. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including the use of
PPE (personal protective equipment), proper waste disposal,
and handling potentially infectious materials.
