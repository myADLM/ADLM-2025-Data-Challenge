Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Lysophosphatidylcholines in Blood Spots Using LC MS/MS
1. PURPOSE
To provide consistent procedures for the analysis of
lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) in blood spots using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS). This
ensures high-quality results and compliance with regulatory
standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing LPC analysis
on blood spot specimens using LC MS/MS in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists to follow this
SOP accurately and fully document all procedures and results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and handling
any issues that arise during the analysis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Dried blood spots on filter paper.
• Sample Volume: A minimum of two 3.2mm punches from the
blood spot using a calibrated puncher.
• Storage: Blood spots should be stored at room temperature in a
dry place, preferably with desiccant, and are stable for up to 30
days. For long-term storage, refrigerate or freeze.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• LC MS/MS system with appropriate columns and reagents.
• Calibrated sample puncher (3.2mm).
• Methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, water (LC-MS grade).
• Calibration standards and internal standards for LPCs.
• 96-well plates and plate shaker.
• Centrifuge (capable of 4000 RPM).
• Vortex mixer.
• Nitrogen evaporator or similar drying apparatus.
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated).
• Gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Mobile phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid.
• Mobile phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
• LPC Calibration standards and internal standards.
• Extraction solvent: Methanol with 0.1% formic acid.
• Deionized water.
• Clean 96-well plates for sample extraction and analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Punch two 3.2mm disks from the dried blood spot and place
them into a well of a 96-well plate.
2. Add 200 µL of extraction solvent containing internal standards
to each well.
3. Seal the plate and shake on a plate shaker for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
4. Centrifuge the plate at 4000 RPM for 10 minutes.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean 96-well plate.
Sample Analysis by LC MS/MS:
LC Conditions:
1. Set the LC system with Column: Reversed-phase C18, 2.1 x 50
mm, 1.7 µm.
2. Mobile Phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid.
3. Mobile Phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
4. Flow Rate: 0.4 mL/min.
5. Injection Volume: 10 µL.
6. Gradient: Start at 50% B, increase to 95% B over 5 minutes,
hold at 95% B for 1 minute, return to 50% B over 1 minute, and
equilibrate for 3 minutes (total run time: 10 minutes).
MS/MS Conditions:
1. Ionization: Positive Electrospray Ionization (ESI+).
2. Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode for LPC species and
internal standards.
3. Adjust voltages and gas flows according to the instrument
manufacturer's specifications.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations alongside patient samples.
2. Analyze a blank sample (extraction solvent) to check for
contamination.
3. Run calibration standards at the beginning and end of each
batch.
4. Data from QC samples must fall within ±15% of the nominal
concentrations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULT REPORTING
1. Process chromatographic data using LC MS/MS software.
2. Quantitate LPC levels by comparing sample peak areas to
calibration curves.
3. Report results according to laboratory standards, ensuring all
results are reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
4. Document all analytical runs, sample identifications, and any
flags or issues observed during the analysis.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to instrument manual and LPC reagent kit inserts for method
limitations, matrix effects, interference, and potential issues that may
affect the accuracy and precision of results.

12. REVISION
This SOP must be reviewed annually, and any changes must be
documented and approved by laboratory supervisors before
implementation.

13. DOCUMENT CONTROL
All SOPs must be stored in the designated SOP library and
accessible to all laboratory personnel. Ensure that all outdated
versions are archived and the current version is in use.
