Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP): Analytical Phase of
Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL)
Activity Assay
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for accurately determining the activity of
Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) in blood specimens, ensuring reliable
and reproducible results in compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow these
procedures and ensure accurate and timely reporting of results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL)
An enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and
triglycerides, deficiencies of which can lead to disorders like Wolman
disease and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD).
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL
• Handling: Ensure specimens are kept at 2-8°C and sent to the
laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with improper labeling
• Specimens not kept at appropriate temperatures
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• 96-well microplate reader
Reagents:
• Substrate buffer containing 4-MU oleate
• Reaction buffer
• Sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0)
• Stop buffer (sodium carbonate solution)
• LAL standard
• Control solutions
Supplies:
• Microcentrifuge tubes (sterile, DNase/RNase free)
• 96-well flat-bottom plate
• Parafilm
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the Substrate buffer, Reaction buffer, and Stop
buffer according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Calibrate all pipettes to ensure accurate volume dispensing.
◦ Thaw LAL standard and control solutions at room
temperature before use and mix thoroughly.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma.
◦ Carefully pipette off the plasma into a sterile microcentrifuge
tube, avoiding the buffy coat layer.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Setup Microplate:
◦ Label the 96-well plate appropriately with standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ In designated wells, add 50 µL of Substrate buffer.
◦ Add 50 µL of sample, control, or standard to the
corresponding wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with Parafilm to prevent evaporation.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Reaction Termination:
◦ Add 100 µL of Stop buffer to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ Mix the plate gently using a plate shaker for 2 minutes.
4. Measurement:
◦ Read the fluorescence intensity of each well using a
microplate reader with excitation at 355 nm and emission at
460 nm.
◦ Ensure the instrument is blanked with the appropriate buffer
before taking measurements.
C) Calculations:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Generate a standard curve using the LAL standards and plot
fluorescence intensity vs. concentration.
◦ Calculate the LAL activity in patient samples based on the
standard curve.
◦ Correct for any background fluorescence using the
appropriate control.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls with each batch of samples.
• Monitor the assay performance by checking the control data
against established ranges.
• If control results fall outside the designated range, investigate
potential issues, correct, and rerun samples if necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data Entry:
◦ Enter all results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
◦ Verify entries for accuracy.
• Reference Ranges:
◦ Compare patient results to established reference ranges for
LAL activity.
◦ Report results with appropriate clinical interpretation.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure no inhibitors are present in blood samples.
• Hemolyzed samples can cause erroneous results.
9. REFERENCE
• Product insert and instruction manual for the LAL assay kit from
the manufacturer.
• Relevant CLIA regulations and guidelines for enzyme assay
protocols.
