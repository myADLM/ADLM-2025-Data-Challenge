Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Blood Spot
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard protocol for the quantitative measurement of
Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) enzyme activity in dried blood spot
(DBS) specimens using fluorometric or mass spectrometry-based
assays.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting LAL blood
spot testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
LAL blood spot testing in accordance with this SOP. Supervisors
must ensure that all personnel are adequately trained and that testing
is carried out accurately and efficiently.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type:
◦ Dried Blood Spot (DBS) on filter paper.
◦ Typically collected via heel stick for infants or finger stick for
older patients.
• Specimen Collection:
◦ Ensure the DBS card is completely dried at room temperature
for at least 3 hours.
◦ Avoid contamination and ensure proper labeling.
• Specimen Transport and Storage:
◦ Store DBS cards at room temperature in a dry, dark
environment.
◦ Specimens are stable at room temperature for up to 2 weeks,
or at -20°C for long-term storage up to 6 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ DBS cards with incomplete or insufficient blood spots.
◦ Contaminated or improperly labeled specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Fluorimeter or Mass Spectrometer
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ DBS punching device
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge (if required)
◦ Plate reader (if using a plate-based assay)
• Reagents:
◦ LAL substrate (fluorogenic or mass spectrometry-based)
◦ Assay buffer
◦ Calibration standards
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Extraction reagent (if required)
6. PROCEDURE
• 1. DBS Punch Preparation:
◦ Punch a 3 mm diameter disk (usually 1/8" punch) from the
DBS card into the designated well or tube for extraction.
◦ Ensure consistent punching to maintain uniform sample size.
• 2. Sample Extraction:
◦ Add the specified volume of assay buffer or extraction reagent
to each well or tube containing the punched DBS.
◦ Vortex or shake to ensure thorough mixing.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time and temperature to allow
complete extraction of the enzyme.
• 3. Assay Setup:
◦ Prepare the assay plate by adding calibration standards,
quality controls, and extracted samples to the designated
wells.
◦ Add the LAL substrate to each well according to the assay
protocol.
◦ Mix gently to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Incubate the plate under the specified conditions (e.g.,
temperature and duration) to allow the enzyme reaction to
proceed.
• 4. Detection:
◦ For fluorometric assays: Measure fluorescence intensity using
a plate reader at the specified excitation and emission
wavelengths.
◦ For mass spectrometry-based assays: Analyze samples using
a mass spectrometer and quantify the LAL activity based on
the generated mass spectral data.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
monitor assay performance.
◦ Compare control values with established ranges and take
corrective actions if results fall outside acceptable limits.
• External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs as
available.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review assay data ensuring that all controls are within acceptable
ranges.
• Calculate LAL enzyme activity based on standard curves and
calibration data.
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
generate a final report.
• Flag any abnormal results according to clinical thresholds and
notify the requesting physician as required.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish and validate reference ranges specific to the
laboratory’s patient population and testing methodology.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Be aware of potential interferences such as hemolysis, improper
specimen collection or storage, and substrate impurities.
• Validate any deviations or modifications to the standard protocol
prior to implementation.
