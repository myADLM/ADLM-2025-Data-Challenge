Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lysosomal and Peroxisomal Disorders
Newborn Screen, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the analytical procedures
for generating results for lysosomal and peroxisomal disorders in
newborn screening using blood spot specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in newborn screening protocols are
responsible for performing and documenting all steps within this
protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that this protocol is
adhered to, and for managing any troubleshooting and corrective
actions.
3. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable Specimen: Blood spot collected on a newborn
screening card. Ensure proper filling of the circle with thorough
saturation.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Blood spots that are improperly dried,
under-saturated, uneven, or contaminated.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS)
• Puncher machine
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagents: specific enzyme substrates, internal standards, quality
control materials
• Calibration standards
• Incubation plates
• Solvents: methanol, water (HPLC grade)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
1. Punch a precise disc from the blood spot card using the
puncher machine and place it into the appropriate well of the
incubation plate.
2. Add specific enzyme substrates and internal standards into
each well containing a blood spot disc.
3. Incubate the plates for the required period as specified by the
reagent manufacturers' instructions, typically at 37°C for a
specific duration (e.g., overnight).
5.2 Sample Extraction
1. Following incubation, add the required volume of extraction
solvent (e.g., methanol) to each well.
2. Mix thoroughly and centrifuge the incubation plate to separate
the liquid from the blood spot disc.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a new vial or well for analysis.
5.3 Instrumentation Setup and Calibration
1. Set up the Tandem Mass Spectrometer (MS/MS) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform daily instrument calibration using calibration standards
specific to the lysosomal and peroxisomal disorders to be
screened.
3. Validate calibration results, ensuring that they fall within the
acceptable range as defined by the laboratory's standard
calibration criteria.
5.4 Analytical Measurement
1. Inject the extracted sample into the MS/MS.
2. Utilize predefined methods for the detection and quantification
of enzyme activities or metabolites associated with lysosomal
and peroxisomal disorders.
3. Ensure that each run includes quality control (QC) samples that
cover the low, mid, and high ranges of expected analyte
concentrations.
5.5 Data Analysis and Result Generation
1. Analyze the MS/MS data using approved software, ensuring
cross-checks for accuracy and correctness.
2. Compare the obtained enzyme activity or metabolite levels
against established reference intervals for lysosomal and
peroxisomal disorders in newborns.
3. Flag any results that fall outside the reference interval for
further review and verification.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control (QC) samples at the start, middle, and end
of each analytical batch. QC materials should mimic patient
specimens and provide known concentrations of the target
analytes.
2. Record all QC results and ensure they fall within the acceptable
limits before releasing patient results.
3. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot the
instrument, reagents, and sample preparation steps. Do not
release any patient results until the issue is resolved and QC
results are within limits.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verified results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Results must be reviewed and interpreted by a trained
professional before releasing them.
3. Critical results or indications of potential disorders must be
flagged and communicated to the responsible healthcare
provider promptly.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
1. If any deviation from expected results or QC failures are
observed, document and investigate the root cause.
2. Perform corrective actions, such as re-calibration, re-running
samples, or replacing reagents as necessary.
3. Record all actions taken in the instrument log and notify the
supervisor.
