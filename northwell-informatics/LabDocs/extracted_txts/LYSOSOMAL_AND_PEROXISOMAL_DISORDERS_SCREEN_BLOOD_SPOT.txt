1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the analytical
phase for generating results for the Lysosomal and Peroxisomal
Disorders Screen using blood spot samples. This includes steps for
processing, analyzing, and reporting results to ensure accurate and
reliable diagnoses.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
testing and analysis of blood spot specimens for Lysosomal and
Peroxisomal Disorders.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP and ensure all equipment and reagents are used and
maintained according to manufacturer guidelines. It is also the
responsibility of staff to report any deviations or issues to the
laboratory supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Acceptable Specimens:
• Dried blood spots on approved filter paper, collected, and stored
per standard specimen collection guidelines.
• Specimen must be provided with the necessary patient
information and collection date.
b. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly labeled, stored, or submitted
beyond the recommended timeframe.
• Specimens with insufficient blood saturation on the filter paper.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
a. Required Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Tandem
Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS)
• Centrifuge, pipettes, and plate reader
• Incubators (if needed according to test protocols)
• Calibrated analytical balances
b. Reagents and Consumables:
• Analytical grade solvents and chemicals
• Enzyme substrates and buffers specific for lysosomal and
peroxisomal biomarkers
• Control and calibration standards
• Sample extraction materials and vials
1. PROCEDURE
a. Specimen Preparation:
• Verify patient information and specimen integrity upon receipt.
• Cut out the blood spot sample, ensuring uniform circular spots are
obtained.
• Place the blood spot in appropriate extraction solvent, vortex, and
incubate as per protocol.
b. Sample Extraction:
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions to extract the biomarkers
from the blood spot.
• Centrifuge the extracts to remove particulates and transfer
supernatant to analysis vials.
c. Analysis:
• Calibrate the HPLC or MS/MS system using the standard and
control calibrators.
• Load the prepared samples into the instrument.
• Perform the assay according to the specific protocol for lysosomal
and peroxisomal disorder screening.
• Monitor the run, ensuring all quality control (QC) parameters are
within the specified ranges.
d. Quality Control:
• Run QC samples alongside patient samples to ensure accuracy.
• If QC samples do not fall within the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and rerun the samples.
e. Data Analysis:
• Review raw data outputs from the HPLC or MS/MS for each
sample.
• Use appropriate software to interpret biomarkers concentrations.
• Verify results against established reference ranges for each
disorder.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Validation:
• Validate results by cross-referencing with control samples and
repeat testing if discrepancies are found.
• Document the validation process and any corrective actions
taken.
b. Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results by a qualified personnel before
releasing the final report.
• Ensure all steps, from sample preparation to result reporting, are
documented comprehensively in the laboratory records.
c. Critical Results:
• If any results indicate critical values, immediately report to the
supervising pathologist.
• Document the critical report notification and follow up actions.
