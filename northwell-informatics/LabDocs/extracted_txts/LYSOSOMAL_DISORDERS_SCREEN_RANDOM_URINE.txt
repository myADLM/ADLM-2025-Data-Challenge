Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase -
Lysosomal Disorders Screen, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing the analytical phase
of the Lysosomal Disorders Screen, Random, Urine to detect the
presence of lysosomal enzymes and metabolites, and generating
accurate results for clinical use.
2. DEFINITIONS
Lysosomal disorders are a group of inherited metabolic disorders
caused by defects in lysosomal functions. These disorders lead to an
accumulation of substrates within lysosomes due to enzyme
deficiencies.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 10 mL random urine collected in a sterile container without
preservatives.
• Specimens should be sent to the laboratory immediately after
collection or stored at 2-8°C if there is any delay, but must be
processed within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected more than 24 hours prior to receipt in the
laboratory.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or containing
preservatives.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme Assay Kits for lysosomal enzymes.
• HPLC or LC-MS/MS equipment for metabolite analysis.
• Standard laboratory glassware and consumables.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C).
• Water Bath (37°C).
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Protective personal equipment (lab coat, gloves, safety goggles).
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Review the specimen documentation to ensure proper collection
and handling.
• Bring specimens stored at 2-8°C to room temperature prior to
analysis.
• Label all specimens accurately.
Enzyme Assay:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Aliquot 1 mL urine sample into a well-labeled
microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500g for 10 minutes at room temperature to
remove debris.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add substrate solutions as per the enzyme assay kit
instructions.
◦ Incubate samples at 37°C for the required duration (typically
1-2 hours).
3. Reaction Termination:
◦ Add stop solution to terminate the reactions.
◦ Centrifuge the samples if sedimentation is required.
4. Measurement:
◦ Measure product formation using appropriate
spectrophotometric or fluorometric techniques.
◦ Record absorbance or fluorescence values.
Metabolite Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Aliquot 5 mL urine sample into a well-labeled tube if larger
volumes are required for analysis.
◦ If using HPLC or LC-MS/MS, additional preparation steps
like filtration may be necessary.
2. Instrumentation:
◦ Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS based on protocol
instructions.
◦ Calibrate the instrument with control standards.
3. Analysis:
◦ Inject the prepared sample into the instrument.
◦ Run the sample according to standard operating
parameters.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze two levels of control samples (normal and abnormal)
alongside patient samples.
• Control values must fall within the established range before
patient results can be reported.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing following laboratory guidelines.
• Ensure instrument validation and maintenance records are up to
date.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review raw data and apply necessary corrections for any
technical errors.
• Calculate enzyme activity and metabolite concentrations using
assay-specific equations and standards.
• Revise and verify results before entry into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Use standard QC procedures to accept or reject runs.
Reference Intervals and Critical Values:
• Establish reference intervals based on the population data.
• Define critical values and follow the protocol to report these
promptly to the requesting physician.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to assay kit inserts and instrument manuals for specific
limitations affecting test accuracy. Interferents in urine like
hemoglobin or bilirubin may affect enzyme reactions or metabolite
quantitation.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit inserts for enzymes and substrates.
• Instrument manuals for HPLC and LC-MS/MS.
• Laboratory protocols for sample handling, QC, and result
reporting.
10. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain a log of all specimens processed including date, time, and
technologist initials. Record of any corrective actions taken for out-of-
range samples or failed quality controls should be documented
thoroughly.
This SOP provides a comprehensive guide for the analytical phase of
generating results for Lysosomal Disorders Screen, Random, Urine,
ensuring accuracy and consistency in laboratory practices.
