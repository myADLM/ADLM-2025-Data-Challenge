Lysosomal Enzyme Analysis, Leukocytes Standard Operating
Procedure
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for the
analysis of lysosomal enzymes in leukocytes for diagnostic purposes.
This protocol includes the steps for sample preparation, enzyme
assay, and data reporting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated staff to follow this protocol
accurately to ensure reliable results. Any deviations or issues must
be reported to a supervisor immediately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Fresh peripheral blood collected in ACD (yellow-top)
tubes.
• Minimum volume required: 10 mL.
• Transport and store specimens at 4°C up to 24 hours from
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens older than 24 hours.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing other anticoagulants
(e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens at room temperature, hemolyzed, or frozen.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator set to 37°C
Reagents:
• Lysis buffer (e.g., 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline)
• Substrate solutions for specific enzymes (e.g., 4-
methylumbelliferyl substrates)
• Stop solution (e.g., glycine buffer pH 10.4)
• Leukocyte isolation medium (e.g., Ficoll-Paque)
Supplies:
• ACD (yellow-top) tubes
• Microtubes
• Cuvettes or microplates
• Gloves and lab coats
4. PROCEDURE
A) Leukocyte Isolation:
1. Centrifuge blood sample at 400 x g for 20 minutes at room
temperature to separate plasma and cells.
2. Carefully remove the plasma layer and transfer to a separate
tube for potential further analysis.
3. Resuspend the cell pellet in PBS and overlay onto a Ficoll-
Paque gradient.
4. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature; do
not use the brake.
5. Collect the leukocyte band and wash with PBS by centrifuging
at 200 x g for 10 minutes.
6. Resuspend the leukocyte pellet in lysis buffer and incubate on
ice for 30 minutes.
7. Centrifuge lysate at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Transfer
the supernatant to a new tube.
B) Enzyme Assay:
1. Prepare substrate solution according to the enzyme being
measured (e.g., 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide for β-
glucuronidase).
2. Add equal volumes of leukocyte lysate and substrate solution to
cuvettes or wells of a microplate.
3. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C in the dark for 30
minutes.
4. Stop the reaction by adding an equal volume of stop solution.
5. Measure fluorescence with a spectrophotometer or fluorometer
(excitation 365 nm, emission 450 nm).
6. Compare fluorescence intensity to a standard curve using 4-
methylumbelliferone standards.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Verify the performance of all reagents and equipment before
starting the analysis.
• Record control and patient results in a logbook along with the
date and initials of the technologist.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate enzyme activity from the standard curve and express
results as nmol/ hour/ mg protein.
• File all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results as per laboratory quality guidelines.
• Report critical values immediately to the ordering physician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• β-Glucuronidase: Normal range (1.5-4.5 nmol/hr/mg protein)
• Reference intervals may vary between laboratories and must be
established based on local population data.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure leukocyte purity to avoid interference from platelets and
red blood cells.
• Enzyme activity may deteriorate if the temperature or transport
conditions are not maintained.
• Follow reagent storage instructions to maintain integrity.
