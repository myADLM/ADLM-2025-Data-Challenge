Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Lysosomal Storage Disease Gene Panel,
Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed procedure for
generating results for the Lysosomal Storage Disease Gene Panel.
This includes DNA extraction from the specimen, preparation for
sequencing, data analysis, and interpretation. The procedure ensures
consistent and reliable results by following standard methodologies
and quality control protocols.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of testing
for the Lysosomal Storage Disease Gene Panel in our CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for following the procedures
outlined in this SOP, including DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing, and initial data analysis. • Genetic Analysts: Responsible
for in-depth data analysis, variant calling, and interpretation. •
Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for overseeing all stages of the
procedure, ensuring compliance with the SOP, and resolving any
issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable: • Whole blood samples: Collected in EDTA
tubes, minimum volume 3 mL. • Buccal swabs: Properly collected
and stored to prevent degradation. • Dried blood spots: Collected on
standard filter paper and stored appropriately.
Unacceptable: • Samples with insufficient volume. • Specimens
arriving in the laboratory more than 72 hours after collection without
proper cold storage. • Specimens with labels that are incomplete or
illegible.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit) •
Quantification apparatus (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer) • Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) • Library
preparation kits (e.g., Illumina DNA Prep) • PCR reagents and
thermal cycler • Bioinformatics software for analysis (e.g., GATK,
VarSeq)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction using the designated DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify DNA using Qubit Fluorometer.
3. Assess DNA quality by running a small aliquot on an agarose
gel.
B. Library Preparation
1. Normalize the DNA concentration to the required input for the
library preparation protocol.
2. Prepare DNA libraries using the library preparation kit following
the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Perform a quality check and quantify the library using
appropriate methods (e.g., Qubit, Bioanalyzer).
4. Pool the libraries in equimolar ratios for sequencing.
C. Sequencing
1. Load the pooled libraries onto the sequencing platform as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Run the appropriate sequencing protocol for the Lysosomal
Storage Disease Gene Panel.
D. Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics workstation
securely.
2. Perform quality control checks on raw sequencing data using
software like FastQC.
3. Align reads to the human reference genome using a tool like
BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner).
4. Perform variant calling using GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit).
5. Annotate variants using a comprehensive database (e.g.,
ClinVar, dbSNP).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples. •
Ensure compliance with internal quality control standards at every
significant step. • Perform periodic proficiency testing to validate
analytical competencies. • Use quality metrics to evaluate each
sequencing run; runs failing quality control must be repeated.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Interpretation
1. Assess the significance of identified variants with available
bioinformatics tools and databases.
2. Correlate variants with the clinical data provided using
established guidelines (e.g., ACMG guidelines).
B. Documentation
1. Document all findings and interpretations accurately in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Prepare the genetic report including operator initials, date,
specimen ID, methodologies used, variants found, and their
interpretations.
C. Verification
1. Reviewed and verified results by the genetic analyst and a
laboratory director before releasing the report to ensure
accuracy and completeness.
2. Follow up with appropriate actions if any critical variants or
unexpected findings are identified.
