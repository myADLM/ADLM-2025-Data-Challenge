Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase: Lysosomal Storage
Disorders, Six-Enzyme Panel, Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be taken for the analysis of the
six-enzyme panel for lysosomal storage disorders using leukocyte
specimens. The purpose is to ensure accurate, reproducible, and
efficient results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to perform the analytical procedures. All deviations, discrepancies, or
deficiencies must be immediately brought to the attention of the
laboratory supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Lysosomal Storage Disorders: Genetic disorders caused by enzyme
deficiencies resulting in the accumulation of substrates within
lysosomes.
Six-Enzyme Panel: Enzyme assays performed to screen for specific
lysosomal storage disorders. The six enzymes typically assayed are
alpha-glucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-
galactosidase, arylsulfatase B, and sphingomyelinase.
Leukocytes: White blood cells isolated from the patient's blood used
for enzyme assays.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Verify sample integrity: Ensure leukocyte samples are properly
stored at -80°C and have not thawed during transport.
2. Thaw leukocyte samples on ice.
3. Count leukocytes using an automated cell counter to ensure
adequate cell concentration (target: 1-5x10^6 leukocytes).
B) Enzyme Assay Preparation:
1. Prepare assay buffers and enzyme substrates according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Prepare a calibration curve by serial dilution of enzyme
standards.
3. Set up a 96-well plate, assigning wells for blank, control, patient
samples, and standards.
4. Add appropriate buffer to all wells followed by the addition of
enzyme substrate.
C) Enzyme Assay Procedure:
1. Lyse leukocytes by sonication or use of lysis buffer, followed by
centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Collect
supernatant.
2. Add leukocyte lysate to the corresponding wells on the plate.
3. Initiate the reaction by adding enzyme-specific substrates.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended time (typically
30-60 minutes).
5. Stop the reaction by adding stopping buffer (consult the
enzyme-specific protocol).
D) Measurement:
1. Measure the reaction product using a microplate reader at the
appropriate wavelength (commonly 405 or 450 nm).
2. Use the calibration curve to determine enzyme activity in the
patient samples. Calculate enzyme activity as nmol product
formed per hour per mg of protein.
E) Quality Control:
1. Perform quality controls using known positive and negative
controls.
2. Include blank wells to account for background absorbance.
3. Record all results, including the date, time, and initials of the
technologist performing the assay.
F) Data Analysis:
1. Ensure assay performance within predefined quality control
limits.
2. Verify calibration curve linearity and suitability.
3. Calculated enzyme activities should fall within established
reference ranges for the respective enzyme.
G) Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
2. Provide interpretive comments based on enzyme activity
relative to reference ranges.
3. Notify clinical staff of critical values or abnormal findings as per
lab protocol.
H) Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
1. If controls fall outside of acceptable ranges, review procedures
and reagents, and repeat assay if necessary.
2. Report persistent issues to the laboratory supervisor for further
investigation and remediation.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Enzyme activities are expressed in nmol/hour/mg protein. Reference
intervals are provided based on established population studies (add
specific values per enzyme tested).
