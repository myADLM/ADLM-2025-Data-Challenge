Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for LYSOZYME, IGE, and SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase in
generating results for Lysozyme, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The goal is to
ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
ELISA assays for Lysozyme, IgE, and Serum. All specimens must
have already been collected, received, and accessioned according to
the laboratory's protocols.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and for
troubleshooting any deviations from protocol.
• Quality Control staff are responsible for overseeing proper
execution of quality control checks.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimens:
◦ Lysozyme: Serum or plasma.
◦ IgE: Serum or plasma.
◦ Serum: Serum.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C if they are to be tested within 72
hours.
◦ For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA kits for Lysozyme, IgE, and Serum.
• Micropipettes and tips (100 µL, 200 µL, 1000 µL).
• Plate reader compatible with the ELISA kits.
• Multichannel pipettes.
• ELISA microplates.
• Wash buffer.
• Substrate reagent.
• Stop solution.
• Standards and controls.
• Laboratory timer.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents, standards, and controls according to
the manufacturer's instructions provided in the ELISA kits.
2. Equipment Calibration:
◦ Ensure that the plate reader and pipettes are calibrated and
functioning properly.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix gently.
Centrifuge all samples at 1500xg for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
B. Lysozyme ELISA Assay
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to designated
wells in the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
3. Wash the plate three times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well and incubate for
1 hour at room temperature.
5. Wash the plate as above.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate for
20 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
7. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well and read the plate at
450 nm within 30 minutes.
C. IgE ELISA Assay
1. Add 50 µL of standards, controls, and samples to designated
wells in the ELISA plate.
2. Add 50 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. Mix by gently
tapping the plate.
3. Incubate the plate for 2 hours at room temperature.
4. Wash the plate five times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate for
10-20 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
6. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well and read the plate at
450 nm within 30 minutes.
D. Serum ELISA Assay
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to designated
wells in the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
3. Wash the plate three times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well and incubate for
1 hour at 37°C.
5. Wash the plate as above.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate for
15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
7. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well and read the plate at
450 nm within 30 minutes.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal QC:
◦ Analyze quality control samples with each assay to validate
the test run. Ensure that the results fall within the pre-
defined acceptable range.
2. Calibration:
◦ Verify calibration using standard samples provided in the kit
and ensure readings match expected values.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate concentrations from standard curves generated by
plotting absorbance against known concentrations using
appropriate software.
2. Review:
◦ Technologists must manually review and verify results for
accuracy.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report finalized results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) along with any caveats regarding sample or
test integrity.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific ELISA kit insert for individual test limitations,
potential interferences and specific handling requirements.
