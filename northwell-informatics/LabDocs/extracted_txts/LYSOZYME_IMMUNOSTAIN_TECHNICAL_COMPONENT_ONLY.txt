SOP: LYSOZYME IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT
ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidelines for the technical component only
of performing a lysozyme immunostain. The stain is used to identify
lysozyme (muramidase) in tissue sections, assisting in the diagnosis
of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, certain histiocytic neoplasms,
and other conditions where increased lysozyme is suspected.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel in the laboratory responsible
for the preparation, staining, and evaluation of tissue sections for
lysozyme immunostain.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the staining procedure accurately and ensure that
appropriate quality control and documentation practices are followed.
All personnel must be trained and familiar with this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Lysozyme: Enzyme that is part of the innate immune system and
acts to break down bacterial cell walls.
• Immunostain: A staining technique used to detect the presence
and location of specific proteins or antigens in tissue sections.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections.
• Slides should be adequately labeled with patient identifiers to
avoid any mix-up during the staining process.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunostainer (automated or manual system)
• Lysozyme primary antibody (see manufacturer guidelines for
appropriate dilutions)
• Detection system (e.g., biotin-streptavidin, polymer-based
system)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB (diaminobenzidine))
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Xylene and graded ethanol for deparaffinizing
• Wash buffer (e.g., PBS - Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Mounting media
• Glass slides and cover slips
• Positive and negative control tissue sections
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Sectioning
1. Cut 3-5 µm sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Mount the sections on charged glass slides.
3. Bake the slides at 60°C for one hour or overnight at 37°C to
ensure adherence of sections.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by incubating in xylene for 2-3 changes, 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 change, 5 minutes.
◦ 70% ethanol, 1 change, 5 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a heat-induced epitope retrieval
method:
◦ Immerse slides in a retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH
6.0 or Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0).
◦ Heat in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath
according to specific antibody manufacturer
recommendations.
◦ Allow slides to cool in the buffer to room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer (PBS) for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining
1. Apply peroxidase block if necessary; incubate for 10 minutes to
quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse in wash buffer.
3. Incubate slides with lysozyme primary antibody at the
appropriate dilution:
◦ Apply 100-200 µL of diluted primary antibody to each
section.
◦ Incubate according to manufacturer recommendations,
typically 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in wash buffer for 5 minutes, 2 changes.
5. Apply the secondary antibody/detection reagents according to
the system used (e.g., biotin-streptavidin, polymer-based
system):
◦ Incubate as directed by the manufacturer.
◦ Rinse in wash buffer.
6. Develop color with DAB or other suitable chromogen:
◦ Incubate for 5-10 minutes or until desired color intensity
develops.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
7. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
8. Rinse in distilled water, dehydrate through graded ethanols,
95% and 100%.
9. Clear slides in xylene, 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
E. Mounting
1. Apply mounting media and cover slip.
2. Allow slides to dry.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive control: Ensure that staining is observed in expected
tissue elements (e.g., Paneth cells in small intestine, some
myeloid cells).
• Negative control: Omit primary antibody on a separate section to
ensure specificity.
• Document all quality control measures in the appropriate logs.
9. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• This procedure covers the technical component only. Slides are to
be evaluated by a qualified pathologist for interpretation of
staining results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Technologists should ensure that all slides are labeled and
grouped with appropriate controls before providing them to
pathologists for review.
11. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow institutional safety guidelines for handling reagents and
disposal of waste.
• Dispose of used reagents, slides, and tissues according to
biohazard regulations.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's guidelines for lysozyme antibody and detection
system.
• Current laboratory best practices and regulatory requirements.
13. NOTES
• This procedure is subject to periodic review and updates based
on advancements in methodology or changes in regulatory
guidelines.
