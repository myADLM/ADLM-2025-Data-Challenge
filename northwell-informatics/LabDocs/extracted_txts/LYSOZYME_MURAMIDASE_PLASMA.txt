Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
and verifying results for Lysozyme (Muramidase), Plasma in the
clinical laboratory.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP and ensure that all procedures
concerning analytical testing for Lysozyme (Muramidase) are
performed correctly and documented appropriately. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for overseeing accuracy and precision
compliance and for addressing any irregularities.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
◦ Plasma collected in a Lithium Heparin or EDTA
anticoagulant tube.
◦ Minimum Volume: 1 mL.
Handling and Stability:
◦ Following collection, the sample should be mixed by
inversion 8-10 times to prevent clotting.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma, then transfer plasma to a clean and
appropriately labeled aliquot tube.
◦ Store plasma at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Grossly hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
◦ Specimens that are not properly labeled or with collection
exceeding stability limits.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
◦ Automatic or semi-automatic Lysozyme immunoassay
platform.
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge.
◦ Micropipettes with disposable tips.
◦ Laboratory refrigerator and freezer.
Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Lysozyme (Muramidase) test kit (includes standards,
controls, and reagents).
◦ Calibration control materials (low, medium, high).
◦ Quality control materials appropriate for the assay.
◦ Disposable gloves, lab coats, eye protection, and other
personal protective equipment (PPE).
3. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the assay system following the manufacturer's
instructions using the standards provided in the Lysozyme
test kit.
◦ Document calibration results in appropriate logs and verify
curve acceptability.
◦ Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples each day of testing—one at the
beginning of the run (level 1) and one at the end (level 2).
◦ Blinded controls may also be included intermittently.
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable limits, investigate,
correct issues, and re-run controls before proceeding with
patient testing.
4. PROCEDURE
◦ Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, controls, and samples to equilibrate
to room temperature before use.
2. Mix reagents and controls as per the package insert
instructions.
◦ Assay Steps:
1. Prepare the reaction wells/plate as described by the kit
insert.
2. Add appropriate volumes of standards, quality control
material, and patient plasma specimens to the
designated wells.
3. Follow the sequence of reagent additions (e.g.,
antibodies, substrates) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Incubate according to the specified time and
temperature conditions.
5. Measure the absorbance or relevant signal using the
appropriate settings for the assay.
◦ Calculations:
1. Obtain absorbance values for standards, controls, and
patient specimens.
2. Construct a standard curve and calculate the
concentrations of samples by interpolation from this
curve.
3. Document all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS), and cross-verify with manual logs.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted and must be reviewed
by the technologist for accuracy.
◦ Verify and document all results in the LIS.
◦ Report findings according to site-specific guidelines.
◦ Critical results or results that markedly differ from historical
values should be flagged and promptly reviewed.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Consult the latest laboratory reference ranges made
available by the kit manufacturer or based on laboratory
validation:
◦ Typical Reference Interval: 5-15 µg/mL (this may vary and
should be verified with current controls and standards).
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Interpretation of results should take into account the
patient’s clinical context.
◦ Assay Limitations: False results may occur due to interfering
substances, technical errors, or improper sample handling.
◦ Investigate unexpected results (e.g., outside reference
range) by reviewing QC data, recalibrating, and possibly
repeating the assay.
8. MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE
◦ Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for routine maintenance
and troubleshooting of analytical equipment.
◦ Ensure recording all preventive maintain data in the
equipment log.
◦ Strict adherence to all safety protocols, proper PPE use
while handling biological specimens, reagents, and
equipment.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
◦ Retain calibration records, QC logs, patient reports, reagent
lot numbers, and all troubleshooting records per laboratory
protocol.
◦ Maintain equipment maintenance logs as per laboratory
policy.
10. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for the
Lysozyme (Muramidase) test kit.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
◦ Laboratory Quality Management System documentation.
This SOP is maintained under the authority of the Laboratory Director
and shall be reviewed annually or as necessary due to updates in
testing protocols or regulatory guidelines.
