Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase: MA2 Antibody by
ELISA, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the detection and
quantification of MA2 Antibody in serum samples using the Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. This protocol ensures
that laboratory personnel follow standardized steps to achieve
accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to carry
out this procedure according to the specified protocol and to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1. Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collect blood in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot, then centrifuge for 10-15 minutes at
2000-3000 RPM to obtain serum.
• Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if testing will be conducted within 48 hours.
For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
2.2. Specimen Rejection Criteria:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens not properly labeled or stored.
• Specimens received in unapproved collection tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader (capable of reading at 450 nm)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Multichannel pipette (optional)
• MA2 Antibody ELISA Kit (includes microplate, standards, controls,
buffers, conjugate, substrate, and wash solution)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Timer
• Absorbent paper
• Plate shaker (optional)
• Laboratory gloves and personal protective equipment
1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, specimens, and controls to room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
• Mix all reagents gently to avoid foaming.
• Prepare wash buffer according to kit instructions if needed.
4.2. Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microplate with appropriate labels for standards,
controls, and patient specimens.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum samples
to the designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour, with gentle
shaking if available.
4. Aspirate the contents of each well, then wash the wells 3 times
with 300 µL of wash buffer. Ensure complete removal of liquid
at each step.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes, with
gentle shaking if available.
7. Aspirate and wash the wells 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes. Avoid prolonged exposure to light.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an ELISA
microplate reader within 15 minutes of adding stop solution.
12. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
5.1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
value (Y-axis) against the corresponding concentration (X-axis) of
each standard. 5.2. Determine the concentration of MA2 Antibody in
patient samples by interpolating their mean absorbance values from
the standard curve. 5.3. Report results in appropriate units, as
specified by the kit manufacturer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1. Use both positive and negative controls provided in the kit to
ensure assay performance. 6.2. Run controls with each assay batch.
The assay is valid if control values fall within the expected range. 6.3.
Document quality control results and take corrective action if controls
are out of range. Repeat the assay if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1. Review and verify all results before reporting. 7.2. Enter results
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) according to laboratory
protocols. 7.3. Any critical values or abnormal results should be
immediately reported to the requesting physician or appropriate
clinical personnel per laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
8.1. This assay is designed for use with human serum samples only.
8.2. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with
assay performance and produce inaccurate results. 8.3. The
diagnostic interpretations of results should be done in conjunction
with clinical findings and other diagnostic procedures.
