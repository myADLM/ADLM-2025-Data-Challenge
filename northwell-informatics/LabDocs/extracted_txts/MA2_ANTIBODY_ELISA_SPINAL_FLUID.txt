Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Protocol for Analysis of Spinal Fluid using MA2 Antibody ELISA
1. PURPOSE: This procedure outlines the detailed steps for the
analysis of spinal fluid using the MA2 antibody ELISA technique in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. The goal is to ensure accurate and
reproducible results through standardized processes.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for performing MA2 antibody ELISA on spinal fluid
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis as per the described procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed and proper documentation is maintained.
• All personnel must report any deviations or unexpected results to
the laboratory supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred: Minimum 1.0 mL of spinal fluid.
• The specimen should be clear and free of any particulate matter.
• Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately
and processed within 24 hours of collection. If longer storage is
necessary, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• ELISA microplate washer
• MA2 antibody ELISA kit (including pre-coated microplates,
calibrators, controls, conjugate, substrate, and wash solution)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Waste container with appropriate disinfectant solution
• Timer
• Disposable gloves
• Calibration and control materials
6. PROCEDURE:
Reagent Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare wash solution according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Prepare any other reagents as described in the ELISA kit insert.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen spinal fluid specimens at room temperature before
analysis.
2. Gently mix each sample by inversion before pipetting.
Assay Procedure:
1. Securely place the microplate in the designated holder.
2. Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples into
appropriate wells.
3. Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate reagent into each well.
4. Gently tap the plate to mix the contents and cover to prevent
evaporation.
5. Incubate the microplate at room temperature (18-25°C) for 60
minutes.
6. Following incubation, carefully wash the microplate as follows:
◦ Aspirate the contents of each well.
◦ Fill each well with at least 300 µL of wash solution and
aspirate. Repeat this step for a total of 5 washes.
◦ After the last wash, invert the plate and gently tap on
absorbent paper to remove any residual wash solution.
7. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution into each well.
8. Incubate the microplate at room temperature for 15-30 minutes
(specific time as per kit protocol) in the dark.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
10. Immediately read the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set to 450 nm.
Quality Control:
1. Run internal controls with every batch of tests to ensure assay
integrity.
2. Results obtained from controls should be within the established
ranges. Any deviations must be investigated, and appropriate
corrective actions must be taken before proceeding with sample
analyses.
3. Document all quality control results accordingly.
7. CALCULATION AND REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance value for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean OD for each
standard versus the concentration and determine the
concentration of the samples from the standard curve.
3. Report results in units defined by the ELISA kit manufacturer,
ensuring that the generated data is consistent and valid.
4. Any results falling outside of the reference intervals or
presenting anomalies must be reviewed by a laboratory
supervisor before final reporting.
5. Results are verified and entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS) following established data entry guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals will be provided in the ELISA kit insert. Report
results outside of this range and note as abnormal.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay.
• High levels of endogenous antibodies or other specific binding
substances in patient samples can interfere with immunoassay-
based methods.
