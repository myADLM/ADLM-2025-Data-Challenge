Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Macadamia Nut, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of Macadamia Nut-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protocol
ensures the accuracy and reliability of the test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
All laboratory personnel performing the test are responsible for
adhering to this SOP, ensuring quality control, and reporting results
accurately. The supervisor is responsible for overseeing the process
and addressing any issues that may affect the test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain tube without additives.
• Minimum volume of 1 mL serum is required for the assay.
• Specimen should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7
days of collection. For longer storage, serum can be frozen at
-20°C.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen with hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimen with unidentified collection details or improper storage
conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit for Macadamia Nut-specific IgE (commercially available)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader with a filter for 450 nm
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Lab timer
• Serum samples
• Calibrators and controls provided with the ELISA kit
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation: Follow the instruction manual of the
ELISA kit for preparing reagents. Ensure all reagents are at
room temperature before use.
2. Equipment Calibration: Calibrate micropipettes and plate
reader according to manufacturer’s instructions. Check
incubator temperature regularly.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
◦ Vortex gently to mix.
◦ Centrifuge any samples with visible particulate matter at
3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for calibrators, controls, and patient samples
as per the ELISA kit layout.
◦ Fill each well with 100 μL of dilution buffer provided in the
kit.
3. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of serum sample to designated wells.
◦ Add 100 μL of calibrators and controls to their respective
wells.
4. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for the duration
specified in the kit manual (usually 1 hour).
5. Washing:
◦ Wash each well with the wash buffer four to five times using
the wash protocol detailed in the ELISA kit.
6. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of the detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Signal Development:
◦ Add 100 μL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark for the time specified in the kit manual
(usually 15-30 minutes).
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
9. Reading Results:
◦ Read the plate at 450 nm using the plate reader.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Control Evaluation:
◦ Ensure controls are within the expected range as provided
by the manufacturer of the ELISA kit. Repeat the assay if
controls fail.
2. Data Validation:
◦ Validate results against calibration curves.
◦ Review data for anomalies and repeat questionable
samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure correct entry of patient ID, sample ID, and test
results.
2. Result Review:
◦ Verify results according to laboratory reporting standards.
◦ Flag any critical values (if applicable) and notify the relevant
medical personnel promptly.
