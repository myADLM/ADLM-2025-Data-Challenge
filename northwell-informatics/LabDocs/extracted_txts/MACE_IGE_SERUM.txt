Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MACE, IGE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for generating
and verifying results for MACE (Mycobacteria Avium Complex
Enzyme-linked immunoassay), IGE (Immunoglobulin E), and serum
tests. This includes the analytical steps from specimen preparation to
result reporting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the testing,
adhering to quality control protocols, and ensuring accurate result
documentation. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process, managing any deviations, and ensuring compliance with this
SOP.
1. DEFINITION
• MACE: Enzyme-linked immunoassay used to detect antigens of
Mycobacterium avium complex.
• IGE: Quantitative measurement of Immunoglobulin E in serum.
• SERUM: General reference to serum testing, including
electrolytes, liver function tests, and other biochemical assays.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzers (specific to MACE, IGE, and serum assays)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Suitable reaction tubes and wells
• Reagent kits specific to each test
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. General Sample Preparation
1. Label Verification: Ensure all samples are correctly labeled
with patient information.
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum.
3. Aliquoting: Aliquot appropriate volumes of serum for each
specific test while minimizing exposure to air to avoid
contamination.
B. MACE Assay Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents as indicated in the manufacturer's
insert.
◦ Calibrate the analyzer as per the manufacturer's
recommendations.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Load reagents, controls, and serum samples onto the
analyzer.
◦ Initiate the enzyme-linked immunoassay program specific to
MACE.
3. Incubation:
◦ Follow the specified incubation times and temperatures as
outlined in the assay kit.
◦ Ensure no deviations from the recommended protocol.
4. Reading and Results:
◦ After the assay completion, analyze the results using the
dedicated software.
◦ Evaluate the quality control results to ensure validity.
C. IGE Assay Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the IGE-specific reagents as per the kit instructions.
◦ Perform necessary calibrations as instructed.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Load reagents, controls, and serum samples into the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Select the IGE assay protocol on the analyzer.
3. Incubation and Washing:
◦ Follow the recommended incubation times.
◦ Perform the washing steps as per the kit’s instructions to
avoid any nonspecific binding.
4. Reading and Results:
◦ Measure and record the IGE levels.
◦ Compare against control results to ensure assay validity.
D. General Serum Testing Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents for specific serum tests (e.g.,
electrolytes) are ready and within expiry dates.
◦ Calibrate the analyzer appropriately.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
◦ Select appropriate protocols for the specific serum tests
being performed.
3. Analysis:
◦ Allow the analyzer to complete the assays following
programmed protocols.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or deviations.
4. Reading and Results:
◦ Verify results using internal quality control data.
◦ Investigate and resolve any out-of-range controls before
validating patient results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples at the beginning of the testing cycle, after
every 20 patient samples, and at the end of the cycle.
◦ Document QC results and take corrective actions if results
fall outside the acceptable range.
7. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
8. RESULT REPORTING
9. Verification:
◦ Review all results for accuracy and consistency before
reporting.
◦ Compare patient results with historical data for plausibility.
10. Documentation:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure all QC data and any deviations or corrective actions
are documented.
11. Delivering Results:
◦ Transmit final verified results to the electronic medical
record (EMR) or provide printed reports for physician review.
