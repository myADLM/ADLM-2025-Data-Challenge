1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and efficient
analysis and reporting of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum
samples using the MACKEREL automated analyzer.
1. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/acceptable: - 5 mL serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) - Serum specimens should be stored and
transported at 2-8°C and should arrive at the laboratory within
48 hours of collection.
Unacceptable: - Specimens arriving at the laboratory greater
than 48 hours after collection. - Specimens collected in tubes
containing anticoagulants such as EDTA or citrate.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
MACKEREL Automated Analyzer IgE reagent kits Calibrators
and controls specific to IgE analysis Serum separator tubes
(SST) Pipettes and tips Timer Personal protective equipment
(PPE) Laboratory Information System (LIS)
3. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation: 1. Verify the specimen type, collection date, and
storage conditions. 2. Allow the serum specimen to come to
room temperature if it has been refrigerated. 3. Using a clean
pipette, transfer the serum specimen to the appropriate sample
container for the MACKEREL analyzer. 4. Label the sample
container with the patient’s identification details and the specific
test required.
B) Analysis: 1. Calibrate the MACKEREL analyzer using the
IgE-specific calibrators according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Run quality control (QC) checks using the provided IgE
controls to ensure the analyzer is functioning correctly. -
Document QC results and take corrective action if controls are
outside acceptable limits. 3. Load the serum specimens into the
MACKEREL analyzer according to the machine’s operating
protocol. 4. Initiate the IgE analysis run and monitor the
analyzer for any error messages. 5. Once the analysis is
complete, review the results on the MACKEREL display,
ensuring there are no error codes or messages.
C) Reporting: 1. Verify and validate the IgE results using the
laboratory’s LIS. 2. Ensure that critical values and any
discrepancies are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist or supervisor. 3. Document and report the results
in the patient's medical record as per site-specific guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
Material: - Calibrators specific to the MACKEREL IgE assay -
Liquid controls from the reagent kit
Procedure: 1. Perform QC checks with every new reagent kit
and as per laboratory schedule (e.g., daily, weekly). 2. Record
QC results and take appropriate corrective action if QC results
are out of acceptable limits. 3. Periodically compare patient
results with other methods or instruments to ensure accuracy.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. Document all results
in the LIS and notify the referring physician of any critical values
immediately.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
The normal reference interval for serum IgE is <100 IU/mL.
However, reference intervals can be age-specific and may vary.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the MACKEREL analyzer product insert and
manufacturer’s guidelines for limitations specific to the IgE
reagent pads and assay procedures.
8. REFERENCES:

guidelines for IgE assay procedures
9. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory technologists and
supervisors to ensure that this procedure is adhered to. Any
deviations or discrepancies should be documented and brought
to the attention of the designated supervisor.
