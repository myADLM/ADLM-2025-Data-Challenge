1. PURPOSE
To provide step-by-step instructions for the determination of
macroamylase presence and activity in serum specimens using
specific laboratory equipment and reagents, ensuring accurate and
reliable results. This SOP will cover the necessary procedures for
analysis, quality control, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
• All technologists performing the macroamylase test must follow
this SOP strictly.
• Supervisors must ensure that staff comply with this SOP and
address any issues related to the test methodology or results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Macroamylase: Complex form of amylase that exists in the serum
bound to proteins, usually immunoglobulins, making it too large to be
excreted by the kidneys.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample to separate the serum from the cells.
• Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for 7 days when stored at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes that do not provide a clear serum
separation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Immunoglobulin precipitation reagents
• Amylase reagent kit (including necessary buffers and substrates)
• Calibrators and quality control materials specific for amylase
activity
• Spectrophotometer capable of accurate readings of amylase
activity
• Necessary consumables such as test tubes, cuvettes, gloves, etc.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents
• Prepare all reagents following the manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibrators and quality control materials should be ready for use
at room temperature.
B. Immunoglobulin Precipitation
1. Pipette an equal volume (e.g., 500 µL) of serum and
immunoglobulin precipitation reagent into a labeled test tube.
2. Mix well and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove precipitates.
4. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new labeled tube for
amylase activity analysis.
C. Amylase Activity Determination
1. Pipette the required volume of supernatant and amylase
reagent into cuvettes according to the amylase reagent kit
instructions.
2. Mix well and incubate at 37°C for the specified time (usually 10
minutes).
3. Measure the absorbance of the reaction mixture using a
spectrophotometer at the appropriate wavelength for amylase
activity.
D. Calculation and Reporting
1. Calculate the amylase activity using the provided formula or
software associated with the amylase reagent kit.
2. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. If macroamylase is suspected (typically when total serum
amylase is elevated but urinary amylase is normal/low), report
the finding in the LIS and inform the requesting clinician.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials alongside patient specimens to
ensure the reliability of results.
• Use at least two levels of control (normal and abnormal) for each
batch of tests.
• Record all QC data in the QC log book.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
resolve any issues before reporting patient results.
1. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
• The centrifuge, pipettes, incubator, and spectrophotometer should
be maintained according to the manufacturers' schedules and
procedures.
• Regular calibration and preventive maintenance should be
documented.
• Any malfunction should be reported and repaired immediately.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and lab
coats when handling biological specimens.
• Handle and dispose of all reagents and samples in accordance
with the laboratory’s biosafety protocols.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any updates or revisions to this SOP, including the date
and nature of the changes.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff can ensure the accurate and
precise determination of macroamylase in patient serum samples,
contributing to correct clinical diagnosis and treatment.
