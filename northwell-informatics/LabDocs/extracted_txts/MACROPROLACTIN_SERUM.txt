1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides guidelines to accurately and efficiently perform
the analysis of macroprolactin in serum to ensure reliable and
reproducible results. Proper identification and quantification of
macroprolactin are critical for diagnosis and management of
hyperprolactinemia.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top
tube. After clotting, centrifuge the sample to separate serum.
Pre-analytical Considerations:
• Ensure specimens are free from hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus
as these can interfere with analysis.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if not assayed immediately. Specimens
are stable for up to 72 hours when stored properly.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory with no collection date/time
indicated.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or beyond the
stability period.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Macroprolactin assay kit
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Measuring device (e.g., automated analyzer, immunoassay
analyzer)
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Verify the patient information and specimen details.
2. Centrifuge the blood collection tubes to obtain serum after clot
formation (at least 30 minutes post-collection).
B) Precipitation with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)
1. Mix equal volumes of serum (500 µL) with polyethylene glycol
(PEG) solution (25% w/v).
2. Vortex the mixture and incubate at room temperature for 10
minutes.
3. Centrifuge the mixture at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes to separate
precipitated macroprolactin.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube. This supernatant
contains monomeric prolactin, which will be quantified.
C) Measurement of Prolactin Levels
1. Use the macroprolactin assay kit according to manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of the supernatant into the assay
wells, as per assay protocol.
3. Run the assay in the immunoassay analyzer.
4. Record the prolactin levels from the supernatant.
D) Calculating Macroprolactin Component
1. Measure prolactin concentration in the original serum sample
using the same assay kit/protocol.
2. Compare prolactin levels in the original serum and supernatant.
3. Calculate percentage recovery using the formula: Recovery (%)
= (Prolactin in Supernatant / Prolactin in Original Serum) × 100
4. If recovery is <40%, significant macroprolactin presence is
indicated.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use control samples included with the assay kit to ensure
procedural accuracy.
• Ensure calibration and maintenance of assay analyzers.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and all QC results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented and reported according to site-
specific guidelines.
• Include the serum prolactin level, prolactin level after PEG
precipitation, and the calculated percentage recovery.
• Interpret findings. Report significant macroprolactin presence if
recovery percentage is <40%.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Prolactin (monomeric) concentration in serum less than 20 μg/L.
• Recovery rate <40% indicates significant macroprolactin
presence.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may affect results.
• Proper handling and storage of specimens are crucial.
• Interference or cross-reactivity of reagents must be monitored as
per manufacturer’s instructions.

All laboratory personnel must be trained in this SOP and demonstrate
competency before independently analyzing macroprolactin in serum
samples.
