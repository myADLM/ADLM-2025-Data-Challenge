Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for MACRO/MICROTHROMBOCYTOPENIA
GENE PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of macro/
microthrombocytopenia gene panel using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technology to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all molecular diagnostics personnel
performing next-generation sequencing for the detection of mutations
associated with macrothrombocytopenia and microthrombocytopenia.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the execution of
the tasks outlined in this SOP, including the preparation of samples,
sequencing, data analysis, and reporting of results. Supervisors must
ensure that all staff are trained and competent before performing the
procedure.
4. SPECIMENS
• Preferred specimens: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood,
minimum volume 3 mL.
• Acceptable alternatives: Buccal swabs, cell lysates, or other DNA-
containing specimens.
• For blood samples: Must be received within 48 hours of collection
and stored at 2-8°C.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, HiSeq)
• DNA Extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• Quantification and quality control reagents (e.g., Qubit
Fluorometer, Bioanalyzer)
• NGS library preparation kits (specific for the targeted gene panel)
• PCR reagents
• Bioinformatics analysis software (e.g., BaseSpace, Galaxy)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction from the specimen using the
designated DNA extraction kit following manufacturer
instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA using the Qubit Fluorometer and assess
quality using Bioanalyzer.
3. Proceed with samples that meet the purity requirements (A260/
A280 between 1.8-2.0) and sufficient quantity as per kit
protocol.
B. Library Preparation
1. Prepare NGS library using the appropriate library preparation
kit specific for the macro/microthrombocytopenia gene panel.
2. Amplify the target regions via PCR following the PCR protocol
provided by the kit manufacturer.
3. Perform clean-up of PCR products using a purification method
(e.g. magnetic beads).
4. Quantify the prepared library and validate library size/quality
using Bioanalyzer.
C. Sequencing
1. Normalize and pool the libraries as per standard operating
concentrations.
2. Load the pooled library onto the NGS platform and set up the
sequencing run.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality metrics and troubleshoot
any issues as they arise.
D. Data Analysis
1. Transfer sequencing data to the designated bioinformatics
analysis software.
2. Perform primary analysis (base calling, demultiplexing) followed
by alignment to the reference genome.
3. Conduct variant calling to identify potential mutations in the
gene panel.
4. Annotate variants using the bioinformatics pipeline to assign
clinical significance.
E. Reporting
1. Verify the data for accuracy by reviewing quality control metrics,
including coverage depth and variant quality scores.
2. Interpret the results in the context of the patient’s clinical
information.
3. Compile the final report, detailing the detected mutations (if
any) with their clinical relevance.
4. Have the final report reviewed and approved by a senior clinical
molecular geneticist or equivalent authority.
5. Transmit the final report to the ordering clinician securely.
7. QUALITY CONTROL & INSTRUMENT MAINTENANCE
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
validity of the results.
• Adhere to instrument maintenance schedules and perform regular
calibration and performance checks.
• Follow manufacturer guidelines for reagent and equipment use to
ensure optimal functioning.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction kit, library
preparation kit, and NGS platform.
• Current literature and clinical guidelines for the interpretation of
macro/microthrombocytopenia genetic variants.
9. REVISION HISTORY
Document all revisions with dates and descriptions of changes made
to the SOP.
This protocol establishes a detailed workflow from DNA extraction to
the final reporting of results for the macro/microthrombocytopenia
gene panel via next-generation sequencing, ensuring comprehensive
analysis and accurate diagnostics.
