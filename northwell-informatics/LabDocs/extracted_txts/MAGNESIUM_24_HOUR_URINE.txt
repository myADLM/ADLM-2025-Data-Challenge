Protocol for Analytical Phase: MAGNESIUM, 24-HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the standard operating procedure for measuring the
magnesium concentration in a 24-hour urine collection.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff is responsible for performing the analysis
and documenting the results. It is the responsibility of supervisors
and laboratory management to ensure the procedure is performed
correctly and validated.
2. DEFINITION:
Magnesium concentration in 24-hour urine captures the amount of
magnesium excreted by the body over a 24-hour period, aiding in the
assessment of magnesium metabolism and kidney function.
3. PROCEDURE:
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) or equivalent, as needed
• Calibrated Laboratory Balance
• Quantitative volumetric glassware
• Centrifuge
• Water bath (for dilutions, if necessary)
Reagents and Supplies:
• Standard magnesium solution
• Deionized water
• Calibration standards
• Quality control samples
• Urine containers
• Collection instructions for patients
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
Collection:
• Patient must collect all urine over a 24-hour period into a clean,
appropriately labeled container.
• Refrigerate urine during collection period.
Transport and Storage:
• Ensure urine is stored refrigerated and transported promptly to
the laboratory.
• Urine volume must be recorded upon receipt.
Preparation for Analysis:
1. Volume Measurement:
• Measure and record total volume of the 24-hour collected urine
accurately.
2. Mixing:
• Homogenize the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly to ensure
uniform sample distribution.
3. Aliquoting:
• Aliquot an appropriate volume for analysis based on the
instrument used.
4. Dilution:
• Dilute the urine sample, if necessary, to fall within the detectable
range of the analytical instrument. Typically, dilution may be
performed using deionized water.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform instrument calibration using standard magnesium
solutions before analyzing patient samples.
2. Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens to
ensure accuracy of results. These should include both positive
and negative controls.
3. Record all calibration and QC data along with patient results.
Analyzer Operation:
ICP-MS Procedure:
1. Set up the ICP-MS according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load calibration standards, QC samples and patient samples.
3. Initiate the run sequence, ensuring the instrument follows the
correct calibration curve.
4. Monitor the instrument for any errors and validate precision and
accuracy of results.
AAS Procedure (if ICP-MS is unavailable):
1. Prepare instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Aspirate diluted urine sample and standard solutions, taking
care to handle samples properly to avoid contamination.
3. Record absorbance and calculate magnesium concentration
using calibration standards.
Result Calculation:
1. Total Magnesium (mg / 24 hours) = Magnesium concentration
(mg/mL) x Urine volume (mL)
2. Ensure all calculations are performed accurately and results
documented appropriately.
Reporting Results:
1. Update all patient results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results according to laboratory standards.
3. Provide results to the ordering physician with relevant
annotations based on findings.
Reference Intervals:
Typically, magnesium excreted in a 24-hour urine collection for adults
ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 mmol or 36 to 60 mg, but reference intervals
may vary by laboratory and patient context. Always ensure reference
intervals are current and specific to the method used.
Quality Control:
1. Daily: Run QC samples with each batch of patient specimens.
2. Monthly: Perform correlation studies with an external reference
laboratory, if available, or analyze proficiency testing samples.
3. Traceability: Ensure all equipment and reagents used are
validated and have traceable certification.
Method Limitations:
**1. Food and medication can influence urine magnesium levels.
Ensure patient compliance with pre-collection instructions. **2.
Potential interference by other elements in complex matrices. Apply
correction algorithms and validation techniques.
References: Ensure all references to analytical techniques,
equipment manuals, and reagent certificates are kept current within
the laboratory SOP manuals.
I have crafted the protocol to align with SOP standards, facilitating
accurate and seamless laboratory operations for Magnesium, 24-
Hour, Urine measurement. Changes can be accommodated based
on specific laboratory instruments.
