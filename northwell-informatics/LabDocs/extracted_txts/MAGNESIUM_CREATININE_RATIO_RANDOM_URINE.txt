Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Analytical Phase for
Generating Results: Magnesium/Creatinine Ratio, Random,
Urine
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reliable determination of the
Magnesium/Creatinine Ratio in random urine samples. This SOP
describes the methodology, quality control procedures, and reporting
standards for the urine Magnesium/Creatinine ratio analysis.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Magnesium/Creatinine ratio analysis in urine samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the test,
adhering to quality control measures, and ensuring accurate
documentation.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for reviewing results,
maintaining equipment, and ensuring adherence to SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Random urine sample.
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is not
performed immediately. Allow the sample to reach room
temperature before testing if refrigerated.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer capable of measuring Magnesium
and Creatinine.
• Reagents:
◦ Magnesium Color Reagent
◦ Creatinine Assay Reagent
• Controls:
◦ Magnesium Control Level 1 (Normal)
◦ Magnesium Control Level 2 (Abnormal)
◦ Creatinine Control Level 1 (Normal)
◦ Creatinine Control Level 2 (Abnormal)
• Calibrators:
◦ Multi-analyte Calibrator
• Urine containers and sterile cups
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
1. Vortex the urine sample thoroughly before analysis.
2. Ensure the sample is at room temperature.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Perform calibration of the chemistry analyzer using the multi-
analyte calibrator.
2. Run assay-specific controls for both Magnesium and Creatinine
to verify the calibration.
3. Load the urine sample onto the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Select the appropriate test codes for Magnesium and
Creatinine measurements.
5. Initiate the tests on the analyzer as per standard operating
procedures.
6. The analyzer will automatically measure and report the
concentrations of Magnesium and Creatinine in the urine
sample.
C. Calculation of Magnesium/Creatinine Ratio
1. Obtain the Magnesium concentration (mg/dL) from the
analyzer’s readout.
2. Obtain the Creatinine concentration (mg/dL) from the analyzer’s
readout.
3. Calculate the ratio using the formula: [ \text{Magnesium/
Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{\text{Magnesium concentration}}
{\text{Creatinine concentration}} ]
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials with each batch of patient samples
(minimum daily).
• Acceptable ranges for quality control materials must be within the
established limits. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot the
issue, and rerun controls before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the Magnesium and Creatinine concentrations and
calculated Magnesium/Creatinine ratio into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results are thoroughly reviewed and verified by the
laboratory technologist.
• Report critical results following laboratory protocol for notification
of critical values.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS Refer to site-specific reference
intervals for Magnesium and Creatinine concentrations in urine and
the Magnesium/Creatinine ratio.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, turbidity, and contamination in the urine sample may
interfere with test results.
• Ensure proper sample handling and storage to avoid such
interferences.
11. MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the chemistry
analyzer as per manufacturer's guidelines.
• Log all maintenance activities.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for the Chemistry Analyzer

• Internal Quality Control Procedures
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and clinical guidelines on
Magnesium/Creatinine Ratio analysis.
13. REVISION HISTORY
• Version 1.0, Date: [Insert Date]
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate
determination of the Magnesium/Creatinine ratio in random urine
samples, adhering to the quality standards required for clinical
decision-making.
