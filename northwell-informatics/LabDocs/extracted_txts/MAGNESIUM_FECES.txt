SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for the Analysis of Magnesium
(Mg) in Feces
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the accurate and
precise determination of magnesium levels in fecal specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this SOP, ensuring proper
quality control, data entry, and reporting. Supervisors are
responsible for validating abnormal results and ensuring proper
maintenance of equipment.
3. SPECIMEN HANDLING A. Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: A complete 24-hour fecal collection in a sterile
container, well-mixed, and labelled with the date and time of
collection as well as patient identification details.
• Acceptable: Random fecal specimen collected in a sterile
container.
• Unacceptable: Fecal specimens with contamination, insufficient
volume, or improper labelling.
B. Specimen Storage:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately.
• Specimens may be stored frozen at -20°C for longer periods.
Allow specimen to thaw completely at room temperature and mix
thoroughly before analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES)
• Certified magnesium standard solutions
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high magnesium
concentrations)
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Deionized water
• Disposable polypropylene or polyethylene labware
• Centrifuge
• Water bath or digestion block
1. PROCEDURE A. Fecal Digestion:
2. Homogenize the fecal specimen thoroughly.
3. Weigh an appropriate amount of the homogenized feces
(typically 0.5g to 1.0g) into a digestion vessel.
4. Add 10 mL of nitric acid to the fecal sample.
5. Heat the sample in a water bath or digestion block at 95°C until
complete digestion is achieved (generally 2 hours).
6. Allow the digest to cool to room temperature.
7. Dilute the digest with deionized water to a final volume suitable
for the AAS or ICP-OES analysis.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Set up the AAS or ICP-OES according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Use certified standard solutions to create a calibration curve,
including at least five points (e.g., 0, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg/L).
3. Analyze the calibration standards and ensure the calibration
curve meets acceptable linearity (r^2 > 0.995).
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Run a blank to ensure no contamination.
2. Analyze quality control samples before running patient
samples; results must be within acceptable limits.
3. Analyze patient samples, including at least one quality control
sample per batch of 20 specimens.
4. Dilute samples if magnesium concentrations exceed the
calibration range and reanalyze.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) at the
beginning and end of each analytical run.
2. All quality control results must fall within 2 standard deviations
of the target value.
3. Recalibrate and reanalyze if any quality control results are out
of range.
4. Record quality control and sample data in appropriate logs.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report numerical results in mg/kg feces.
• Verify all results for accuracy and ensure all controls are within
the limits before reporting.
• Abnormal results should be reviewed and validated by a
supervisor before releasing.
• Critical values (if applicable) should be reported immediately to
the requesting clinician following laboratory protocol for critical
result notification.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals may be specific to the patient population and
available from the test kit insert or established by the laboratory.
• Typical reference range for fecal Mg: 80-500 mg/kg (Note: This
range needs to be verified specific to your laboratory setup.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Interference from high amounts of other metals or matrix
components.
• Precision and accuracy are dependent on adherence to the
quality control protocols.
