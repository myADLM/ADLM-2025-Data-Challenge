Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Magnesium, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and precise
measurement of plasma magnesium levels using established
analytical techniques.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
and reporting of plasma magnesium levels in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Provisionally designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the magnesium plasma analysis, ensuring adherence to
this SOP, and reporting the validated results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Plasma, collected using heparin as the anticoagulant.
Collection Guidelines:
• Collect blood specimens in green-top (heparin) tubes.
• Ensure the tubes are filled completely to avoid dilution errors.
• Gently invert the tube several times to mix the anticoagulant with
blood.
Stability:
• Plasma magnesium levels are stable for up to 7 days when stored
at 2-8°C and up to 24 hours at room temperature (~20-25°C).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instrument: Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical
Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) or Colorimetric Analyzer.
• Heparinized Plasma Separation Tubes (PST).
• Calibrators and magnesium standard solutions.
• Control materials for quality control analysis – two levels (Normal
and High).
• Appropriate pipettes and tips.
• Laboratory grade deionized water.
6. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Use the calibrators to calibrate the instrument at the start of
each batch of samples.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control (QC) samples at both normal and high
concentration levels with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Acceptable ranges for QC materials should be established
and documented.
b) Sample Handling:
1. Plasma Separation:
◦ Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to obtain plasma.
◦ Carefully aliquot the plasma into labeled secondary tubes,
avoiding cell pellet contamination.
2. Analysis:
◦ Prepare the analyzer according to the instrument-specific
SOP.
◦ Load plasma samples onto the analyzer in the specified
order.
◦ Ensure the correct identification and tracking of each
sample and corresponding data entry.
3. Instrumental Measurement:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for the operation of the
ICP-OES or Colorimetric Analyzer.
◦ Input initial sample information including the sample type
(plasma), method of analysis, and desired measurement
units (mg/dL or mmol/L).
4. Data Collection:
◦ Collect and review the raw data and calculated results from
the analyzer software.
◦ Ensure the results fall within linearity limits specified for the
method.
c) Post-Analysis:
1. Result Review:
◦ Validate all control and calibration results.
◦ Investigate any out-of-range QC results, recalibrate if
necessary, and repeat the analysis of affected samples.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure proper verification according to lab-specific
guidelines.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document all findings, calibration, and QC data in the
laboratory log.
◦ Note any anomalies or deviations and actions taken in the
batch record.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance of instruments as per
manufacturer's recommendation.
• Maintain and document calibration logs.
• Conduct proficiency testing (e.g., CAP Surveys) regularly to
ensure the accuracy and precision of magnesium determinations.
• Comply with relevant quality management protocols and CLIA
regulations.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolysis in specimens may release intracellular magnesium,
leading to falsely elevated results.
2. Icteric or lipemic samples may interfere with certain analytical
methods.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adults: 1.7 – 2.2 mg/dL (0.70 – 0.91 mmol/L)
• Pediatric values may vary by age, refer to specific pediatric
reference intervals if available.

• Instrument-specific operation manuals and reagent package
inserts.

guidelines.

plasma magnesium results while ensuring adherence to quality
control standards and regulatory requirements.
