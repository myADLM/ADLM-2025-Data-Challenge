SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Magnesium,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a detailed and standardized protocol for the analytical phase
of generating results for serum magnesium levels. This procedure
ensures accurate, consistent, and reliable measurement of serum
magnesium using approved methodologies and instruments.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedures outlined in this SOP, ensuring adherence to the protocol,
and recording all necessary information. Supervisors are responsible
for overseeing the process to ensure it is carried out correctly and for
addressing any issues or discrepancies.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube)
Volume: Minimum 2 mL of serum Stability: Specimens should be
analyzed within 48 hours of collection if stored at room temperature
(15-25°C) or within 7 days if refrigerated (2-8°C).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c 311)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
Reagents:
• Magnesium reagent kit specifically designed for the chemistry
analyzer used
• Calibrators
• Quality control materials (Level 1 and Level 2 controls)
• De-ionized water
Supplies:
• SST collection tubes
• Laboratory recording logs
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify that calibrators, quality controls, and reagent kits are not
expired and are stored according to the manufacturer's
specifications.
2. Prepare the required reagents if needed, referring to the
manufacturer’s instructions included with the magnesium
reagent kit.
Specimen Processing:
1. Ensure that the serum sample has been correctly processed
(separated and devoid of hemolysis).
2. If the sample has been refrigerated, allow it to come to room
temperature before analysis (approximately 15-30 minutes).
Calibration:
1. Perform calibration of the chemistry analyzer using the provided
calibrators for magnesium at the beginning of each shift or as
recommended by the manufacturer.
2. Document the calibration in the laboratory calibration log, noting
the date, time, and initials of the technician performing the
calibration.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at both high and low levels prior to
analyzing patient samples.
2. Accept quality control results only if they fall within the
predefined acceptable range according to manufacturer
specifications.
3. Document quality control results in the QC log, noting any
corrective actions if results fall outside acceptable limits.
Sample Analysis:
1. Load the serum sample into the chemistry analyzer according
to the instrument’s loading instructions.
2. Input necessary patient information into the analyzer.
3. Run the samples through the automated method described by
the manufacturer.
4. Verify the results generated by the analyzer by reviewing any
flagged results for potential errors or discrepancies.
Troubleshooting:
1. If flagged results or errors occur, repeat the analysis after
ensuring the specimen integrity and correct loading.
2. If issues persist, inform the supervisor and follow the
instrument's troubleshooting guide or contact the manufacturer
for support.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Confirm that all results are within the limit of quantification and
meet the laboratory’s acceptance criteria.
2. Perform necessary calculations if applicable, ensuring all data
is accurate and documented.
3. Verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician
following the laboratory’s critical value notification policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Employ three levels of quality control material automatically
analyzed at appropriate intervals.
• Review and verify all quality control results before analyzing and
reporting patient samples.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as scheduled.
• Compare inter-laboratory results and implement corrective actions
if discrepancies are noted.
8. REFERENCES
Refer to the product insert for the specific magnesium reagent kit
used, the chemistry analyzer’s user manual, and any relevant clinical
laboratory standards (such as those provided by CLIA).
9. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain records of calibration, quality control results, patient sample
analysis, troubleshooting actions, and any deviations from the
standard protocol.
10. APPENDICES
Include any charts, forms, or logs necessary for the documentation of
the performed analyses.
