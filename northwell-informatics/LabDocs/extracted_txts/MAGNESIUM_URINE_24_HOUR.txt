Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase: Magnesium,
Urine, 24 Hour
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the measurement and
reporting of Magnesium levels in 24-hour urine specimens to ensure
accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
analysis of Magnesium in 24-hour urine specimens following this
SOP. The supervisor is responsible for overseeing the completion of
the analysis and ensuring compliance with all procedures.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• A complete 24-hour urine collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are not labeled with the start and end time of the
collection.
• Specimens with significant contamination or those not stored
properly during the collection period.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-
OES) or Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)
• Volumetric flasks
• Pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Deionized water
• Magnesium standard solutions
• Quality control samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Log sheets
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Verify the completeness and labeling of the 24-hour urine
specimen.
3. Mix the contents of the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly
before aliquoting.
4. Transfer an aliquot of the urine specimen to a clean container.
5. If needed, centrifuge the aliquot to remove any particulate
matter.
Dilution:
1. Calculate dilution factor based on expected magnesium
concentration.
2. Prepare diluted urine sample using deionized water to fall within
the linear range of detection of the ICP-OES/AAS.
3. Ensure accurate volume measurements using calibrated
pipettes and volumetric flasks.
Analysis:
1. Load the diluted urine sample, Magnesium standard solutions,
and quality control samples into the ICP-OES/AAS.
2. Set up the instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for Magnesium analysis.
3. Run a calibration curve using Magnesium standard solutions.
4. Analyze the urine sample and recording the observed
concentration of Magnesium.
5. Run quality control samples intermittently to ensure accuracy
and precision of the instrument.
Troubleshooting:
1. Should any control samples fall outside established limits, re-
run the sample.
2. If quality control fails again, recalibrate the instrument and
prepare fresh standards and samples.
3. Document any corrective actions taken in the log sheet.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Quality control urine samples with known concentration of
Magnesium.
Procedure:
1. Run quality control samples together with patient samples.
2. Document results of quality control samples on log sheet.
3. Ensure that all quality control results fall within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Procedure:
1. Enter Magnesium concentration results into the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
2. Review and verify results for correctness.
3. Attach comments if sample integrity was compromised or if
additional testing was necessary.
Reference Intervals:
• Adult: 1.0 – 3.0 mmol/24 hours (Reference range may vary based
on population and method used.)
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer instrument manual for specific limitations
related to interference from other substances and detection range
accuracy.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Manual: ICP-OES/AAS
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urine analysis.
• Relevant scientific literature on urine trace element analysis
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Procedure:
1. Keep daily logs of all maintenance and calibration activities.
2. Document all results and quality control activities in an
organized manner.
3. Maintain records of corrective action for any issues
encountered during analysis.
This SOP ensures the consistent performance and reliability of the
analytical phase for Magnesium in 24-hour urine specimens,
supporting accurate clinical decision-making based on laboratory
results.
