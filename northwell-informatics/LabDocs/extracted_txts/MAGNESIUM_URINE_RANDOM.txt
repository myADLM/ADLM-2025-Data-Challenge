Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Magnesium, Urine, Random
1. PURPOSE
To provide a reliable method for the analysis of magnesium in
random urine samples in order to determine the magnesium
concentration.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
magnesium test on urine samples.
• All laboratory staff are responsible for identifying any deficiencies
in the procedure that may affect test results and must report them
to their supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Type:
• Random urine specimen collected in a clean, dry container.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimen should be mixed well before analysis.
• Ensure that the sample is free from contamination and particulate
matter.
• If testing cannot be performed immediately, the sample can be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. Ensure the container is tightly
closed and clearly labeled.
Specimen Rejection:
• Specimens in containers with no collection date/time or patient
identifier.
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated with particulate matter or
have been stored improperly.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection if stored
at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of measuring magnesium
in urine.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Magnesium reagent kit specifically recommended for the
analyzer.
• Quality control materials (two levels: normal and abnormal).
Supplies:
• Disposable gloves.
• Clean, dry urine sample containers.
• Calibrators for magnesium analysis.
• Laboratory logbook and report forms.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation and Calibration:
• Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration dates.
• Perform daily calibration of the analyzer using the magnesium
calibrators.
• Document calibration results in the calibration log.
4.2 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, and
after any maintenance or calibration procedures.
• Use two levels of quality control materials: normal and abnormal.
• Document QC results in the Quality Control log. Ensure they fall
within established acceptable ranges before proceeding with
patient samples.
• If QC results fall outside established ranges, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer's manual and repeat QC testing. If
issues persist, notify the supervisor for further instructions.
4.3 Sample Analysis:
1. Mix the random urine sample thoroughly.
2. Check and document the sample identity against the laboratory
logbook.
3. Aliquot an appropriate volume (as specified by the
manufacturer's instructions) of the urine sample into a clean
tube.
4. Load the urine sample into the chemistry analyzer.
5. Analyze the sample according to the instrument’s protocol.
4.4 Result Interpretation and Verification:
• Review the analyzer’s output for each sample to ensure the result
falls within the reportable range.
• If the result is outside the reportable range, follow the instrument's
procedure to dilute the sample and re-analyze.
• Verify all results and ensure they are entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) according to the established protocol.
• Ensure that any abnormal results are flagged and reviewed by a
supervisor or pathologist.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS for review and
verification by a technologist.
• Abnormal results should be flagged and, if necessary, reported to
the attending clinician immediately according to the critical value
policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure that the urine specimen is properly mixed before analysis
to avoid sediment interference.
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples may interfere with the
accuracy of magnesium measurements.
• Ensure proper sample storage conditions to prevent degradation.
1. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain thorough documentation of calibration, quality control,
sample analysis, and any troubleshooting procedures in the
appropriate logs.
• Ensure all logs are reviewed and signed by a supervisor regularly.
