Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Measuring Magnesium in Urine (Timed
Collection)
1. Purpose The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized
protocol for the accurate and reliable measurement of
magnesium levels in timed urine samples.
2. Scope This SOP applies to the analytical phase of processing
and reporting magnesium levels in timed urine specimens in the
laboratory.
3. Responsibility It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP to ensure the integrity of
magnesium measurements in timed urine samples.
4. Specimen Requirements and Stability Specimen: Preferred/
acceptable: - 24-hour urine collection or specified timed volume
from a clean, dry, plastic container. - No preservatives or
stabilizers are added to the urine sample.
Unacceptable: - Specimens with high turbidity. - Urine samples
collected in containers with added preservatives. - Urine
collected over a variable duration contradicting the specified
timed collection.
Handling: - Ensure correct labeling with patient information and
collection start/end times. - Store samples at 2–8°C until
analysis, ensuring the sample does not freeze.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies • Atomic absorption
spectrophotometer or colorimetric analyzer. • Calibration
standards for magnesium. • Quality control materials. • Sample
containers. • Personal protective equipment (PPE).
6. Procedure A) Preparation and Pre-analysis:
1. Verify patient identification and specimen details on the
container.
2. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly before aliquoting to
ensure homogeneity.
3. Perform a visual inspection of the specimen for turbidity or
contaminants.
4. Record the total volume of the timed urine collection.
5. If necessary, dilute the sample according to the analyzer's
specifications and record the dilution factor.
B) Analysis: 1. Set up and calibrate the atomic absorption
spectrophotometer or colorimetric analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions. 2. Prepare calibration standards ranging
from low to high concentrations of magnesium. 3. Prepare quality
control materials and analyze them to ensure the instrument is
functioning correctly. 4. Pipette the urine sample into the analyzer's
appropriate container and insert it into the instrument. 5. Run the
sample analysis according to the established protocol. 6. Document
the magnesium concentration provided by the analyzer. 7. Process
the calibration and quality control materials results and ensure they
fall within acceptable limits.
C) Post-analysis: 1. Validate the results, review any flagged or
abnormal readings, and re-analyze if necessary. 2. Calculate the total
magnesium excretion for the timed urine collection period using the
formula: Total Magnesium (mg/day) = Magnesium concentration (mg/
L) × Total urine volume (L) 3. Record the calculated result in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). 4. If any sample integrity issues
are identified, such as hemolysis or turbidity, use best judgment for
reporting and notify the supervisor.
1. Quality Control
1. Analyze quality control materials at the start and end of
each batch of specimens.
2. Record QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges specified by the manufacturer.
3. Investigate any QC failures and document corrective
actions.
2. Reporting Results
1. Enter the validated magnesium concentration results into
the LIS.
2. Report the total magnesium excretion in mg/day, ensuring
proper documentation and patient identification.
3. Follow critical result reporting guidelines and promptly
communicate any critical high or low magnesium values
to the physician.
3. Reference Intervals • Adults: 50–150 mg/day (may vary based
on population studies). • Reference intervals should be updated
periodically based on new clinical research and population-
specific data.
4. Method Limitations • Ensure samples are free from
contaminants and preservatives that can interfere with
magnesium measurements. • Refer to the instrument
manufacturer's guideline for any specific limitations regarding
sample volume, dilution, or matrix effects.
5. References • Manufacturer’s instrument manual for atomic
absorption spectrophotometer or colorimetric analyzer. • Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for urine
magnesium measurement.
6. Review and Revision • This SOP will be reviewed annually and
revised as necessary by the laboratory supervisor to ensure
compliance with current standards and practices.
