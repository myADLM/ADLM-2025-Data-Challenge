Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MAG Antibody Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline procedures for the analysis and generation of results for
Myelin Associated Glycoprotein (MAG) antibody testing in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of MAG antibody testing,
from specimen handling to result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP during the analytical phase of testing for MAG antibody.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a SST (Serum Separator Tube) and allowed to
clot for 30 minutes before centrifugation.
• Specimen volume: Preferably 2-3 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants or
preservatives.
• Hemolyzed or significantly lipemic specimens.
• Unlabeled or improperly labeled specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA Reader or appropriate automated immunoassay system
• ELISA Kit for MAG Antibody detection (ensure it is within
expiration date and stored as recommended)
• Pipettes, tips, and reservoirs
• Microtiter plates
• Plate washer
• Timer
• Laboratory computer system with software for data acquisition
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Setup:
1. Ensure that all equipment and reagents are available and set
up according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibrate the ELISA Reader if required and perform routine
maintenance checks.
Specimen Handling:
1. Retrieve the stored serum specimens and allow them to come
to room temperature.
2. Verify proper labeling and documentation.
3. Mix specimens gently and ensure the absence of any clots or
hemolysis.
Testing Procedure:
1. Add appropriate controls and standards to the designated wells
of the microtiter plate.
2. Pipette specified volume of patient specimens into designated
wells.
3. Follow ELISA Kit instructions for adding reagents (e.g.,
incubation and washing steps).
4. Ensure proper timing and handling of the microtiter plate during
all steps.
5. At the end of the incubation period, read the plate using the
ELISA Reader.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative quality control samples with each
batch of specimens.
2. Ensure that the controls fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding to patient specimen analysis.
3. Document all quality control checks.
7. RESULT ANALYSIS AND REPORTING:
1. Analyze the data obtained from the ELISA Reader.
2. Compare patient specimen readings to the established cut-off
values provided by the kit.
3. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Critical Value Reporting:
1. Results indicating high MAG antibody titers that are clinically
significant must be flagged and reported to the clinician
promptly.
2. Follow the protocol for handling and documenting critical
values.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
1. Enter all results, including quality control data and corrective
actions, in the LIS.
2. Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, equipment calibration,
and any deviations from the SOP.
3. Store results and related documentation securely for the time
frame stipulated by laboratory policies.
