Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MAHI MAHI
IgE Assay
1. Purpose:
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of MAHI MAHI
IgE levels in clinical specimens using a specific immunoassay
method. This procedure ensures accurate, reproducible, and precise
results.
2. Scope:
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel performing MAHI
MAHI IgE analysis.
3. Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay as described.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
procedure, ensuring compliance, and troubleshooting any issues.
4. Definitions:
MAHI MAHI IgE: Immunoglobulin E antibodies specific to MAHI MAHI
(a type of fish) allergens.
5. Materials and Equipment:
• Specimen: Serum or plasma
• MAHI MAHI IgE test kits (e.g., ImmunoCAP, or any vendor-
specific kits)
• Micropipettes with disposable tips (various volumes)
• Reagent reservoirs
• Incubator (37°C)
• Plate washer
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm and a
reference wavelength of 620 nm (if applicable)
• Centrifuge (for sample preparation if necessary)
• Vortex mixer
• Calibrators and controls (provided in the test kit or obtained from
a reliable source)
6. Procedure:
6.1 Sample Preparation:
• Obtain venous blood samples and store them in appropriate
collection tubes (serum or plasma).
• Centrifuge samples at 1500 to 2000 g for 10 minutes to separate
serum/plasma if not already separated.
• Store serum/plasma at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within
72 hours. For longer storage, freeze aliquots at -20°C or lower.
6.2 Reagents Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and controls to equilibrate to room temperature
before use.
• Reconstitute lyophilized reagents (if applicable) as per the kit
instructions.
• Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution as
specified in the kit insert.
6.3 Assay Protocol:
1. Pipetting Standard and Controls:
◦ Add appropriate volume (e.g., 100 µL) of standards,
controls, and samples to the designated wells of the
microplate.
◦ Ensure duplicate or triplicate measurements for each
standard, control, and sample to enhance accuracy.
2. Adding Detection Reagent:
◦ Add detection antibody/reagent (e.g., enzyme-conjugated
anti-IgE) to each well according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Refer to the kit insert for volume and incubation
times.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature (typically
37°C) for the recommended duration (e.g., 1 hour) to allow
antigen-antibody binding.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells as directed (e.g., 5 times with 300 µL of
wash buffer per well) using an automated plate washer to
remove unbound components.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the enzyme substrate to each well and incubate for the
recommended time (e.g., 15-30 minutes) in the dark to
develop color.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction. The color change should be immediate.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using the plate reader.
Use 620 nm as a reference wavelength if required by the
assay protocol.
6.4 Data Analysis:
• Use the software provided with the plate reader to generate a
standard curve from the absorbance values of the standards.
• Calculate the IgE concentration of the samples using the standard
curve.
• Ensure all values fall within the linear range of the standard curve.
Dilute and retest samples with concentrations above the highest
standard.
6.5 Quality Control:
• Run controls with each assay to verify assay performance.
• Accept the run if control values fall within the established ranges.
Reject the run if control values are out of range and investigate
potential issues.
7. Reporting Results:
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
verifying accuracy.
• Report IgE concentration in kUA/L (kilo units of allergen-specific
IgE per liter) with reference to established reference ranges.
8. Troubleshooting:
• Inconsistent standard curve: Review reagent preparation,
pipetting technique, and incubation conditions.
• High background noise: Ensure thorough washing steps and
check for reagent contamination.
• No color change: Verify enzyme and substrate addition and
ensure proper incubation conditions.
9. References:
• Manufacturer’s kit insert for MAHI MAHI IgE assay.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory SOP for general immunoassay practices.
10. Revision History:
• Document and keep a record of any changes to the protocol for
future reference.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure that MAHI
MAHI IgE levels are accurately and efficiently measured, providing
reliable data for clinical decision-making.
Note: All laboratory personnel must read and understand this SOP
before performing the MAHI MAHI IgE assay. Any deviations from
this protocol should be documented and justified.
