Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Mail Out Research (Blood)
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for analyzing and generating
results for mail-out research blood samples. The aim is to ensure that
all samples are processed uniformly, accurately, and within the
defined parameters.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for analyzing blood samples and
generating results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and addressing any deviations.
2. Definitions
• Mail Out Research: Research samples sent to external
laboratories for specialized testing.
• Accessioned Sample: A sample that has been received,
identified, and logged into the laboratory's information system.
3. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verification:
◦ Confirm the sample identity against the accession log.
◦ Verify that all required documentation (requisition forms,
sample labels) is complete and matches the sample.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate plasma/serum.
◦ Ensure the centrifuge parameters are appropriate for the
sample matrix.
3. Aliquoting:
◦ Carefully pipette the plasma/serum into labeled aliquot
tubes.
◦ Ensure labels include: patient ID, date, time of drawing, and
test to be conducted.
B. Analysis
1. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Ensure all equipment (centrifuges, pipettes) is calibrated
and validated.
◦ Use reagents that are within their expiration dates and
stored correctly.
2. Analytical Techniques:
◦ Perform the analysis using appropriate methodologies
based on the external laboratory’s requirements.
◦ Follow the specific analytical technique SOPs guaranteed to
be approved (e.g., ELISA, HPLC, LC-MS).
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples in parallel to verifying the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
◦ Document any QC failures and corrective actions taken.
C. Documentation and Packaging
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
prior to shipping.
◦ Complete and include a research requisition form and any
additional required documentation as specified by the
external laboratory.
2. Sample Packaging:
◦ Package aliquot tubes with adequate cushioning to prevent
breakage.
◦ Include necessary ice packs or dry ice to maintain sample
integrity, particularly if the samples are temperature
sensitive.
◦ Clearly label the outer package with the destination address,
“BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE” and any handling instructions.
3. Shipping:
◦ Ship the package to the external laboratory using an
approved courier service.
◦ Ensure the package is accompanied by any legally required
transportation documentation, and follow regulatory
guidelines for the transport of biological specimens.
4. Reporting and Review
1. Result Review:
◦ Review results for consistency and accuracy by designated
personnel.
◦ Any results that fall outside of the expected reference range
should be flagged for review and addressed with the
external laboratory if necessary.
2. Results Communication:
◦ Document and communicate results to the principal
investigator and/or submitting agency following laboratory
privacy and reporting guidelines.
3. Archiving:
◦ Store copies of all documentation, including QC records, for
a minimum of five years.
◦ Samples may be retained according to research project
specifications or until confirmation of receipt and
completeness by the external laboratory.
5. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
• If any steps of the process fall outside of the acceptable limits or
protocol, immediate corrective action must be taken. This involves
documenting the issue, addressing it according to the laboratory’s
corrective action plan.
• Deviations should be reported immediately to the supervisor to
ensure proper action is taken to maintain integrity and reliability of
the results.
6. References
• Internal lab quality control guidelines (print or digital access)
• Manufacturer instructions and package inserts for all test kits and
reagents used
• External laboratory guidelines and protocols for specific research
assays
By following this SOP, we aim to maintain high standards of accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in generating results for mail-out research
blood samples. All staff must be trained on this procedure to ensure
uniform handling of all research samples.
