Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase -
Malabsorption Evaluation Panel, Feces
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of the Malabsorption
Evaluation Panel, Feces, ensuring accurate and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow the
procedures outlined in this SOP. The supervisor is responsible for
ensuring adherence to these procedures and addressing any issues
that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Feces (stool samples)
• Preferred/Acceptable: At least 5 grams of a freshly collected
fecal sample.
• Unacceptable: Any specimens that are not properly labeled, have
leaked, or are collected outside of the specified time frame.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Analytical Balance
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Incubator
◦ pH Meter
◦ Spectrophotometer
◦ Microscopy equipment (if applicable)
• Reagents:
◦ Sudan III stain (for fecal fat examination)
◦ 10% formalin
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Benedict’s reagent (for reducing substances)
◦ Normal saline
◦ Commercial kits for specific enzymatic assays (e.g., elastase,
chymotrypsin)
• Supplies: Sterile containers, glass slides, cover slips, pipettes,
test tubes, gloves, labeling materials.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Specimen Reception:
◦ Confirm specimen identity and labeling.
◦ Record specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the fecal sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Aliquot appropriate portions of the sample for each test
component.
B. Analysis
1. Quantitative Fecal Fat Analysis: a. Protocol: - Weigh
approximately 5 grams of well-mixed fecal sample. -
Homogenize with 10% formalin or other suitable preservation
solution. - Perform extraction using an appropriate lipid solvent.
- Quantify extracted fats using gravimetric or
spectrophotometric methods. b. Documentation: - Record the
weight of the sample and extracted fat.
2. Qualitative Fecal Fat Examination: a. Protocol: - Mix a small
portion of the fecal sample with a drop of saline on a glass
slide. - Add a few drops of Sudan III stain. - Cover with a cover
slip and examine under the microscope. - Note presence and
size of fat globules. b. Documentation: - Record findings in the
LIS.
3. Reducing Substances (e.g., for Carbohydrate
Malabsorption): a. Protocol: - Mix a small amount of the fecal
sample with Benedict’s reagent in a test tube. - Heat the
mixture in a boiling water bath for about 5 minutes. - Observe
the color change to indicate the presence of reducing
substances. b. Documentation: - Record the results and
intensity of color change.
4. Pancreatic Enzyme Activity (e.g., Elastase, Chymotrypsin
Analysis): a. Protocol: - Follow the manufacturer’s instructions
for the commercial enzymatic assay kits. - Use aliquoted fecal
samples and reagents as per kit protocols. - Measure
absorbance using a spectrophotometer. b. Documentation: -
Record absorbance readings in the LIS.
5. pH Measurement: a. Protocol: - Mix a small portion of the
fecal sample with distilled water. - Measure pH using a
calibrated pH meter. b. Documentation: - Record pH value in
the LIS.
C. Quality Control
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Always run positive and negative controls along with patient
samples for each assay.
◦ Verify control results fall within established ranges before
accepting patient results.
2. Equipment Calibration:
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Maintain calibration logs.
D. Reporting
1. Result Verification:
◦ Verify all results are accurate and complete.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist.
2. Result Entry:
◦ Enter all test results into the LIS.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting and
interpretation.
3. Critical Values:
◦ Immediately notify the physician or relevant healthcare
provider of any critical values.
E. Method Limitations
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert or guidelines for specific
enzymatic assays.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the use of enzymatic assay kits.
• Relevant Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs of specimen receipt, test performance, quality
control, and result reporting.
• Ensure all documentation is complete, accurate, and securely
stored.
8. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all revisions to the procedure with dates and a
summary of changes.
