Standard Operating Procedure: Malaria, Molecular
Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the detection of malaria
through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the laboratory, ensuring
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in molecular
techniques performing malaria detection using PCR for samples
received in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of trained molecular laboratory personnel to
perform malaria PCR as per this protocol.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this SOP, troubleshooting, and validation of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL.
• Specimen stability: Room temperature for up to 6 hours or
refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Samples in heparinized tubes.
• Hemolyzed samples.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kit specific for blood samples
• Malaria-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR master mix
• Ethanol (70%)
• Micropipettes and filtered tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory gloves, lab coat, and eye protection
• Clean work surface and biological safety cabinet
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves,
lab coat, and eye protection.
◦ Clean and disinfect the work surfaces with 70% ethanol
before starting.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
extraction kit appropriate for blood samples.
◦ Ensure all blood samples are processed using universal
precautions to prevent contamination.
3. Storage:
◦ Extracted DNA should be stored at -20°C if not immediately
used for PCR.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Preparation:
◦ Clean the PCR working area with 70% ethanol.
◦ Assemble all necessary reagents and place them on ice.
2. Reaction Mix Preparation:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the kit or protocol
used, including malaria-specific primers and probes.
◦ The master mix should include:
▪ PCR buffer
▪ dNTP mix
▪ MgCl₂
▪ Primers and probes
▪ Taq polymerase
▪ Nuclease-free water
3. Aliquoting:
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate
(depending on the thermal cycler format), ensuring no
cross-contamination.
◦ Add extracted DNA samples to each tube or well.
4. Negative and Positive Controls:
◦ Include negative controls (nuclease-free water) and positive
controls (known malaria-positive DNA) in each PCR run to
ensure the validity of the results.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Loading the Thermal Cycler:
◦ Place the PCR tubes or plate into the thermal cycler and
program the cycling conditions.
2. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Typical cycling conditions may include:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35-40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (optimized based
on primer/probe design)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Ensure to monitor the reaction progress.
D. Detection and Analysis:
1. Post-PCR:
◦ Once the PCR is complete, proceed to detect the amplified
product using appropriate detection methods (e.g., gel
electrophoresis, real-time PCR detection system).
2. Analysis:
◦ Evaluate the results by comparing the amplification curves
of the samples to the negative and positive controls.
◦ Interpretation should be based on the presence or absence
of the target amplification signals.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report positive results as "Malaria DNA detected" and negative
results as "Malaria DNA not detected."
• Include any pertinent information regarding sample integrity or
unusual findings in the report.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform weekly quality control measures using known positive
and negative controls to ensure the accuracy and consistency of
the PCR process.
• Document and review all QC results. If QC fails, do not report
patient results until the issue is resolved.
Note: Always follow biosafety and biosecurity guidelines while
handling patient samples and performing PCR to avoid contamination
and false results.
9. LIMITATIONS
• PCR may not detect very low levels of malaria DNA in cases of
very low parasitemia.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic tests.
10. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for the DNA extraction kit
and PCR reagents used.
• WHO Guidelines on Molecular Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases
(latest edition).
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures reliable and accurate
detection of malaria using PCR, maintaining high standards of
molecular diagnostics.
