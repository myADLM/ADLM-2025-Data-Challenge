Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) For Malaria PCR with
Parasitemia Reflex
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for performing Malaria PCR with
Parasitemia Reflex testing to ensure accurate and timely results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform Malaria PCR testing with parasitemia reflex.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform the
procedure as described in this SOP.
• The supervision responsibility lies with the designated team lead/
supervisor to ensure compliance with the procedures.
• All laboratory personnel are responsible for identifying any
inconsistencies or issues with the procedures and reporting them
to the supervisor immediately.
4. DEFINITIONS
Malaria PCR: A polymerase chain reaction-based test used to detect
malaria DNA in blood samples.
Parasitemia Reflex: Microscopic examination of blood to determine
the level of malaria parasites in the blood when PCR is positive.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole Blood Sample
◦ Collect 3-5 mL of whole blood in an EDTA tube.
◦ Samples should be mixed properly by gentle inversion.
◦ Store the sample at 2-8°C if processing is delayed. The
sample is stable at this temperature for up to 48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Samples not in EDTA tubes.
• Samples received more than 48 hours after collection without
proper storage.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Malaria PCR Master Mix
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and Sterile Tips
• EDTA tubes
• Microscope and Glass Slides
• Giemsa Stain
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction using the designated DNA extraction kit
as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Ensure all safety precautions are followed, including wearing
PPE.
3. Label all tubes appropriately with patient information and
extraction date.
B. PCR Preparation
1. Thaw and prepare PCR master mix as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Add extracted DNA to the PCR master mix in sterile PCR tubes.
3. Incorporate appropriate positive and negative controls.
4. Program the thermal cycler with the specific cycling conditions
for malaria DNA amplification.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler.
2. Start the PCR run and monitor the process.
3. At the end of the PCR cycle, store amplification products at
-20°C until analysis.
D. Interpreting PCR Results
1. Analyze the PCR products using gel electrophoresis or real-
time PCR analysis software.
2. Compare the amplification results against positive and negative
controls.
3. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
E. Reflex Parasitemia
If PCR results are positive for malaria DNA:
1. Prepare a thin blood film smear using a drop of the EDTA whole
blood sample.
2. Stain the blood film with Giemsa stain.
3. Examine the stained smear under the microscope to determine
the parasitemia level.
◦ Count the number of parasites per 200 white blood cells and
calculate parasitemia as a percentage of infected red blood
cells.
4. Record the results in the LIS, ensuring all details are accurately
documented.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of PCR to
ensure the accuracy of the test.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the PCR thermal
cycler and microscope.
• Review QC charts and promptly address any deviations from
expected results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the PCR results as well as parasitemia levels (if applicable)
into the LIS.
• Flag any critical values or discrepancies for further review by the
supervisor.
• Results should be verified by another certified laboratory
technologist.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• PCR sensitivity may be affected by improper sample storage or
degradation of DNA.
• High backgrounds or nonspecific amplification may occur if the
PCR setup is not done in a contamination-free environment.
• Morphological differentiation in parasitemia reflex may be
subjective; hence multiple reviews or automated counting should
be encouraged where possible.

updates to equipment, reagents, or procedures are incorporated in
subsequent versions of this SOP.
