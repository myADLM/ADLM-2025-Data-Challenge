Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for MALT, IGE, and
SERUM Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for MALT (Mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue), IgE (Immunoglobulin E), and Serum analysis. This document
outlines step-by-step instructions to ensure accurate and
reproducible results, including specimen handling, reagent
preparation, analytical techniques, equipment usage, quality control
measures, result reporting, and troubleshooting.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedures as described in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring staff compliance with the SOP and taking corrective actions
when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
• MALT: Lymphoid tissues in the mucosal lining of the digestive
tract, respiratory tract, and other mucosa surfaces.
• IgE: A class of immunoglobulins associated with allergic
reactions.
• Serum: The liquid part of blood after coagulation, devoid of cells
and clotting factors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• MALT Specimen: Biopsy samples preserved in formalin.
• IgE Specimen: Serum collected in a red or gold top vacutainer
(no anticoagulants).
• Serum Specimen: Serum collected in a red or gold top
vacutainer (no anticoagulants).
Specimen handling instructions:
• MALT samples must be fixed in formalin immediately post-
collection and sent to the laboratory within 24 hours.
• IgE and Serum samples must be centrifuged within 2 hours of
collection and kept refrigerated at 4-8°C until analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ ELISA Reader
◦ Refrigerated Incubators
◦ Microplate Washer
◦ Pipettes
• Reagents:
◦ IgE ELISA kits (calibration standards and controls included)
◦ MALT immunohistochemistry reagents
◦ Serum protein assay reagents
• Supplies:
◦ Micropipette tips
◦ Microplates
◦ Slide racks and slides
1. PROCEDURE
A) MALT Analysis
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure the biopsy sample is well-fixed. Process embedding
in paraffin, sectioning, and mounting on slides.
2. Immunohistochemistry:
◦ Deparaffinize slides using xylene and rehydrate through
graded alcohol to water.
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable buffer.
◦ Incubate with primary antibody (specific to the lymphoid
tissue markers), followed by secondary antibody conjugated
with reporter enzyme.
◦ Visualize using chromogenic substrate and counterstain.
B) IgE Analysis
1. ELISA Method:
◦ Prepare reagent, standards, and controls according to the
kit protocol.
◦ Add standards, controls, and samples to appropriate wells in
the ELISA plate.
◦ Incubate at the recommended temperature and time.
◦ Wash and add detection antibody.
◦ Develop color reaction, measure absorbance using an
ELISA reader.
C) Serum Analysis
1. Protein Quantification:
◦ Prepare reagents for protein assays (e.g., Bradford assay or
BCA Protein Assay).
◦ Pipette standards, controls, and samples into microplate
wells.
◦ Incubate with appropriate reagents.
◦ Measure absorbance at specified wavelengths using a
microplate reader.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Daily Quality Control:
• Perform daily quality control checks using calibration standards
and controls included in the IgE ELISA kit.
• For serum protein assays, use commercially available QC
material.
• Document all QC results. If any QC fails, investigate, notify the
supervisor, and perform necessary corrective actions.
B) Equipment:
• Daily temperature and humidity checks for incubators.
• Regular maintenance and calibration of ELISA reader and
microplate washers.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Include the date, time, and analyst initials.
• Review results for consistency and validity.
• Report abnormal or critical results promptly following site-specific
protocols.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• IgE ELISA:
◦ Verify incubation times and temperatures.
◦ Check reagent preparations and expiration dates.
◦ Ensure washing technique efficacy.
• Serum Protein Assay:
◦ Verify assay reagent mixes.
◦ Check for protein standard curve validity.
• MALT Immunohistochemistry:
◦ Confirm antigen retrieval efficiency.
◦ Check antibody concentrations and specificity.
