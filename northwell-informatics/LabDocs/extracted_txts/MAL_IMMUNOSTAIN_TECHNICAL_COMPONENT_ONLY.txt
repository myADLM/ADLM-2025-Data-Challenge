Standard Operating Procedure MAL Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for the technical component of performing
MAL Immunostain in order to ensure accurate and reproducible
results. This includes the preparation, staining, and processing of
tissue samples for immunohistochemical analysis. Results generated
by this technical protocol will be used for diagnostic purposes by
pathologists.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP when processing samples for MAL Immunostain. It is also the
responsibility of all staff to report any procedural deviations or
equipment malfunctions to their immediate supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks or sections mounted on positively charged
slides.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Unfixed tissue, frozen sections,
specimens that have not been properly fixed and processed, or
inadequately mounted sections.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• Drying Oven
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled Water
• Hematoxylin
• Eosin
• Cover Slips and Mounting Media
• Primary Antibody against MAL (specific dilution as determined by
laboratory validation)
• Secondary Antibody (appropriate for the primary antibody host
species)
• Detection Kit (e.g., ABC complex, HRP-labeled polymer)
• Chromogen Substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Positive and Negative Control Slides
• Automated Immunostainer (if applicable)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Section Preparation
• Section FFPE tissue blocks at 3-5 µm thickness using a
microtome.
• Float sections on a 45°C water bath and mount on positively
charged slides.
• Dry slides in a 60°C drying oven for at least 1 hour or overnight at
room temperature.
5.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize the sections by immersing the slides in xylene for 3
changes, 5 minutes each.
• Rehydrate the sections through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
• Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
5.3. Antigen Retrieval
• Perform antigen retrieval using appropriate retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a microwave, pressure cooker or steamer
for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
5.4. Immunostaining
• Place the slides in a humidified chamber.
• Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in 3%
H2O2 solution for 10 minutes.
• Incubate sections with blocking solution (e.g., 10% normal serum)
for 20 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
• Apply the primary antibody against MAL at the predetermined
optimal dilution and incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature
or 4°C overnight.
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer, 3 changes for 5 minutes each.
5.5. Detection
• Apply the secondary antibody and incubate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (typically 30 minutes).
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer, 3 changes for 5 minutes each.
• Apply the detection kit (e.g., ABC complex, HRP-labeled polymer)
and incubate as directed by the manufacturer.
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer, 3 changes for 5 minutes each.
• Apply the chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) and incubate until the
desired stain intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
5.6. Counterstaining
• Dip slides in hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1 minute to
counterstain.
• Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
• Dip slides briefly in 70% ethanol, followed by 95% ethanol.
5.7. Dehydration and Mounting
• Dehydrate sections in 100% ethanol, 2 changes for 2 minutes
each.
• Clear sections in xylene, 2 changes for 2 minutes each.
• Mount sections with cover slips using a compatible mounting
media.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
slides stained.
• Ensure the staining intensity and localization on the control slides
are appropriate for MAL expression.
• Document any deviations from the standard protocol, reagent
issues, or equipment malfunctions in the QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides will be reviewed by a pathologist or designated
reviewer.
• The pathologist will interpret the stain and provide a diagnostic
report based on the staining pattern and intensity observed.
