Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MAML2
(11Q21) Rearrangement, Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma
(MEC) by FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
detection of MAML2 (11Q21) rearrangements in mucoepidermoid
carcinoma (MEC) tissue specimens using Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will perform all procedures according
to this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
procedure and for addressing any issues that arise during the
process.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• FISH hybridization system with appropriate hardware (e.g., Vysis
IntelliFISH Hybridization Oven)
• Fluorescence microscope (capable of detecting DAPI, FITC, and
Texas Red)
• Automated image analysis system (if applicable)
Reagents:
• MAML2 Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (containing labeled probes
specific for 11Q21 region)
• Fluorescence mounting medium with DAPI
• Wash Buffers 1 and 2
• Denaturation solution
• Hybridization buffer
Supplies:
• Adhesive microscope slides suitable for FISH
• Coverslips
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Humidified hybridization chamber
• Positive and negative control tissue sections
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Tissue Sectioning:
◦ Cut formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
into 4 µm thick sections.
◦ Place tissue sections on adhesive microscope slides.
◦ Bake slides at 56°C for at least 2 hours (or overnight) to
ensure proper adhesion.
2. Pretreatment:
◦ Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate in graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70% - 2 minutes
each).
◦ Immerse slides in pre-warmed pretreatment solution at 95°C
for 10 minutes.
◦ Wash in purified water, followed by an alcohol series (70%,
95%, and 100% ethanol - 2 minutes each).
B. FISH Protocol
1. Co-Denaturation and Hybridization:
◦ Apply 10 µL of MAML2 Break Apart FISH probe mixture to
each tissue section.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement to
prevent evaporation during hybridization.
◦ Co-denature slides on a pre-warmed hybridization plate at
75°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Transfer slides to a humidified hybridization chamber and
incubate at 37°C overnight (16-24 hours).
2. Post-Hybridization Wash:
◦ After hybridization, carefully remove coverslips and wash
slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Follow with a wash in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 1 minute.
3. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply a few drops of fluorescence mounting medium with
DAPI to each slide.
◦ Cover with a clean coverslip and allow to dry at room
temperature in the dark.
4. Analysis:
◦ Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filters for DAPI, FITC, and Texas Red.
◦ Analyze at least 100 interphase nuclei per specimen.
◦ Document the presence of break-apart signals (indicative of
MAML2 rearrangements) or fusion signals (indicative of
intact 11Q21 region).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative controls with each batch of
patient samples.
• Verify that each control yields the expected results before
reporting patient results.
• If controls fail, do not report patient results and repeat the test
procedure, addressing any identified issues.
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) following
verification.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the presence or absence of MAML2 rearrangement in the
LIS.
• Include an interpretation of the findings in the context of MEC
diagnosis.
• Report results using the standardized format “Positive/Negative
for MAML2 (11Q21) Rearrangement.”
• Critical results or unexpected findings should be promptly
communicated to the ordering physician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
This test reports a qualitative result (Positive/Negative), and therefore
reference intervals are not applicable.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• FISH analysis may be affected by the quality of the FFPE tissue.
• Inadequate sample size or poor tissue preservation may impede
accurate analysis.
• Cross-reaction with non-target regions is minimized but not
eliminated by careful probe design and stringent washing
conditions.
1. REFERENCE MATERIALS
Refer to the FISH probe manufacturer's insert and relevant technical
guidelines for troubleshooting and additional procedural details.

accurate and reliable results for the detection of MAML2 (11Q21)
rearrangements in MEC tissue specimens.
