Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) Immunostain, Technical Component
Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a detailed protocol for the
technical component of performing MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB)
immunostain. This includes preparing the slides, applying the stain,
performing quality controls, and generating results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) immunostain procedure
according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with the procedural steps and addressing any deficiencies.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Tissue must be properly identified and labeled with patient
information and accession number.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Tissue sections not fixed in formalin.
• Specimens with inadequate labeling or compromised integrity.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunostaining instrument (e.g., Ventana Benchmark,
Leica Bond)
• Primary antibody: MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) antibody
• Appropriate secondary antibody
• Detection kit suitable for the automated instrument being used
• Positive and negative control slides
• Slides, cover slips, and mounting medium
• Washing buffer (e.g., PBS)
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Xylene and ethanol for deparaffinization and rehydration
• Slide drying oven
1. PROCEDURE
Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 micrometer sections from FFPE tissue block and place
on positively charged slides.
2. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adhesion of tissue to
the slide.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 10 minutes, and repeat two
more times.
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval as per the manufacturer's protocol
specified for the detection kit in use (e.g., use of buffer solution
in a pressure cooker, microwave, or water bath).
Immunostaining:
1. Load slides into the automated immunostainer.
2. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions
for the specific immunostaining instrument.
3. Program the instrument for the MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB)
antibody protocol, which includes:
◦ Application of primary MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) antibody
◦ Incubation period as specified by the antibody manufacturer
◦ Application of secondary antibody and detection kit reagents
4. Run the immunostaining program as per the instrument's
guidelines.
Counterstaining:
1. Remove slides from the instrument.
2. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
4. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium and cover slips on deparaffinized,
counterstained slides.
2. Allow slides to dry completely before evaluation.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide known to express
MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) and a negative control slide (omitting the
primary antibody) in each run.
• Verify quality control slides before proceeding to patient slides
analysis.
• Document all quality control measures and ensure they meet
acceptable standards.
1. RESULT REPORTING
• The stained slides will be reviewed by a pathologist or designated
qualified personnel.
• Document any observations and results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Ensure that any critical issues relating to slide integrity or staining
results are communicated to the supervisor immediately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) positive: Cytoplasmic and/or
membranous staining in breast epithelial cells.
• MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) negative: No staining.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific limitations and
troubleshooting tips regarding the MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB)
antibody.
• Address any inconsistencies in staining or control results with
appropriate corrective action, and document all steps taken.

• Manufacturer's instructions for MAMMAGLOBIN (MGB) primary
antibody.
