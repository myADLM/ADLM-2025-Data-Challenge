MANDARIN, IGE, SERUM Analytical
Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized protocol for the analysis of
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum samples specifically for
Mandarin (orange) allergen using an automated immunoassay
analyzer.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the IgE analysis specific to Mandarin in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: To perform IgE assays according to
the procedure, ensuring proper documentation of results.
• Supervisors: To ensure staff is adequately trained, SOP is
followed, and results are reviewed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable: Serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST). The blood should be allowed to clot at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 2000–
3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Specimen Stability: Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days. If longer storage is required, serum aliquots should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP or similar)
• IgE calibration standards
• Quality control materials
• Specific Immunoassay reagents for Mandarin-specific IgE
analysis
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation and Calibration
1. Daily Start-Up: Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and
perform a daily start-up routine as outlined in the instrument
manual.
2. Calibration: Calibrate the analyzer using the provided IgE
calibration standards following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quality Control: Run quality control materials to ensure
analyzer accuracy. Record results, and confirm they fall within
the acceptable range.
6.2 Sample Handling and Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify patient information and sample integrity. Reject
samples that do not meet acceptance criteria.
◦ Allow refrigerated samples to come to room temperature
before analysis.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load serum samples onto the immunoassay analyzer
according to the instrument’s specific operating instructions.
3. Initiate Analysis:
◦ Select the appropriate IgE test specific to Mandarin allergen
as per the assay protocol.
◦ Start the analysis run, ensuring that proper barcode
identification for each sample is used.
6.3 Result Verification and Documentation
1. Printout Verification: Verify that results for each sample have
been generated without any error messages.
2. Review and Validation:
◦ Compare quality control results with the expected values. If
control runs are within the acceptable range, validate the
patient results.
◦ If quality control fails, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines, retest, and only validate results
once controls are satisfactory.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Flag and document any critical values according to
laboratory protocols.
◦ Verify all findings and sign off as per laboratory policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Frequency: Perform quality control checks at the beginning of
each shift and with each new reagent lot.
• Materials: Use commercially available control materials at
different concentration levels.
• Documentation: Record all QC results and corrective actions in
the instrument log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the LIS for physician review.
• Critical results should be communicated immediately to the
ordering physician/nurse as per laboratory protocol.
