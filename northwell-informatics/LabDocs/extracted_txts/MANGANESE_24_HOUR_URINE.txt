Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MANGANESE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standard, consistent
approach for the analysis and generation of results for manganese
(Mn) in a 24-hour urine collection. This will ensure accurate, precise,
and reliable results for clinical assessment.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of manganese in urine
samples collected over 24 hours and is intended for use in the clinical
laboratory by trained and authorized personnel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis according to this SOP and adhere to all quality control
measures. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff are
adequately trained and competent to perform the procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
Manganese (Mn): An essential trace element that can be toxic at
elevated levels.
24-hour urine collection: A method of urine collection over a 24-hour
period to measure specific analytes.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Urine collected over 24 hours. The
collection container should be prewashed with trace metal-free
nitric acid to avoid any contamination.
• Volume: A minimum of 50 mL of the 24-hour collection should be
submitted for analysis.
• Stability: Urine specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)
• Calibration standards for manganese
• Quality control materials for trace metals
• Reagent-grade or ultra-pure water
• Concentrated nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Sample preparation apparatus (centrifuge, pipettes, etc.)
• Polystyrene tubes or appropriate containers for specimen
handling
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation of Specimen
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
2. Take an aliquot of the specimen (minimum 50 mL) and transfer
it to a pre-cleaned tube.
3. Add concentrated nitric acid (trace metal grade) to the aliquot (1
mL per 100 mL of urine) to digest organic material.
7.2. Instrument Calibration
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS or AAS with manganese standards
ranging from 0 to 100 µg/L.
2. Use reagent-grade or ultra-pure water as the blank.
3. Run calibration standards at the beginning of the analysis to
ensure accurate quantification.
7.3. Quality Control
1. Analyze at least two levels of quality control materials (normal
and abnormal) with each batch of patient samples.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each analytical run.
7.4. Sample Analysis
1. Set up the ICP-MS or AAS by following the manufacturer’s
instructions for the analysis of manganese.
2. Introduce the digested urine sample into the instrument.
3. Record the response and calculate the concentration of
manganese in the sample based on the calibration curve.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all the quality control data before certifying the patient
results.
2. Report the manganese concentration in µg/L.
3. Ensure that the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection is
documented to allow for the calculation of the total manganese
excretion over the 24 hours (µg/24h).
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Range: 0.5 - 1.5 µg/24 hours (reference ranges can vary
and should be verified with the latest literature or clinical
guidelines).
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Run quality control materials daily and after any calibrations,
repairs, or maintenance.
2. Ensure all results fall within established control limits before
patient results are reported.
3. Document all quality control data and any corrective actions
taken for out-of-control situations as per laboratory protocol.
11. MAINTENANCE
1. Perform routine maintenance on the ICP-MS or AAS as
recommended by the manufacturer.
2. Keep records of maintenance, calibration, and any service
performed on the instrument.
12. SAFETY
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (lab coat,
gloves, safety glasses) while handling chemicals and
specimens.
2. Handle nitric acid and other reagents in a fume hood.
3. Dispose of waste according to the laboratory's hazardous waste
disposal guidelines.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
If analytical issues arise (e.g., unacceptable quality control results,
equipment malfunction), follow the troubleshooting guidelines
provided by the instrument manufacturer and notify the supervisor
immediately.
14. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manual for the ICP-MS or AAS.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and published literature on
manganese analysis.
15. REVIEW AND DOCUMENT CONTROL
This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change in
method, equipment, or clinical guidelines. Ensure the document is
version-controlled and the most current version is accessible to all
relevant staff.
