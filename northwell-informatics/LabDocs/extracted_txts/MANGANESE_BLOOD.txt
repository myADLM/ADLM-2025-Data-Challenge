Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for the Analysis of
Manganese in Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of manganese in blood samples to ensure accurate and reliable
results. This procedure includes sample preparation, analysis, quality
control, and result reporting.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of manganese in blood samples
within the analytical phase in the lab.
3. DEFINITIONS
• ICP-MS: Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, the
analytical technique used for manganese analysis.
• Calibration standard: Solutions of known manganese
concentration used to calibrate the ICP-MS.
• Quality Control (QC) samples: Reference materials with known
manganese concentrations used to ensure accuracy and
precision.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for the preparation,
analysis, and preliminary data review.
• Lab Supervisors/Managers: Responsible for reviewing and
approving results, as well as ensuring adherence to this SOP.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ICP-MS system
• Trace metal-free blood collection tubes
• Calibration standards for Manganese
• Quality Control samples
• Reagents: high-purity nitric acid, deionized water
• Sample tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and protective gear
6. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND
HANDLING
• Acceptable Specimens: Whole blood collected in trace metal-
free tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed specimens, clotted
specimens, and those collected in non-trace metal-free tubes.
• Specimen Handling: Ensure specimens are mixed thoroughly by
gentle inversion and kept at 2-8°C if analysis is not immediately
performed. Avoid prolonged storage.
7. CALIBRATION AND QC PROCEDURE
Calibration
1. Prepare calibration standards of manganese in ranges that
include the expected concentration in blood (e.g., 0, 2, 5, 10, 20
ppb).
2. Run the standards on the ICP-MS and generate a calibration
curve.
3. Ensure the R-square value is greater than 0.995 to proceed.
Quality Controls
1. Include a low, medium, and high QC sample in each batch of
analysis.
2. Analyze QC samples and verify they fall within accepted ranges
before proceeding with sample analysis.
8. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Aliquoting: Aliquot 0.5-1 mL of whole blood sample into a
clean, trace metal-free polypropylene tube.
2. Digestion:
◦ Add 0.5 mL of high-purity nitric acid to each tube and mix
well.
◦ Allow the samples to digest at room temperature for 30
minutes.
◦ Dilute with deionized water to a final volume of 5 mL.
3. Mixing: Vortex mix each sample to ensure homogeneity.
9. ICP-MS ANALYSIS
1. Set up the ICP-MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions and standard laboratory practices.
2. Prime the system and allow it to stabilize.
3. Load the samples, blanks, calibration standards, and QC
samples onto the auto-sampler.
4. Begin the analysis run sequence.
5. Ensure that internal standard corrections are applied to account
for matrix effects and instrument fluctuations.
10. DATA REVIEW AND ACCEPTANCE
CRITERIA
1. Data Review:
◦ Analyze the data output from the ICP-MS.
◦ Ensure all QC samples fall within their specified ranges.
◦ Verify the calibration curve is linear and all standards meet
acceptance criteria.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Calibration curve R-square value must be ≥ 0.995.
◦ QC samples must be within ±10% of their known values.
◦ Any samples beyond acceptable control limits should
prompt a batch reanalysis.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are to be reviewed and verified by a laboratory
supervisor for accuracy.
2. Results are documented in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Critical values should be communicated immediately to the
relevant healthcare provider following the laboratory’s policy for
critical results.
12. QUALITY CONTROL AND
TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Routine performance checks and maintenance of the ICP-MS
should be performed according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. If QC samples are out of range, troubleshoot the ICP-MS
system, reagents, and sample preparation protocols.
3. Document any deviations from the SOP and actions taken to
resolve issues.

samples.
14. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
All steps performed, results obtained, and any deviations must be
documented and archived in accordance with laboratory policies and
CLIA regulations.
This SOP ensures that the analysis of manganese in blood samples
is carried out consistently, ethically, and accurately, leading to reliable
results that support clinical decision-making.
