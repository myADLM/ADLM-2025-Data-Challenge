Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
MANGANESE/CREATININE RATIO, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed, step-by-step
procedure for the determination of Manganese/Creatinine Ratio in
random urine samples, ensuring accurate, consistent, and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP and for troubleshooting any issues
that may arise during the process.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Sample Type: Random urine
Volume Required: A minimum of 10 mL of urine
Stability: Samples must be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24
hours of collection. Specimens may be frozen at -20°C for up to 1
month if delayed analysis is necessary.
Unacceptable Specimens:
- Specimens with insufficient volume
- Specimens with visible contamination
- Specimens without proper labeling including collection date and
time
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
The following equipment and supplies are required for the analysis:
- Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) or Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) - Calibrated volumetric
pipettes - Calibration standards for Manganese and Creatinine -
High-purity water for dilutions - Disposable 50 mL polypropylene
tubes - Appropriate external quality control materials
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
- Verify calibration of equipment and reagent preparation as per
manufacturer's guidelines. - Ensure all equipment is cleaned and free
of contaminants before use.
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow urine samples to reach room temperature if refrigerated. 2.
Mix samples thoroughly before aliquoting. 3. Dilute urine samples in
a 1:10 ratio with high-purity water.
Standard Preparation:
- Prepare calibration standards for Manganese and Creatinine
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure standards cover the
expected range of concentrations found in urine samples.
Manganese Analysis:
1. Set up the AAS or ICP-MS according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Analyze calibration standards to create a calibration curve. 3. Run
quality control samples to ensure accuracy and precision. 4. Analyze
the diluted urine samples. 5. Record Manganese concentration in μg/
L.
Creatinine Analysis:
1. Measure Creatinine concentration using the Jaffe method or
enzymatic method. 2. Run calibration standards to ensure accuracy.
3. Analyze the diluted urine samples. 4. Record Creatinine
concentration in mg/dL.
Calculation:
- Calculate the Manganese/Creatinine Ratio by dividing the
Manganese concentration (μg/L) by the Creatinine concentration
(mg/dL).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
- Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples
analyzed. - Use certified reference materials to ensure validity of
results. - Any deviation from acceptable control limits must be
investigated and documented.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
- Results are to be reviewed and verified by trained personnel before
reporting. - Report Manganese/Creatinine ratio in μg/mg on the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). - Ensure any comments related
to sample integrity or analysis issues are included in the final report.
Reference Intervals:
- Normal reference intervals for Manganese/Creatinine ratios may
vary and should be established based on literature and institutional
guidelines.
7. INTERPRETATION AND LIMITATIONS
- Refer to AAS or ICP-MS manuals for potential interferences or
limitations - Ensure completeness and accuracy in the documented
results. - Results outside reference intervals should be reviewed for
potential pre-analytical or analytical errors.
8. REFERENCES
- Instrument user manuals (AAS or ICP-MS) - Relevant literature on
Manganese/Creatinine ratios
Documenting detailed results and interpretations are crucial for
ensuring accuracy and reliability in providing Manganese/Creatinine
ratios from urine samples, facilitating effective patient care and
research outcomes.
