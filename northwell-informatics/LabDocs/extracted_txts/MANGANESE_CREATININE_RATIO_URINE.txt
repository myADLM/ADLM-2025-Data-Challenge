Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Manganese/
Creatinine Ratio, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide consistent, reliable
guidelines for the analytical phase of generating results for the
Manganese/Creatinine Ratio in urine specimens. The protocol aims
to ensure accuracy in quantifying manganese and creatinine
concentrations, maintaining quality control, and appropriately
reporting the results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
analyzing urine specimens for Manganese/Creatinine Ratio at this
laboratory. This protocol outlines the procedure for sample
preparation, analysis, quality control, and reporting results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to adhere to the procedures, ensure accurate
documentation, and report any discrepancies immediately to the
supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
Manganese/Creatinine Ratio (Mn/Cr ratio): A diagnostic urinary test
that quantifies the ratio of manganese concentration to creatinine
concentration to assess metal exposure and kidney function.
1. SAFETY
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat, and
safety goggles must be worn at all times. Laboratory personnel
should be familiar with the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for
any chemicals used in the analysis. Dispose of all biological and
chemical waste according to laboratory guidelines.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
A. Preferred Specimen:
• 10-20 mL of urine collected in a clean, leak-proof container.
• Specimens should be collected any time of the day, preferably
‘first morning void’.
B. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
• Specimens with visible contamination such as blood or excessive
sediment.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the container
or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
A. Equipment:
1. Atomic absorption spectrometer or inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) for manganese measurement.
2. Automated or manual creatinine analyzer.
3. Centrifuge.
4. Pipettes.
B. Reagents:
1. Calibration standards for manganese.
2. Reagents for creatinine measurement according to the
manufacturer's specifications.
3. Deionized water.
C. Supplies:
1. Urine collection containers.
2. Disposable pipette tips.
3. Centrifuge tubes.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the urine sample is at room temperature before
analysis.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
3. Aliquot the sample into a pre-labeled centrifuge tube.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
debris.
B. Manganese Measurement:
1. Follow the instrument-specific protocol for manganese analysis
using atomic absorption spectrometry or ICP-MS.
2. Calibrate the instrument using manganese standards.
3. Analyze the sample for manganese content.
C. Creatinine Measurement:
1. Measure creatinine concentration using enzymatic or
colorimetric methods as per the creatinine analyzer's
specifications.
2. Ensure appropriate calibration and quality control for accuracy.
D. Calculating the Mn/Cr Ratio:
1. Compute the ratio by dividing the manganese concentration by
the creatinine concentration.
2. Verify calculation results for accuracy.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Material:
1. Use commercial quality control samples for both manganese
and creatinine as per the lab's guidelines.
B. Procedure:
1. Perform quality control for each batch of samples analyzed.
2. Record the results according to site-specific guidelines.
3. Investigate and document any failures or discrepancies in the
quality control process.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Documentation:
1. Enter the Mn/Cr ratio into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Review and verify the results by the designated technologist.
B. Communicating Critical Results:
1. Report critical values to the requester immediately, following the
laboratory's critical values policy.
2. Document the communication in the patient's record.
3. REFERENCES
Refer to the instrument's user manual, reagent kits' package inserts,
and site-specific guidelines for detailed procedures beyond the scope
of this SOP.
1. REVISIONS AND APPROVALS
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required based on
regulatory changes, equipment updates, or procedural
improvements. All revisions must be approved by the laboratory
supervisor and the quality assurance manager.
