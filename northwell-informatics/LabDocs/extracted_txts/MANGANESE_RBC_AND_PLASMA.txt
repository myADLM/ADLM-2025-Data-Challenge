Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Manganese,
RBC and Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for manganese in red blood cells (RBC) and
plasma specimens. This procedure ensures accuracy and
reproducibility of test results.
2. DEFINITION
Manganese is an essential nutrient for human health, but either
deficiency or excess can lead to adverse health conditions. This
procedure applies to the measurement of manganese concentration
in RBC and plasma specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence and addressing
any deficiencies.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Class II Biological Safety Cabinet
• Microscope
• Pipettes and Tips
• Disposable Polypropylene Tubes and Vials
• Calibration Standards for Manganese
• Quality Control (QC) Materials
• RBC and Plasma Samples
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory Gloves
• Laboratory Coat
• Safety Goggles
• Reagents: Nitric Acid, Ultrapure Water
5. SAMPLE PREPARATION
A) RBC Separation Procedure:
1. Centrifuge Specimens: Centrifuge whole blood samples at
1500 g for 10 minutes to separate plasma from RBC.
2. Aspiration: Carefully aspirate the plasma into a separate
polypropylene tube.
3. RBC Washing: Wash RBCs three times with isotonic saline.
After each wash, centrifuge at 1500 g for 5 minutes and
carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the RBC
pellet.
4. RBC Lysis: Lyse the washed RBCs by resuspending the pellet
in at least 15 volumes of lysis buffer or ultrapure water.
5. Aliquot: Aliquot 1 mL of lysed RBCs into a clean polypropylene
tube for analysis.
B) Plasma Preparation Procedure:
1. Aliquoting: Aliquot 1 mL of the initially separated plasma into a
clean polypropylene tube.
2. Storage: Store both RBC and plasma samples at -20°C until
analysis.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Digestion:
1. Safety Precautions: Perform digestion in a fume hood. Wear
appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, goggles).
2. Digestion Process:
◦ Add 0.5 mL of the RBC or plasma sample into a digestion
vessel.
◦ Add 2 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the sample.
◦ Seal the digestion vessel and allow the sample to digest at
room temperature for 1 hour.
◦ Heat the digestion vessel at 100°C for 3 hours until the
sample is completely digested.
B) ICP-MS Analysis:
1. Calibration: Prepare calibration standards for manganese as
per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS using the prepared manganese
standards.
◦ Run control samples before analyzing test samples.
3. Sample Loading: Load the digested samples into the ICP-MS
auto-sampler rack.
4. Analysis:
◦ Analyze each sample in triplicate to ensure reproducibility.
◦ Record and review the data generated by the ICP-MS.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples (known concentrations of manganese)
alongside patient samples.
◦ Perform QC tests at the beginning, middle, and end of each
batch of samples analyzed.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
validate the accuracy of results.
3. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ QC results must fall within ±2 standard deviations (SD) from
the mean.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable limits, recalibrate the
ICP-MS and repeat the analyses.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Validate results by reviewing the triplicate data points for
consistency.
2. Calculate the average manganese concentration from the
triplicate analyses.
3. Report results in appropriate units (e.g., µg/L for plasma; µg/g
hemoglobin for RBC).
