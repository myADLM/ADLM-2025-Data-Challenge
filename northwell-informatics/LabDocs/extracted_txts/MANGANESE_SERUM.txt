Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Manganese, Serum
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the analysis and reporting of serum
manganese levels, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
manganese serum analysis following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP, including equipment maintenance, quality control, and
documentation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a trace-element-free, royal blue-top tube with
no anticoagulant.
Specimen Collection:
• Ensure specimens are collected following standard phlebotomy
procedures.
• Invert tube gently to mix the specimen and let it clot at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes before centrifugation.
Specimen Handling and Transport:
• Centrifuge specimen to separate serum from cells.
• Transfer serum to a trace-element-free, approved transport
container.
• Store and transport specimens at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Specimens are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated. For
longer storage, specimens may be frozen at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes with additives or anticoagulants.
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens not separated from cells within the specified time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
suitable analytical instrument.
• Trace-element-free collection tubes.
• Trace-element-free transfer and storage containers.
• Calibration standards (traceable to NIST standards).
• Quality Control (QC) materials.
• Deionized water.
• Pipettes and pipette tips (trace-metal free).
• Nitric acid (trace-metal grade).
• Microcentrifuge tubes (trace-metal free).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards covering the expected
concentration range of manganese.
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure all standards and reagents are trace-element-free.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
◦ Mix gently but thoroughly by inversion.
◦ Aliquot 0.5 mL serum specimen into a trace-element-free
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Blank and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare a blank (deionized water) and QC samples with
known manganese concentrations.
B. Manganese Analysis:
1. Set up the ICP-MS instrument and adjust for manganese
detection.
2. Aspirate calibration standards, blanks, and QC samples to
verify instrument performance and establish calibration curves.
3. Aspirate patient serum specimens, ensuring no carryover by
running deionized water between samples.
4. Record the counts for manganese and convert to concentration
using the calibration curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each
analytical run.
• QC materials should be within acceptable ranges before reporting
patient results.
• Investigate and reanalyze samples if QC results are outside
acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results to the nearest whole number in µg/L.
• Verify all results manually before releasing.
• Record any observed deviations or issues during the analysis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Provide reference intervals as per the current clinical guidelines:
• Manganese, serum: 0.5 - 1.5 µg/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure accurate specimen handling to avoid contamination.
• Interpret results in the context of the patient's clinical condition,
considering potential interferences.
1. REFERENCES
• Appropriate clinical and laboratory standards (e.g., CLIA, CAP).
• Manufacturer's manuals for instruments and reagents.
• Peer-reviewed literature on the analysis of manganese in
biological specimens.
Review and Revision History:
• Document all revisions and review annually to ensure the protocol
remains up-to-date and compliant with relevant guidelines.
