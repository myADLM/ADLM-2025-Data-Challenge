Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Measuring Mango-Specific IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedure for
the measurement of Mango-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in
serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
or other approved analytical methods.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of Mango-specific IgE levels in serum samples within the
clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to ensure that the
procedures described in this SOP are followed accurately and
consistently to obtain reliable and reproducible results. It is also the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to verify the adherence to
the protocol and to address any deviations or issues that arise during
the analytical process.
4. DEFINITIONS
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
reactions. Mango-specific IgE: IgE antibodies that specifically target
mango allergens.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL is preferred.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Stability: Samples are stable for up to 1 month at -20°C, and up
to 1 year at -80°C.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader (capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm)
• ELISA kits or approved alternative for Mango-specific IgE
• Microcentrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate washer (optional)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Reagents provided in the ELISA kit (coated microtiter plates,
wash buffer, substrate, stop solution, standards, and controls)
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions provided with the ELISA kit.
2. Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature before use.
7.2 Sample Preparation
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix by
gentle inversion.
2. Centrifuge samples at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
7.3 Plate Setup
1. Label the ELISA plate with appropriate sample identifiers,
including standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Pipette the standards, controls, and samples into the
designated wells according to the ELISA kit instructions. Use
duplicates or triplicates for better accuracy.
7.4 Incubation and Wash Steps
1. Add the detection antibody to each well according to the kit
instructions.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time.
3. Wash the plate thoroughly using the wash buffer. Follow the
instructions provided with the ELISA kit.
7.5 Detection and Measurement
1. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate according
to the kit instructions, usually at room temperature.
2. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
3. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA plate reader.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
the validity of the results.
2. Ensure that the included standards create a standard curve that
meets the manufacturer’s criteria for validity.
3. If controls fall outside the expected range, investigate and
rectify the issue before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
4. Document all quality control results in the appropriate logs.
9. CALCULATION AND RESULT REPORTING
1. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance readings of the
standards using four-parameter logistic curve fitting.
2. Calculate the Mango-specific IgE concentrations of the samples
by interpolating their absorbance readings from the standard
curve.
3. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and review them for accuracy.
4. Report results according to the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to
cross-reactivity and sensitivity.
• Ensure that hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples are avoided as
they may interfere with the test results.
