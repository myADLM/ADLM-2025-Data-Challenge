Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Mannan Binding
Lectin Complement Pathway, Functional, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for Mannan Binding
Lectin Complement Pathway, Functional, Serum. This includes
the steps for preparing and running the assay, quality control,
troubleshooting, and reporting results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The responsibility for performing this procedure lies with trained
laboratory personnel. It is the responsibility of laboratory
supervisors to ensure that all staff performing the assay are
adequately trained and follow this SOP as written.
3. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
The Mannan Binding Lectin Complement Pathway, Functional,
Serum assay measures the capacity of serum to activate the
lectin pathway of the complement system. The assay detects
the activation of complement components after the binding of
mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to a mannan-coated surface.
4. SPECIMEN
◦ Preferred/acceptable: Serum samples collected in red-top
tubes or serum separator tubes (SST).
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens, or
samples that are not appropriately labeled or not separated
from the clot within 2 hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450
nm and 620 nm
◦ Microplate washer or manual washing apparatus
◦ Pipettes and tips (single and multi-channel)
◦ Reagent reservoirs
◦ Mannan-coated microplates
◦ MBL assay buffer
◦ Complement standards and controls
◦ Chromogenic substrate
◦ Stop solution
6. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before beginning the assay.
◦ Prepare any required dilutions of standards, controls, and
samples as per the assay instructions.
B. Mannan-Coated Microplate Assay
1. Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples, standards, and
controls to the appropriate wells of the mannan-coated
microplate. Incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
2. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of MBL assay buffer
per well. Ensure complete removal of wash buffer after
the final wash.
3. Add 100 µL of chromogenic substrate to each well.
Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
5. Read the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference at 620
nm using a microplate reader.
C. Calculations
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
the standards against their respective concentrations on a
graph.
◦ Determine the concentration of the samples and controls by
comparing their absorbance to the standard curve using
appropriate software or calculations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run controls with each assay batch. Controls must fall
within predetermined ranges for the assay to be valid.
◦ Perform regular calibration and maintenance of the
microplate reader and washer according to manufacturer's
specifications.
◦ Periodically verify the mannan-coated microplates’ ability to
bind MBL by running proficiency samples.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Invalid controls: repeat the entire assay. Check the
expiration dates of reagents and ensure proper storage
conditions. Verify that all equipment is functioning correctly
and has been properly calibrated.
◦ High background absorbance: ensure thorough washing of
plates, and be cautious of pipetting errors. Verify the
specificity and activity of the chromogenic substrate.
◦ Inconsistent results: check for pipetting accuracy, reagent
preparation, and sample handling errors.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review the calculated concentration of MBL for consistency
and alignment with control values.
◦ Report the results along with the normal reference range.
Highlight any abnormal findings and ensure documentation
on the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Critical values must be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider and
documented as per laboratory policy.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ This interval will vary based on the method used and should
be determined by each laboratory. Reference ranges
provided by the kit manufacturer should be followed unless
otherwise established by the laboratory.
