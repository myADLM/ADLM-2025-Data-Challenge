Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase in
Generating Results for Maple Red (Acer Rubrum) IgE
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the standardized procedures for analyzing, measuring and
generating results for Maple Red (Acer Rubrum) Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) in patient specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This
document details the workflow from the initial specimen preparation
to the final result reporting to ensure accurate and reliable data.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as per this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of supervisory staff to ensure that all
personnel are trained and competent in performing these
procedures.
• It is the responsibility of both laboratory personnel and the
supervisory team to identify and address any deviations from this
SOP.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION:
a) Specimen Type:
• Acceptable: Serum or plasma collected in an SST (Serum
Separator Tube) or EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic Acid)
tube.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted samples.
b) Specimen Storage:
• Upon receipt, specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
processed within 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower if the analysis cannot be completed within the given
timeframe.
c) Specimen Preparation:
• Allow serum/plasma samples to reach room temperature prior to
analysis.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500xg for 10 minutes to ensure
separation and removal of particulates.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Specific IgE Assay Kit for Maple Red (Acer Rubrum)
• Micropipettes (10-100 µL, 100-1000 µL) and tips
• Calibrated microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at
450 nm
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Wash buffer (provided in the assay kit)
• Control solutions (Negative and Positive, included in the assay kit)
• Calibrators provided in the assay kit
• Timer
• Laboratory bench centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE:
a) Initial Setup:
• Ensure all equipment and reagents are verified for calibration and
within expiration dates.
• Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves, lab coat, and safety
goggles.
b) Running the Assay:
1. Prepare all reagents, samples, controls, and calibrators as per
instruction in the assay kit manual.
2. Pipette the required volume of controls, calibrators, and patient
samples into the designated wells of the microplate.
3. Add the specific IgE detection antibody to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the required period (as specified
by the assay kit).
5. Wash the plate using the washing buffer to remove unbound
material.
6. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate again at
37°C.
7. Perform another washing step to remove unbound conjugate.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate at room
temperature in the dark.
9. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader.
c) Quality Control:
• Run Negative and Positive controls with each batch of samples.
• Acceptable control ranges must be established and adhered to.
Control results outside these ranges indicate an assay failure and
necessitate repeat testing.
1. CALCULATION OF RESULTS:
a) Generate a standard curve from the calibrator results by plotting
absorbance against known IgE concentrations. b) Determine the IgE
concentration in patient samples by interpolation from the standard
curve. c) Ensure the linearity and accuracy of the standard curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
a) Result Interpretation:
• Refer to the standard reference intervals for IgE specific to Maple
Red (Acer Rubrum). b) Report Format:
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Include the concentration of IgE, control results, and any
comments regarding assay performance (e.g., technical issues,
repeat analyses). c) Critical Results:
• Any value falling within critical limits must be communicated to the
ordering physician immediately and recorded in the laboratory's
critical results log.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the Specific IgE Assay Kit insert for detailed information
on any limitations that may impact results, such as interfering
substances or non-specific binding.
