STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: MAPLE SYRUP URINE
DISEASE GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for the Maple Syrup Urine
Disease (MSUD) gene panel test. This ensures the accuracy,
reproducibility, and reliability of test results for clinical decision-
making.
Responsibility: This procedure is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel trained in molecular genetic testing. It is the
responsibility of the staff and supervisors to ensure that gene panel
testing is performed and documented in accordance with the
procedure, including any corrective actions that may be required.
1. TEST BACKGROUND
Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disorder
caused by mutations in genes encoding the branched-chain alpha-
keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The MSUD gene panel is a next-
generation sequencing (NGS) test designed to detect variants in
these specific genes.
Genes included in the panel:
• BCKDHA
• BCKDHB
• DBT
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• PCR amplification reagents
• NGS library preparation kit
• Sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq)
• Bioinformatics analysis software
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Ensure specimen has been collected, received, and
accessioned properly.
2. Extract genomic DNA from the submitted specimen (e.g., blood
or saliva) using an appropriate DNA extraction kit.
3. Measure the DNA concentration and assess the quality using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop) and/or a fluorometer (e.g.,
Qubit).
4. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
B. PCR Amplification and Library Preparation
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, including specific primers for the MSUD gene
panel.
2. Amplify the target regions by setting up the PCR with
appropriate cycling conditions.
3. Verify the PCR product by running a small aliquot on an
agarose gel.
4. Use the amplified PCR product for NGS library preparation,
following the library preparation kit protocol.
5. Normalize the library concentration, pool libraries, and prepare
for sequencing.
C. NGS Sequencing
1. Load the prepared library onto the sequencer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform sequencing run and monitor the progress.
3. Ensure quality control metrics (e.g., cluster density, Q30 scores)
are within acceptable ranges.
D. Data Analysis
1. Perform primary data analysis using the sequencing platform’s
software pipeline to generate FASTQ files.
2. Use bioinformatics software to align the reads to the human
reference genome (e.g., hg19 or hg38) and call variants in the
MSUD-related genes.
3. Filter and annotate the variants based on predefined criteria
(e.g., allele frequency, predicted impact).
4. Review results and classify variants according to the ACMG
guidelines.
5. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the findings,
including pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of
uncertain significance (VUS).
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in the testing workflow.
2. Run internal quality control samples with each batch of testing
to ensure the reliability of results.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
testing process and perform root cause analysis if necessary.
F. Reporting Results
1. Prepare the final report for the medical director or designated
personnel to review and sign off.
2. Ensure report includes patient information, method description,
identified variants, interpretation, and recommendations.
3. Issue the report to the referring clinician with appropriate
comments and recommendations.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable. The report will detail specific mutations and their
clinical significance using available databases and literature.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
2. Follow institutional safety guidelines for handling biological
specimens and reagents.
3. Dispose of waste according to biomedical waste disposal
regulations.
4. Ensure the use of appropriate personal protective equipment
(PPE).
5. REFERENCES
6. ACMG Recommendations for Standards for Interpretation and
Reporting of Sequence Variants.
7. Manufacturer instructions for DNA extraction kits, PCR
reagents, NGS library preparation, sequencing platforms, and
bioinformatics software.
8. DOCUMENTATION
9. Maintain a record of all performed tests, including worksheets,
electronic data, and final reports.
10. Document details of the DNA extraction, PCR setup,
sequencing run, and result interpretations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
By following the above protocol, laboratory staff can ensure that
accurate and reproducible results are generated for the MSUD gene
panel test, facilitating effective clinical decision-making and patient
care.
