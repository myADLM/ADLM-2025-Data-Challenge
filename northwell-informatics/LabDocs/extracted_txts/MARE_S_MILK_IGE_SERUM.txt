STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for MARE'S MILK, IGE, SERUM within
the laboratory. All steps from specimen handling through result
verification are detailed to ensure accurate and reproducible data.
Responsibility:
Designated Laboratory Technologists are responsible for carrying out
the procedures defined in this SOP, performing quality control
checks, and ensuring that results are accurately documented,
verified, and reported.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL Collection
Container: Serum separator tube (SST)
Handling and storage:
• After collection, allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
• Store serum aliquots at 2-8°C if analyzing within 72 hours,
otherwise store at -20°C for extended storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens with incorrect labeling or without essential details like
collection date and time.
• Specimens exceeding handling and storage conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens ADVIA Centaur
XP)
• Pipettes, calibration verification tools
• Refrigerators (-20°C and 2-8°C)
Reagents:
• Specific reagents for MARE'S MILK, IGE assays (as per
manufacturer's guidelines)
• Quality control materials: High, Medium, Low serum pools for IGE
Supplies:
• SST tubes
• Labeled aliquot tubes
• Disposable gloves, lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of the Automated Immunoassay Analyzer:
• Verify calibration status of the analyzer.
• Load the reagents specific to MARE'S MILK, IGE assay.
• Perform required daily startup and background checks.
• Ensure a validated daily log for room temperature (20-26°C) and
humidity (15-85%) is maintained.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control serum pools (High, Medium, Low) before
processing patient samples.
• Verify control results are within established limits before
proceeding with specimen analysis.
• Document quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
Analytical Testing:
1. Load serum samples onto the analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer for MARE'S MILK, IGE target analysis as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Start the run and monitor status.
4. Review initial outputs on the analyzer screen.
5. Upon completion of the run, transfer data/results to the LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
Reporting Results:
• Verify all results for patient serum samples.
• Confirm quality control results are acceptable.
• Validate final patient results in LIS.
• Communicate critical results immediately as per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals:
• Utilize manufacturer's insert for reference intervals specific to
MARE’S MILK IGE.
Method Limitations: Refer to the assay manufacturer's guidelines and
package insert for any specific method limitations.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
If any quality control results fall outside acceptable limits:
• Re-run the affected control level.
• If re-run results remain unacceptable, halt patient testing and
troubleshoot as per operator manual and laboratory supervisory
guidelines.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions.
If analyzer flags sample results:
• Re-analyze flagged samples.
• Review flagged results with supervisor if necessary.
• Document issues and actions taken.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Maintain records for:
• Specimen receipt and handling
• Equipment calibration and maintenance
• Quality control results
• Patient results
• Corrective actions and troubleshooting
Ensure all documentation is accurate and complete for audits and
regulatory compliance.
