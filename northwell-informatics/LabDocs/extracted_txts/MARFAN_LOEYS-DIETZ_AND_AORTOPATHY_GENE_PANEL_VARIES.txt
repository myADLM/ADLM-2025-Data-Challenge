collection
◦ Saliva and Buccal swabs: store at room temperature and
process within 7 days of collection
3. Specimen Preparation:
◦ DNA extraction: perform using an appropriate, validated kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions
4. Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Adequate volume of specimen collected
◦ Properly labeled and accompanied by a requisition form
5. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimen tubes leaking or broken
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume or poorly labeled
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
1. Equipment:
◦ Thermal cycler for PCR amplification
◦ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micro-pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
2. Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ PCR master mix
◦ NGS library preparation kit
◦ Buffer solutions
3. Supplies:
◦ EDTA collection tubes
◦ Collection kits for saliva and buccal swabs
◦ Sterile centrifuge tubes
C. Analytical Procedure
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction from
blood, saliva, or buccal swabs
◦ Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer
◦ Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix as per kit instructions
◦ Amplify target regions using specific primers for Marfan,
Loeys-Dietz, and Aortopathy genes
◦ Verify amplification success using gel electrophoresis
3. Library Preparation:
◦ Prepare NGS libraries from amplified DNA using a library
preparation kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions
◦ Quantify and qualify the prepared libraries using a suitable
method (e.g., Bioanalyzer or Qubit)
4. Next-Generation Sequencing:
◦ Load prepared libraries into the NGS machine
◦ Perform sequencing as per instrument protocol
◦ Monitor sequencing run for quality and completeness
5. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
◦ Use bioinformatics tools to analyze sequencing data
◦ Identify and annotate genetic variants related to Marfan,
Loeys-Dietz, and Aortopathy
◦ Confirm results using appropriate validation methods (e.g.,
Sanger sequencing)
D. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Perform control runs with known positive and negative
samples
◦ Monitor instrument and reagent performance regularly
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs
3. Documentation:
◦ Maintain logbooks for DNA extraction, PCR setup,
sequencing runs, and data analysis
◦ Document all quality control measures taken, including
troubleshooting steps when necessary
E. Reporting Results
1. Review and Verification:
◦ Ensure all data is reviewed and verified by qualified
personnel
◦ Cross-check results with clinical information for correlation
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Provide comprehensive interpretation of genetic findings
◦ Include recommendations for further testing or clinical
management where applicable
3. Result Transmitting:
◦ Generate the final report using the laboratory information
system (LIS)
◦ Communicate results to the requesting physician
4. Documentation and Record-keeping:
◦ Store all raw data, processed results, and reports following
laboratory record-keeping protocols
F. Handling and troubleshooting of issues:
1. If any issues or aberrations in results are found during analysis:
◦ Recheck the specimen quality and preparation steps
◦ Perform an analysis run on another instrument if possible
◦ Consult with the on-call supervisor if the issue persists
2. Retain proper documentation of any issues and the corrective
steps undertaken.
