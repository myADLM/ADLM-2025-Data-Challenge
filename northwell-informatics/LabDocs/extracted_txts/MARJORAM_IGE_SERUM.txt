Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Marjoram-specific IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Marjoram-specific IgE in serum using
immunoassay methods.
2. PRINCIPLE Quantitative determination of Marjoram-specific IgE in
human serum is performed to evaluate allergic sensitization.
3. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel trained to perform
immunoassay testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
4. RESPONSIBILITY Designated staff are responsible for performing
the assay, validating results, recording data, and performing quality
control.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS - Specimen: Serum - Volume:
Minimum 1 mL serum - Collection: Blood collected in a plain red-top
tube or SST (Serum Separator Tube) - Stability: Serum should be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or at -20°C for longer storage.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES - Immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
Phadia® 250) - Calibrators specific to Marjoram IgE - Controls (low,
medium, and high levels) - Reagent kits specific for Marjoram IgE -
Pipettes and tips - Centrifuge - Sample tubes - Personal protective
equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation 1. Mix serum samples gently to ensure uniformity. 2. If
serum is frozen, thaw completely at room temperature and mix
gently. 3. Ensure all reagents and controls are at appropriate
temperature (as specified by manufacturer).
Assay Setup 1. Turn on and calibrate the immunoassay analyzer
according to manufacturer instructions. 2. Load reagents, calibrators,
and controls onto the analyzer. 3. Enter sample IDs into the system
or load the barcode information. 4. Load serum samples onto the
analyzer.
Running the Assay 1. Follow automated testing system instructions
to start the run. 2. Ensure appropriate detection and reporting
settings are configured (e.g., specific for IgE). 3. Allow the assay to
proceed according to programmed protocol.
Result Generation 1. Review assay outputs from the immunoassay
analyzer. 2. Verify results using control levels: - Ensure that all control
values fall within the acceptable range. - If controls are out of range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay. 3. Record Marjoram-specific IgE
concentrations obtained from the analyzer. 4. Document any
anomalies or issues encountered during the assay.
8. QUALITY CONTROL - Perform internal quality control checks: -
Run at least three levels of controls (low, medium, and high) with
each batch of patient samples. - Document control results. - Validate
instrument calibration regularly as recommended by the
manufacturer. - Perform proficiency testing as required to maintain
CLIA certification.
9. CALCULATIONS - The immunoassay analyzer performs
calculations based on pre-programmed calibration curves. - Ensure
that results are within the linear range for the assay.
10. REPORTING RESULTS - Results are reviewed and verified by
trained personnel. - Enter verified results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). - Critical or abnormal findings should be
communicated to the clinician promptly.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS - Refer to the manufacturer's product
insert for specific limitations of the Marjoram-specific IgE assay. -
Ensure samples are free from hemolysis or lipemia as these can
interfere with assay performance.
12. REFERENCES - Manufacturer's product insert for Marjoram-
specific IgE assay kit. - Laboratory internal quality assurance
protocols. - CLIA guidelines for high-complexity testing.
13. RECORDS MANAGEMENT - Maintain complete records of
assay runs, including control data and calibration logs. - Document
any corrective actions taken during assays and quality control
checks.
14. SAFETY - Follow appropriate laboratory safety protocols. - Use
PPE including gloves and lab coat. - Dispose of biohazard material
according to laboratory guidelines.
This SOP ensures standardization, accuracy, and reliability of results
for Marjoram-specific IgE in serum within the clinical laboratory.
