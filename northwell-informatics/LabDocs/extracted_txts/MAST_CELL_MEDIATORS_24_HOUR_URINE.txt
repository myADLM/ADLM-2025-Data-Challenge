Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mast Cell Mediators,
24-Hour Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of Mast
Cell Mediators (such as histamine and serotonin) in a 24-hour
urine specimen.
Responsibility:
◦ It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure that the
analysis of Mast Cell Mediators is performed accurately and
consistently according to this protocol.
◦ The designated laboratory personnel, including
technologists, are responsible for performing the test and for
notifying the supervisor of any irregularities or issues during
the analysis.
2. SPECIMEN
Acceptable:
◦ Full 24-hour urine collection. The urine should be collected
in a container provided by the laboratory, containing an
appropriate preservative (e.g., 6N HCl). The initial portion
should be discarded, and the remaining urine over the next
24 hours should be collected, including the first void of the
next day. The container should be kept refrigerated during
the collection period.
Unacceptable:
◦ Incorrectly timed or partially collected 24-hour urine
samples.
◦ Specimens without preservative or improperly preserved.
◦ Specimens that have been exposed to room temperature for
extended periods without refrigeration.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
system or preferred analytical system verified for mast cell
mediators.
◦ Eppendorf pipettes and tips.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Analytical balance.
◦ Standard laboratory glassware (vials, test tubes).
◦ Reagents for extraction and derivatization specific to mast
cell mediator analysis.
◦ Control materials specific to mast cell mediators analysis.
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine sample thoroughly to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Measure and record the total volume of the collected
urine.
3. Aliquot approximately 10 mL of the sample into a labeled
centrifuge tube.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
5. Aliquot the supernatant into another clean, labeled tube
for analysis.
Extraction and Derivatization:
1. Follow the specific extraction and derivatization protocol
provided by the manufacturer of the mast cell mediator
reagents or as validated by the laboratory.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls
following the reagent protocol.
Chromatography (LC-MS or other approved method):
1. Set up the LC-MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and the laboratory-standardized method for
mast cell mediators.
2. Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and controls into
the auto-sampler.
3. Start the run, ensuring that all laboratory safety
procedures are followed.
Data Analysis:
1. Once the run is complete, analyze the chromatograms.
2. Ensure all peaks corresponding to the mast cell mediators
(such as histamine and serotonin) are correctly identified
and quantified against calibration standards.
3. Validate the run by comparing control measurements with
established quality control limits.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run appropriate quality control materials with each batch of
samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
◦ Review quality control results, and if control results are
outside of specified limits, identify and correct the issue
before proceeding with sample analysis.
◦ Document any discrepancies or corrective actions taken in
the laboratory logbook.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results must be verified by the technologist and entered
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Report results in units of µg/24 hours or the appropriate
standardized unit.
◦ Any findings that fall outside the reference intervals must be
flagged and noted for the referring physician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Histamine: [Insert lab-specific reference range]
◦ Serotonin: [Insert lab-specific reference range]
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Any limitations based on the manufacturer’s instructions or
identified during the validation process must be noted.
◦ Interferences and potential cross-reactivities should be
documented and understood by the technologist.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's protocol and package inserts for reagents
and LC-MS system.
◦ Laboratory-specific validation documents and quality control
procedures.
This SOP must be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance and better accuracy in the analysis of mast cell
mediators in 24-hour urine specimens.
