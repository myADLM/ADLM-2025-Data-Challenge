Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generation of Results for
Mast Cell Mediators, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for mast cell mediators in a random urine specimen. This procedure
ensures accurate and reliable measurement of mast cell mediators,
necessary for the diagnosis and monitoring of mast cell-related
disorders.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
testing, ensuring the reliability of results, and maintaining proper
documentation. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the testing process and addressing any issues that may
arise.
1. DEFINITION
Mast cell mediators are substances released by mast cells and
include histamine, tryptase, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.
Measurement of these mediators in a random urine specimen can
help in diagnosing mast cell activation disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements: A) Acceptable: Random urine specimen
collected in a clean, leak-proof container without preservatives. B)
Unacceptable: -Specimens that have been received more than 24
hours after collection. -Specimens that display evidence of
contamination or improper handling. -Specimens with insufficient
volume (<10 mL).
Equipment:
• High-performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Tips
• Volumetric Flasks and Measuring Cylinders
• Clean Polypropylene Tubes
• Sample Vials
• Calibration Standards and Quality Control Material
Reagents:
• Extraction Reagents
• Mobile Phase Reagents
• Internal Standards
• Derivatization Reagents (if applicable)
• Calibration Standards for Histamine, Tryptase, Prostaglandins,
and Leukotrienes
• Quality Control Materials
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared and calibrated
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Verify that the HPLC-MS/MS system is properly maintained and in
optimal working condition.
• Set up the centrifuge to appropriate speed and duration according
to the sample processing requirements.
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the random urine specimen thoroughly.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
particulates.
3. Carefully transfer an aliquot of the supernatant to a clean
polypropylene tube.
4. If using internal standards, add the specified volume of internal
standards to each sample.
5. Extract the mediators using the appropriate extraction reagent.
6. For derivatization, follow the specific procedural requirements.
HPLC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Load the prepared sample into sample vials and place them in
the auto-sampler.
2. Prepare the HPLC-MS/MS system according to laboratory
protocol.
3. Inject the sample into the HPLC-MS/MS system.
4. Perform the chromatographic separation followed by mass
spectrometric detection as per the validated method for mast
cell mediators.
5. Record the retention times, peak areas, and other relevant
data. Quality Control:
6. Analyze QC samples alongside patient samples to ensure the
accuracy of results.
7. Use both positive and negative controls to validate the assay
performance.
8. Evaluate the calibration curve for linearity and ensure all
calibration points meet acceptance criteria.
Data Analysis:
1. Process the chromatographic and spectral data using the
designated software.
2. Quantify the concentrations of histamine, tryptase,
prostaglandins, and leukotrienes in the urine samples.
3. Apply the internal standard method for enhanced accuracy.
4. Verify the results against the acceptable range of quality
controls.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review the results for consistency and flag any values that fall
outside clinical reference ranges.
3. Verify and sign off on the results as per laboratory protocol.
Reference Intervals: Reference intervals vary based on the specific
mast cell mediator being measured and are to be established
according to validated reference standards and population studies.
Method Limitations: Refer to the protocol and manufacturers'
instructions for limitations related to reagents, equipment, or matrix
interferences.
References: Refer to the latest protocol manuals, equipment user
guides, and relevant peer-reviewed articles pertaining to mast cell
mediator analysis.
This SOP ensures standardized and reliable testing of mast cell
mediators in random urine specimens, contributing crucial
information for the management of mast cell activation disorders.
