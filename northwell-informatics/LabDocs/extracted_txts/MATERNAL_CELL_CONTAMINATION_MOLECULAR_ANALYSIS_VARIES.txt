Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC) in
Molecular Analysis
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary for
detecting and documenting maternal cell contamination (MCC) in
prenatal samples (such as amniotic fluid or chorionic villus samples)
using molecular analysis. This ensures the accuracy of results for
fetal genetic testing.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel trained in molecular techniques are
responsible for performing and documenting the MCC test following
this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Amniotic fluid, minimum of 2 mL
• Chorionic villus sample (CVS), minimum of 5 mg
• Maternal blood, 5 mL collected in EDTA tube
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Samples not stored or transported under appropriate conditions
(e.g., not kept at room temperature)
• Samples with insufficient volume or mass
• Samples received without proper labeling or collection date/time
indicated on the sample container or requisition
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• DNA extraction kit (Qiagen DNA Mini Kit or equivalent)
• PCR reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTP mix, primers specific for
STR markers)
• Electrophoresis unit
• Agarose gel and appropriate buffers
• DNA ladder
• Positive and negative control samples
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• PCR tubes and strips
• Thermal cycler
4. PROCEDURE:
Sample Preparation:
1. Record the receipt of the sample and verify the integrity and
quantity.
2. Isolate genomic DNA from both fetal (amniotic fluid or CVS) and
maternal blood samples using standard DNA extraction
methods.
3. Quantify the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix according to the manufacturer's
protocol, including specific primers for short tandem repeats
(STRs) that distinguish maternal and fetal DNA.
◦ Example PCR mix:
▪ 25 µL of 2X Master Mix
▪ 5 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
▪ 5 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
▪ 5 µL of template DNA (fetal or maternal, 20 ng/µL)
▪ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 µL
2. Program the thermal cycler as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C (depending on primer Tm) for 30
seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel and load PCR products along with a
DNA ladder.
2. Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
3. Stain the gel with an appropriate DNA dye (e.g., ethidium
bromide or SYBR Safe) following standard protocols.
4. Visualize the bands under UV light or a gel documentation
system.
Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Compare the STR profiles between the maternal and fetal
samples.
2. Identify the presence of maternal alleles in the fetal sample to
assess contamination.
3. Document the presence or absence of MCC.
4. Use appropriate software or manual calculations to determine
the percentage of maternal cell contamination if detected.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure the reliability of the results.
2. Record all observations and results in the laboratory log.
3. Verify that all steps were followed as per protocol.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Compile and document the results, including the detection of
maternal alleles in fetal samples and the percentage of
contamination (if applicable).
2. Verify and sign off by a senior technologist or supervisor.
3. Generate and issue a report conforming to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
4. Address any potential issues with sample integrity or procedural
deviations in the report.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Normal range: No detectable maternal cell contamination. Alert
threshold: Any level of detectable maternal cell contamination should
be noted and investigated further.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to manufacturer’s instructions and scientific literature for
limitations associated with PCR-based STR analysis for MCC
detection, including allele dropout, PCR inhibitors, and primer-
specific limitations.
