Maternal Serum Screening (MSS), Integrated, Specimen #1 – PAPP-
A, NT
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide detailed procedures for
generating results for the first specimen (PAPP-A, NT) of the
Integrated Maternal Serum Screening. This screening is performed to
evaluate the risk of certain genetic conditions, such as Down
syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, by analyzing specific
markers in maternal blood and nuchal translucency (NT)
measurements during the first trimester.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff are responsible for:
• Proper processing and handling of the specimen.
• Performing analyses according to established guidelines.
• Documenting results and performing quality control (QC).
• Taking corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
PAPP-A: Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A NT: Nuchal
translucency (measured by ultrasonography)
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Glass/plastic test tubes
• Refrigerated storage units (2-8°C)
• PAPP-A assay kits and reagents
• Quality control materials
• Analytical instruments (e.g., immunoassay analyzers)
• Nuchal translucency data from ultrasound
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
1. PROCEDURE
A) SPECIMEN RECEIPT AND HANDLING
• Verify the patient's identity and the specimen's integrity.
• Confirm that the collection date, time, and required documentation
(ultrasound NT measurement) are recorded.
• Log the specimen and accompanying information into the LIS.
• Store the specimen at 2-8°C until testing.
B) SPECIMEN PREPARATION
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate the plasma.
• Aliquot the plasma into labeled tubes for PAPP-A analysis.
• Maintain aliquots at 2-8°C until analysis.
C) ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
PAPP-A Assay:
• Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run quality control (QC) samples prior to patient samples to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the assay.
• Load patient specimens and PAPP-A assay reagents into the
analyzer.
• Initiate the PAPP-A assay run as per the analyzer's protocol.
• Document the start and end times of the analysis.
NT Data:
• Retrieve NT measurement data from the radiology department,
ensuring it has been performed within the same timeframe as
specimen collection.
• Enter NT data into the LIS.
D) QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC on each new assay lot and at the beginning of each
run.
• Document QC results and take corrective action if results are
outside the acceptable range.
• Record any deviations and notify the designated supervisor
immediately.
E) RESULT CALCULATION AND REPORTING
• Review the PAPP-A and NT measurement results.
• Calculate risk estimates for Down syndrome and Trisomy 18 by
integrating PAPP-A levels and NT measurements along with
maternal age and other demographic factors.
• Verify results in the LIS and ensure proper documentation.
• Review any flagged results for possible follow-up or repeat
testing.
F) REPORT DISPATCH
• Print and cross-check reports for accuracy.
• Dispatch results to the ordering healthcare provider.
• Store electronic copies in the LIS for future reference.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTION
If any issues arise during processing, analysis, or result reporting:
• Inspect all reagents and instrument performance.
• Recalibrate or perform maintenance on instruments if necessary.
• Rerun the assay with fresh QC material and patient specimens.
• Report persistent issues to the supervisor and follow escalation
procedures.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records in the LIS including specimen accession, QC
data, and final results.
• Document all corrective actions taken.

maintenance.
By following this protocol, laboratory staff will ensure accurate and
reliable maternal serum screening results, supporting critical
decisions for prenatal care and management.
This protocol is effective as of [date] and will be reviewed annually by
the designated supervisor.
