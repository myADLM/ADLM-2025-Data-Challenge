Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase: MATERNAL
SERUM SCREENING, INTEGRATED, SPECIMEN #2
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analysis of maternal serum
samples for the integrated screening tests: Alpha Fetoprotein, Human
Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Estriol, and Inhibin A. This is to
ensure the accurate and timely generation of results, which are used
for assessing the risk of fetal aneuploidies and neural tube defects.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in the
processing and analysis of maternal serum samples for the
integrated screening tests mentioned above.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for executing the
procedures as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained
and adhere to the procedure, managing quality control, and
troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP): A protein produced by the fetus, used in
screening for neural tube defects.
• Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): A hormone produced by
the placenta, used in screening for chromosomal abnormalities
such as Down syndrome.
• Estriol (uE3): An estrogen produced by both the fetus and the
placenta, used in screening for fetal well-being.
• Inhibin A: A hormone produced by the placenta, used in screening
for chromosomal abnormalities.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimens: Maternal serum specimen #2.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL serum.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 48 hours. For long-term storage, samples should be frozen
at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens may affect results and should be rejected.
5.2. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Specific immunoassay kits for AFP, hCG, Estriol, and Inhibin A
(manufacturer instructions to be followed strictly).
• Calibrators and controls as provided by the assay kit
manufacturer.
• Automated immunoassay analyzer.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Necessary consumables such as test tubes, gloves, etc.
5.3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (both negative and positive controls)
with each batch of tests.
• Acceptable quality control ranges should be verified and
documented before reporting patient results.
• Document lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents and
controls.
5.4. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Note: Follow the specific manufacturer’s instructions for the
preparation and running of the immunoassay analyzer.
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix
thoroughly.
2. Centrifuge samples if particulate matter is present and use the
supernatant for testing.
B. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer using the provided
calibrators as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Verify calibration curve by running controls within acceptable
ranges.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and controls
onto the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Select the appropriate assay for AFP, hCG, Estriol, and Inhibin
A on the analyzer.
3. Start the run as per the manufacturer's instructions.
D. Post-Run:
1. Review analyzer results for each analyte.
2. Verify that quality control results fall within the acceptable range
before validating patient results.
3. For any out-of-range QC results, re-run the QC and address
issues according to the manufacturer’s troubleshooting
guidelines.
5.5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results from the analyzer are reviewed, validated, and entered
into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Critical Values: Notify the supervisor immediately if any results fall
outside critical reference ranges.
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for any additional interpretation
criteria or comments to be included.
5.6. RESULT VALIDATION AND RELEASE
• Ensure all results are consistent with the quality control data.
• Review patient demographics and clinical information to correlate
with test results whenever necessary.
• Only validated results should be transmitted to the ordering
clinician via the LIS.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all safety protocols including the use of PPE (gloves, lab
coats, etc.).
• Handle and dispose of all biohazardous materials following the
institutional guidelines.
• Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for specific
reagents and kits used.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, quality control data,
maintenance logs, and any corrective actions taken during the
analytical phase.
• Ensure all logs and results are up-to-date for review during audits
or inspections.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for immunoassay kits.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines for maternal serum screening.
• Laboratory’s internal quality control manual and SOP
documentation.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure consistent and
reliable results for maternal serum screening, aiding in the optimal
clinical management of pregnant patients.
