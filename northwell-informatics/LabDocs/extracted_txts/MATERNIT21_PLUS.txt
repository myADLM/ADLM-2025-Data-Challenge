STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Analytical Phase for
MATERNIT21 PLUS Testing
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedures for performing MATERNIT21
PLUS testing, a non-invasive prenatal screening method that uses
cell-free DNA in maternal blood to assess the risk of specific
chromosomal conditions in the fetus. The aim is to ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all trained laboratory personnel performing the
analytical phase of the MATERNIT21 PLUS test after specimen
collection, receipt, and accessioning within the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform
the testing procedures according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying
results.
• Quality control personnel are responsible for conducting regular
quality checks and maintenance.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Blood collection tubes (Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT)
• Centrifuge
• Nucleic Acid Extraction System
• Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) equipment
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform
• Pipettes and tips
• Nucleic acid quantification instruments (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer)
• Reagents for DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Data analysis software
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Verify the integrity of the specimen and ensure proper labeling.
2. Centrifuge the blood collection tubes at 1600 x g for 10 minutes
at room temperature.
3. Carefully transfer the plasma to a new tube without disturbing
the buffy coat and cellular material.
B. DNA Extraction
1. Use the nucleic acid extraction system to isolate cell-free DNA
from the plasma following the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a Qubit Fluorometer to
ensure sufficient DNA concentration for downstream analysis.
C. Library Preparation and Sequencing
1. Prepare DNA libraries using the appropriate reagents and kits
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform quantification and quality check of prepared libraries
before sequencing.
3. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform and initiate
the sequencing run following the instrument’s user guide.
D. Data Analysis
1. After sequencing, transfer raw sequencing data to an analysis
workstation.
2. Use the designated data analysis software to process and
analyze the sequencing data.
3. Compare the sequencing results against control data to identify
potential chromosomal anomalies.
4. Ensure that bioinformatics analysis meets the necessary quality
control thresholds before interpreting the results.
E. Quality Control
1. Include control samples (both positive and negative) in each
batch of extracted DNA, library preparation, and sequencing
run to ensure accuracy and reliability.
2. Document any deviations and perform necessary corrective
actions.
3. Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment in accordance with
the manufacturer's recommendations.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review analyzed data for each sample ensuring that all quality
control criteria are met.
6. Validate results using appropriate interpretative guidelines.
7. Submit results for verification by a laboratory supervisor.
8. Report results to the requesting clinician through the laboratory
information system (LIS) once verification is completed.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
All procedures, QC results, calibrations, maintenance logs, and any
deviations or corrective actions should be meticulously documented
in the laboratory records as per the laboratory’s standard
documentation procedures.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Ensure compliance with all laboratory safety protocols, wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and handling
reagents and instruments according to safety guidelines.
