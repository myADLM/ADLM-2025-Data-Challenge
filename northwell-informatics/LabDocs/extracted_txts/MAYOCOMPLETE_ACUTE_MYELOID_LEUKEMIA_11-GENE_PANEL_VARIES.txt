Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MAYOCOMPLETE ACUTE MYELOID
LEUKEMIA, 11-GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To provide and document the standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for the MAYOCOMPLETE
ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, 11-GENE PANEL, VARIES test,
ensuring accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the 11-gene panel test for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
using samples that have been received, accessioned, and prepared.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory technologists and technicians performing this test are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. It is also the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP and to
address any procedural issues or deviations.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Centrifuge
• Agilent Bioanalyzer or TapeStation
• DNA Extraction Kits
• PCR Amplification Kits
• NGS Library Preparation Kits
• Clean Microfuge Tubes
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Disposable Gloves
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Carefully extract genomic DNA from the patient's bone marrow
or peripheral blood sample using a validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a UV
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Ensure that the DNA concentration meets the minimum
requirement for downstream applications, typically 10-50 ng/µL.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Set up PCR reactions with primers specific to the 11 genes
included in the AML panel according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
2. Mix the reaction components in a clean microfuge tube,
ensuring accurate pipetting and minimal contamination.
3. Load the reaction tubes into the PCR thermal cycler, and run
the PCR program as specified by the kit's instructions.
4. After PCR completion, verify the success of amplification via
agarose gel electrophoresis or Agilent Bioanalyzer/TapeStation.
C. NGS Library Preparation:
1. Prepare the NGS libraries using the amplified PCR products
according to the library preparation kit's instructions.
2. Perform indexed adapter ligation and ensure proper indexing
for sample identification.
3. Purify the NGS libraries to remove unincorporated adapters and
primers, using magnetic beads or column-based cleanup
methods.
4. Quantify and assess the quality of prepared libraries using a
fluorometer and Bioanalyzer/TapeStation.
D. Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run the sequencing reaction under recommended conditions,
typically involving paired-end sequencing.
3. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure it proceeds without
technical issues, following the platform's real-time monitoring
tools.
E. Data Analysis:
1. After sequencing, transfer the raw data to the bioinformatics
pipeline for analysis.
2. Perform sequence alignment against the reference genome
and variant calling to identify mutations in the 11 genes of
interest.
3. Interpret the variant data using validated bioinformatics tools
and databases (e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar).
4. Compile the identified variants into a comprehensive report,
including interpretations of clinical significance.
F. Result Reporting:
1. Ensure that all identified variants are reviewed and verified by a
certified clinical laboratory scientist or pathologist.
2. Assemble the final report, highlighting clinically relevant
mutations and their potential impact on patient diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment.
3. Submit the verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for final review and dissemination to the ordering
physician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Include positive and negative control samples in every batch of
DNA extraction, PCR, library preparation, and sequencing to
validate results for each run.
2. Regularly perform routine maintenance and calibration of all
equipment following manufacturer recommendations.
3. Document all steps and observations in laboratory logbooks
and ensure adherence to quality control guidelines.

8. DEVIATIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Any deviation from this SOP must be documented and reviewed by
the laboratory supervisor. Corrective actions will be undertaken to
address any issues and prevent future occurrences.
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is reviewed annually and updated as needed by the
laboratory manager and approved by the Laboratory Director.
