Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
MAYOCOMPLETE Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Therapeutic Gene
Mutation Panel (FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, TP53), Next-Generation
Sequencing
1. PURPOSE: This procedure outlines the analytical phase of
generating results for the MAYOCOMPLETE Acute Myeloid
Leukemia, Therapeutic Gene Mutation Panel. This panel
employs next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify
mutations in the FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, and TP53 genes, which are
crucial for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-
making in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
Responsibility: Designated trained laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the steps in this SOP, analyzing data, and
ensuring the accuracy and validity of the results.
1. DEFINITIONS:
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
• QC: Quality Control
• AML: Acute Myeloid Leukemia
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Confirm sample identity and adequacy in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Extract DNA from the received specimen using appropriate
extraction kits and following standard extraction protocols.
3. Quantify extracted DNA using spectrophotometry (e.g., Qubit or
Nanodrop) and assess quality using agarose gel
electrophoresis or TapeStation/Fragment Analyzer.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Amplify target regions (FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, TP53) using targeted
PCR.
2. Attach sequencing adapters and molecular barcodes to the
amplified DNA fragments according to the Illumina library
preparation protocol or the equivalent approved protocol.
3. Purify amplified libraries with magnetic beads to remove
unspecific products and primers.
4. Assess library quality and quantity using a Bioanalyzer or
TapeStation.
C) Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
1. Pool libraries of different samples ensuring equal
representation.
2. Perform sequencing using an NGS platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq or NextSeq) following the manufacturer's protocols.
3. Load the pooled library onto the sequencer, set up the run
according to the panel specifications, and initiate sequencing.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Post-sequencing, transfer the raw data to the bioinformatics
workstation.
2. Use specialized software to align the sequencing reads to the
human genome reference sequence.
3. Identify variants (mutations) in the FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, and TP53
genes using variant calling algorithms.
4. Annotate identified variants and filter out common benign
variants using databases such as dbSNP, 1000 Genomes,
ExAC, and relevant AML-specific mutation databases.
E) Quality Control:
1. Examine sequencing quality metrics (e.g., Q30 score, read
depth) to ensure they meet the predetermined acceptance
criteria.
2. Include positive and negative controls in every batch to verify
assay performance.
3. Re-run samples that failed QC metrics or controls to ensure
reliable and accurate results.
F) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review the annotated variant data for clinical relevance and
pathogenicity based on the latest scientific literature and clinical
guidelines.
2. Confirm identified mutations using additional techniques (e.g.,
Sanger Sequencing) if required.
3. Compile a comprehensive report including detected mutations,
their clinical significance, and potential therapeutic implications.
4. Verify and authorize the report by a trained clinical laboratory
geneticist or pathologist.
5. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and communicate them to the requesting physician.
G) Documentation:
1. Document all steps in the sample processing and analysis
workflow, ensuring traceability.
2. Maintain all records, including raw data, QC logs, and final
reports, according to CLIA regulations.

1. NOTES:
2. Ensure regular maintenance of all equipment and adherence to
calibration schedules.
3. Update procedures and manuals annually or as needed to
comply with new guidelines and technological advancements.
4. Train all personnel on this SOP before performing the assay
independently.
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS: Follow all laboratory safety
guidelines, including the use of personal protective equipment
(PPE) and safe handling of biological specimens and reagents.
