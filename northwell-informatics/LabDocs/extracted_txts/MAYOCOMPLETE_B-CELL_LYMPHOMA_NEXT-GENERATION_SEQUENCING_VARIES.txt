Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
MAYOCOMPLETE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This protocol details the preparation, sequencing, and data
analysis steps required for generating and reporting results for
the MAYOCOMPLETE B-Cell Lymphoma Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS) test.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the operating technologists and laboratory
supervisors to ensure all procedures are strictly followed to ensure
accurate and reliable results. Documentation should be completed
accurately and timely to reflect the activities conducted during the
analytical phase.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the generation of results for all received
MAYOCOMPLETE B-Cell Lymphoma samples intended for
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), as requested by
clinicians.

3. PROCEDURE
4.1. Sample Preparation
a) DNA Extraction i. Extract genomic DNA from the patient samples
using an appropriate DNA extraction kit. ii. Measure DNA
concentration and purity using a spectrophotometer. iii. Required
DNA concentration: ≥ 20ng/µl (ideally 50-100ng/µl) with A260/A280
ratio of 1.8-2.0.
b) DNA Quality Control i. Run extracted DNA on an agarose gel to
check integrity and size. ii. Use QC passed DNA for library
preparation.
4.2. Library Preparation a) DNA fragmentation i. Fragment the DNA
to the desired size (~150-350 bp) using a sonicator.
b) Adapter Ligation and PCR Amplification i. Perform end repair, A-
tailing, and ligate adapters to fragmented DNA. ii. Amplify the
adapter-ligated DNA using PCR as per manufacturer's protocol. iii.
Clean up PCR products with magnetic beads to remove unused
primers, dNTPs, and enzymes.
c) Library QC and Quantification i. Quantify the constructed libraries
using qPCR or fluorometric methods. ii. Perform QC using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer or equivalent to check library size distribution and
integrity.
4.3. Sequencing a) Cluster Generation i. Load the libraries onto the
sequencing flow cells. ii. Use bridge amplification to generate clusters
on the flow cell surface.
b) Sequence Generation i. Perform paired-end sequencing using
Illumina (or equivalent) sequencing platforms as per laboratory
standard protocols. ii. Define appropriate sequencing depth and read
length according to test requirements (typically >500X mean
coverage).
4.4. Data Analysis a) Raw Data Processing i. Convert raw data files
(BCL) to FASTQ files using the sequencing platform software (e.g.,
Illumina's bcl2fastq). ii. Perform QC on FASTQ files using tools like
FastQC to evaluate read quality, GC content, and adapter
contamination.
b) Alignment i. Align the FASTQ reads to the human reference
genome (e.g., hg19 or hg38) using a certified aligner (e.g., BWA-
MEM). ii. Process aligned reads (BAM files) for sorting, marking
duplicates, and recalibrating base quality scores using tools such as
SAMtools and GATK.
c) Variant Calling i. Identify SNPs and Indels using a variant caller like
GATK or Strelka. ii. Filter variants based on quality metrics (e.g.,
depth, base quality, mapping quality).
d) Annotation i. Annotate the filtered variants using databases like
dbSNP, ClinVar, COSMIC, and others to determine clinical relevance.
ii. Identify known oncogenic mutations and novel variants pertinent to
B-cell lymphoma.
4.5. Reporting Results a) Variant Review i. Review and interpret
variant data with clinical significance in the context of B-cell
lymphoma. ii. Compare detected variants against known B-cell
lymphoma-associated genes and relevant mutations.
b) Documentation and Report Generation i. Compile the final variant
list, providing details on gene, nucleotide change, amino acid
change, and variant classification. ii. Document QC metrics and any
deviations encountered during the process. iii. Enter results into the
LIS for review by the responsible pathologists. iv. Generate an
interpretive report including clinically significant variants along with
appropriate clinical correlations and management recommendations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL a) Include positive and negative controls
(e.g., reference DNA samples with known variants) in each run
to ensure sequencing accuracy and reliability. b) Regularly
calibrate and maintain sequencing instruments as per
manufacturer's recommendations. c) Perform periodic
proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons to validate
the test performance.
2. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE a) Follow all laboratory safety
guidelines including the use of PPE and proper waste disposal.
b) Comply with regulatory requirements (e.g., CLIA, CAP)
pertaining to molecular diagnostic testing.
