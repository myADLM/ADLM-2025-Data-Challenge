Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: MAYOCOMPLETE Bladder and Prostate Cancer Panel, Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS), Tumor
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for performing Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) for the MAYOCOMPLETE Bladder and Prostate Cancer Panel
on tumor specimens.
Responsibility: To be performed by trained laboratory personnel
qualified in molecular diagnostics and NGS techniques.
1. DEFINITIONS
NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a method used to sequence
DNA or RNA to detect genetic variations. Panel: A predefined set of
genes or regions of the genome that are sequenced. Tumor
Specimen: Tissue or cell sample collected from a patient suspected
of having bladder or prostate cancer.
1. EQUIPMENT & MATERIALS
• NGS Sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher)
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Library Preparation Kit specific for the NGS platform
• PCR Amplification Kit
• MAYOCOMPLETE Bladder and Prostate Cancer Panel Kit
• Quality Control Reagents
• Bioinformatics Analysis Software
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes, and other general lab supplies
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Confirm specimen identity using the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Process the tumor specimen to obtain viable tissue or cell
samples.
3. Extract DNA from the tumor specimen using the DNA Extraction
Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Quantify and qualify the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
4.2 Library Preparation
1. Use the Library Preparation Kit to prepare DNA libraries from
the extracted DNA. Follow manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform PCR amplification of the regions of interest using the
MAYOCOMPLETE Bladder and Prostate Cancer Panel Kit.
3. Purify and quantify the amplified libraries.
4. Perform quality control checks on the prepared libraries (e.g.,
using a bioanalyzer).
4.3 Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS Sequencer following
the manufacturer's procedures.
2. Input the sequencing run parameters specific to the
MAYOCOMPLETE Bladder and Prostate Cancer Panel.
3. Start the sequencing run and monitor for any errors or issues
during the run.
4.4 Data Analysis
1. Once sequencing is complete, transfer raw sequencing data to
a secure server for bioinformatics analysis.
2. Use Bioinformatics Software to align sequences to the
reference genome and identify genetic variants.
3. Annotate genetic variants according to the established
guidelines and filter based on clinical relevance.
4. Perform a thorough quality control review of the sequencing
data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
4.5 Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review and interpret the genetic variants in the context of
bladder and prostate cancer.
2. Generate a comprehensive report including identified genetic
variants, their clinical significance, and any relevant therapeutic
or prognostic implications.
3. Verify the results with a secondary review by an experienced
molecular pathologist or geneticist.
4.6 Documentation and Record Keeping
1. Document all procedural steps, reagent lot numbers, quality
control results, and sequencing run details in the laboratory
records.
2. Ensure all reports are reviewed and signed by the responsible
laboratory personnel.
3. Store all documentation according to laboratory guidelines and
regulatory requirements.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform routine quality control (QC) procedures using internal
controls and external proficiency testing materials.
6. Adhere to all maintenance schedules for the NGS Sequencer
and other critical equipment.
7. Participate in external quality assurance programs.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
9. Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide if technical
issues arise during DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing, or data analysis.
10. Document any deviations from the standard procedure and
corrective actions taken.
