SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results - MAYOCOMPLETE
COLORECTAL CANCER PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
◦ To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for MAYOCOMPLETE Colorectal Cancer
Panel, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of tumor
samples.
◦ To ensure accurate, reliable, and high-quality results
following standard protocols.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to
follow this SOP for generating results of the Colorectal
Cancer Panel via NGS.
◦ Laboratory personnel must follow all procedures accurately,
identifying and documenting any deviations or issues, and
bringing them to the attention of the supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
◦ NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a high-throughput
method used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in
DNA.
◦ Tumor sample: A specimen collected from a colorectal tumor
for genetic analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
◦ Library preparation kit specific for colorectal cancer panel
◦ PCR reagents
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ Quality control material (e.g., control DNA samples)
◦ Software for sequence alignment and variant calling
5. PROCEDURE A) DNA Extraction: - Extract DNA from the tumor
sample using a validated DNA extraction kit. - Quantify and
assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis.
B) Library Preparation: - Prepare the DNA libraries using a
colorectal cancer-specific library preparation kit. - Perform end-
repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation according to the
manufacturer's instructions. - Purify the libraries using
appropriate purification methods (e.g., bead-based purification).
- Amplify the libraries using PCR and quantify the libraries using
qPCR or a bioanalyzer.
C) Sequencing: - Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS
sequencer following the manufacturer's protocol. - Set
sequencing parameters as recommended for the colorectal
cancer panel. - Perform sequencing runs and monitor the
progress as per the standard protocol.
D) Data Analysis: - Transfer sequencing data to the
bioinformatics analysis pipeline. - Perform sequence alignment
to the reference genome. - Identify and call variants using
variant calling software. - Annotate variants and assess their
significance in the context of colorectal cancer. - Perform quality
control checks, including read depth, coverage, base quality,
and strand bias.
E) Result Interpretation: - Review variant annotation and
interpretation software results. - Compare identified variants
with known colorectal cancer-related genetic markers. - Consult
scientific literature and relevant databases to further validate
the findings. - Document findings in a standardized report
format including potential clinical significance.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
monitor performance.
◦ Verify the consistency and accuracy of variant calling by
comparing with known control datasets.
◦ Perform routine instrument maintenance and calibration
according to manufacturer specifications.
◦ Validate new batches of reagents and consumables to
ensure consistent performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Prepare and review the final report, including identified
variants, annotation, and clinical interpretation.
◦ Discuss findings with the clinical team as necessary.
◦ Store raw data, processed data, and reports securely in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are verified by a qualified technologist
before being issued.
