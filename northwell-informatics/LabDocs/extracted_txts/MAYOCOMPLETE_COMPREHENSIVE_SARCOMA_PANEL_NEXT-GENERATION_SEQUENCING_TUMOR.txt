Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
MAYOCOMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE SARCOMA PANEL, NEXT-
GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS), TUMOR
1. Purpose
To delineate the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for the MAYOCOMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE SARCOMA
PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING, TUMOR in order to
ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
1. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the analytical
phase of the NGS procedure for tumor specimens submitted for the
MAYOCOMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE SARCOMA PANEL.
1. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the NGS
procedure, monitoring quality control, and documenting results.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Oversee the technologists, validate
results, and address any procedural issues.
• Quality Control Unit: Validate calibration and maintenance of all
NGS instrumentation and monitoring adherence to predefined
quality control measures.
1. Definitions
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing.
• Tumor DNA: DNA extracted and purified from tumor tissue
specimens.
• QC: Quality Control.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• NGS Sequencer (e.g., Illumina, ThermoFisher)
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Library Preparation Kit specific for the sarcoma panel
• PCR Thermocycler
• High-sensitivity DNA chip (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer)
• Qubit Fluorometer for DNA quantification
• Reagents for sequencing (e.g., buffers, primers)
1. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction:
1. DNA is extracted according to the laboratory’s validated DNA
Extraction SOP. The purity and concentration of the DNA are
assessed using a NanoDrop and Qubit fluorometer.
2. Aim for a concentration of 20-200 ng/µL.
B. Library Preparation:
1. Prepare DNA library following the Library Preparation Kit
instructions specific for the sarcoma panel.
2. Ensure accurate quantification of the prepared library using
Qubit Fluorometer.
3. Validate the size and quality of libraries on an Agilent
Bioanalyzer using a high-sensitivity DNA chip.
4. Pool prepared libraries to the appropriate concentration and
volume based on sequencer’s specifications.
C. Sequencing:
1. Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS Sequencer.
2. Enter run parameters into the sequencing software, ensuring
that the parameters align with the sarcoma panel specifications.
3. Begin sequencing run and closely monitor initial quality control
metrics provided by the sequencing software.
D. Quality Control:
1. Monitor sequencing run parameters and performance metrics in
real-time.
2. Post-run, validate sequencing quality metrics, including Q30
scores, read depth, and sequencing coverage.
3. Utilize internal controls to ensure run validity.
4. Repeat sequencing if quality parameters do not meet the
predefined standards.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Pipeline analysis begins automatically or is initiated through
analysis software specific to the NGS platform.
2. Ensure data alignment to the appropriate reference genome
(e.g., hg38).
3. Utilize variant calling software to identify single nucleotide
variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (Indels), copy number
variations (CNVs), and structural variants (SVs).
4. Annotate identified variants using established databases and
bioinformatics tools.
5. Review the variant calls and filter out artifacts based on the
predefined criteria ensuring clinical relevance.
F. Result Interpretation:
1. Confirm that identified variants are presented within the clinical
context of the sarcoma panel.
2. Draft a preliminary report including identified relevant variants
and their potential clinical significance.
3. Consult with the pathologist or molecular geneticist for
validation and final sign-off on the report.
4. Document the finalized report in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
G. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Ensure all quality control checks, interim results, and the final
report are comprehensively documented and stored securely in
the LIS.
2. Ensure that all data and generated reports comply with
laboratory quality management standards and regulatory
requirements.
3. Quality Control and Maintenance
• Regular calibration and maintenance of sequencing equipment
should be performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Maintain and verify calibration certificates for all equipment.
• Document and address any deviations from standard procedures
or instrument malfunctions.
1. Safety and Compliance
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper waste disposal.
• Ensure compliance with all relevant regulations, including CLIA,
CAP, and other governing bodies.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s equipment and reagent manuals.
• Laboratory’s internal quality management protocols.
• Relevant scientific literature and guidelines on sarcoma NGS
panels.
1. Review and Approvals
• This SOP will be reviewed annually by laboratory supervisor or
designee.
• Document versioning and approval signatures.
• Record of any procedural changes or updates to reflect current
best practices.
This SOP provides systematic guidance for laboratory personnel to
ensure the precise and accurate execution of the analytical phase for
the MAYOCOMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE SARCOMA PANEL,
NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING, TUMOR ensuring high
standards and regulatory compliance in test results.
