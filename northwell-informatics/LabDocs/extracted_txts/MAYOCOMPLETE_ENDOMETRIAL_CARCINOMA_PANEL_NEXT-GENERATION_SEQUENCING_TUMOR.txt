Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MAYOCOMPLETE
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary for
performing the MAYOCOMPLETE Endometrial Carcinoma Panel
utilizing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. This SOP is
designed to ensure accurate and reliable results for the detection of
genetic mutations in tumor samples from patients diagnosed with
endometrial carcinoma.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP for processing tumor specimens, conducting NGS, interpreting
data, and reporting results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, Paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Fresh frozen tissue samples.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with insufficient tumor content (less than required
percentage of tumor cells).
• Specimens not properly fixed or preserved.
• Specimens without proper labeling or collection information.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit or equivalent.
• Ion Torrent sequencer or Illumina MiSeq sequencer.
• MAYOCOMPLETE Endometrial Carcinoma Panel reagent kit.
• Primers for targeted NGS.
• Quality Control (QC) materials and reference standards.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE tissue.
• NanoDrop or Qubit Fluorometer for DNA quantification.
• PCR thermocycler.
• Ion Torrent or Illumina MiSeq sequencer.
• Bioinformatics workstation for data analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Review the FFPE tissue block to confirm the presence of
adequate tumor content.
2. Section tissue at 5-10 microns using microtome.
3. Deparaffinize tissue sections following the QIAamp DNA FFPE
Tissue Kit protocol.
4. Perform DNA extraction as per the manufacturer’s guidelines
for the specified kit.
5. Quantify DNA using NanoDrop or Qubit Fluorometer and record
the concentration.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Prepare DNA library using MAYOCOMPLETE Endometrial
Carcinoma Panel reagent kit.
2. Perform target enrichment through PCR using specific primers
as per the kit instructions.
3. Verify the quality and quantity of the library using a suitable
assay (e.g., BioAnalyzer).
C) Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared library onto the Ion Torrent or Illumina MiSeq
sequencer.
2. Follow the sequencer's operational manual for loading and
initiating NGS run.
3. Monitor library loading efficiency and sequencing progress.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics workstation.
2. Perform initial data quality checks and filtering using standard
bioinformatics tools.
3. Align sequences to the reference genome using appropriate
software algorithms.
4. Analyze variant data to identify genetic mutations relevant to
endometrial carcinoma.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run QC materials alongside patient samples as controls for
validation.
2. Assess sequencing run quality and variant call accuracy.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken in the
QC log.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Compile analyzed data into a comprehensive report.
6. Review and verify results as per laboratory guidelines.
7. Report findings to the referring clinician including mutation
details and clinical relevance.
8. Ensure results are accurately entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
