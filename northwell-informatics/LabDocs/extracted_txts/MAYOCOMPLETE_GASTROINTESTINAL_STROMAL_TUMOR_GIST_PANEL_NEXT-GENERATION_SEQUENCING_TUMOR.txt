Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for MAYOCOMPLETE
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Panel, Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS), Tumor
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and procedures
involved in the analytical phase of generating results for the
MAYOCOMPLETE Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Panel,
using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques from tumor
specimens.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of the MAYOCOMPLETE GIST Panel testing. The procedures
must be strictly followed to ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent
results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP and
performing the necessary procedures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that laboratory
personnel are trained and adhere to this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• GIST: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing
• DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
• QC: Quality Control
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Quality Control of Tumor Specimen
1. Specimen Reception and Preparation
◦ Ensure the specimen received is correctly identified and
matches the patient requisition form.
◦ Verify that the tumor specimen is appropriate for NGS (e.g.,
proper collection method, freshness, preservation).
◦ Process the specimen as per the standard tumor processing
protocol to extract DNA.
2. DNA Extraction
◦ Extract genomic DNA from the tumor specimen using a
validated DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen, Thermo Fisher).
◦ Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer
(e.g., Qubit) to determine the concentration and purity.
◦ Ensure DNA meets the minimum quality and quantity
requirements specified by the NGS protocol (e.g., A260/280
ratio).
3. Quality Control
◦ Perform pre-analytical QC checks to verify DNA integrity
using gel electrophoresis or a fragment analyzer.
◦ Store the DNA at -20°C until ready for library preparation.
B. Library Preparation
1. Library Preparation
◦ Prepare the DNA library using a standardized protocol for
the MAYOCOMPLETE GIST Panel.
◦ Perform DNA fragmentation, end-repair, adapter ligation,
and enrichment of target regions using specific library
preparation kits.
◦ Verify the quality of the prepared library using a fragment
analyzer or a bioanalyzer.
2. Quality Control
◦ Conduct QC procedures to check the library's concentration
and size distribution.
◦ Ensure the library meets the quality specifications required
for sequencing.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing
1. Sequencing Setup
◦ Load the prepared library onto the NGS platform (e.g.,
Illumina, Ion Torrent) following the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Configure the sequencing run parameters according to the
MAYOCOMPLETE GIST Panel requirements.
2. Sequencing Run
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for any technical issues and
ensure it proceeds without interruptions.
◦ After the sequencing run is completed, ensure the raw
sequencing data is correctly outputted for analysis.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Data Transfer and Initial Analysis
◦ Transfer the raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics team
for initial analysis.
◦ Utilize specific bioinformatics tools and pipelines to align,
map, and annotate the sequenced reads to the reference
genome.
2. Variant Calling and Annotation
◦ Perform variant calling to identify mutations in the target
genes associated with GIST.
◦ Annotate identified variants using current databases and
literature.
3. Quality Control of Data Analysis
◦ Conduct data QC to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
the variant calling process.
◦ Re-run failed or suspect analyses, if necessary, using
alternative methods or settings.
E. Reporting Results
1. Result Review and Validation
◦ Review the generated results to ensure they meet all quality
checks and clinical relevance.
◦ Confirm the final variant list and report for accuracy and
completeness.
2. Result Reporting
◦ Generate a comprehensive report detailing the identified
mutations and their potential clinical implications.
◦ Send the report to the ordering physician or clinical team for
further interpretation and patient care decision-making.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Implement regular QC procedures for all analytical steps,
including pre-analytical, sequencing, and post-analytical stages.
• Document all QC checks and corrective actions taken if any
issues arise.
• Perform periodic audits of the analytical phase to ensure
adherence to this SOP.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manual for DNA extraction kits.
• Library preparation kit protocol.
• NGS platform user manual.
• Bioinformatics tool documentation.
• Current clinical literature and variant databases for GIST.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain comprehensive logs for all analytical procedures,
including specimen handling, DNA extraction, library prep,
sequencing, data analysis, and result reporting.
• Document all QC activities, including any deviations and
corrective actions.
