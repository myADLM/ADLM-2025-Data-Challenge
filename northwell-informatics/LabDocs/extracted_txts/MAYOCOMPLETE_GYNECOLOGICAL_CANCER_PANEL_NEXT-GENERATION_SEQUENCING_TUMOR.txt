STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE MAYOCOMPLETE
GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for the
MAYOCOMPLETE Gynecological Cancer Panel using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) on tumor specimens.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of tumor specimens using the MAYOCOMPLETE
Gynecological Cancer Panel by NGS as conducted within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES Designated laboratory staff are
responsible for performing the analysis following the protocols
outlined. Supervisory staff are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this SOP and for addressing any issues or
deviations.
4. SPECIMENS The acceptable specimen type for this test is
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or
unstained slides containing tumor tissue.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microtome
• DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN DNA extraction kit or equivalent)
• Quantus™ Fluorometer
• Library preparation kit (e.g., Illumina TruSight Oncology 500)
• NGS system (Illumina NextSeq 550 or equivalent)
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• PCR thermal cycler
• Bioanalyzer or TapeStation for library quantification and quality
control
• Reagents: PCR primers, indices, enzymes, buffers, and reagents
as per the library preparation kit
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Receive and accession the FFPE tissue specimens.
2. For tissue blocks:
◦ Section the tissue at 5-10 microns thickness on a
microtome.
◦ Mount the sections on glass slides.
3. For unstained slides:
◦ Ensure the slide has 5-10 micron thick tissue sections.
4. Deparaffinization and tissue digestion:
◦ Follow the protocols outlined in the DNA extraction kit for
deparaffinizing and digesting tissue samples.
B. DNA Extraction and Quantification
1. Extract DNA using the recommended DNA extraction kit as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a Quantus™ Fluorometer.
◦ Ensure DNA concentration meets the requirements as
specified by the library preparation kit.
C. Library Preparation and Amplification
1. Prepare the DNA library using the recommended library
preparation kit for the NGS platform.
2. Follow the library preparation protocol:
◦ Fragment DNA, perform end-repair, adenylation, and
adaptor ligation.
◦ Perform library enrichment with target-specific probes
provided in the kit.
3. Amplify the enriched library using PCR.
4. Purify the amplified library according to the protocol steps.
5. Assess the quality and size distribution of the library using a
Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
D. Next-Generation Sequencing
1. Normalize the DNA library to the required concentration for
sequencing.
2. Pool libraries if multiplexing samples on a single run.
3. Load the prepared library onto the NGS platform (Illumina
NextSeq 550 or equivalent).
4. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for running the
sequencing instrument.
5. Monitor sequence data generation to ensure sufficient coverage
and quality.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to bioinformatics software
designated for variant calling and annotation.
◦ Analyze data using validated pipelines.
2. Review and interpret variant calls:
◦ Cross-reference detected variants with clinically relevant
databases and guidelines (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC).
◦ Utilize quality control metrics to ensure accuracy and
reliability of results.
F. Reporting Results
1. Compile a comprehensive report of the detected variants
following internal guidelines.
2. Verify and review the generated results before issuing a final
report.
3. Report findings to the requesting clinician including
interpretative comments and possible implications for patient
management.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine calibration and maintenance of equipment
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Use appropriate controls at each step to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of the results.
• Document all quality control measures and deviations.
