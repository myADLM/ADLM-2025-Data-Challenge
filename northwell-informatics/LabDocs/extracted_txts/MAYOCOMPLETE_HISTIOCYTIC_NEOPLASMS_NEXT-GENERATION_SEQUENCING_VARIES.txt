Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
MAYOCOMPLETE HISTIOCYTIC NEOPLASMS, NEXT-
GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS), VARIES
1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to define the steps undertaken
during the analytical phase of generating results for the
MayoComplete Histiocytic Neoplasms using Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
procedure as outlined to ensure accurate and reliable test results. All
personnel must be trained and authorized to perform NGS testing.
1. Specimen Requirements
◦ Accepted Specimens: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded
(FFPE) tissue
◦ Minimum amount: ≥ 20% tumor content required
◦ Storage Conditions: Room temperature
2. Equipment and Reagents
◦ NGS Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq)
◦ DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue
Kit)
◦ Library Preparation Kit (e.g., Illumina TruSight RNA Pan-
Cancer Panel)
◦ Purification Systems (e.g., Beckman Coulter SPRISelect)
◦ PCR Clean-Up Kits (e.g., AMPure XP)
◦ Bioanalyzer/TapeStation or equivalent for library quality
control
◦ Reference Materials: Internal standards and positive/
negative control samples
3. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction:
• Follow the DNA Extraction Kit Instructions relevant to FFPE tissue
samples.
• Quantify DNA using a fluorescence-based quantification method
(e.g., Qubit).
• Assess purity using NanoDrop or equivalent.
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further use.
B. Library Preparation:
• Fragment DNA either by sonication or enzymatic method to the
desired size (150-200 bp).
• Use the Library Preparation Kit for end repair, A-tailing, adapter
ligation, and amplification.
• Purify libraries using magnetic bead clean-up (e.g., AMPure XP
beads).
• Quantify and assess quality of libraries using Bioanalyzer/
TapeStation.
C. Library Pooling and Sequencing:
• Normalize final library concentrations.
• Pool libraries in equimolar ratios as per sequencing instrument
guidelines.
• Load the pooled sample into the NGS sequencer.
• Use appropriate sequencing reagents and flow cell (e.g., Illumina
Reagent Kit v3).
• Set up the sequencer using recommended settings (e.g., paired-
end 150 bp reads).
D. Data Analysis:
• Transfer generated FASTQ files to analysis pipeline.
• Perform quality control checks using software tools (e.g.,
FastQC).
• Align sequences to the reference genome using a suitable aligner
(e.g., BWA).
• Call variants using variant calling software (e.g., GATK or
equivalent).
• Annotate variants using a reliable database and annotation tools
(e.g., Annovar, ClinVar).
• Perform comprehensive data review and interpret results per
laboratory guidelines.
1. Quality Control:
◦ Include internal controls (positive and negative) in each run.
◦ Verify the integrity of the sequencing run using internal
control metrics (e.g., > Q30 Quality Score).
◦ Review and document any quality control deviations.
◦ Use standard QC procedures to determine the acceptance
or rejection of sequencing runs.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Generate a detailed summary report of the identified
variants, including clinical relevance.
◦ Review the report for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Validate questionable variants with orthogonal methods if
necessary (e.g., Sanger sequencing).
◦ Forward the final report to a designated pathologist for
clinical correlation and sign-off.
3. References:
◦ Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for DNA extraction,
library preparation kits, and sequencing instruments.
◦ Databases and software tools for data analysis and
interpretation.
◦ Consensus guidelines for NGS testing in clinical
laboratories.
4. Appendix:
◦ Instrument-specific setup guides and troubleshooting tips.
◦ Documentation templates for recording extraction, library
preparation, and sequencing procedures.
◦ Emergency contact information for technical support.
