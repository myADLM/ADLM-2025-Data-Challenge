MAYOCOMPLETE KIDNEY CANCER PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING, TUMOR SOP
1. PURPOSE To provide guidelines for the analytical phase of
generating results for MAYOCOMPLETE Kidney Cancer Panel
using next-generation sequencing (NGS) on tumor specimens.
This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in
processing and analyzing tumor samples for genetic mutations
associated with kidney cancer.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated staff to
perform the analytical procedures as defined in this protocol,
ensuring adherence to the outlined steps and promptly
addressing any deviations or issues.
3. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable specimen: Fresh frozen
tissue, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks,
or slides with tumor tissue. Unacceptable specimens: Non-
tumor tissue, degraded specimens, improperly stored or
collected specimens. Ensure proper labelling including
collection date, type of specimen, and patient identification.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Next-generation sequencer (Illumina, Thermo Fisher, or
equivalent)
• DNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Promega, or equivalent)
• Library preparation kits (Illumina, Thermo Fisher, or equivalent)
• PCR thermocycler
• Quantification equipment (Qubit fluorometer, Bioanalyzer, or
equivalent)
• Clean bench for sample preparation
• Appropriate computational tools for bioinformatics analysis
Ensure all reagents are stored according to manufacturer's
instructions and not used past the expiry date.
1. PROCEDURE Step 1: DNA Extraction
• Follow the manufacturer's protocol for extracting DNA from tumor
tissue.
• Quantify extracted DNA using Qubit or Bioanalyzer.
• Assess quality of the extracted DNA by spectrophotometry and
gel electrophoresis.
Step 2: Library Preparation
• Prepare DNA libraries as per the manufacturer's protocol
including fragmentation, end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and
PCR amplification.
• Purify libraries using appropriate purification methods (e.g., bead-
based purification).
• Quantify and assess quality of the libraries using the Bioanalyzer.
Step 3: Sequencing
• Load libraries onto the NGS platform according to sequencer
manufacturer's protocol.
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of sequencer before
running the sample.
• Monitor sequencing run to avoid incomplete or error-prone data
collection.
Step 4: Data Analysis
• Transfer raw sequencing data to bioinformatics platform for
processing and analysis.
• Align reads to reference genome using appropriate alignment
tools (e.g., BWA, Bowtie2).
• Call variants using established software (e.g., GATK, VarScan).
• Annotate variants using databases (e.g., dbSNP, COSMIC).
Step 5: Result Interpretation
• Review variant calls for clinical significance using established
guidelines.
• Evaluate quality control metrics throughout analysis.
• Generate report summarizing key findings including potential
clinically actionable mutations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL For each batch of samples:
• Include positive and negative controls during DNA extraction and
library preparation steps.
• Monitor instrument performance and conduct regular calibration
checks.
• Review inter-laboratory and intra-laboratory quality control data
for consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS Results must be reviewed and verified
by a qualified technologist before being transmitted to the
electronic laboratory information system (LIS). Ensure proper
documentation of all steps and findings.
2. REFERENCES Refer to manufacturer's guidelines for reagents
and equipment. Use established protocols and databases for
bioinformatics analysis. Follow institutional guidelines for
clinical reporting and interpretation of genetic data.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to equipment and reagent
manufacturers' guidelines for limitations. Genotype-phenotype
correlations may vary depending on individual patient and
tumor heterogeneity.
4. ADDITIONAL NOTES Ensure adherence to ethical guidelines
and patient confidentiality throughout the analytical process.
5. DOCUMENTATION Maintain detailed records of all steps in the
procedural workflow including batch records, sample tracking,
quality control metrics, and analysis results.
