Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MAYOCOMPLETE
LIQUID BIOPSY PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING,
CELL-FREE DNA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed guideline for the analytical phase of processing
and generating results for the MAYOCOMPLETE Liquid Biopsy Panel
using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology on cell-free
DNA (cfDNA). This procedure ensures accurate, consistent, and
reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of
the MAYOCOMPLETE Liquid Biopsy Panel, including preparation,
sequencing, data analysis, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP during the analytical phase. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to the protocol and to
address any deviations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Preferred Specimen: Plasma from blood collected in specialized cfDNA tubes.
- Volume: Minimum of 10 mL of plasma.
- Stability: Process plasma within 6 hours of collection to ensure cfDNA integrity.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
- NGS platform (e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher)
- cfDNA extraction kits
- Library preparation kits
- Quantitative PCR (qPCR) machine
- Bioanalyzer for library quality control
- Required buffers, enzymes, and reagents for library preparation and sequencing
- Calibration and maintenance records for all equipment used
- Computer and software for bioinformatics analysis
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Pre-Analytical Quality Check
- Verify sample identification and documentation.
- Centrifuge blood samples at 1600 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to isolate plasma.
- Transfer plasma to a clean, labeled tube without disturbing the buffy coat.
6.2. cfDNA Extraction
- Follow the manufacturer's protocol for cfDNA extraction.
- Elute cfDNA in a low-TE buffer.
- Quantify cfDNA using a fluorometric method (e.g., Qubit).
6.3. Library Preparation
- Prepare cfDNA libraries using the designated library preparation kit.
- Follow manufacturer's instructions for enzymatic fragmentation, end-repair, dA-tailing, and adapter ligation.
- Enrich libraries using targeted capture or amplicon-based methods specific to the MAYOCOMPLETE Panel.
- Purify the library using magnetic beads.
6.4. Library Quality Control
- Assess library size distribution and concentration using a Bioanalyzer.
- Ensure the library is within the expected size range for cfDNA libraries.
6.5. NGS Sequencing
- Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform according to manufacturer instructions.
- Set up the sequencing run with appropriate parameters and barcoding strategies.
- Monitor the sequencing run for quality metrics such as cluster density and Q30 score.
6.6. Data Analysis
- Transfer raw sequence data to the designated bioinformatics pipeline.
- Perform primary data analysis including base-calling, demultiplexing, and alignment to the reference genome.
- Apply secondary analysis for variant calling, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), copy number variations (CNVs), and structural rearrangements.
- Tertiary analysis includes annotation and filtering of variants to identify clinically relevant mutations.
6.7. Data Review and Interpretation
- Review data for quality control metrics and ensure adherence to established thresholds.
- Validate identified variants with secondary methods if necessary (e.g., digital PCR).
- Interpret results in the context of clinical relevance, considering variant pathogenicity databases and guidelines.
6.8. Reporting Results
- Generate a detailed report summarizing the findings, including identified mutations, variant classifications, and clinical interpretations.
- Ensure the report is reviewed and signed off by a qualified laboratory director.
- Distribute the final report through the designated laboratory information system (LIS) or electronic health record (EHR) portals.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
- Utilize positive and negative control samples in each batch to monitor assay performance.
- Document and investigate any deviations or anomalies observed during the process.
- Conduct regular proficiency testing and participate in external quality assurance programs.
8. SAFETY
- Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols and use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required.
- Handle all biological specimens and reagents according to biosafety guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
- Manufacturer's instructions for cfDNA extraction kit, library preparation kit, and NGS platform.
- CAP/CLIA guidelines for molecular diagnostic laboratories.
- Relevant scientific literature pertaining to the interpretation of cfDNA NGS results.
