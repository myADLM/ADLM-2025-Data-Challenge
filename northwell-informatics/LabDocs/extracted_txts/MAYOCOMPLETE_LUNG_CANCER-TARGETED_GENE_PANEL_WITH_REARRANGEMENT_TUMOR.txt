Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
MAYOCOMPLETE LUNG CANCER-TARGETED GENE PANEL
WITH REARRANGMENT, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical phase procedures for generating results for
the MAYOCOMPLETE LUNG CANCER-TARGETED GENE PANEL
WITH REARRANGEMENT, TUMOR in order to ensure accurate and
timely reporting of patient results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to adhere to protocol for performing molecular assays and
to generate accurate and reliable results. Lab supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the quality assurance of the process.
1. DEFINITION
The MAYOCOMPLETE LUNG CANCER-TARGETED GENE PANEL
WITH REARRANGEMENT, TUMOR is a comprehensive genetic test
performed to identify targetable genomic alterations such as
mutations, rearrangements, and gene amplifications associated with
lung cancer.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Reagents:
• Next-generation sequencer (e.g., Illumina or Ion Torrent)
• Thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Quantification equipment (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer)
• Agilent 2200 TapeStation or equivalent
• Pipettes and tips, sterile and aerosol-resistant
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR master mix
• Gene panel assay kit specific to MAYOCOMPLETE Lung Cancer
panel
• Nuclease-free water
• Appropriate controls (positive and negative)
• Reagent grade ethanol
• Laboratory notebook and/or LIMS for documentation
B. Sample Preparation:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Using the designated DNA extraction kit, isolate DNA from
tumor tissue.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
Qubit Fluorometer and the Agilent 2200 TapeStation.
◦ DNA should have a minimum concentration of 10 ng/μl and
a total volume of at least 50 μl. The A260/A280 ratio should
be between 1.8 – 2.0.
2. Library Preparation:
◦ Prepare libraries from the extracted DNA using the
MAYOCOMPLETE Lung Cancer gene panel assay kit.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for library preparation
which involves hybridization capture of target sequences.
◦ Amplify the targeted regions through PCR.
◦ Purify the amplified library and perform quality assessment
using the TapeStation system.
3. Sequencing:
◦ Load the prepared library into the sequencer according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Set up the sequencer run with the appropriate parameters:
▪ Read length: Paired-end 150 bp (example)
▪ Coverage: Aim for an average depth of 500x
◦ Monitor the sequencing run and ensure all quality controls
are within acceptable limits.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ After completion of the sequencing run, perform initial data
quality checks.
◦ Align the sequenced reads to the human reference genome.
◦ Call variants including single nucleotide variants (SNVs),
insertions/deletions (INDELs), copy number variations
(CNVs), and gene rearrangements.
◦ Filter variants based on predefined criteria (e.g., variants
with a read depth <10x considered low confidence).
◦ Employ bioinformatic tools for annotation to determine the
clinical relevance of detected alterations.
◦ Confirm results using orthogonal methods if required (e.g.,
Sanger sequencing for specific mutations).
C. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate the
assay performance.
• Ensure that the base call quality scores are within acceptable
limits (e.g., >Q30 for at least 80% of bases).
• Check that the coverage metrics meet the required thresholds.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of sequencers and
other critical equipment.
• Document any deviations from standard protocols in the
laboratory information management system (LIMS).
D. Reporting Results:
1. Verify the analyzed data and confirm the presence of clinically
significant variants.
2. Generate a detailed report thoroughly documenting:
◦ Patient identifiers and specimen details
◦ List of detected mutations, rearrangements, or
amplifications along with gene name, nucleotide change,
amino acid change, and associated clinical significance
◦ Coverage statistics and quality metrics
◦ Interpretation notes and recommendations for potential
clinical applications.
3. Ensure that the report is reviewed and signed off by the
designated molecular pathologist.
4. Transmit final reports to appropriate clinical teams and securely
archive testing data in compatibility with privacy regulations.
E. Documentation:
• Record all stages of processing, including date, time, and
identifying information for the personnel performing each step.
• Document any troubleshooting steps taken during the protocol.
