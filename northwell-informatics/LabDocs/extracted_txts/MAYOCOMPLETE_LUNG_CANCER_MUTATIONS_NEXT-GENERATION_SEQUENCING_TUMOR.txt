Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for MAYOCOMPLETE
Lung Cancer Mutations via Next-Generation
Sequencing (Tumor)
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for MAYOCOMPLETE Lung Cancer
Mutations using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) from
tumor specimens. The protocol ensures accurate and timely
generation of sequencing data, identification of mutations, and
reporting of results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the handling, processing, and analysis of tumor specimens for
MAYOCOMPLETE Lung Cancer Mutations NGS testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure the integrity of the results.
Supervisors are responsible for verifying compliance with the
protocol and addressing any deviations.
4. DEFINITIONS
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing
• Tumor Specimen: A sample derived from a patient's tumor tissue
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase (Assumed completed)
◦ Specimen collection, reception, and accessioning according
to standard laboratory procedures.
B. Analytical Phase
Equipment and Reagents
◦ Sequencing Equipment: Illumina sequencing platforms or
equivalent
◦ Software: BaseSpace Sequence Hub, GATK, Annovar, and
other bioinformatics tools
◦ Reagents: DNA extraction kits, library preparation kits,
sequencing reagents, control materials
Procedure
1. DNA Extraction
▪ Extract DNA from the tumor specimen using an
appropriate extraction kit.
▪ Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer and assess
quality and integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis
or a similar method.
▪ If DNA quality is not satisfactory, re-extract or use
alternative extraction methods as needed.
2. Library Preparation
▪ Utilize library preparation kits specific to the
sequencing platform in use.
▪ Fragment DNA, perform end repair, adaptor ligation,
and amplification according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
▪ Quantify and validate the library using a fluorometer
and assess the size distribution using capillary
electrophoresis.
3. Sequencing
▪ Load the validated library onto the sequencing
platform.
▪ Configure the sequencing run with appropriate
parameters (e.g., read length, coverage).
▪ Initiate sequencing and monitor the run to ensure
proper functioning of the equipment.
▪ Run control samples to confirm the accuracy and
reliability of the sequencing process.
▪ Upon completion, transfer sequencing data to a
secure storage location for further analysis.
4. Data Analysis
▪ Perform base calling and quality check of the raw
sequencing data.
▪ Align the sequencing reads to the reference genome
using appropriate alignment software (e.g., BWA,
Bowtie2).
▪ Mark duplicates and perform local realignment around
indels.
▪ Call variants using established variant calling software
(e.g., GATK, VarScan).
▪ Annotate identified variants using annotation tools
(e.g., Annovar, VEP).
▪ Utilize bioinformatics pipelines to identify lung cancer-
specific mutations and compile a mutation report.
5. Quality Control
▪ Implement internal quality controls including positive
and negative controls in each run.
▪ Review quality metrics such as coverage depth, base
quality scores, and variant quality scores.
▪ Perform manual inspection of variants to confirm
computational analysis results.
▪ Troubleshoot any discrepancies observed in quality
control metrics.
▪ Compare results of control samples to established
reference values.
6. Result Verification and Reporting
▪ Generate a summary report of identified mutations.
▪ Verify the accuracy and completeness of the results by
cross-reference with control data and second analyst
review if necessary.
▪ Validate critical mutations manually and through
secondary analysis platforms as necessary.
▪ Draft the final report, ensuring proper documentation
of findings, interpretation, and clinical significance.
▪ Submit the report for review and approval by a senior
lab personnel or supervisor.
▪ Transfer verified results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and communicate results to the ordering
physician or healthcare provider as needed.
