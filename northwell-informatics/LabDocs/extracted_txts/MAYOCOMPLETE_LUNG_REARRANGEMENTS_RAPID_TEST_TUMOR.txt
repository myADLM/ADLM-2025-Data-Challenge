MAYOCOMPLETE LUNG REARRANGEMENTS, RAPID TEST,
TUMOR - Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide an efficient and accurate method for analyzing suspected
lung tumor samples for specific genetic rearrangements using the
MAYOCOMPLETE LUNG REARRANGEMENTS, RAPID TEST. This
procedure ensures high-quality results that aid in diagnosing lung
cancer and planning patient treatment.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory technologist to
perform the MAYOCOMPLETE LUNG REARRANGEMENTS, RAPID
TEST on tumor samples received in the laboratory, document the
findings, and report the results accurately and timely.
1. SPECIMEN
Type of Specimen:
• Tumor biopsy tissue
Acceptable:
• Fresh frozen tissue or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks
Unacceptable:
• Contaminated or improperly labeled specimens
• Specimens not meeting the minimum tissue requirement
• Degraded or necrotic tissue
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• MAYOCOMPLETE LUNG REARRANGEMENTS Test Kit
• Microtome
• DNA/RNA Extraction Kit
• Thermal Cycler
• Real-Time PCR System / Digital PCR System
• Pipettes and Filter Tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Reagents and buffers as specified in the MAYOCOMPLETE
LUNG REARRANGEMENTS Test Kit
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
FFPE Tissue Samples:
• Cut 5-10 micrometer sections from the FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
• Place sections into microcentrifuge tubes and deparaffinize if
necessary.
Fresh Frozen Tissue:
• Transfer an appropriate amount (minimum tissue required per
protocol) of fresh frozen tissue into a microcentrifuge tube.
Nucleic Acid Extraction:
• Use a DNA/RNA extraction kit to obtain the nucleic acids from the
tissue sections.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring that the extracted
samples meet necessary quality and concentration levels.
PCR Setup:
• Thaw all reagents and samples at room temperature, then keep
on ice.
• Prepare the PCR reaction mix by adding the required reagents
and DNA/RNA template as per the test kit's protocol.
• Aliquot the PCR mix into each well of the PCR plate/tube.
PCR Amplification:
• Load the plate/tube into the thermal cycler.
• Program the thermal cycler per the kit’s specified cycling
conditions (initial denaturation, annealing, elongation, number of
cycles, etc.).
Post-PCR Analysis:
• Run the PCR plate/tube on a Real-Time PCR System or Digital
PCR System per the kit protocol.
• Determine the presence of genetic rearrangements by analyzing
the amplification curves and cycle threshold (Ct) values as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls provided in the test kit for
each PCR run.
• Follow internal quality control measures to ensure the assay's
integrity (set thresholds, review control results).
• Document all quality control checks performed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze the data following the post-PCR analysis guidelines.
• Enter the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
accurately.
• Verify the results and ensure all critical parameters are within
acceptable ranges before releasing the report.
• Review and sign-off by a supervising pathologist if required per
laboratory policy.
Reference Ranges:
• Positive for lung rearrangements
• Negative for lung rearrangements
• Indeterminate (if controls fail or results are inconclusive)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The assay may fail due to poor quality or quantity of extracted
nucleic acids.
• Presence of PCR inhibitors can interfere with the test results.
• This test is specific for the rearrangements specified in the test kit,
and cannot detect other genetic abnormalities.
