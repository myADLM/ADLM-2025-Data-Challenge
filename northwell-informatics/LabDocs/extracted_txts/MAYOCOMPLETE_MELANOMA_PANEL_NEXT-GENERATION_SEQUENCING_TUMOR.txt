STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for MAYOCOMPLETE Melanoma Panel, Next-
Generation Sequencing, Tumor
1. PURPOSE
The SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase
involved in generating results for the MAYOCOMPLETE Melanoma
Panel using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). This procedure
ensures quality and consistency in testing and results management
for tumor samples.
Responsibility:
This protocol is to be followed by trained personnel in the molecular
diagnostic laboratory. It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to
ensure that all steps are performed as specified and to report any
deviations to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
The MAYOCOMPLETE Melanoma Panel involves the use of NGS
technology to analyze DNA extracted from tumor tissue to identify
genetic variants associated with melanoma.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verification:
◦ Confirm that the specimen (tumor tissue) has been
collected, received, and accessioned correctly.
◦ Verify that the sample details match the requisition form.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from the tumor tissue using a validated DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Measure the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
using spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorometry
(e.g., Qubit).
3. Quality Control of DNA:
◦ Ensure that the DNA sample has a concentration of ≥20 ng/
µL and a purity (A260/A280 ratio) between 1.8 and 2.0.
◦ Run a 1% agarose gel to assess the integrity of the DNA.
B. Library Preparation
1. DNA Fragmentation:
◦ Fragment the DNA using sonication or enzymatic methods
to generate 150-300 bp fragments.
2. End Repair and Adapter Ligation:
◦ Perform end repair and add platform-specific adapters (e.g.,
Illumina) to the fragmented DNA.
3. Library Amplification:
◦ Enrich the library using polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
following the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Library Quantification and Quality Control:
◦ Quantify the library using qPCR or a fluorometric method.
◦ Assess the size distribution of the library using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
C. Sequencing
1. Sequencing Setup:
◦ Load the prepared library onto the NGS instrument (e.g.,
Illumina HiSeq or MiSeq).
◦ Ensure that sequencing reagents are prepared and loaded
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Input the necessary run parameters and start the
sequencing run.
2. Run Monitoring:
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for quality metrics, including
cluster density and percentage of PF clusters.
D. Data Analysis
1. Primary Analysis:
◦ Use the NGS instrument’s software for base calling and
initial sequence data processing.
2. Secondary Analysis:
◦ Align the sequence reads to the reference genome (e.g.,
GRCh38) using bioinformatics software (e.g., BWA, Bowtie).
◦ Perform variant calling using tools such as GATK, VarScan,
or similar.
3. Tertiary Analysis:
◦ Annotate the identified variants with information from
databases such as COSMIC, ClinVar, and dbSNP.
◦ Filter and prioritize variants based on their potential clinical
significance.
E. Quality Control
1. Run Review:
◦ Validate the run by ensuring all quality control metrics are
within acceptable ranges.
◦ Re-sequence samples if any key quality indicators fall below
the threshold.
2. Peer Review:
◦ Perform a secondary review of the results by another
qualified technologist or supervisor.
F. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Clinical Interpretation:
◦ Review the variants identified in the context of melanoma-
related genes.
◦ Consult relevant literature and databases to assess the
clinical significance of detected variants.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a detailed report that includes information on the
detected variants, their potential clinical implications, and
recommendations for follow-up.
3. Reporting:
◦ Ensure that the report is verified and signed off by a
pathologist or qualified laboratory director.
◦ Transmit the final report to the referring physician or
appropriate medical personnel.
4. Documentation
• Maintain comprehensive records of all steps, from sample receipt
to report issuance.
• Ensure all logbooks and electronic records are updated and
securely stored.
1. Troubleshooting
• Notify a supervisor immediately in the event of any procedural
deviations, instrument errors, or quality control failures.
• Document any incidents and corrective actions taken.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and kit inserts for DNA extraction,
library preparation, and sequencing platforms.
• Bioinformatics tools user guides and best practice guidelines from
reputable resources.
• Relevant literature on melanoma genetics and variant
interpretation.
1. REVIEW
This SOP must be reviewed bi-annually and updated accordingly to
reflect advancements in technology and changes in laboratory
practices.
