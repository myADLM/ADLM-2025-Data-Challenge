1. PROCEDURE
4.1 DNA Extraction
1. Ensure specimen has been accessioned.
2. Extract genomic DNA from the specimen using an appropriate
extraction kit or protocol.
3. Quantify the DNA using a Qubit Fluorometer.
4. Assess the quality of DNA using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.
4.2 Library Preparation
1. Prepare DNA libraries using the NGS library preparation kit as
per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of prepared libraries using the
Qubit Fluorometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer, respectively.
4.3 PCR Amplification
1. Amplify the library using PCR as instructed in the library
preparation protocol.
2. Purify PCR products according to the kit’s protocol.
4.4 Sequencing
1. Load the final purified libraries onto the sequencer.
2. Follow the specific instructions for the sequencing run setup as
given by the manufacturer's user manual.
3. Start the sequencing run ensuring correct instrument calibration
and sample entry.
4.5 Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data from the instrument to the
analysis workstation.
2. Perform initial reads quality control checks using software such
as FastQC.
3. Align sequencing reads to the reference genome using
appropriate software (e.g., BWA, HISAT2).
4. Detect variants calling using reliable software (e.g., GATK,
Varscan).
5. Annotate identified mutations using annotation tools (e.g.,
ANNOVAR, SnpEff).
6. Use bioinformatics pipelines and software approved by the
laboratory's validated procedures to interpret the results.
4.6 Quality Control
1. Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Review QC metrics: ensure coverage, library complexity, and
mapping quality meet threshold criteria.
3. Investigate and resolve any deviations from the acceptable
range of QC metrics.
4.7 Results Reporting
1. Review and verify findings with additional bioinformatic checks
if necessary.
2. Document all identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic
variants.
3. Prepare the report for clinical interpretation including the
significance of identified variants.
4. Upload validated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and distribution.
5. LIMITATIONS
• DNA sample quality and quantity must meet minimum
requirements as poor sample quality may lead to inadequate
sequencing results.
• Ensure appropriate instrument maintenance and calibration to
avoid technical errors.
• Interpret results in the context of the comprehensive clinical and
other laboratory findings.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manuals and product inserts for all kits and
reagents used.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature for the interpretation of genomic
variants.
• Internal and external quality assurance protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION
2. Maintain all records of DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing runs, QC checks, and data analysis.
3. Ensure logs and electronic records are complete, accurate, and
backed up according to laboratory policy.
4. REVIEW AND REVISION
5. This protocol should be reviewed annually or revised as
necessary to conform with updates in technology and
guidelines.
6. Any protocol changes must be documented and approved by
the laboratory management.
This SOP will ensure consistent, accurate, and efficient analysis of
myeloid neoplasm specimens using next-generation sequencing
technology. All laboratory personnel must adhere strictly to these
guidelines.
