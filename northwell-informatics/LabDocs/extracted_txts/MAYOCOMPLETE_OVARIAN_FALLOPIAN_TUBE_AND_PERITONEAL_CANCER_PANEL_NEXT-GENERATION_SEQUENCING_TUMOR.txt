SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
MAYOCOMPLETE OVARIAN, FALLOPIAN TUBE, AND
PERITONEAL CANCER PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING (NGS), TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for the MAYOCOMPLETE Ovarian, Fallopian
Tube, and Peritoneal Cancer Panel using Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS) from tumor specimens. This ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for diagnosis, prognosis, and
therapeutic management.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to perform
the analysis following this SOP. It is also the responsibility of lab
supervisors to ensure the SOP is followed and to address any issues
that arise during the analysis.
2. DEFINITIONS
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a method used to sequence
DNA or RNA to identify genetic variations.
• Library Preparation: The process of converting tumor DNA into a
form compatible with the sequencing technology.
• Sequencer: The instrument used to perform NGS.
• Bioinformatics Analysis: Computational methods used to analyze
sequencing data to identify genetic variants.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tumor DNA
1. Isolation and Quantification of DNA:
◦ Extract DNA from tumor specimen using a validated
extraction method.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a fluorometric method
(e.g., Qubit fluorometer).
◦ Assess DNA purity using spectrophotometry (e.g.,
NanoDrop).
2. DNA Quality Control (QC):
◦ Run 5 μl of DNA on an agarose gel to check for degradation.
◦ Ensure the DNA concentration is within the acceptable
range (e.g., 20-200 ng/μl).
◦ Store DNA at -20°C until further use.
B) Library Preparation
1. Shearing the DNA:
◦ Use a sonicator or another fragmentation device to shear
DNA to the desired fragment length (e.g., 150-200 bp).
2. End Repair, A-tailing, and Adapter Ligation:
◦ Perform end repair and A-tailing using an end repair/A-
tailing enzyme mix.
◦ Ligate sequencing adapters to the A-tailed DNA fragments
using a ligation enzyme mix.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Amplify the adapter-ligated DNA fragments using a PCR
protocol with specific primers.
◦ Purify the PCR products using magnetic beads.
4. Library QC:
◦ Quantify the prepared library using a fluorometric method.
◦ Check library size distribution using a bioanalyzer or similar
device.
◦ Ensure an optimal concentration and appropriate fragment
size before sequencing.
C) Sequencing
1. Loading Libraries onto Sequencer:
◦ Dilute the libraries to the required concentration.
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform
(e.g., Illumina sequencer).
2. Running the Sequencer:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for setting up and
running the sequencer.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run to ensure there are no errors or
deviations from expected performance.
D) Data Analysis
1. Primary Data Analysis:
◦ Use sequencer-provided software for primary data analysis
to generate raw sequence files (FASTQ).
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align the raw sequence data against the human reference
genome using bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, Isaac).
◦ Perform variant calling using appropriate variant calling
software (e.g., GATK, VarDict).
3. Annotation and Interpretation:
◦ Annotate the identified variants using a comprehensive
annotation tool (e.g., ANNOVAR, VEP).
◦ Interpret the clinical significance of variants based on
databases and clinical guidelines (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC).
E) Quality Control and Reporting
1. QC Metrics Review:
◦ Review sequencing quality metrics (e.g., coverage, read
quality) to ensure data integrity.
◦ Ensure all target regions meet the minimum coverage
threshold.
2. Data Interpretation Meeting:
◦ Present the data in a multidisciplinary meeting involving
pathologists, geneticists, and oncologists.
◦ Finalize the interpretation of significant and actionable
variants.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Compile the interpreted results into a standardized report
format.
◦ Include information on detected variants, their clinical
significance, and any recommended follow-up tests or
treatments.
4. Result Verification:
◦ Verify the final report through a dual-review process by
qualified personnel.
◦ Release the results to the ordering physician via the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
F) Documentation and Records
1. Maintain Detailed Records:
◦ Document all steps of the analytical process in the
laboratory information management system (LIMS).
◦ Retain records of all QC data, sequencing run metrics, and
bioinformatics analyses for future reference.
2. Archiving:
◦ Store sequencing data and associated analysis files in a
secure, backed-up digital archive.
◦ Archive physical DNA samples and libraries at -80°C as per
laboratory policies.
