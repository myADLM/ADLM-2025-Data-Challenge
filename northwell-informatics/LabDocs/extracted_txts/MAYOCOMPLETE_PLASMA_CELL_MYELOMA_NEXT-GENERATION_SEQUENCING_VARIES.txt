Standard Operating Procedure for MAYOCOMPLETE Plasma
Cell Myeloma Testing via Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions and
ensure uniformity in the analytical processes for generating results
from the MAYOCOMPLETE Plasma Cell Myeloma test using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the NGS
analysis for Plasma Cell Myeloma at our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained on NGS and in accordance with CLIA
guidelines are responsible for following this protocol. The laboratory
supervisor will ensure that the procedures are performed correctly
and documented appropriately.
4. DEFINITIONS
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a technology allowing
parallel sequencing of multiple DNA fragments.
• Plasma Cell Myeloma: A cancer of plasma cells, also known as
multiple myeloma.
• Bioinformatics: A computational approach applied in the
evaluation of genomic data.
5. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA Extraction kit
• Quantification reagents (e.g., PicoGreen)
• NGS library preparation kit
• Sequencing reagents and flow cells
• Dedicated NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina or equivalent)
• PCR thermal cycler
• Benchtop centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Bioinformatics software
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable specimens:
• Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA or
heparinized tubes.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens not stored or transported at 2-8°C
• Hemolyzed, clotted samples,or incorrect tube types
7. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Ensure specimens are at room temperature before processing.
2. Extract genomic DNA using the designated DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer or PicoGreen assay.
4. Normalize all DNA samples to the concentration required by the
library preparation protocol (e.g., 50 ng/µL).
B. NGS Library Preparation
1. Perform initial quality control checks on each DNA sample.
2. Follow the library preparation kit's protocol to prepare DNA
libraries. This typically involves processes such as DNA
fragmentation, end repair, adapter ligation, and PCR
amplification.
3. Quantify and validate the prepared libraries using a fluorometer
and bioanalyzer or tape station.
C. Sequencing
1. Load the prepared DNA libraries onto the designated NGS
platform according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Assemble and start the sequencing run.
3. Monitor the sequencing using the platform’s built-in software to
ensure proper function and sequencing quality.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Transfer raw sequencing data securely to the bioinformatics
analysis pipeline.
2. Use the appropriate bioinformatics tools to align reads to the
human genome and identify genetic variants associated with
plasma cell myeloma.
3. Review initial data output and apply relevant filters to remove
artifacts and low-confidence variants.
4. Ensure that all findings are double-checked by a second
analyst for accuracy.
E. Quality Control
1. Run routine controls and standards alongside patient samples
to detect and correct any systemic errors, ensuring the
accuracy of the NGS data.
2. Document and investigate any deviations from expected control
results.
3. Perform proficiency testing as mandated by CLIA guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing key findings,
including clinically relevant variants.
2. Ensure results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified
laboratory director or pathologist.
3. Transmit the final report to the requesting physician via the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
1. Regularly calibrate and maintain the NGS sequencer according
to the manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Schedule routine service and maintenance checks to ensure
continued operation and accuracy.
10. DOCUMENTATION
1. Maintain proper records of all steps from specimen receipt to
result reporting.
2. Document any deviations and the corrective actions taken in
the laboratory’s quality management system.
