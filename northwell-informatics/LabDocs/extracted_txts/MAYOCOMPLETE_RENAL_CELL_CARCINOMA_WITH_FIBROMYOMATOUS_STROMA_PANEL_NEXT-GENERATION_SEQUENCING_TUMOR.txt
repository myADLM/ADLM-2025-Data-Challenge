Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for MAYOCOMPLETE
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA
WITH FIBROMYOMATOUS
STROMA PANEL, NEXT-
GENERATION SEQUENCING,
TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the next-generation
sequencing (NGS) analysis of the MAYOCOMPLETE Renal Cell
Carcinoma (RCC) with Fibromyomatous Stroma Panel using tumor
specimens. This SOP outlines the steps to ensure accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel involved in this
protocol to follow the outlined procedures and ensure that the
appropriate quality control measures are adhered to at every step.
Only personnel trained in NGS and the specific requirements of this
test should perform this analysis. The supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the process and addressing any deviations from the
protocol.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
PREPARATION
Specimen Requirements
• Tissue specimen: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue block, or unstained slides (minimum of 10 slides with 5-10
micron sections).
• Specimens must be accompanied by a pathology report
confirming the diagnosis and providing details of the tumor’s
histology and location.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens that are incorrectly labeled or lack proper
identification.
• Specimens with a low tumor cellularity (<20% tumor cells).
• Specimens that have been improperly fixed (e.g., over-fixed or
improperly processed).
Specimen Preparation
1. Deparaffinization (for FFPE tissues):
◦ Place the FFPE tissue sections on a clean slide.
◦ Deparaffinize the sections using standard deparaffinization
techniques: typically involves sequential immersion in
xylene, followed by rehydration through a series of graded
ethanol baths.
2. Extraction of DNA:
◦ Follow the laboratory’s specified protocol for DNA extraction
from FFPE tissues.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
◦ Assess the quality of the DNA using an appropriate method
(e.g., gel electrophoresis, TapeStation, or Bioanalyzer).
4. LIBRARY PREPARATION
Library Preparation Kit
• Use a validated NGS library preparation kit designed for the
specific requirements of the RCC Panel.
Procedure
1. DNA Fragmentation:
◦ Fragment the extracted DNA using a mechanical or
enzymatic shearing method.
◦ Size-select the fragmented DNA to ensure an average insert
size appropriate for the sequencing platform being used.
2. End Repair and A-tailing:
◦ Perform end repair and A-tailing according to the library
preparation kit manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Adapter Ligation:
◦ Ligate the sequencing adapters to the fragmented DNA.
◦ Purify the adapter-ligated DNA to remove any unligated
adapters.
4. PCR Amplification:
◦ Amplify the adapter-ligated DNA using PCR.
◦ Ensure that the number of PCR cycles is optimized to
minimize biases while obtaining sufficient material for
sequencing.
5. Library Quantification and Quality Control:
◦ Quantify the final library using a method appropriate for the
sequencing platform (e.g., qPCR, fluorometry).
◦ Assess the quality and size distribution of the library using a
TapeStation, Bioanalyzer, or similar instrument.
5. SEQUENCING
Sequencing Platform
• Use a high-throughput NGS platform validated for clinical use
(e.g., Illumina, ThermoFisher, etc.).
Procedure
1. Load Libraries:
◦ Prepare the sequencing run according to the platform
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Load the libraries onto the sequencing instrument.
2. Run Sequencing:
◦ Initiate the sequencing run and monitor for correct function
and completion.
6. DATA ANALYSIS
Bioinformatics Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing:
◦ Perform base calling and generate raw sequencing reads.
◦ Perform initial quality control using tools like FastQC.
2. Alignment to Reference Genome:
◦ Align the sequencing reads to the reference human genome
(e.g., GRCh38) using an aligner such as BWA or STAR.
◦ Remove duplicates using a tool like Picard.
3. Variant Calling:
◦ Call variants using a validated variant caller such as GATK
or Mutect2.
4. Annotation and Filtering:
◦ Annotate the identified variants using a clinical annotation
tool (e.g., ANNOVAR, VEP).
◦ Filter variants based on quality metrics and known
pathogenicity.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
assay's accuracy and detect any contamination.
• Verify that all control results are within the expected range before
reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification
1. Visualization:
◦ Review the aligned reads and variant calls using
visualization tools like IGV.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the variants in the clinical context of renal cell
carcinoma with fibromyomatous stroma, based on current
scientific literature and clinical guidelines.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report detailing the identified
variants and their clinical significance.
◦ A pathologist or molecular geneticist signs off on the report
before it is issued.
Results Transmission
• Report the results electronically through the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure that critical findings are promptly communicated to the
ordering physician.
9. REFERENCES
• Provide references to relevant clinical guidelines, scientific
literature, and manufacturer’s instructions for the kits and
instruments used.

Cell Carcinoma with Fibromyomatous Stroma Panel is performed
consistently and to the highest standards, ensuring reliable and
clinically actionable results.
