SOP for MAYOCOMPLETE Sarcoma Mutation Panel, Next-
Generation Sequencing, Tumor
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for the MAYOCOMPLETE
Sarcoma Mutation Panel using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
technology from tumor specimens.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated staff to
perform the procedures as outlined in this document.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred specimens: - Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tumor tissue blocks or slides - Fresh or frozen tumor tissue -
Minimum DNA requirement: 50 ng of high-quality DNA
Unacceptable specimens: - Specimens with less than 10% tumor
content - Severely degraded or fragmented DNA with an A260/A280
ratio outside 1.8-2.0 range
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment: - NGS Sequencer (Illumina HiSeq, MiSeq or equivalent) -
DNA extraction kits (validated for FFPE and fresh/frozen tissue) -
PCR thermal cycler - Magnetic stand for DNA purification -
Bioanalyzer or equivalent for DNA quality assessment - Computer
with bioinformatics software for data analysis
Reagents: - MAYOCOMPLETE Sarcoma Mutation Panel primers and
probes - PCR reagents (high-fidelity DNA polymerase, dNTPs, etc.) -
Library preparation kit (compatible with NGS sequencer) - Magnetic
beads for DNA cleanup
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction - Extract DNA from FFPE or fresh/frozen tumor
tissue using a validated kit. - Measure DNA concentration and assess
purity using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer or equivalent. - Analyze
DNA integrity on a Bioanalyzer (or equivalent) to ensure samples
meet quality criteria.
B) Library Preparation - Quantify and normalize DNA to 50 ng. -
Adhere to the manufacturers' protocol for the MAYOCOMPLETE
Sarcoma Mutation Panel for multiplex PCR amplification. - Purify
PCR products using magnetic beads and assess quality.
C) Sequencing - Prepare sequencing libraries according to the library
preparation kit instructions. - Normalize and pool libraries. - Load
libraries onto the NGS sequencer and perform sequencing according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
D) Data Analysis - Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics
pipeline. - Perform quality control on sequencing reads. - Align reads
to the human genome reference (hg19/hg38). - Call variants using
appropriate variant caller software. - Annotate variants to identify
clinically significant mutations in sarcoma genes.
E) Reporting Results - Verify and interpret variant data. - Document
all findings and interpretations into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). - Review data with a pathologist or molecular
geneticist. - Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the
mutations detected and provide clinical significance.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use positive and negative controls during DNA extraction.
◦ Include reference samples with known mutations for every
sequencing run.
◦ Verify library preparation efficiency using
electropherograms.
◦ Perform inter-laboratory comparisons periodically to ensure
result consistency.
◦ Engage in routine maintenance of sequencers and data
analysis software updates.
2. LIMITATIONS
◦ Low tumor content in the specimen may result in reduced
assay sensitivity.
◦ Extensive DNA fragmentation may compromise the quality
of library preparation and sequencing.
◦ Rare variant detection may require confirmation with
orthogonal methods.
3. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturers’ manuals for DNA extraction, PCR, library
preparation, and NGS sequencing.
◦ Bioinformatics tools documentation (e.g., BWA, GATK, and
Annovar).
◦ Relevant guidelines from the College of American
Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA).
