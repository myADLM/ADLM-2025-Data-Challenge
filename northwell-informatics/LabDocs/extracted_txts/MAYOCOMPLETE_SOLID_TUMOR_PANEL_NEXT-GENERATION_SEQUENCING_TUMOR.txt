Tumor Panel, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), Tumor
1. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase processes required to generate reliable
and reproducible results for the MAYOCOMPLETE Solid Tumor
Panel using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. This
protocol ensures that procedures are followed in a consistent and
standardized manner in compliance with CLIA regulations.
1. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the analytical
phase of the MAYOCOMPLETE Solid Tumor Panel test in the [Your
Laboratory Name] CLIA-certified laboratory. It includes steps from
sample preparation to data analysis and interpretation.
1. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Technologists: Follow the SOP for the NGS
process, from sample preparation to data analysis, and document
all steps accurately.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure all staff are trained on this SOP
and compliance is maintained. Monitor and cross-check
documentation and result interpretations.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor the quality control and
assurance processes. Investigate and resolve any deviations from
standard procedures.
1. Definitions and Abbreviations
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing
• DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
• QC: Quality Control
• QNS: Quantity Not Sufficient
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor
tissue
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are poorly fixed,
have insufficient tumor content, or are otherwise unsuitable for
DNA extraction and sequencing.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• NGS Sequencer: Ensure sequencer is calibrated as per
manufacturer's instructions.
• DNA Extraction Kit: Use recommended DNA extraction kit for
FFPE samples.
• Library Preparation Kit: Follow the library preparation protocols
for the specific NGS platform.
• Quality Control reagents: Include appropriate positive and
negative controls.
• Laboratory Software: For sequencing data analysis and
interpretation.
1. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction
◦ Deparaffinize FFPE tissue sections.
◦ Extract DNA using the validated DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA.
2. Quality Control of DNA
◦ Measure DNA concentration with a fluorometer.
◦ Assess DNA quality by running an aliquot on an agarose gel
or using a Bioanalyzer.
◦ Record DNA quantity and quality metrics.
◦ If the DNA is degraded or QNS, request a new sample.
B. Library Preparation
1. Fragment DNA
◦ Fragment DNA to the appropriate size using sonication.
◦ Verify fragment size distribution via agarose gel
electrophoresis or Bioanalyzer.
2. End Repair, A-tailing, and Adapter Ligation
◦ Perform end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation following
the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Purify the resulting product using bead-based cleanup.
3. Library Amplification
◦ Amplify the library using PCR and a library preparation kit.
◦ Assess the amplified library for size distribution and
concentration.
4. Quality Control of Library
◦ Confirm the final library quality and concentration.
◦ Apply stringent criteria to ensure high-quality libraries before
proceeding to sequencing.
C. Sequencing
1. Load Libraries on Sequencer
◦ Pool libraries and load onto sequencer.
◦ Ensure proper calibration and setup of the sequencing run.
2. Run Sequencing
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for quality and troubleshoot any
issues immediately.
◦ Document all run parameters and any deviations from
standard procedures.
D. Data Analysis
1. Primary Analysis
◦ Use sequencer's software to perform base calling and
generate raw data files.
◦ Verify that QC metrics (e.g., cluster density, Q30 scores)
meet the required thresholds.
2. Secondary Analysis
◦ Align sequencing reads to the reference genome.
◦ Call variants and filter out low-quality variants using
bioinformatics pipelines.
3. Tertiary Analysis
◦ Annotate variants using appropriate databases.
◦ Interpret pathogenicity of variants based on clinical
relevance and guidelines.
◦ Generate a report summarizing detected variants and their
clinical significance.
E. Quality Control and Reporting
1. Quality Control
◦ Perform regular QC with known reference standards.
◦ Document and review all QC activities and any corrective
actions taken.
2. Reporting Results
◦ Review the data interpretation for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Generate final report and verify by the supervising
technologist.
◦ Deliver results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Documentation
Document every stage of the process in laboratory records, including:
• DNA extraction and QC metrics
• Library preparation and QC metrics
• Sequencing run metrics and outcomes
• Data analysis steps and variant interpretation
• Quality control results and any corrective measures taken
1. References
