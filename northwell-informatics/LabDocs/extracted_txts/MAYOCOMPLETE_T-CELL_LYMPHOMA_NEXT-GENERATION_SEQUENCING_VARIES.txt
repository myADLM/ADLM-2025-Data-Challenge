Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MAYOCOMPLETE T-CELL LYMPHOMA,
NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standard operating
procedures (SOP) for the analytical phase of generating results for
the MAYOCOMPLETE T-CELL LYMPHOMA, next-generation
sequencing (NGS) assay. This ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
timely reporting of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform next-generation sequencing analysis for detecting genetic
variations associated with T-cell lymphoma. The specimens have
already been collected, received, and accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory scientists and technologists are responsible for
performing this procedure. The laboratory supervisor is responsible
for ensuring compliance with this protocol and addressing any issues
that arise during the process.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Next-Generation Sequencer
• Analytical software for NGS data interpretation
• QC control materials
• Pipettes, tubes, and other standard laboratory supplies
• Reagents and chemicals specific to the library preparation kits
• Computer with LIMS (Laboratory Information Management
System) access
5. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all safety protocols for handling biological specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coats, gloves, and eye protection.
• Dispose of waste materials according to laboratory biosafety
guidelines.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Library Preparation:
1. Prepare DNA samples per library preparation kit instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA using a fluorometric or spectrophotometric
method.
3. Prepare libraries from the DNA samples following the kit
protocol, including end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and
PCR amplification.
4. Validate library size and concentration using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer or equivalent instrument.
5. Pool libraries as appropriate for sequencing run.
B. Sequencing Run:
1. Load pooled libraries onto the flow cell/chip according to the
sequencer manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run the sequencing protocol as recommended by the
instrumentation.
3. Monitor the sequencing process for quality and performance
using the instrument's software.
4. At the run's completion, verify that the run meets quality control
metrics.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the appropriate data storage
system and initiate the data analysis pipeline.
2. Perform initial quality assessment using FastQC or an
equivalent tool to ensure that sequencing data meets the
quality criteria.
3. Use the appropriate bioinformatics tools to align reads to a
reference genome and call variants.
4. Filter and annotate variants using the laboratory’s standard
bioinformatics pipeline.
5. Perform secondary validation and interpretation of results by
licensed pathologist or qualified personnel as needed.
D. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each sequencing run
to ensure that the procedure works correctly.
2. Document the performance of quality control materials and
address any deviations observed.
3. Troubleshooting steps to follow in case of failed quality controls:
◦ Re-evaluate library preparation steps and reagent integrity.
◦ Re-run QC metrics on the sequencer.
◦ If necessary, resequence the sample or consult with the
supervisor.
E. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Thoroughly document each step of the process in the
laboratory notebook or LIMS.
2. Review and verify the sequence data and variant calls before
finalizing the report.
3. Assemble the final report, detailing the findings relative to T-cell
lymphoma, and include comprehensive interpretations as
required.
4. Ensure that all results are reviewed and signed off by a
qualified laboratory director or designated expert.
5. Report the results electronically to the ordering clinician through
the LIS.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Result verification: Ensure that results are verified and meet
internal quality criteria.
• Reference ranges and interpretation: Include reference ranges
specific to T-cell lymphoma and interpret results in clinical context.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Highlight the limitations of the NGS assay, including potential false
negatives or positives, regions with poor coverage, and limitations
in detecting certain variants.
• Acknowledge any assay-specific limitations as outlined in the
package insert or validation studies.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for library preparation and sequencing
• Package inserts for all reagents and kits used in the process
• NGS platform user manual
• Publicly available standards and guidelines for NGS
This SOP will be reviewed and updated at least annually or whenever
necessary changes in the process or technology arise. The
adherence to this protocol ensures accurate and reliable outcomes in
T-cell lymphoma genetic sequencing diagnostics.
