Standard Operating Procedures: Analytical Phase for
Mayo Stratification of Myeloma and Risk-Adapted
Therapy Report, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for analyzing bone marrow samples and generating results for the
Mayo Algorithmic Approach of Stratification of Myeloma and Risk-
Adapted Therapy. This ensures accurate, reliable, and repeatable
results for the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple
myeloma.
2. SCOPE
This SOP covers the analytical phase, including specimen
preparation, analytical procedures, quality controls, result
interpretation, and reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained and certified medical laboratory scientists are responsible
for carrying out the steps outlined in this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor ensures adherence to this SOP and
manages any deviations.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Bone Marrow Aspirate: A sample obtained from the marrow for
the purpose of disease diagnosis.
• Mayo Algorithmic Approach: A structured method developed by
the Mayo Clinic for assessing multiple myeloma severity and risk
stratification.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Minimum volume: 1-3 mL of aspirated bone marrow.
• Specimen container: EDTA anti-coagulated tube.
• Specimen stability: Must be processed within 2 hours of collection
or refrigerated at 2-8°C and processed within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Clotted specimens, specimens beyond
acceptable stability time, specimens with visible signs of
contamination.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining reagents
• Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) probes
• Microscope
• Centrifuge
• RNA/DNA extraction kits
• PCR machine
• Appropriate calibrators and controls
• Lab refrigerator (controlled at 2-8°C)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Bone Marrow Aspiration:
◦ Ensure the sample is fixed in EDTA and transported
promptly.
◦ Mix the sample gently if stored refrigerated before
processing.
2. Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the bone marrow sample at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes.
◦ Collect the mono-layer and resuspend in appropriate
medium for further analysis.
B. Analytical Procedures
1. Flow Cytometry:
◦ Prepare single-cell suspensions using standard techniques.
◦ Stain cells with monoclonal antibodies specific to plasma
cell markers (e.g., CD38, CD138).
◦ Run samples on the flow cytometer and collect data.
2. Cytogenetics - FISH Analysis:
◦ Prepare slides using standard bone marrow cytogenetics
protocols.
◦ Apply FISH probes for specific translocations and
chromosomal abnormalities pertinent to myeloma (e.g.,
t(4;14), t(14;16), deletions of 17p).
◦ Analyze under a fluorescence microscope and record
findings.
3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC):
◦ Prepare bone marrow biopsy sections on slides.
◦ Perform IHC staining using specific antibodies for myeloma-
related markers (e.g., Cyclin D1, p53).
◦ Examine slides under a microscope and interpret staining
patterns.
4. PCR and Molecular Testing:
◦ Extract RNA/DNA using extraction kits following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Perform PCR to detect specific genetic mutations and
translocations.
◦ Analyze PCR products using gel electrophoresis or
quantitative PCR machines as appropriate.
C. Quality Control
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls for flow cytometry, FISH,
IHC, and PCR procedures.
◦ Document the results of the quality control samples with each
run.
◦ Identify and troubleshoot any deviations from control limits
before processing patient samples.
• Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs according
to regulatory guidelines.
◦ Review and address any deficiencies identified in proficiency
testing.
D. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Flow cytometry data should be analyzed using specialized
software.
◦ FISH results should be interpreted based on the
fluorescence signal patterns and recorded.
◦ IHC results should be reviewed by a pathologist and
documented.
◦ Molecular test results should be interpreted by comparing
with control reactions and known mutation libraries.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Compile and enter all results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and authorized by a qualified
pathologist or medical director before release.
◦ Generate the report following the Mayo Clinic template,
which includes the risk stratification based on the analytical
results.
◦ Communicate critical findings immediately to the treating
physician.
E. Documentation and Record-Keeping
• Maintain a log of all specimens processed including date/time of
receipt, processing date, and result reporting date.
• Keep records of quality control results, proficiency testing
outcomes, and any corrective actions taken.
• Store all generated data securely and in compliance with local,
state, and federal regulations.

stratification.
• Manufacturer manuals for all reagents and instruments used.

multiple myeloma.
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed when new
regulations or guidelines are published. Approval by the laboratory
director is required for any revisions.
