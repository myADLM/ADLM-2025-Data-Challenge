Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
MDM2 (12Q15) Amplification, Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma/
Atypical Lipomatous Tumor, FISH, Tissue
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the analytical procedure for detecting MDM2
(12Q15) amplification using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) in tissue samples. The analysis is used to diagnose well-
differentiated liposarcoma and atypical lipomatous tumors.
2. Responsibility
The laboratory staff, including technologists and supervisors, are
responsible for performing, documenting, and reviewing the FISH
analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
report and escalate any issues affecting the test accuracy or test
results to a supervisor immediately.
3. Specimen Requirements and Handling
Specimen Type:
• Paraffin-embedded tissue sections or fresh frozen tissue.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure specimens are stored at an appropriate temperature
(-20°C for frozen tissue, room temperature for paraffin-embedded
sections).
• Cut paraffin-embedded tissues to 3-4 µm thick sections and place
on positively charged slides.
• Store the slides at room temperature until use.
4. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies
Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets.
• Hybridization oven.
• Microtome.
• Water bath.
Reagents and Supplies:
• FISH probe for MDM2 (12Q15) (commercially available).
• Pre-treatment kit containing paraffin removal reagents, heat
pretreatment solution, protease solution.
• Hybridization buffer.
• DAPI counterstain.
• Coverslips.
• Immersed oil for fluorescence microscopy.
5. Procedure
Pre-treatment:
1. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by placing the slides in xylene
for 10 minutes twice.
2. Rehydrate the tissue by passing the slides through graded
ethanol series (100%, 85%, and 70%) and finally distilled water.
Heat Pretreatment:
1. Immerse slides in Pretreatment Solution at 92°-94°C for 20
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Protease Treatment:
1. Immerse slides in Protease Solution at 37°C for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water and air dry.
Hybridization:
1. Apply 10 µL of the MDM2 probe mixture to the target area,
cover with a coverslip, and seal the edges with rubber cement.
2. Place the slides in a hybridization oven at 78°C for 5 minutes to
denature the DNA, then incubate at 37°C for 16-24 hours.
Post-Hybridization Washing:
1. Wash slides in 0.4X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 74°C for 2 minutes.
2. Wash slides in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1
minute.
3. Air dry the slides in the dark.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to each slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and apply a drop of immersion oil on the
coverslip for microscopy examination.
Microscopy and Image Analysis:
1. Analyze the slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filter sets.
2. Examine at least 50 non-overlapping, well-submerged tumor
nuclei for each case, and evaluate the hybridization signals.
3. Count the red (MDM2) signals and green (centromere 12)
signals in each nucleus.
4. Calculate the MDM2/CEN12 ratio. A ratio of ≥2.0 indicates
MDM2 amplification, which is consistent with well-differentiated
liposarcoma or atypical lipomatous tumor.
6. Quality Control
• Perform quality control on every run, including positive and
negative controls.
• Document the lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents.
• Ensure that positive control samples consistently show the
expected amplification, and negative controls show no significant
signal.
• Record and address any discrepancies or issues observed.
7. Reporting Results
• Record the findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results that indicate MDM2 amplification should be carefully
reviewed and verified by another technologist.
• Provide a final interpretative report including the MDM2/CEN12
ratio and its clinical significance.
• Inform the pathologist and clinical team of the findings for clinical
correlation and patient management.
8. Method Limitations
• Ensure tissue quality is adequate for FISH interpretation.
• Amplification detection limit and interpretation criteria adhering to
standard guidelines.
• Potential for false negatives or positives must be recognized, and
suspicious results should prompt additional testing or pathology
review.
9. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for MDM2 (12Q15) FISH probes.
• Current guidelines from the College of American Pathologists
(CAP), Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and
relevant literature.
10. Document Control
• Maintain and review this SOP periodically and update as
necessary to conform to best practices and regulatory
requirements.
• Document any deviations or modifications from the outlined
procedure with appropriate justification and approval from
laboratory management.
