Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MEADOW FESCUE,
IGE, SERUM Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate analysis and reporting of
MEADOW FESCUE-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum
samples using an appropriate immunoassay system.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for following the procedures outlined
in this document for the analysis and reporting of MEADOW
FESCUE-specific serum IgE levels.
It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
procedure which may affect laboratory test results and bring them to
the attention of a supervisor. Staff and supervisors must ensure that
the procedure is performed and documented accurately, including
any corrective actions that may be required.
1. DEFINITION
MEADOW FESCUE-specific IgE: Specific IgE antibodies produced
by the immune system in response to exposure to Meadow Fescue
allergens.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Acceptance Criteria:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens showing signs of
hemolysis, lipemia, contamination, or improper storage
conditions.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA, chemiluminescent
immunoassay system)
• MEADOW FESCUE-specific IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators, controls, and appropriate diluents
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
• Sample tubes and pipettes
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators and controls are within their
expiration dates and have been properly stored.
◦ Allow reagents to reach room temperature before use, as
specified in manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Verify specimen identification and acceptability.
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at proper speed and time to
obtain clear serum.
◦ Aliquot serum samples if necessary, label appropriately.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Prepare the immunoassay analyzer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load the MEADOW FESCUE-specific IgE reagent kit and
verify that the correct assay protocol is selected.
◦ Perform calibration and quality control checks before testing
patient samples:
▪ Run calibrators for standard curve generation.
▪ Analyze quality control samples to ensure assay
performance.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load serum samples into appropriate sample carriers or
wells based on analyzer specification.
◦ Start the assay run on the analyzer.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any system alerts or errors during
the run.
◦ Upon completion of the run, review the raw data and results
generated by the analyzer.
5. Result Interpretation and Documentation:
◦ Verify result accuracy by comparing results against control
samples and the calibration curve.
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Flag any results that fall outside normal reference ranges or
show abnormal values.
6. Troubleshooting:
◦ If results are outside acceptable limits, perform
troubleshooting steps based on analyzer recommendations:
▪ Check for sample quality issues and re-run samples if
necessary.
▪ Verify the integrity of reagents and controls, replace if
required.
D. Quality Control:
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control samples at predetermined intervals
(e.g., beginning, mid, and end of batch runs).
◦ Document all quality control results and ensure they are
within acceptable limits.
◦ Perform corrective actions if QC results are outside
acceptable limits and document these actions.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability of the assay.
◦ Compare results with peer group data and implement any
recommended changes.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Reporting Guidelines:
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
◦ Ensure that results are reported with reference intervals and
relevant annotations.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Critical results must be communicated immediately to the
referring physician or clinical team as per laboratory policy.
◦ Document any critical result notifications in the LIS.
F. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific IgE assay kit.
• Laboratory policies and guidelines for serum IgE testing.
G. Documentation:
• Maintain detailed records of all assay runs, including reagent lot
numbers, calibration data, quality control results, and specimen
data.
• Ensure all documentation adheres to CLIA standards and
laboratory policies.
This SOP ensures the rigorous and accurate analysis of MEADOW
FESCUE-specific IgE levels in serum samples, adhering to laboratory
standards and guidelines to provide reliable results for clinical
decision-making.
