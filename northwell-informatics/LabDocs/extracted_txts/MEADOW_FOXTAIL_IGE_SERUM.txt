Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MEADOW FOXTAIL, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of testing
serum samples for Meadow Foxtail-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE).
This procedure ensures the accurate and consistent measurement of
IgE specific to Meadow Foxtail using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA).
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to perform the
steps outlined in this SOP.
• The laboratory manager or supervisor must ensure compliance
with this SOP and address any discrepancies promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Meadow Foxtail-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody
produced by the immune system in response to allergen exposure
from the Meadow Foxtail. Elevated levels may indicate an allergic
response.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Preferred: Serum obtained from a venous blood
sample.
Specimen Collection:
1. Collect blood sample in a serum separator tube (SST).
2. Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 20 to 30
minutes.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
4. Transfer clear, non-hemolyzed serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
Specimen Storage:
• Serum samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours without
significant degradation.
• For long-term storage, freeze aliquots at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader with 450 nm filter
• ELISA washer (or manual washing tools)
• Micropipettes and tips (various sizes)
• Meadow Foxtail-specific IgE ELISA kit
• Calibrated automatic/manual pipettes
• Deionized water
• Graduated cylinders
• Absorbent material (for wash steps)
• Waste disposal containers (biohazard and non-hazard)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Reagent Preparation:
1. All reagents should be brought to room temperature (18-25°C)
before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and stopping solution
as specified in the ELISA kit manual.
3. Reconstitute or dilute standards and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Plate Preparation:
1. Label the microtiter plate(s) with sample, standard, and control
identifiers.
2. Load 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples into
designated wells.
3. Add 100 µL of the allergen-specific IgE conjugate to each well.
C. Incubation and Washing:
1. Incubate the plate as per the kit's instructions (typically 1 hour
at 37°C).
2. Wash the plate 5 times with the prepared wash buffer. Ensure
the wells are free of residual liquid after the final wash.
D. Substrate Reaction:
1. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-20
minutes or until the desired color development is achieved.
E. Stopping the Reaction:
1. Add 100 µL of stopping solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
2. Gently tap the plate to ensure complete mixing.
F. Measurement and Calculation:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using the ELISA
reader.
2. Generate a standard curve from the OD values of the known
standards.
3. Calculate the IgE concentrations of unknown samples by
interpolating their OD values against the standard curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
• Use the positive and negative control sera provided with the
assay kit.
• Include controls in each assay run and ensure they are within the
expected range.
Procedure:
• Perform QC checks on each new kit lot and record results in the
QC log.
• Review and document any outliers and perform corrective actions
if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report IgE concentrations in IU/mL.
• Verify results against quality control criteria before releasing them.
• Flag abnormal or critical values and notify the requesting
physician as per site-specific guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's ELISA kit insert for specific limitations
associated with the test.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
results and should be noted.

necessary by the laboratory supervisor.
