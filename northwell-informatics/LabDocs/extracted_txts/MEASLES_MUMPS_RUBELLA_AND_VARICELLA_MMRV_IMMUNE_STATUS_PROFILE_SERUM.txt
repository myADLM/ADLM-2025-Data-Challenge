Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: MMRV Immune Status Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the detection and quantification of IgG
antibodies against Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella in human
serum to determine immune status.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis and reporting of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
immune status using serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
test as outlined and ensuring accuracy and reliability of test results.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
MMRV Immune Status Profile: A test that measures IgG antibodies
specific to Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella to determine
immunity.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
a. Specimen Type:
• Human serum
b. Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood in serum separator tubes (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1000x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
• Aliquot the serum into properly labeled secondary tubes.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if the testing is to be performed
within 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes
• Lipemic samples
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• ELISA or Chemiluminescence Analyzer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator (37°C)
b. Reagents:
• Commercially available ELISA kits or Chemiluminescence
immunoassay kits specific for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and
Varicella IgG.
• QC control materials (positive and negative controls)
c. Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coats
• Pipette tips
• Cryovials for serum storage
• Timer
7. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation:
• Ensure equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
• Bring reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
b. Assay Protocol:
i. ELISA Method:
1. Prepare the Work Area:
◦ Layout necessary reagents and equipment.
◦ Wear personal protective equipment.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare wash buffer, conjugate, substrate, and stop solution
as described in the kit insert.
3. Plate Preparation:
◦ All reagents, samples, and controls should be brought to
room temperature.
◦ Arrange test, control, and standards in the ELISA plate wells
according to the plate template.
4. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Pipette 100ul of controls, standards, and patient samples
into respective wells.
◦ Incubate for the specified time at 37°C.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as instructed in the kit protocol to remove
unbound antibodies and prevent non-specific binding.
6. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add appropriate conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate for the specified time at 37°C.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark, usually at room temperature, until color
develops.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well.
◦ Measure the optical density using a microplate reader at the
specified wavelength.
ii. Chemiluminescence Method:
1. Analyzer Preparation:
◦ Turn on the analyzer and ensure it is calibrated.
◦ Load reagents and samples onto the analyzer.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Load patient samples, controls, and reagents into
designated positions on the analyzer.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the analyzer's instructions for running the
immunoassay.
4. Detection and Analysis:
◦ The analyzer will automatically measure the
chemiluminescent signal.
◦ Results are calculated based on the signal intensity against
calibrators.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run control samples with each batch of tests. Include both
positive and negative controls.
• Ensure control results are within the specified range: Refer to the
manufacturer’s insert for acceptable limits.
• Document all QC results.
• If controls fall outside the range, troubleshoot and repeat the
assay as necessary before reporting patient results.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
a. Expected Reference Values:
• Negative: indicates no IgG antibodies detected and likely non-
immune.
• Positive: indicates the presence of IgG antibodies and likely
immune.
b. Report Interpretation:
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and patient history.
• Provide comments on any limitations or additional
recommendations if required.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify before releasing for clinical use.
• Notify the healthcare provider of any critical findings.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Follow standard biosafety and infection control precautions.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to laboratory regulations.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for ELISA or Chemiluminescence kits
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Relevant laboratory safety and quality control protocols.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all test results, quality control data, maintenance logs,
and any deviation from the procedure in the appropriate logs and
LIS.
