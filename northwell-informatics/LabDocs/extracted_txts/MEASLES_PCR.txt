Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MEASLES PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps and
responsibilities for performing the analytical phase of Measles PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing to generate accurate and
reliable results for the detection of Measles virus.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the PCR
testing according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to the protocol, provide guidance,
and resolve any issues that may arise during the testing process.
3. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable specimens include nasopharyngeal swabs, throat
swabs, and urine collected in viral transport media.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 48 hours
of collection. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-70°C or lower.
4. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Measles virus PCR Kit (including primers and probes)
• Nuclease-free water
• 70% Ethanol
• PCR tubes or plates
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips (aerosol-resistant)
• Real-time PCR machine
• Biosafety cabinet class II
• Gloves, lab coat, and eye protection
5. EQUIPMENT
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Thermal cycler
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-PCR Preparation
• Clean the work area with 70% ethanol, ensuring a contamination-
free environment.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
6.2 Reagent Preparation
• Prepare the PCR master mix as per the manufacturer's
instructions using the reagents provided in the Measles virus PCR
Kit.
• Mix the master mix components gently and briefly centrifuge to
collect the contents at the bottom of the tube.
6.3 Sample Preparation
• Thaw the specimen (if frozen) and mix thoroughly by vortexing.
• Aliquot the required volume of specimen to a sterile, nuclease-
free tube.
6.4 PCR Setup
• Label the PCR tubes or wells of a PCR plate clearly with
specimen identifiers.
• Add the appropriate volume of PCR master mix to each tube or
well.
• Add the extracted nucleic acids from the samples into the
corresponding tubes or wells containing the PCR master mix.
6.5 PCR Amplification
• Place the PCR tubes or plate into the thermocycler.
• Program the thermal cycler with the following PCR conditions
(refer to the kit insert for exact conditions):
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 45
• Start the PCR run.
6.6 Data Analysis
• At the end of the PCR run, analyze the data using the real-time
PCR instrument software.
• Determine the presence or absence of the Measles virus by
comparing the amplification curves and cycle threshold (Ct)
values to the positive and negative controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of the test.
• Document the results of the controls and ensure they meet the
acceptance criteria specified in the kit insert. If controls do not
meet the criteria, do not report patient results and troubleshoot
the issue.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results as "Detected" or "Not Detected" based on the
presence or absence of amplification.
• For invalid results, repeat the test using the remaining sample or
request a new specimen.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the PCR fails to amplify properly, check the following:
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiry dates.
◦ Verify correct preparation and pipetting of reagents.
◦ Ensure the thermal cycler is properly calibrated and
functioning.
◦ Check for potential contamination and repeat using new
reagents and samples.

• Ensure all records include date, time, technician's initials,
specimen identifiers, and control results.
By following this SOP, the laboratory can ensure accurate and
reliable results for the detection of Measles virus using PCR.
