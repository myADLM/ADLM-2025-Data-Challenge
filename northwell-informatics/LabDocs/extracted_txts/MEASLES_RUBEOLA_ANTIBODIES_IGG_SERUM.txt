Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Measles (Rubeola) Antibodies, IgG,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the analytical phase of
detecting and quantifying Measles (Rubeola) IgG antibodies in serum
samples. This assay aids in determining immunity status or previous
exposure to the measles virus.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
Measles IgG antibody testing within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the assay according to this SOP. The
technical supervisor ensures adherence to the protocol, oversees
quality control, and addresses any issues arising during the assay.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Red-top (no anticoagulant) tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required.
• Specimen Handling:
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge for 10-15 minutes at 1500-2000 x g to separate
serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a labeled clean tube if using a red-top tube.
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing is to be performed
within 48 hours; for longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Measles (Rubeola) IgG ELISA kit or Chemiluminescent
Immunoassay (CIA) specific for Measles IgG detection.
• Calibrators, controls (positive and negative), and standards as per
the kit instructions.
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate reader or chemiluminescent analyzer compatible with
the assay used.
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Timer
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal controls (positive and negative) with each batch of
tests to ensure the assay's accuracy and precision.
• External proficiency testing should be conducted as required by
regulatory and accreditation bodies.
• All results must be reviewed against the control values before
releasing patient results.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Equipment and Reagents: Before starting, ensure all
equipment (e.g., ELISA reader or chemiluminescent analyzer)
is calibrated and functioning properly. Thaw reagents and
controls to room temperature if they are stored cold.
2. Labeling: Appropriately label all samples, controls, and
calibrators.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Adding Samples and Reagents
◦ Dispense the required volume (as specified by the kit) of
calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples into
designated wells of the microplate or analyzer.
◦ Add the required volume of assay buffer or diluent to each
well.
◦ Follow with enzyme-conjugated antibodies specific to
Measles IgG.
2. Incubation
◦ Incubate the microplate or cuvettes as directed by the assay
manual. Typically, incubation occurs at room temperature for
a specific period, often with gentle shaking.
3. Washing
◦ After incubation, wash the wells thoroughly with the wash
buffer provided in the kit to remove unbound components.
4. Adding Substrate
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well, avoiding direct light
to prevent premature reaction. Incubate as directed.
5. Stopping the Reaction
◦ Add the stop solution (if using ELISA) after the proper
incubation period to halt the reaction.
C. Reading and Interpreting Results
1. Signal Measurement
◦ For ELISA, measure the optical density (OD) at the
recommended wavelength using a microplate reader.
◦ For CIA, read the luminescent signal using the
chemiluminescent analyzer.
2. Calculations
◦ Calculate the IgG concentration using the calibration curve
generated from the standards. Ensure all sample and
control results fall within the established curves.
3. Interpretation
◦ Interpret results based on the manufacturer's reference
ranges:
▪ Positive: indicates immunity or previous exposure.
▪ Negative: indicates no detectable immunity or exposure.
▪ Equivocal: repeat testing or additional testing required.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results according to laboratory-specific guidelines and
protocol.
• Report results to the healthcare provider through the laboratory
information system (LIS), ensuring accuracy and completeness.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the assay manual for specific troubleshooting steps if
controls fall outside the acceptable range, if there are unusual OD
readings, or if there is poor reproducibility.
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all test runs, including sample IDs, control
results, calibrator values, and any deviations from the protocol.
• Document maintenance and calibration records for all equipment
used in the assay.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s inserts and guidelines for the Measles (Rubeola)
IgG ELISA or CIA kit.
• Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
documents.
Ensure all staff members review and understand this SOP before
performing the Measles IgG antibody assay. Adherence to the above
steps ensures the integrity and accuracy of all results generated.
