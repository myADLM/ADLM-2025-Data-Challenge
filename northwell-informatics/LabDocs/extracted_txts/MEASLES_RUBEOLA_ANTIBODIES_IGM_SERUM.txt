STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: MEASLES (RUBEOLA) ANTIBODIES, IGM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the detection
of Measles (Rubeola) Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in serum
using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results aid
in the diagnosis of recent or current infection with Measles virus.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document this procedure as outlined and to ensure the quality and
accuracy of the results reported. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Volume: 1 mL serum Minimum
Volume: 0.5 mL serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST at 2000-3000 x g for 10-15 minutes to obtain
clear serum.
Specimen Storage:
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing will be done within 48
hours.
• For longer storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
Specimen Rejection Criteria:
• Hemolysis
• Lipemia
• Icterus
• Contamination with bacteria
• Insufficient specimen volume
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• ELISA washer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
Reagents and Supplies:
• Measles IgM ELISA kit (including all necessary reagents and
controls)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Biohazard disposal containers
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, serum samples, and control sera to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare the required number of microplate wells.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of each control (negative, positive), patient serum
sample, and calibrator to the assigned wells.
2. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer provided, using an
ELISA washer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate solution to each well.
5. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer provided.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the microplate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the enzyme
reaction.
10. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader within 10 minutes after adding the stop solution.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each assay run to
ensure the validity of the assay results.
2. The OD values of the controls should fall within the
manufacturer’s specified range.
3. If control values are outside the expected range, do not report
patient results. Investigate the cause, retake the assay and re-
assess before proceeding.
7. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Calculate the mean OD of the duplicate negative control wells.
This value should be below the cut-off OD determined by the
ELISA kit.
2. Calculate the mean OD of each patient's sample.
3. Compare the mean OD of patient samples to the cut-off value
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Results interpretation:
◦ Positive for IgM Antibodies: OD value greater than the
cut-off value.
◦ Negative for IgM Antibodies: OD value less than the cut-
off value.
◦ Equivocal: OD value within a specified range around the
cut-off value (manufacturer-dependent criterion). Repeat
testing may be required.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Positive and equivocal results must be communicated to the
requesting healthcare provider promptly.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Measles IgM ELISA kit.
• CLSI guidelines for serological testing.
• Laboratory quality management system protocols.
10. PROCEDURAL LIMITATIONS
1. False-positive or false-negative results can occur due to
technical errors, sample contamination, or cross-reacting
antibodies.
2. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
findings and other diagnostic tests.
