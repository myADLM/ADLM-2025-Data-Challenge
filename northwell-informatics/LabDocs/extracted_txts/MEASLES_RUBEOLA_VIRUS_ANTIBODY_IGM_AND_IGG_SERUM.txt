Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Results for Measles (Rubeola) Virus Antibody, IgM
and IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of testing for Measles (Rubeola) virus
antibodies (IgM and IgG) in serum specimens, ensuring reliable
and accurate results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the testing of serum specimens for Measles
(Rubeola) virus antibodies (IgM and IgG) using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or Chemiluminescent
Immunoassay (CIA) methods.
3. DEFINITIONS
• IgM: Immunoglobulin M, indicative of an acute or recent infection.
• IgG: Immunoglobulin G, indicative of past exposure or immunity.
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay.
• CIA: Chemiluminescent Immunoassay.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to ensure that testing is performed
accurately and results are documented correctly according to
this SOP.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: ELISA or CIA analyzer
• Reagents: Measles (Rubeola) Virus Antibody Test Kits (IgM and
IgG), controls, calibrators
• Supplies: Serum tubes, pipettes, microplates (for ELISA),
cuvettes (for CIA), and disposables appropriate to the assay
method
• PPE: Laboratory coat, gloves, and eye protection
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect blood in a red-top or serum-separator tube
(SST). Allow blood to clot at room temperature, centrifuge, and
separate serum from cells.
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 year (avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Include calibrators provided by the test kit manufacturer.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for control ranges. Any
control falling outside the acceptable range must prompt a review
of the procedure and corrective actions before reporting patient
results.
1. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation
• Ensure serum is properly separated and clarified (centrifugation).
• Inspect for hemolysis or contamination; reject unsuitable
specimens.
B) Assay Setup and Operation For ELISA:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reagent preparation.
2. Pipette prescribed volumes of standards, controls, and patient
samples into designated wells of the microplate.
3. Add conjugate reagent according to instructions.
4. Incubate for the specified time at the recommended
temperature.
5. Perform wash steps as outlined in the kit insert.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
8. Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
9. Calculate results based on standard curve and control values.
For CIA:
1. Load the prepared serum samples, controls, and calibrators
into the analyzer.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for assay specifications and
operations.
3. The analyzer will automatically process the assay, and results
will be generated via chemiluminescence detection.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive IgM: Indicates current or recent infection.
• Positive IgG: Indicates past exposure or immunity.
• Negative IgM and IgG: Indicates no evidence of infection or
immunity.
• Equivocal results: Repeat with a new sample or follow
recommended guidelines for additional testing.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all analytical data for quality and accuracy before
verification.
• Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring compliance with reference ranges and interpretive
comments.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential cross-reactivity with antibodies to other viruses.
• False negatives may occur in immunocompromised patients.
• False positives can result from non-specific binding or interfering
substances.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package inserts for Measles (Rubeola) IgM and
IgG test kits.
• CLSI guidelines for immunoassays.
• Laboratory SOPs for quality control and instrument maintenance.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL Ensure proper documentation of all
steps, quality control results, corrective actions, and test results
in accordance with the laboratory's quality management system
and regulatory requirements.
