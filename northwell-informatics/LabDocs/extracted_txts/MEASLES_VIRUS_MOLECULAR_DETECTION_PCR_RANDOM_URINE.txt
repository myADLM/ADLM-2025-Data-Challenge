STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF MEASLES VIRUS MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR –
RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection and reporting of measles
virus using PCR methodology on random urine samples. This SOP
ensures accurate and reliable test results, maintaining compliance
with CLIA regulations.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• A minimum of 10 mL random urine sample collected in a sterile
container.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine specimens collected in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation.
• Specimens that have been stored incorrectly or beyond the
acceptable time frame for testing.
• Specimens with visible contamination or insufficient volume.
Note: If the sample has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature prior to analysis.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STORAGE
• Upon receipt, accession the specimen and log details in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Store urine specimens at 2-8°C if not immediately processed.
Specimens are stable under these conditions for up to 24 hours. If
longer storage is required, store the urine at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR master mix
• Measles virus specific primers and probes
• Molecular grade water
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive control: Known measles virus RNA extract.
• Negative control: PCR-grade water or a measles virus-negative
urine sample.
• Internal control: Human RNase P gene primers and probes for
internal control of extraction and amplification process.
Quality Control Procedure:
• Include positive and negative controls and an internal control in
each PCR run.
• If the controls do not meet expected results, troubleshoot and
repeat the assay.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Vortex urine samples for approximately 5 seconds.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new sterile
microcentrifuge tube, avoiding the pellet.
B) Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to extract viral RNA.
2. Ensure appropriate use of internal controls during extraction.
C) PCR Setup:
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Add the measles virus specific primers and probes to the PCR
master mix.
3. Aliquot the prepared master mix into PCR reaction tubes.
4. Add extracted RNA template (sample), positive control, and
negative control to the designated PCR tubes.
D) Thermal Cycling Conditions:
1. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
2. Amplification: 40 cycles of:
• Denaturation: 94°C for 15 seconds
• Annealing and Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds
E) Detection and Analysis:
1. Load PCR tubes into the thermal cycler.
2. Begin the PCR run and monitor fluorescence during the
amplification process.
3. Analyze results post-PCR.
Criteria for Interpretation of Results:
• Positive Result: Amplification curve crosses the threshold with a
characteristic exponential curve in the sample and positive
control.
• Negative Result: No amplification curve or any exponential curve
in the sample and successful amplification in the positive control.
• Invalid Result: Amplification observed in the negative control or
failed amplification in the internal control; requires repeat testing.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in LIS and include the interpretation of
positive, negative, or invalid.
• Notify the requesting physician or healthcare provider of critical
results following laboratory protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Presence of measles virus RNA detected.
• Negative: Absence of measles virus RNA detected.
• Invalid: Test results inconclusive due to control failure or other
procedural issues.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the PCR assay kit insert for individual assay limitations.
• Issues such as sample integrity, inhibitors in urine, or improper
storage conditions can affect test results.

1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This SOP has been reviewed by the Laboratory Director and
approved for clinical use as of October 2023. It is subject to
review annually or as needed based on new scientific evidence or
guidelines.
