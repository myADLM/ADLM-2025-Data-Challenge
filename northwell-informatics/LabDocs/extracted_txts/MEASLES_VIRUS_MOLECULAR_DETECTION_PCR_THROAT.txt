Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measles Virus, Molecular
Detection, PCR, Throat
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
molecular detection of the Measles virus using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) techniques in throat swab specimens. The results
generated by this procedure will offer diagnostic confirmation of
suspected measles infections in patients.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the molecular analysis
phase of the Measles virus testing, ensuring uniformity and accuracy
in the detection process.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for executing this
procedure accurately, including adherence to quality control protocols
and proper documentation of the generated results. The laboratory
supervisor will ensure that all staff comply with this SOP and will
address any procedural anomalies as they arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Specimen Type Throat swab specimens collected in Viral
Transport Medium (VTM).
4.2. Specimen Handling and Storage
• Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer
storage, freeze specimens at -70°C or lower.
4.3. Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens received without appropriate labeling.
• Specimens received in leaking or compromised condition.
• Specimens not stored or transported under recommended
conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Reagents and Supplies
• Measles virus PCR Master Mix
• PCR-grade water
• Primers and probes specific for Measles Virus
• RNA extraction kit
• Positive and negative controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5.2. Equipment
• Real-Time PCR System
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes (1-1000 µL range) and sterile tips with aerosol barriers
• Biological safety cabinet
5.3. RNA Extraction
1. Thaw throat swab specimens, controls, and reagents as
needed.
2. Use an RNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's
instructions to extract RNA from the throat swab specimens.
3. Elute the RNA in the recommended volume and store it on ice
short term or at -70°C for long-term storage.
5.4. PCR Setup
1. Define the PCR reaction mix by combining the following
components per reaction:
◦ 10 µL of 2X PCR Master Mix
◦ Forward primer (10 µM), 0.5 µL
◦ Reverse primer (10 µM), 0.5 µL
◦ Probe (10 µM), 0.5 µL
◦ Nuclease-free water to adjust the final volume to 20 µL
2. Aliquot 15 µL of the PCR reaction mix into each PCR tube or
well.
3. Add 5 µL of the extracted RNA sample to each corresponding
PCR tube or well.
4. Include the positive and negative controls in separate wells.
5.5. PCR Cycling Conditions
1. Program the Real-Time PCR System using the following
thermal cycling profile:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of: a) Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds b)
Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
5.6. Detection and Interpretation
1. After the PCR run, analyze the amplification data using the
associated software of the Real-Time PCR System.
2. Determine the presence of the Measles virus by assessing the
cycle threshold (Ct) values:
◦ Positive: Ct value ≤ 38
◦ Negative: No amplification (undetermined Ct value)
◦ Inconclusive: Amplification with Ct value > 38 and evaluation
of other test indicators may be necessary. Repeat testing if
needed.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1. Internal Controls
• Positive control: Ensure the PCR components and reaction are
functioning correctly.
• Negative control: Detect any potential contamination in reagents
or equipment.
6.2. Procedure Monitoring
• Analyze the positive control to confirm target amplification.
• Check the negative control for absence of contamination or non-
specific amplification.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1. Documenting Outcomes
• Record Ct values and interpret the results accordingly.
• Enter all findings into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7.2. Result Communication
• Critical results will be communicated promptly to the ordering
physician or relevant healthcare provider following laboratory
protocols.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
8.1. For unexpected results or failed runs:
• Verify the integrity and concentration of extracted RNA.
• Confirm all reagents were prepared and stored properly.
• Review instrument performance and maintenance logs.
• Repeat preparation and steps if necessary, including extraction
and PCR setup.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive detection: Measles virus RNA detected in the throat
specimen.
• Negative detection: No Measles virus RNA detected.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for RNA extraction kit and Real-Time
PCR reagents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all details in the PCR results log, including date, time,
sample ID, Ct values, and personnel initials.
• Ensure all documentation aligns with regulatory requirements and
laboratory policies.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accuracy
and reliability of the Measles virus molecular detection process,
contributing to the effective diagnosis and management of patient
care.
