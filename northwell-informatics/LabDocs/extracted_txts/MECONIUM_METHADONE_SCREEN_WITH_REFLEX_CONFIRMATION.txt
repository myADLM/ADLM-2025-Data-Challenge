PROTOCOL: ANALYTICAL PHASE OF MECONIUM METHADONE
SCREEN WITH REFLEX CONFIRMATION
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Meconium Methadone Screen with Reflex
Confirmation. The screening aims to identify methadone exposure in
neonates, and reflex confirmation is performed when initial screening
results are positive or equivocal.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
screening and reflex confirmation following the procedures outlined in
this protocol and to ensure that all generated results are accurate
and properly documented.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA, LC-MS/MS)
◦ Methadone screening reagents and controls
◦ Methanol (for sample preparation)
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Calibration standards
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Incubator (if required for the assay)
◦ Appropriate labware (tubes, vials, microplates)
◦ Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result entry and
reporting
2. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Screening:
1. Preparation:
1. Confirm that the specimen received is meconium and
meets acceptable criteria. Reject specimens if they are
not labeled correctly, have insufficient volume, or exhibit
signs of contamination.
2. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Ensure it is calibrated and in
good working order.
2. Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenize the meconium sample thoroughly.
2. Weigh out an appropriate aliquot of the meconium
(usually 0.5-1.0 g).
3. Add methanol to the aliquot in a 1:5 ratio (e.g., 1 mL
methanol for 0.2 g meconium) and vortex to mix well.
4. Centrifuge the mixture at approximately 2000 x g for 10
minutes.
5. Collect the supernatant and transfer it to a clean vial for
analysis.
3. Screening Immunoassay:
1. Prepare the immunoassay reagents, controls, and
calibration standards according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the prepared samples, controls, and standards onto
the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Run the screening assay according to the predefined
protocol.
4. Screening Results Interpretation:
1. Negative Result: If the methadone concentration in the
sample is below the cutoff limit, report as negative.
2. Positive Result: If the methadone concentration is at or
above the cutoff limit, proceed with reflex confirmation.
3. Equivocal Result: If the result is unclear, repeat the
screening or proceed with reflex confirmation.
B. Reflex Confirmation:
1. Preparation:
1. Confirm that the equipment for confirmation (such as LC-
MS/MS) is calibrated and in good working order.
2. Ensure all reagents and supplies for confirmation are
available and prepared as needed.
2. Sample Preparation for Confirmation:
1. Use the same stored supernatant that was prepared for
the initial screening.
2. If a new extract is required, repeat the sample preparation
steps as specified in the initial screening procedure.
3. Confirmatory Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples, controls, and calibration
standards onto the LC-MS/MS or alternative confirmatory
analyzer.
2. Run the confirmatory assay according to the predefined
protocol.
4. Confirmation Results Interpretation:
1. Compare the results against established cutoff values.
2. Verified Positive Result: Confirm the presence of
methadone if the concentration is above the confirmatory
cutoff value.
3. Negative Result: If methadone is not detected or is
below the cutoff, report as negative.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
6. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to ensure assay integrity.
7. Perform routine calibration of the analyzers as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
8. Document all control and calibration results in the Quality
Control log.
9. Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
specimen analysis and result reporting.
10. RESULT REPORTING
11. Enter screening and confirmatory results into the LIS
accurately.
12. Interpret the results in accordance with laboratory guidelines
and indicate if reflex confirmation was performed.
13. For critical or unexpected positive results, follow laboratory
protocol for result notification to the healthcare provider.
14. REFERENCE INTERVALS & LIMITATIONS
• Positive Cutoff for Screening: (specify value, e.g., 30 ng/g)
• Positive Cutoff for Confirmation: (specify value, e.g., 20 ng/g)
• Reference Interval: Negative (Methadone not detected or below
cutoff)
Method Limitations: Refer to the specific immunoassay and
confirmatory test kit inserts for detailed limitations.
