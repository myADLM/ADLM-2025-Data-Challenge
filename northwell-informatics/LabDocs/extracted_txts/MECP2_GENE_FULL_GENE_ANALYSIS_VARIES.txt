STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) MECP2 Gene Full
Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the MECP2 gene, including full gene analysis
for genetic testing and diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
carrying out the procedures according to this protocol. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the MECP2
gene analysis procedure which may affect test results and bring them
to the attention of a supervisor.
Defining the MECP2 Gene: The MECP2 gene (Methyl-CpG binding
protein 2) is an essential gene associated with Rett Syndrome and
other neurodevelopmental disorders.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• Blood: 3-5 mL collected in an EDTA tube.
• Buccal cells: collected using a buccal swab.
• Extracted DNA: minimum concentration of 20 ng/µL, total volume
at least 50 µL.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens received in incorrect collection tubes (e.g., heparin
tubes).
• Specimens with insufficient volume or concentration of DNA.
• Specimens contaminated or hemolysis beyond acceptable levels.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) thermocycler.
• Electrophoresis apparatus.
• DNA extraction kit.
• Primer sets for MECP2 gene.
• Agarose gel.
• Gel documentation system.
• Sequencing machine.
4. PROCEDURE A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from the sample using the specified DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify DNA using spectrophotometer or fluorometer to
ensure the concentration meets the requirement (minimum 20
ng/µL).
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for analysis.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Design and order primers that cover the entire coding region of
MECP2 gene.
2. Prepare PCR reaction mixture:
◦ DNA template: 100 ng.
◦ Primers: 0.5 µM each.
◦ dNTPs: 0.2 mM.
◦ Taq DNA polymerase: 1 unit.
◦ Buffer: supplied with polymerase.
◦ Water: to final volume of 25 µL.
3. Amplify the DNA using the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Annealing: temperature specific to primers (~55°C) for
30 seconds.
▪ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
2. Load PCR products alongside a DNA ladder.
3. Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 60 minutes.
4. Visualize DNA fragments under UV light using the gel
documentation system.
D) DNA Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a DNA purification kit.
2. Set up sequencing reaction with purified PCR products and
specific sequencing primers.
3. Sequence the DNA using the sequencing machine according to
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Collect raw sequencing data and assemble the sequence using
bioinformatics tools.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Align the assembled sequence against the reference MECP2
gene sequence.
2. Identify mutations, deletions, duplications, and other variations
within the gene.
3. Interpret the genetic variations using databases and literature.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the genetic findings and interpretation.
2. Generate a detailed report including identified variations with
clinical significance.
3. Ensure the report is reviewed and verified by the designated
personnel.
Quality Control:
• Perform positive and negative controls for each PCR run.
• Ensure proper calibration and validation of sequencing machine.
• Periodically review and update primers and reagents used in the
analysis.
Reference Material:
• MECP2 reference sequence (e.g., RefSeq NM_004992.3)
• Validation data for primers and sequencing method.
• Standard genetic databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD)
Method Limitations: Refer to the specific conditions tested by the
MECP2 gene according to manufacturer and reagent guidelines.
References: Refer to the manufacturer instructions for PCR and
sequencing instruments and relevant genetic databases for
interpretation.
