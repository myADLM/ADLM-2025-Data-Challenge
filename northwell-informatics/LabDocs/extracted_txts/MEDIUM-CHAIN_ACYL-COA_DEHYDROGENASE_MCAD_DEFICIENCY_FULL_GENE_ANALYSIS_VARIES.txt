Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA
Dehydrogenase (MCAD) Deficiency Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the detailed analytical procedures for generating
and reporting results for the full gene analysis of Medium-Chain Acyl-
CoA Dehydrogenase (MCAD) Deficiency. Accurate results are critical
for the diagnosis and management of MCAD deficiency, an inherited
metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down
medium-chain fatty acids.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the molecular genetics laboratory
performing full gene analysis for MCAD deficiency.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel including molecular genetic
technologists and laboratory supervisory staff are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
1. DEFINITIONS
MCAD Deficiency: An autosomal recessive metabolic disorder
caused by mutations in the ACADM gene, leading to a deficiency of
the enzyme MCAD, which is essential in the fatty acid oxidation
pathway.

1. PROCEDURE
7.1 DNA Extraction
1. Purpose: Isolate genomic DNA from the blood or buccal swab
sample.
2. Procedure:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the DNA extraction
kit.
2. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until analysis.
7.2 PCR Amplification
1. Purpose: Amplify targeted exons and flanking intronic regions
of the ACADM gene.
2. Procedure:
1. Design specific primers for all exons and flanking regions
of ACADM.
2. Prepare PCR reaction mixture including primers, dNTPs,
Taq polymerase, buffer, and DNA template.
3. Thermal cycling conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-65°C for 30 seconds (depending on
primer melting temperature)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Verify PCR product size and yield via agarose gel
electrophoresis.
7.3 NGS or Sanger Sequencing
1. Purpose: Determine the nucleotide sequence of the amplified
ACADM gene regions.
2. Procedure for NGS:
1. Pool amplified products and prepare sequencing library.
2. Perform sequencing run on NGS platform following
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Analyze sequence data using bioinformatics tools to
identify mutations.
3. Procedure for Sanger Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a gel extraction kit.
2. Set up sequencing reactions with BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit.
3. Perform sequencing on a capillary electrophoresis
instrument.
4. Analyze sequence data using software to identify
mutations.
7.4 Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Purpose: Identify and interpret variants in the ACADM gene.
2. Procedure:
1. Align sequence reads to the reference genome using
bioinformatics software.
2. Identify and annotate variants.
3. Confirm pathogenic variants based on mutation
databases and literature.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control samples in each run.
• Validate new reagents and primers with known positive samples.
• Document all quality control measures and take corrective actions
as necessary.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Review sequence data and confirm variant pathogenicity.
• Generate a comprehensive report including:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Variant details
◦ Pathogenicity interpretation
◦ Literature references supporting the interpretation
• Ensure lab director reviews and signs off on the report before
releasing to the clinician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable for genetic analysis. Report findings based on the
presence or absence of mutations and their pathogenic significance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
