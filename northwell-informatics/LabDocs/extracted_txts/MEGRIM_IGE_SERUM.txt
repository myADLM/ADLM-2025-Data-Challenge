Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MEGRIM, IGE, SERUM
in Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for performing
and documenting MEGRIM (Methylgranulocyte Immunoglobulin), IgE
(Immunoglobulin E), and Serum analysis in the laboratory. This SOP
ensures accurate, consistent, and reliable results while maintaining
compliance with CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for conducting MEGRIM, IgE, and
Serum analyses as defined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of
all staff to identify any issues affecting laboratory test results and
bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
Staff and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that analyses are
performed and documented according to the procedures, including
any corrective actions that may be required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A) MEGRIM: Preferred: Whole blood collected in an EDTA tube.
Unacceptable: Specimens collected in tubes containing heparin or
citrate, specimens clotted or hemolyzed.
B) IgE: Preferred: Serum obtained from blood collected in a red-top
or SST (serum separator tube). Unacceptable: Specimens collected
in an incorrect tube or grossly hemolyzed specimens.
C) Serum: Preferred: Blood collected in a red-top or SST tube.
Unacceptable: Specimens grossly hemolyzed or lipemic specimens,
clotted specimens for SST.
Specimens should arrive to the laboratory within 2 hours of collection
for optimal results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerators/freezers with internal/external thermometers
• Automated analyzer specific to MEGRIM, IgE, and Serum tests
• Assay-specific reagent kits (MEGRIM, IgE, Serum)
• Control material: 2 Levels for each assay – Negative and Positive
• Standard laboratory consumables: gloves, tubes, labels
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Negative and Positive QC materials specific to MEGRIM, IgE, and
Serum provided in assay kits.
Storage: Control materials are to be stored at 2-8°C. Stable
unopened until the expiry date.
Procedure:
• Perform QC with each new lot of reagents according to
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document all QC checks and results in the QC log.
• If QC fails, perform troubleshooting as per manufacturer’s
guidelines and notify the supervisor.
1. PROCEDURE
A) MEGRIM Analysis:
1. Obtain whole blood specimen in EDTA tube.
2. Centrifuge specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer supernatant to a properly labeled tube.
4. Analyze using automated analyzer, following the manufacturer's
instructions.
5. Document results in LIS and maintain records.
B) IgE Analysis:
1. Obtain serum specimen from red-top or SST tube.
2. Centrifuge SST tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer serum to clean, labeled tube avoiding any layer
mixing.
4. Perform assay using automated analyzer or ELISA method.
5. Document results in LIS and maintain records.
C) Serum Analysis:
1. Obtain serum specimen from red-top or SST tube.
2. Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer the serum to a clean, properly labeled tube.
4. Perform analysis using automated analyzer relevant to
requested serum tests.
5. Document results in LIS and maintain records.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist prior to releasing. Every
effort must be applied to ensure accuracy. Any discrepancies must be
resolved and documented.
Critical Results: Critical results must be communicated to the clinician
immediately as per lab policy.
Document reporting and action taken for critical results in LIS.

This SOP will be reviewed annually to ensure compliance and to
incorporate any updates from the assay manufacturers. All staff must
be trained and competency assessed in these procedures before
performing them independently.
