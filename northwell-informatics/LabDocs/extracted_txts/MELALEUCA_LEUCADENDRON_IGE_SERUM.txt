1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
testing for Melaleuca leucadendron IgE in serum samples. The aim is
to ensure accurate and reliable results for the detection and
quantification of IgE specific to Melaleuca leucadendron, which is
essential for diagnosing potential allergic reactions.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
testing procedures and documenting results as defined in this
protocol. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies
in the testing procedure which may affect laboratory test results and
bring them to the attention of a supervisor. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that testing procedures are performed and
documented according to this protocol, including any corrective
actions that may be required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red or gold-top (SST)
vacutainer tube.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed or lipemic samples,
specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Melaleuca leucadendron-specific IgE test kit (e.g., ImmunoCAP or
equivalent).
• Analyzer compatible with the IgE test kit (e.g., Phadia 250, 5000,
or equivalent).
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (calibrated for the required volumes)
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling:
1. Upon arrival in the laboratory, verify that the specimen is
properly labeled with patient identification and collection date/
time.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum from the clot, ensuring that no hemolysis or
lipemia is present.
3. Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum samples at
-20°C.
B) Calibration and Preparation of Analyzer:
1. Perform daily calibration and maintenance checks on the
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure that the IgE test kit and reagents are not expired and
are stored at the recommended temperatures.
3. Load the IgE test kit and reagents into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
C) Testing Procedure:
1. Invert serum samples gently to mix.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum (as specified by the test
kit) into the designated wells or tubes.
3. Follow the specific steps provided in the IgE test kit instructions
for adding reagents and incubation times.
4. After completing the incubation steps, allow the analyzer to
process the samples and generate results.
D) Quality Control:
1. Perform internal quality control checks using controls provided
in the IgE test kit or laboratory-prepared controls.
2. Run positive and negative controls in parallel with patient
samples to validate the assay.
3. Document all QC results in the QC log and ensure controls fall
within established ranges before reporting patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Review and verify generated results according to the
laboratory’s standard guidelines.
6. Ensure that any results showing potential interference or error
messages are investigated and retested if necessary.
7. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure proper documentation and verification by the
technologist.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• The reference interval for Melaleuca leucadendron-specific IgE is
determined based on the assay manufacturer's guidelines or
laboratory-specific validated ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the Melaleuca leucadendron-specific IgE test kit insert for
individual test limitations. Ensure that results are interpreted in
conjunction with clinical findings and other laboratory tests.
