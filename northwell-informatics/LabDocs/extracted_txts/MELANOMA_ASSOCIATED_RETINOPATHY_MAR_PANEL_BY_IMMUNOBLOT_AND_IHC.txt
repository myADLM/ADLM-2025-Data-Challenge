Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
MELANOMA ASSOCIATED RETINOPATHY MAR PANEL BY
IMMUNOBLOT AND IHC
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to guide laboratory
personnel in the analysis and generation of results for the
Melanoma Associated Retinopathy (MAR) Panel using
immunoblot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in
processing, analyzing, and reporting MAR Panel results by
immunoblotting and IHC.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
procedures as outlined and ensuring proper quality control.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying results and addressing
any discrepancies or issues that arise during analysis.
1. SPECIMEN Acceptable Specimen: Serum, plasma, or tissue
sections from patients with suspected melanoma-associated
retinopathy. Samples must be properly labeled and transported
to the laboratory under recommended conditions.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoblot Transfer Apparatus
• Blocking Buffer
• Primary and Secondary Antibodies specific for MAR Panel
• Molecular Weight Markers
• Chemiluminescence Detection System
• Immunohistochemistry Staining Kit
• Microscope
• Eppendorf Tubes
• Glass Slides
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Enzyme-Linked Secondary Antibody for IHC
• DAB Substrate
• Light Microscope with camera
• Computer with imaging software
1. PROCEDURE
A) IMMUNOBLOT:
1. Protein Separation:
◦ Load molecular weight markers and patient samples onto
SDS-PAGE gel.
◦ Run electrophoresis until protein separation is complete.
2. Transfer to Membrane:
◦ Transfer separated proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane
using immunoblot transfer apparatus.
3. Blocking:
◦ Block the membrane with blocking buffer for 1 hour at room
temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate membrane with primary antibodies specific to MAR
panel proteins overnight at 4°C.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Wash the membrane with PBS and incubate with enzyme-
linked secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
6. Detection:
◦ Apply chemiluminescence detection system and expose the
membrane to X-ray film or imaging system to visualize
bands.
7. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare patient protein bands against controls to identify
presence and intensity of MAR panel markers.
B) IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC):
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Cut tissue sections and place on glass slides.
◦ Fix sections with paraformaldehyde and permeabilize with
Triton-X100.
2. Blocking:
◦ Block tissue sections with blocking buffer for 1 hour at room
temperature.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate sections with primary antibodies specific to MAR
panel proteins overnight at 4°C.
4. Wash and Secondary Antibody:
◦ Wash sections with PBS and incubate with enzyme-linked
secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Detection:
◦ Apply DAB substrate and observe under a light microscope.
◦ Capture images using microscope camera and imaging
software.
6. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare staining patterns and intensities against controls
to determine presence of MAR markers.
7. Documentation:
◦ Record all observations and control results in the lab
records and patient’s file.
◦ Ensure proper documentation for each step to ensure
traceability and validation of results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform parallel antibody staining with known positive and
negative controls.
• Confirm reagent functionality with blinded duplicate samples.
• Record and address any deviations observed with control
samples before reporting patient results.
• Ensure equipment calibration and maintenance are up to date.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and validate results with the laboratory supervisor.
• Utilize site-specific reporting guidelines to document findings.
• Report any critical findings immediately to the physician.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturer's protocol and reagent inserts for
immunoblot and IHC for limitations related to sensitivity and
specificity.
• Ensure appropriate handling and storage conditions for antibodies
and reagent kits.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product inserts for antibodies and reagents used
in immunoblot and IHC.
• Relevant published literature on melanoma-associated
retinopathy and MAR panel biomarkers.
