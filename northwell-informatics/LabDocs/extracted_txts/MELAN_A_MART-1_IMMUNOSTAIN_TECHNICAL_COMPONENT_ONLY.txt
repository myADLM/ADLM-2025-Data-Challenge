Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
MELAN A (MART-1) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for MELAN A (MART-1) immunostaining,
which includes the preparation, staining, and analysis of the
specimen using the MELAN A (MART-1) immunostain. This
document is intended for use by qualified laboratory personnel.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel, including medical laboratory
scientists and histotechnologists, are responsible for performing the
staining procedure and documenting the results according to this
SOP.
It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure that this
procedure is followed and that any issues or discrepancies are
addressed promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Tissue sections should be cut at 4-5 microns and mounted on
positively charged slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Improperly fixed tissue samples.
• Damaged or broken sections.
• Slides with insufficient or excessive tissue.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Hot plate or oven
• Immunostaining platform (e.g., Dako Autostainer, Ventana
Benchmark)
• MELAN A (MART-1) primary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., HRP polymer detection system)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Positive control slides
• Negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Cut FFPE tissue sections at 4-5 microns using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and mount onto
positively charged slides.
3. Allow slides to dry at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed
by incubation on a hot plate or oven at 60°C for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides using xylene for 3 changes of 5 minutes
each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of ethanol baths:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 changes of 3 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol, 2 changes of 3 minutes each
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using a suitable buffer
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker or microwave.
2. Allow slides to cool in buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Load slides onto the immunostaining platform.
2. Apply MELAN A (MART-1) primary antibody and incubate for
the recommended time (e.g., 30-60 minutes) at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4. Apply the detection system (e.g., HRP polymer detection
system) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Rinse slides in PBS.
6. Apply the chromogen (e.g., DAB) and incubate until desired
staining intensity is achieved (e.g., 5-10 minutes).
7. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol baths (95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene.
F. Mounting and Coverslipping
1. Apply mounting medium to the slides.
2. Cover with coverslips.
3. Allow slides to dry before analysis.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run
to ensure staining accuracy and specificity.
• Verify the staining quality by examining control slides and
documenting the results.
• Any discrepancies or deviations from expected results must be
reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Examine stained slides under a microscope to assess staining
intensity and distribution.
• Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) or
appropriate logbook.
• Provide technical information only; interpretation for clinical use is
the responsibility of the pathologist.
1. REFERENCE RANGES
Not applicable for the technical component of immunostaining
procedures.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The staining quality may be affected by tissue fixation,
processing, and sectioning quality.
• Overstaining or understaining can lead to false-positive or false-
negative results.
• Proper controls must be included to ensure the validity of the
staining procedure.

1. REVISIONS AND DOCUMENT CONTROL
• This SOP is subject to annual review and updating to ensure
compliance with current standards and practices.
• Document control procedures will be in place to manage revisions
and distribute updates to relevant personnel.
