Protocol for Analytical Phase: Melatonin, Plasma
1. Purpose This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for
quantifying melatonin levels in plasma samples. The aim is to
ensure accurate and reliable results for clinical and diagnostic
purposes.
2. Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen:
◦ Plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
◦ Minimum volume: 2 mL
◦ Samples should be transported to the laboratory within 2
hours of collection.
◦ If transport is delayed, samples should be stored at 4°C and
must not exceed 24 hours in this storage condition.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Samples collected in insufficient volume.
◦ Specimens received after 24 hours of collection when stored
at 4°C.
◦ Specimens subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge (for storage needs)
◦ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
◦ Melatonin assay kit (FDA approved)
◦ EDTA/heparinized blood collection tubes
◦ Calibrators and controls specified by the assay kit
◦ Pipettes and related disposables
4. Principle High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is
used to quantify plasma melatonin levels. The assay kit
provides standardized reagents and an established
methodology for extraction and quantification.
5. Sample Preparation
◦ Centrifuge the plasma sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at
4°C.
◦ Transfer the supernatant into a clean, labelled container.
◦ Store the supernatant at 4°C if not analyzing immediately.
6. Procedure: Sample Analysis
◦ Ensure all reagents and equipment are ready.
◦ Prepare calibration standards and quality controls following
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Add appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into designated HPLC vials.
◦ Follow the melatonin assay kit instructions for sample
preparation and extraction.
◦ Load the prepared vials onto the HPLC system.
◦ Run the HPLC analysis following the parameters set by the
assay kit.
7. Quality Control
◦ Perform internal quality control using the provided standards
and control materials with each batch of samples.
◦ Record all QC results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ If QC fails:
▪ Investigate possible reasons (e.g., reagent preparation,
machine calibration).
▪ Repeat QC analysis.
▪ Document corrective actions in the LIS.
8. Results Interpretation
◦ Ensure the integration of chromatograms is accurate.
◦ Review each chromatogram and compare against
calibration curves.
◦ Ensure auto-generated results from the HPLC software are
verified before acceptance.
◦ Report results in ng/mL or pmol/L as specified in the kit
instructions.
9. Reporting Results
◦ Document the final results according to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
◦ Include necessary comments if sample integrity or assay
issues are encountered.
◦ Ensure critical values are flagged and communicated as per
laboratory policy.
10. Reference Intervals
Reference intervals are defined by the assay kit:
• Adults: 10-60 pg/mL during daytime, 50-200 pg/mL during
nighttime
1. Method Limitations
• Ensure sample integrity to avoid compromised results.
• Refer to the assay kit for all potential limitations, including
interference from specific drugs or conditions.

• HPLC system operation manual.
1. Document Revisions
• Routine updates will be made in accordance with new scientific
findings, manufacturer updates, or changes in laboratory
protocols.
This protocol ensures the consistent and accurate measurement of
melatonin levels in plasma, adhering to stringent quality control and
reporting guidelines necessary for CLIA-certified laboratory practices.
