Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Melons (Ml),
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), Serum
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Melons (Ml), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and
Serum tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures the accuracy,
precision, and reliability of test results obtained.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory staff performing the analytical procedures are responsible
for following this SOP to ensure that results are accurate, precise,
and reliable.
3. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instruction manuals for analytical instruments and
assay kits
• Quality control guidelines and regulatory standards from CLIA
(Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)
• Laboratory-specific procedures for equipment maintenance and
troubleshooting
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Melons (Ml): A hypothetical biomarker for analytical purposes
• Immunoglobulin E (IgE): Immunoglobulin E, responsible for
allergic reactions
• Serum: The liquid part of blood after coagulation, devoid of cells
and clotting factors
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
• Melons (Ml), IgE, and Serum:
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum (obtain approximately 10 mL of
blood in an SST tube)
◦ Handling and Storage: Separate serum by centrifugation at
3000 rpm for 15 minutes, transfer to labeled aliquot tubes, and
store at 2-8°C if analysis is within 72 hours, or freeze at -20°C
for longer-term storage.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen Conditions: Hemolyzed, icteric, or
lipemic samples; improperly labeled specimens; or specimens
that have exceeded recommended storage time/temperature
conditions.
6. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Analytical instruments: Specific to Melons (Ml), IgE, and general
serum analysis
• Reagent kits specific to each test (follow manufacturer’s
instructions for storage and preparation)
• Quality control materials
• Laboratory-grade water
7. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE:
A. Melons (Ml) Analysis:
1. Pre-Analytical Checks:
◦ Confirm specimen identity and match with the test
requisition.
◦ Ensure specimen integrity using visual inspection and pre-
analytical validation checks (hemolysis, lipemia, icterus).
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare necessary reagents as per the manufacturer's
instructions. Use freshly prepared reagents where
necessary.
3. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Ensure the analytical instrument for Melons (Ml) is
calibrated per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run the calibration verification to ensure the calibration
curve is correctly set.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette the designated volume of serum into the appropriate
well/container.
◦ Add reagents as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Start the analysis sequence on the instrument.
◦ Document reagent lot numbers and expiry dates, calibration
checks, and initial readings.
5. Post-Analytical Checks:
◦ Verify the results against control samples.
◦ Record in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Perform result validation checks on automatically generated
reports to ensure no flagging issues.
B. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Analysis:
1. Pre-Analytical Checks:
◦ Confirm and document specimen identity.
◦ Inspect and validate specimen as per standard protocols.
2. Reagent and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and quality control samples as per kit
instructions.
3. Instrument Setup and Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analytical instrument based on the provided
guidelines.
◦ Conduct calibration verification checks.
4. Sample Processing:
◦ Pipette the precise required volume of serum into the assay
platform.
◦ Follow the stepwise addition of reagents (e.g., incubation,
washing, substrate addition) as detailed in the protocol.
5. Analysis and Report:
◦ Run the instrument as per protocol.
◦ Validate results against control data.
◦ Integrate and verify data in the LIS.
C. General Serum Analysis:
1. Validation Checks:
◦ Verify serum sample identity and processing accuracy.
◦ Conduct visual inspection and validate integrity.
2. Instrument and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Perform routine calibration of the serum analyzer.
◦ Prepare reagents as per manufacturer's instructions.
3. Sample Processing and Analysis:
◦ Handle and process serum as guided for specific tests.
◦ Run the assay according to laboratory protocols.
◦ Validate data from analytical outcomes.
4. Post-Analytical Validation:
◦ Compare results against control ranges.
◦ Enter and verify results in LIS.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Use quality control samples at multiple levels (e.g., high, normal,
and low) for routine assays.
• Perform internal QC daily or as recommended.
• Run external QC samples periodically and participate in
proficiency testing programs.
• Address QC failures immediately; reanalyze samples or
troubleshoot instruments where needed.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Validate results in LIS by the responsible technologist.
• Release results once all validation checks pass, following site-
specific guidelines.
• Document any issues or deviations encountered during analysis.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to reagent and instrument inserts for specific test limitations.
Avoid using results from compromised samples.
11. DOCUMENTATION:
Maintain comprehensive records of:
• Calibration and QC checks
• Sample analysis data
• Reagent logbooks
• Maintenance logs for all instruments used
