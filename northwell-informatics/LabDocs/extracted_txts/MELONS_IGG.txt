Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) MELONS IgG Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for performing
quantitative analysis of MELONS IgG antibodies in patient serum
samples. This analysis is intended for diagnosing and monitoring
diseases related to MELONS antibody levels.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in immunoassay techniques are
responsible for performing the MELONS IgG analysis. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the process, troubleshooting issues,
and ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly.
3. SPECIMEN
3.1. Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
3.2. Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the serum separator tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
to separate serum from cells.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 48
hours. For long-term storage, keep serum aliquots at -20°C or
-80°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Microplate washer
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator set to 37°C
4.2 Reagents:
• MELONS IgG ELISA kit
• Distilled water
• Calibrators and controls (Provided with the ELISA kit)
• Wash buffer (Provided with the ELISA kit)
• Substrate Solution (Provided with the ELISA kit)
• Stop Solution (Provided with the ELISA kit)
4.3 Supplies:
• Polystyrene microplates (included in the ELISA kit)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Paper towels or absorbent pads
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
beginning the assay (approximately 30 minutes).
2. Prepare the wash buffer as per the kit instructions.
3. Label and arrange all required microplate wells based on the
layout plan which includes controls, calibrators, and patient
samples.
5.2 Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to the
assigned wells of the microplate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Aspirate the contents from the wells and wash the plate 3 times
with 300 µL of wash buffer per well. Remove any remaining
liquid by inverting and tapping the plate on a paper towel.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. Incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Repeat the washing step as described in 3.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
7. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
8. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
5.3 Data Analysis:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the known
concentrations of the standards against their corresponding
absorbance values.
3. Use the standard curve to determine the MELONS IgG
concentration in the patient samples from their absorbance
values.
4. Verify the results by ensuring the controls are within the
expected range before validating patient results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal Quality Controls:
• Include both positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Ensure controls fall within predetermined ranges. If controls are
out of range, troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
6.2 Calibration Verification:
• Perform calibration verification using standards provided in the
ELISA kit.
• Ensure the linearity and accuracy of the standard curve.
6.3 External Quality Assessment:
• Participate in an external quality assessment (EQA) program to
ensure the reliability and accuracy of MELONS IgG testing.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Reference Intervals:
• Negative: < 10 IU/mL
• Indeterminate: 10 - 20 IU/mL
• Positive: > 20 IU/mL
7.2 Documentation:
• Record results in the LIS. Ensure that all patient results are
reviewed and validated by the technologist before releasing.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the accuracy of
the results.
• Ensure proper handling and storage of specimens to avoid
degradation of the MELONS IgG.
