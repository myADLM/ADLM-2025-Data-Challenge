Analytical Protocol for Membranous Nephropathy
Target Antigen Identification Using Mass Spectrometry
on Tissue Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of the identification of target antigens in membranous
nephropathy using mass spectrometry in tissue samples. This will
ensure the precise, reproducible, and accurate identification of
relevant antigens in clinical samples.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory scientists will perform the mass spectrometry
analysis.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that all staff are
trained and competent in performing the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Specimen Type:
• Fresh frozen kidney biopsy tissue (optimal)
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) kidney tissue
Specimen Storage:
• Fresh frozen tissue: Store at -80°C until processing.
• FFPE tissue blocks: Store at room temperature in a dry
environment.
Specimen Rejection:
• Specimens with insufficient material.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or lack accompanying
requisition paperwork.
• Specimens that have been stored outside of recommended
conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Microcentrifuge
• Tissue homogenizer
• Ultrasonic bath or probe sonicator
• Centrifuge
• Water bath/incubator (37°C)
• Pipettes and tips
• Fume hood
Reagents:
• Lysis buffer: 8M Urea in 100mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5
• Reduction agent: Dithiothreitol (DTT)
• Alkylation agent: Iodoacetamide (IAA)
• Trypsin or LysC enzyme
• Acetonitrile (LC-MS grade)
• Formic acid (LC-MS grade)
• Water (LC-MS grade)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Tissue Sample:
1. Tissue Dissection and Homogenization:
◦ Thaw fresh frozen tissue on ice or prepare FFPE sections
(10-20 µm).
◦ Homogenize approximately 10-50 mg of tissue in lysis buffer
using a tissue homogenizer.
◦ Sonicate tissue lysate in an ultrasonic bath or using a probe
sonicator to ensure complete cell lysis.
2. Protein Extraction and Digestion:
◦ Centrifuge the lysate at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and determine
protein concentration using a BCA or Bradford assay.
◦ Reduce proteins by adding DTT to a final concentration of 5
mM and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Alkylate proteins by adding IAA to a final concentration of 15
mM, incubate at room temperature in the dark for 30
minutes.
◦ Dilute urea concentration to 1M using 100mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.5.
◦ Digest proteins overnight with trypsin or LysC at a 1:50
enzyme-to-protein ratio at 37°C.
3. Peptide Cleanup:
◦ Acidify the digest by adding formic acid to a final
concentration of 1%.
◦ Desalt peptides using C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE)
cartridges or tips according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Elute peptides with 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic
acid.
◦ Dry the eluted peptides using a vacuum concentrator.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis:
• Reconstitute dried peptides in 0.1% formic acid.
• Load peptides onto the LC-MS/MS system.
• Perform data acquisition in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) or
targeted mode.
Data Analysis:
1. Database Search:
◦ Perform a database search using appropriate software (e.g.,
Mascot, Sequest, MaxQuant) against a human protein
database.
◦ Set parameters for precursor mass tolerance (typically 10
ppm) and fragment mass tolerance (typically 0.5 Da).
2. Identification Criteria:
◦ Peptides must have at least two unique fragment ions for
confirmation.
◦ Proteins identified must have at least one unique peptide
with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1%.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a detailed report including identified antigens,
peptide sequences, and confidence scores.
◦ Submit results to the requesting healthcare provider or
research team.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Use standardized control tissue or reference samples with known
antigen profiles.
• Perform routine calibration and maintenance of the mass
spectrometer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Include process blanks and duplicate samples to monitor for
contamination and reproducibility.
Documentation:
• All steps from tissue preparation to data analysis must be
documented in the laboratory information management system
(LIMS).
• Any deviations from the procedure and corrective actions taken
must be recorded.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Verification:
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
scientist before being reported.
• Significant findings, including the presence of known antigens
associated with membranous nephropathy, should be highlighted
in the report.
Communicating Results:
• Results should be transmitted electronically to the LIS and
healthcare provider, along with a written interpretative report
outlining key findings and any limitations.
REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for identified antigens will depend on current
literature and disease-specific criteria.
METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure adherence to the mass spectrometry sensitivity and
specificity limits.
• Note that detection is dependent on the quality and quantity of the
tissue sample and proper sample preparation.
REFERENCES
• Refer to the latest literature and manuals provided by mass
spectrometry equipment and reagent manufacturers for any
updates on protocols and procedures.
