STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR MENINGITIS/
ENCEPHALITIS PATHOGEN PANEL, PCR, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Meningitis/Encephalitis Pathogen Panel,
PCR, using spinal fluid (CSF) specimens. This SOP ensures that test
results are produced consistently, accurately, and within a timely
manner for proper clinical interpretation.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to follow this
protocol to ensure accurate test results.
• The laboratory supervisor must ensure the technologists are
properly trained and competency assessed periodically.
• It is the responsibility of the technologists to report any issues
encountered during the testing process to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimen: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL CSF
• Specimens should be processed as soon as possible after
collection.
• If immediate processing is not possible, CSF specimens should
be stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze
the specimens at -70°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR instrument (manufacturer-specific, e.g., BioFire FilmArray,
Cepheid GeneXpert)
• Meningitis/Encephalitis Pathogen Panel assay kits (manufacturer-
specific)
• Positive and Negative control materials
• Nuclease-free water (for negative control)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Biosafety cabinet
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and sterile, nuclease-free pipette tips with aerosol
barriers
• Tube racks
• Laboratory timer
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Verification and Preparation:
1. Confirm that the specimen is correctly labeled with patient
identification and matches the accompanying requisition form.
2. Verify that the CSF volume is adequate for testing.
3. If using a refrigerated specimen, equilibrate the sample to room
temperature before testing.
Assay Setup:
1. Don appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and face
shield/mask.
2. Perform all steps inside a biosafety cabinet to prevent
contamination.
3. Prepare the required reagents and materials for the Meningitis/
Encephalitis Pathogen Panel assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Vortex the specimen briefly to ensure proper mixing.
5. Pipette the recommended volume of CSF into the sample
chamber of the assay cartridge or tube as directed by the
manufacturer’s protocol.
6. Add the required reagents to the assay cartridge or tube (e.g.,
lysis buffer, internal controls) as specified in the assay
instructions.
7. Securely close the assay cartridge or tube.
PCR Instrument Loading:
1. Power on the PCR instrument and allow it to initialize.
2. Load the prepared assay cartridge or tube into the PCR
instrument.
3. Enter the sample and control identification information into the
instrument’s software.
4. Start the assay run following the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. The run will proceed automatically, and follow the instrument
alerts and status.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls with each run.
2. Assess control results to validate the run.
◦ Positive Control must yield target detection.
◦ Negative Control must show no target detection.
3. If controls are not within acceptable results, troubleshoot as per
the manufacturer’s recommendations and repeat the assay.
Result Review and Reporting:
1. After the PCR run is complete, verify that the assay run
completed successfully and controls met acceptance criteria.
2. Review the results within the instrument software.
3. Record and save results as per laboratory data management
protocols.
4. Print or export results for physician review and electronic
medical record (EMR) entry where applicable.
5. Validate and verify results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive for Specific Pathogen: Indicates the presence of the
detected pathogen's genetic material and supports a diagnosis of
meningitis or encephalitis caused by that pathogen.
• Negative: Indicates that no target pathogen's genetic material was
detected in the provided sample.
• Inconclusive: Results from inadequate samples or assay failure.
Repeat the assay with a new specimen.
Notify attending physician immediately for any positive result
following the critical result notification policy.
