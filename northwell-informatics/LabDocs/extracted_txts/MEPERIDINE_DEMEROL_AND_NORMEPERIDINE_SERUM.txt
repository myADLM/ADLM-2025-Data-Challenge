Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Meperidine (Demerol) and Normeperidine, Serum Results
Generation
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedural steps for the analysis, validation, and
generation of results for Meperidine (Demerol) and Normeperidine in
serum samples. This SOP ensures accurate and timely results while
maintaining the integrity and reliability of the laboratory process.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
analysis, documenting the results, and performing any required
quality control measures.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying the process and
ensuring all procedures follow this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
Volume:
• A minimum of 2 mL of serum is required for analysis.
Stability:
• Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within
48 hours of collection.
• For storage beyond 48 hours, serum should be frozen at -20°C or
lower, ensuring to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed serum samples
• Specimens with insufficient volume
• Specimens collected in tubes other than specified
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
instrument
• Calibrators and controls specific for Meperidine (Demerol) and
Normeperidine
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Solvents and reagents as specified by the manufacturer
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum separator tube at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes
at room temperature.
2. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, labeled polypropylene
tube.
3. If analysis is not performed immediately, store the serum at
2-8°C or freeze at -20°C.
B. Instrument Preparation and Calibration:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the HPLC
or LC-MS/MS system.
2. Prepare the calibrators and controls as specified by the
manufacturer.
3. Perform instrument calibration using standard solutions of
Meperidine and Normeperidine.
4. Ensure calibration curves meet the acceptance criteria defined
in the instrument’s operating manual.
C. Analysis:
1. Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the HPLC
or LC-MS/MS system as per the instrument protocol.
2. Initiate the analytical run according to the instrument’s software.
3. Monitor the system for any error messages or deviations during
the run.
D. Data Review:
1. After the analytical run is complete, review the chromatograms
and ensure peak integrity and appropriate retention times for
Meperidine and Normeperidine.
2. Verify that all quality control results fall within acceptable
ranges.
3. Investigate and resolve any discrepancies or errors observed
during the data review.
E. Result Calculation and Reporting:
1. Quantify the concentrations of Meperidine and Normeperidine
using the calibration curve.
2. Validate the results by comparing them against quality control
measures.
3. Report the quantified results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Include comments in the LIS if any results fall outside normal or
expected ranges.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine quality control checks with each batch of samples
analyzed.
• Include internal and external controls to verify the accuracy and
precision of the analytical process.
• Maintain documentation of all quality control results and any
corrective actions taken in case of deviations.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's instrument and reagent inserts for
specific limitations associated with the analytical detection of
Meperidine and Normeperidine.
• Results may be affected by the presence of hemolysis or other
interfering substances in the serum samples.
• Serum samples must be handled with care to avoid contamination
or degradation of analytes.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instrument manual and reagent inserts for HPLC
or LC-MS/MS systems
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature on Meperidine and
Normeperidine analysis
8. DOCUMENTATION
• The results, along with quality control data, shall be meticulously
documented and stored.
• Any deviation from standard procedures and corrective actions
taken shall also be documented and reviewed.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Adhere to standard safety protocols for handling biological
samples and chemicals.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Dispose of waste materials following biohazard and chemical
waste disposal guidelines.
This SOP ensures that the process for analyzing and generating
results for Meperidine (Demerol) and Normeperidine in serum is
standardized, accurate, and reliable.
