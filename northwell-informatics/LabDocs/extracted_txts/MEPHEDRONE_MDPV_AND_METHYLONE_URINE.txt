Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Mephedrone, MDPV, and Methylone in
Urine
1. PURPOSE To describe the procedures for the analysis and
reporting of the synthetic cathinones, mephedrone, MDPV, and
methylone in urine specimens to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility: Designated staff will perform the analysis and
reporting following the established procedure. It is the responsibility
of all staff to ensure adherence to the steps outlined in this SOP and
document any deviations or issues encountered during the process.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to the analysis of urine
specimens for the presence of mephedrone, MDPV, and
methylone. The analysis will be conducted using Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) technology.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Mephedrone: A synthetic stimulant similar to cathinone.
• MDPV: Methylenedioxypyrovalerone, a synthetic stimulant.
• Methylone: A synthetic stimulant also known as bk-MDMA,
resembling MDMA in its effects.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Appropriate Specimens: Fresh urine collected in a clean, leak-
proof container.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are improperly labeled,
contaminated, or collected in unsuitable containers.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS Instrumentation
• Analytical grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Standard solutions of mephedrone, MDPV, and methylone
• Internal standard solution
• Calibration standards and quality controls
• Pipettes, centrifuge, and test tubes
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and
Quality Controls:
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples using
appropriate analyte concentrations.
3. Store standards and quality controls at -20°C until use.
4. Thaw samples at room temperature before analysis.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Record specimen details: accession number, collection time,
and date.
2. Mix urine specimens well before aliquoting.
3. Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 1 mL) of urine specimen
into a labeled test tube.
4. Add internal standard solution to each specimen.
5. Vortex mix samples for 30 seconds.
6. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for LC-MS analysis.
C. LC-MS Analysis:
1. Set up the LC-MS instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Load prepared calibration standards, quality controls, and urine
specimens into the sample tray.
3. Set the instrument parameters, including the mobile phase
composition, flow rate, and column temperature.
4. Inject calibration standards, quality control samples, and urine
specimens into the LC-MS.
5. Monitor the instrument for any errors or irregularities throughout
the run.
6. Analyze data using appropriate software and check for the
presence of mephedrone, MDPV, and methylone.
D. Interpreting and Reporting Results:
1. Ensure the calibration curve meets the acceptable criteria (e.g.,
R² > 0.995).
2. Review and interpret results from the analysis.
3. Document the concentration of mephedrone, MDPV, and
methylone in the specimens.
4. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. Verify and release test results following site-specific guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL: A. Internal Quality Control:
7. Include at least one set of quality control samples with each
analytical batch.
8. Monitor control results to ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
9. Troubleshoot any out-of-range results before releasing patient
results.
B. External Quality Control:
1. Participate in an external proficiency testing program.
2. Compare results with those from other laboratories and take
corrective actions if discrepancies are identified.
3. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION OF EQUIPMENT:
4. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the LC-MS
instrument according to the manufacturer’s schedule.
5. Record maintenance activities in the equipment logbook.
6. Ensure reference standards and reagents are within expiration
dates.
7. SAFETY:
8. Follow proper laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, lab coats, and
safety glasses.
9. Handle and dispose of biological samples and reagents
according to biosafety and chemical safety guidelines.

1. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document any changes to the procedure, including the date and
summary of changes.
By adhering to the steps outlined in this SOP, the laboratory ensures
the reliable detection and quantification of mephedrone, MDPV, and
methylone in urine specimens, providing accurate results for clinical
or forensic purposes.
