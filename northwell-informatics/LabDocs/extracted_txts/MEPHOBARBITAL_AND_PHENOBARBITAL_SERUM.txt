Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Mephobarbital and Phenobarbital in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analysis
and quantitation of Mephobarbital and Phenobarbital in serum
samples using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
with UV detection.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in
the detection and quantification of Mephobarbital and Phenobarbital
in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis according to this
SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the protocol and verify the
results.
• Laboratory Director: Periodically review and update the SOP as
necessary.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Mephobarbital: A barbiturate that is used as a sedative and an
anticonvulsant.
• Phenobarbital: A barbiturate that is used as a sedative-hypnotic
and an anticonvulsant.
• HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, an analytical
technique used to separate, identify, and quantitate components
in a mixture.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph with UV Detector
• Analytical Balance
• Micropipettes and Tips
• Centrifuge
• Serum Sample Tubes
• HPLC Grade Water
• Methanol (HPLC Grade)
• Standard Solutions of Mephobarbital and Phenobarbital
• Calibrated Volumetric Flasks
• Mobile Phase (Typically a mixture of water and methanol with a
pH adjusted if necessary)
6. REAGENTS AND STANDARDS
• Mephobarbital Standard Solution
• Phenobarbital Standard Solution
• Internal Standard (if applicable)
• Mobile Phase: Mix water and methanol in a 50:50 ratio, adjust pH
to 6.0 using phosphoric acid
• HPLC Column: C-18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 µm)
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Sample Preparation
• Allow the serum samples to thaw to room temperature if frozen.
• Pipette 1.0 mL of serum into a centrifuge tube.
• Add 50 µL of the internal standard solution (if using an internal
standard).
• Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
• Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the supernatant into a clean vial for HPLC
analysis.
• Prepare calibration curves using various concentrations of
Mephobarbital and Phenobarbital standards.
7.2 HPLC Setup
• Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Fill the mobile phase reservoirs with prepared mobile phase.
• Prime the HPLC system with the mobile phase.
• Install the C-18 HPLC column.
• Set the UV detector to 254 nm.
• Set the flow rate to 1.0 mL/min.
• Set the temperature of the column oven to 25°C.
• Inject 20 µL of each sample or standard into the HPLC system.
7.3 Chromatographic Conditions
• Mobile Phase: 50:50 Water:Methanol (pH 6.0. adjusted with
phosphoric acid)
• Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min
• Injection Volume: 20 µL
• Detection Wavelength: 254 nm
• Column Temperature: 25°C
7.4 Calibration Curve
• Prepare a series of standard solutions of Mephobarbital and
Phenobarbital at concentrations ranging from the lower limit of
quantitation to the upper limit.
• Inject each standard solution into the HPLC system in triplicate.
• Plot the peak area versus concentration to create the calibration
curve.
7.5 Sample Analysis
• Inject prepared serum samples and record the chromatograms.
• Measure the peak areas for Mephobarbital and Phenobarbital.
• Quantitate the levels of Mephobarbital and Phenobarbital in the
serum samples using the calibration curve generated.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with
each batch of samples to ensure assay reliability.
• Ensure that the coefficients of variation (CV) for quality control
samples are within acceptable limits (<15%).
• If QC samples do not meet standards, re-evaluate the procedures
and repeat the sample batch.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data must be reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
technologist.
• Concentrations are to be reported with appropriate units (e.g., ng/
mL or µg/mL).
• Document any deviations from the normal procedure and
corrective actions taken.
