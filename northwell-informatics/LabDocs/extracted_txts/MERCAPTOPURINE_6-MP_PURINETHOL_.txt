Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Mercaptopurine (6-MP, PURINETHOL)
1. Purpose
This document outlines the standard operating procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Mercaptopurine (6-MP,
PURINETHOL) in blood or plasma samples. The purpose of this
procedure is to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable test results
when determining the concentration of Mercaptopurine in patient
specimens.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
follow this SOP as defined.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure adherence to the
SOP, and to review and authorize any deviations or updates to the
procedure.
• All staff performing this procedure must be trained and deemed
competent prior to conducting the test.
1. Definitions
Mercaptopurine (6-MP): A chemotherapy medication used to treat
acute lymphocytic leukemia and other medical conditions by
interfering with the growth of rapidly dividing cells.
1. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type:
• Human blood or plasma
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood samples in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• The specimen should be mixed thoroughly but gently to avoid
hemolysis.
• Centrifuge the blood samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to separate plasma from cellular components.
• Plasma should be aliquoted into appropriately labeled tubes and
stored at -20°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Blood collected in inappropriate collection tubes (e.g., sodium
fluoride, citrate).
• Specimens received without proper labeling or documentation of
collection details.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) system.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Sonicator.
• Freezer (-20°C).
Reagents:
• HPLC/LC-MS grade methanol, acetonitrile, and water.
• Mercaptopurine standard (analytical pure grade).
• Internal standard (e.g., 6-thioguanine).
• Mobile phase reagents (appropriate gradient/specific to HPLC/LC-
MS method).
Supplies:
• Centrifuge tubes.
• Sample vials for HPLC/LC-MS.
• Syringe filters.
1. Procedure
Preparation and Calibration:
• Prepare stock solutions of Mercaptopurine standard and internal
standard in methanol at appropriate concentrations.
• Prepare calibration standards by diluting the stock solution with
human plasma to create a calibration curve (e.g., 10 ng/mL - 1000
ng/mL).
• Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the calibration curve range.
Sample Preparation:
• Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
• Vortex and centrifuge thawed samples to ensure homogeneity.
• If using protein precipitation: Add 3 parts of cold methanol to 1
part plasma, vortex for 1 minute, and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for
10 minutes. Collect the supernatant.
• Filter the supernatant through a syringe filter and transfer it into
HPLC/LC-MS vials.
Chromatographic Analysis:
• Set up the HPLC/LC-MS system per the manufacturer’s
instructions and method validation specifics.
• Load the vials into the auto-sampler.
• Set the mobile phase gradient and flow rates as per the validated
method.
• Inject calibration standards, quality control samples, and prepared
plasma samples.
Data Analysis and Quality Control:
• Analyze the chromatograms using the appropriate software to
quantify the concentration of Mercaptopurine.
• Ensure the calibration curve is linear and within the acceptable
range (typically R2 > 0.98).
• Run quality control samples intermittently to check for precision
and accuracy.
• Any sample outside the QC range should be re-evaluated.
1. Reporting Results
Data Interpretation:
• Use the calibration curve to calculate the concentration of
Mercaptopurine in patient specimens.
• Verify the results for accuracy and consistency against the
internal quality control samples.
Documentation:
• Document all procedural steps, calibrations, and quality control
measures in the laboratory information system.
• Record any deviations and corrective actions taken during the
analysis.
Reference Interval:
• Reference intervals should be determined as per clinical
guidelines and patient's therapeutic regimen.
Critical Results:
• Alert the attending physician or relevant clinical personnel
immediately upon identification of results that fall outside the
therapeutic range or are potentially life-threatening.
1. Quality Control
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform routine QC checks per the established schedule (e.g.,
daily, bi-weekly).
• Document all QC results and actions taken for out-of-control
results.
External Quality Assessment:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs annually.
