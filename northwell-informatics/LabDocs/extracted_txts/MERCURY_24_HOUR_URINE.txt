Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mercury, 24-Hour Urine
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable measurement of mercury levels
in 24-hour urine samples using atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(AAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform the
analysis of mercury in 24-hour urine samples within the analytical
phase.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to ensure that
all steps in this analytical procedure are properly followed to achieve
accurate and precise results. Any deviations from this procedure
should be reported to the appropriate supervisor and documented
accordingly.
4. DEFINITIONS
• AAS: Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry
• ICP-MS: Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
• QC: Quality Control
• LIS: Laboratory Information System
5. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
Specimens for mercury analysis must be collected over a 24-hour
period in a suitable collection container provided by the laboratory,
which may contain a preservative to stabilize the urine sample. Upon
arrival at the laboratory, specimens are accessioned and stored in
accordance with relevant SOPs.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer or ICP-MS
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (fixed and adjustable)
• Volumetric flasks (Graduated)
• Laboratory balance
Reagents:
• Analytical grade nitric acid (HNO3)
• Analytical grade hydrochloric acid (HCl)
• Mercury standard solutions
• Deionized (DI) water
Supplies:
• 24-hour urine collection containers
• Test tubes
• Pipette tips
• Gloves and lab coats
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Standards
1. Mercury Standard Solutions:
◦ Dilute concentrated stock mercury solution to prepare a
series of working standards ranging from 0.5 to 10 µg/L.
◦ Store prepared standards in tightly capped bottles at 4°C
when not in use.
2. Digestion Reagents:
◦ Prepare a 1:1 mixture of concentrated HNO3 and HCl for
sample digestion.
B) Sample Preparation
1. Mix the 24-hour urine sample thoroughly.
2. Record the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection.
3. Pipette a 10 mL aliquot of the urine sample into a digestion
tube.
4. Add 1 mL of the digestion reagent to the urine sample.
5. Digest the sample according to the selected method (heat in a
water bath at 90°C for 30 minutes or using a microwave
digestion system).
6. After digestion, allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
7. Dilute the digested sample to a final volume (e.g., 25 mL) with
DI water.
C) Mercury Analysis
Using AAS:
1. Calibrate the AAS instrument using the mercury standard
solutions.
2. Analyze the digested urine samples in duplicate.
3. Record and evaluate the absorbance readings for each sample.
4. Calculate the mercury concentration from the calibration curve.
Using ICP-MS:
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS instrument using the mercury standard
solutions.
2. Analyze the digested urine samples.
3. Record and evaluate the ion counts for each sample.
4. Calculate the mercury concentration using the generated
calibration curve.
D) Quality Control
1. Include at least one blank, one low-level QC, and one high-level
QC in each analytical run.
2. Acceptable recovery for QC samples should be within ±10% of
the expected value.
3. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot,
and reanalyze as necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transfer the mercury concentration data to the LIS.
2. Include the results in the patient’s report, specifying the mercury
concentration in µg/L.
3. If the mercury concentration exceeds the critical value (e.g.,
>20 µg/L), immediately notify the requesting healthcare
provider as per laboratory protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL AND CRITICAL VALUES
• Reference Interval: 0.0 - 10.0 µg/L
• Critical Value: ≥ 20.0 µg/L
10. LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure that samples are free of particulates before analysis.
2. The presence of certain chemical interferences may affect
accuracy; employ appropriate corrective methods as needed.
3. Ensure all materials coming in contact with mercury standards/
sample solutions are free of contamination to avoid false
results.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Handle all chemicals, especially acids and mercury, with caution.
• Dispose of waste according to safety guidelines.

13. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain records of all calibrations, QC results, instrument
maintenance, and any corrective actions taken.
