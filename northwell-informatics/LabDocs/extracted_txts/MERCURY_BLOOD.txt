Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Mercury, Blood
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the accurate measurement and reporting
of mercury levels in blood samples using appropriate analytical
methods and instrumentation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
mercury blood analysis and documenting all results according to this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all protocols are
followed, reviewing generated results, and implementing corrective
actions if needed.
1. Specimen Requirements
Collection:
• Blood specimens collected in trace element-free evacuated blood
collection tubes (dark blue top with EDTA).
• Specimens should be collected following standard venipuncture
procedures and must minimize contamination.
Volume:
• The required volume for mercury analysis is 5 mL of whole blood.
Handling:
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory immediately
after collection.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if there is any delay in
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-trace element-free tubes.
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens that have been stored improperly or exceeded
recommended storage time.
1. Equipment and Reagents
Equipment:
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) with graphite
furnace or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-
MS).
• Analytical balance.
• Trace element-free plasticware.
Reagents:
• Mercury standard solutions.
• Matrix modifiers (e.g., palladium chloride).
• Nitric acid and perchloric acid for sample digestion.
• Purified water (18 MΩ·cm or double-distilled).
1. Procedure
Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and validated against certified
reference materials.
Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenize the whole blood specimen by gentle inversion.
2. Aliquot 1 mL of whole blood into a trace element-free digestion
vessel.
3. Add 2 mL of nitric acid and 0.5 mL of perchloric acid to the
vessel.
4. Digest the sample in a controlled environment (e.g., microwave
digestion system) according to manufacturer specifications.
5. After digestion, dilute the sample to a fixed volume (e.g., 25
mL) with purified water.
Analysis:
1. Calibration: Prepare a series of mercury standards covering the
expected analytical range. Perform a blank measurement to
ensure no contamination.
2. Measurement: Analyze the prepared blood samples using AAS
or ICP-MS. Record instrument settings and measurement
times.
3. Data Recording:
◦ Ensure each measurement includes appropriate quality
control checks (blanks, calibration standards, and control
samples).
◦ Record sample and control readings, date, time, and initials
of the operator.
Troubleshooting:
• If the mercury level is outside the expected range: i. Verify system
calibration with a certified reference material. ii. Recheck sample
preparation and ensure no contamination. iii. Reanalyze the
sample if needed.
• For instrument errors or anomalies, document the issue and notify
the supervisor. Follow manufacturer's troubleshooting guidelines.
1. Quality Control
Internal Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples before, during, and after the batch
analysis.
• Control samples should show acceptable recovery rates (e.g.,
within 10% of the expected value).
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs periodically to
affirm the method's accuracy and precision.
1. Reporting Results
• Review all results and ensure they meet predefined criteria before
verification.
• Critical values must be immediately communicated to the
requesting physician and documented according to laboratory
policy.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
Reference Intervals:
• Normal Range: Typically less than 5 µg/L for mercury in blood.
1. Documentation
• Maintain all records of sample preparation, analysis, and quality
control in a secure and accessible format.
• Ensure proper documentation for all corrective actions and
instrument maintenance activities.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s instrument manual for AAS or ICP-MS.
• Standard Methods for the Examination of Blood (as applicable).
• External proficiency testing guidelines and protocols for mercury
analysis.
This SOP was reviewed and approved on [Date], and will be
reviewed annually or as needed based on updates to equipment,
reagents, or regulatory guidelines.
