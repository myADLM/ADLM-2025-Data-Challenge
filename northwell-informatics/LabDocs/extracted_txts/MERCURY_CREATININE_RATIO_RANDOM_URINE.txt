STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Generating Results for Mercury/
Creatinine Ratio, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of
results for the Mercury/Creatinine Ratio in random urine
samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of random urine
specimens received in the laboratory for the determination of
the Mercury/Creatinine Ratio.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow the
protocol specified in this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
4. DEFINITIONS
N/A
5. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
5.1. Equipment
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (for creatinine determination)
• Traceable pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Specimen cups
5.2. Reagents and Standards
• Mercury standard solution
• Creatinine standard solution
• Nitric acid
• Internal standard solution for ICP-MS
• Quality control (QC) materials for creatinine
• Calibration materials for both mercury and creatinine
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Specimen Requirements
• Use random urine samples that are collected and processed as
per the standard specimen collection and handling SOP.
6.2. Preparation and Calibration of Instrumentation 6.2.1. ICP-MS
• Turn on the ICP-MS and allow it to warm up as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform daily performance check and calibration with mercury
standard.
• Prepare calibration standards ranging from 0.1 to 50 µg/L
mercury.
• Include internal standard solution into each standard, sample, and
QC material.
6.2.2. Clinical Chemistry Analyzer for Creatinine Measurement
• Turn on the clinical chemistry analyzer and run the start-up and
calibration procedures.
• Calibrate the analyzer with the creatinine standard solution.
• Verify calibration using two levels of QC material, ensuring that
results fall within the acceptable range.
6.3. Sample Preparation
• Mark and prepare all urine samples, including QC materials and
blank controls.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500g for 10 minutes to remove any
debris.
• Transfer the supernatant to clean tubes for analysis.
6.4. Mercury Analysis by ICP-MS
• Pipette 5 mL of each sample, standard, and QC material into
separate sample tubes.
• Add 0.5 mL of nitric acid to each tube to digest and preserve the
mercury content.
• Add the internal standard solution as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Run each sample, standard, and QC material through the ICP-
MS.
• Document and verify results from the ICP-MS software.
6.5. Creatinine Analysis by Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
• Pipette 1 mL of each sample, standard, and QC material into
separate cuvettes.
• Run each sample, standard, and QC material using the clinical
chemistry analyzer.
• Document and verify results from the analyzer software.
6.6. Calculation of Mercury/Creatinine Ratio
• Calculate the ratio of mercury to creatinine for each sample.
• Formula: Mercury/Creatinine Ratio (µg/g) = (Mercury
concentration [µg/L] / Creatinine concentration [g/L])
• Perform and verify calculations through a validated worksheet or
laboratory information system (LIS).
6.7. Quality Control and Troubleshooting
• Ensure QC samples are analyzed with each batch of patient
samples.
• Verify that all QC results are within the established control ranges.
• Follow SOP for troubleshooting and corrective action if QC results
are out of range.
6.8. Reporting Results
• Review and validate all results in the LIS.
• Attach notes for any deviations observed during the analysis.
• Ensure that results are accurately entered and reported as per
laboratory protocols.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for the final release of
results.
• Ensure all critical results are communicated to the requesting
clinician as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Mercury: <10 µg/L (considered non-exposed)
• Creatinine: 0.6 – 1.2 g/L for adults
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are properly preserved and handled to avoid
contamination or degradation.
• Be aware of interferences or matrix effects that may influence
mercury measurement or creatinine determination.
