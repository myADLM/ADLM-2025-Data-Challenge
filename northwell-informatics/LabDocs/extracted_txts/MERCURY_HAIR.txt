SOP: Hair Mercury Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed analytical
procedures for determining the concentration of mercury in human
hair samples. This process involves sample digestion, reduction,
detection, and quantification using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometry (ICP-MS).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all human hair samples received and
processed in our laboratory for the quantification of mercury.
Laboratory technicians and other personnel involved in the analysis
must adhere strictly to this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for conducting the
analysis as outlined in this SOP and documenting all procedures
and findings accurately.
• Supervisors/Managers: Responsible for ensuring proper training
of personnel, maintaining equipment, verifying results, and
performing regular audits of the process.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Analytical balance (sensitivity of at least 0.0001 g)
• Clean laboratory glassware and digestion vessels
• Nitric acid (HNO3), Hydrochloric acid (HCl), and other required
reagents (trace metal grade)
• Scalpels, tweezers, or clean scissors for sample handling
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses
• Mercury control standards (calibration standards) and Quality
Control (QC) samples
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Human hair
• Sample Volume: Minimum of 0.5 grams of hair
• Collection Method: Hair should be collected using clean scissors
or a sterile scalpel from the nape of the neck in a consistent
manner.
• Storage: Store hair samples in clean, labeled plastic or glass
containers. Avoid contamination with other materials.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
1. Weighing:
◦ Using an analytical balance, weigh approximately 0.5 grams
of hair and document the weight accurately.
2. Cleaning:
◦ Wash the hair sample with deionized water to remove any
external contaminants. Rinse thoroughly.
3. Drying:
◦ Allow the hair sample to air dry in a clean environment. Do
not use heat to accelerate the drying process to prevent any
alteration in mercury content.
6.2. Acid Digestion
1. Setup:
◦ Place the cleaned, air-dried hair sample into a digestion
vessel.
◦ Add 5 mL of nitric acid (HNO3) to each sample.
2. Digestion Process:
◦ Heat the vessel slowly to 95°C using a hot plate or a
digestion block.
◦ Maintain this temperature for 2 hours or until the sample is
completely digested. The sample solution should be clear.
3. Cooling:
◦ Allow the digested sample to cool to room temperature.
4. Dilution:
◦ Dilute the digested sample to a final volume of 25 mL using
deionized water. Mix well.
6.3. ICP-MS Analysis
1. Preparation of Standards and QC Samples:
◦ Prepare a series of mercury calibration standards (e.g., 0, 5,
10, 20 ng/mL mercury) to build a calibration curve.
◦ Prepare Quality Control (QC) samples with known mercury
concentrations to monitor the assay’s accuracy and
precision.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS instrument using the prepared
calibration standards.
◦ Introduce the diluted sample solution into the ICP-MS.
3. Analysis:
◦ Perform the ICP-MS analysis following the instrument
manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Measure the mercury content in the samples.
4. Data Processing:
◦ Use the calibration curve to quantify the mercury
concentration in the hair samples.
◦ Ensure that all analytical data are within acceptable limits,
validating the calibration standards and QC samples.
6.4. Quality Control
• Analyze quality control samples after every 10 hair samples and
at the beginning and end of each analytical session to ensure
analytical integrity.
• Repeat the analysis for any samples falling outside the
established control limits or showing any potential contamination
issues.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transcribe the final concentration values from the ICP-MS to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all data is reviewed and verified by a qualified individual,
typically a laboratory supervisor.
• Report results to the physician or relevant health provider using
the laboratory's standard reporting format.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The method is sensitive to contamination; ensure that all cleaning,
handling, and analytical procedures minimize contamination.
• The sensitivity and accuracy of the results rely on proper
calibration and quality control.
• Strong interference in ICP-MS analysis from other elements might
affect the accuracy; however, these should be minimized through
proper instrument setup and calibration.
