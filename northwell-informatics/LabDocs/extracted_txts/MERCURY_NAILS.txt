Standard Operating Procedure Protocol for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Mercury in Nails
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides instructions for the determination of mercury
(Hg) concentration in nail specimens using Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). This ensures the accuracy,
precision, and reliability of results while maintaining compliance with
regulatory guidelines.
Responsibility:
Authorized laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis of mercury in nail specimens.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Nails (finger or toe)
• Specimens should be free from visible contamination and stored
at room temperature in clean, sealed polyethylene containers.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimen Type:
• Specimens not stored in appropriate containers
• Specimens with visible contamination

1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
4.1.1 Cleaning Nails:
• Rinse nail samples with distilled, deionized water.
• Sonicate samples in a 1% (v/v) nitric acid solution for 10 minutes.
• Rinse with distilled, deionized water and dry under a biological
safety cabinet.
4.1.2 Weighing and Digestion:
• Accurately weigh approximately 0.1-0.2 g of the cleaned nail
sample.
• Transfer the weighed sample into a digestion vessel.
• Add 5 mL of ultrapure nitric acid and 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide to
the vessel.
• Heat the mixture on a hot plate at 95°C for 2 hours or until
complete digestion is achieved.
• Allow the digest to cool, then dilute with distilled, deionized water
to a final volume of 50 mL.
4.2 Instrumentation Setup:
4.2.1 ICP-MS Calibration:
• Calibrate the ICP-MS using certified mercury standard solutions.
• Prepare a calibration curve ranging from 0 to 100 ppb mercury
concentration.
4.2.2 Quality Control (QC):
• Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, and high mercury
concentrations) along with the specimens to ensure accuracy.
• Include reagent blanks to account for any potential contamination.
4.3 Analysis:
4.3.1 Sample Introduction:
• Introduce digested nail samples, quality control samples, and
calibration standards to the ICP-MS.
• Ensure that the flow rate, nebulizer gas, and other critical
parameters are optimized for mercury analysis.
4.3.2 Data Acquisition:
• Collect data using the ICP-MS software, ensuring all peaks are
accurately identified and quantified.
• Verify that internal standards are within acceptable limits.
4.4 Reporting:
4.4.1 Data Review:
• Review raw data to ensure that all QC parameters are within
acceptable ranges.
• Any sample exceeding the control limits must be reanalyzed.
4.4.2 Results:
• Generate final results based on the calibration curve.
• Report mercury levels in ng/g (nanograms per gram) of nail.
4.4.3 Documentation:
• Document all steps meticulously in the laboratory's electronic
information management system (LIMS).
• Ensure all records are traceable and compliant with quality
management standards.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
5.1 Ensure calibration standards and QC samples are prepared
accurately. 5.2 Regular maintenance and performance checks of the
ICP-MS. 5.3 Participation in external proficiency testing programs for
trace metals analysis. 5.4 Continuous training and competency
assessments for laboratory personnel.
