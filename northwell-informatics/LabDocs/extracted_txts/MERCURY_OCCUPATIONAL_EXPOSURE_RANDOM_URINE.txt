STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF MERCURY OCCUPATIONAL
EXPOSURE, RANDOM URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical phase protocol for assessing
mercury occupational exposure through the evaluation of random
urine samples. The goal is to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
reporting of mercury concentrations to assess the occupational
exposure of individuals.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All personnel performing mercury analysis on urine samples are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. Laboratory staff must ensure
accurate measurements, while the supervisor is accountable for
reviewing results and addressing any discrepancies or issues.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Random urine sample
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL
• Container: Clean plastic urine container, properly labeled with
patient identification, collection date, and time.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Urine standard solutions for calibration (Traceable to NIST)
• Mercury-free water for dilution
• Quality Control (QC) samples (low, medium, high)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes for sample preparation
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Sample Mixing: Vortex the urine sample for 5-10 seconds to
ensure homogeneity.
2. Aliquoting: Transfer 5 mL of well-mixed urine into a 50 mL
polypropylene centrifuge tube using a disposable pipette.
3. Dilution: Dilute urine samples 1:10 with mercury-free water,
yielding a final volume of 50 mL.
4. Vortex Mix: Vortex the diluted sample for 5-10 seconds.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare Calibration Standards:
◦ Use traceable standard solutions to prepare a series of
mercury calibration standards at concentrations of 0, 5, 10,
25, 50, 100 µg/L.
◦ Vortex mix each calibration standard for 5-10 seconds.
2. Prepare Quality Control (QC) Samples:
◦ Include at least one low, one medium, and one high QC
sample.
◦ QC samples must be prepared similarly to patient samples.
◦ Vortex mix each QC sample for 5-10 seconds.
3. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS using the prepared calibration
standards.
◦ Verify calibration curve linearity (acceptable R² > 0.995).
C) Measurement Procedure Using ICP-MS
1. Baseline Verification:
◦ Verify that the ICP-MS baseline is stable and within
acceptable limits.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Introduce calibration standards and QC samples to the ICP-
MS for establishing the calibration curve and ensuring QC
integrity.
◦ Analyze the urine samples in sequence, interspersing QC
samples to continuously monitor instrument performance.
◦ Record Mercury concentration (µg/L) for each sample.
D) Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Data Review:
◦ Review raw data for any anomalies or deviations.
◦ Validate QC results to ensure they are within acceptable
ranges (mean ± 2SD).
2. Result Calculation:
◦ Adjust raw results for dilution factor (1:10).
◦ For results exceeding the highest calibration standard, re-
analyze sample after appropriate dilution.
3. Result Documentation:
◦ Document final Mercury concentration results in the
laboratory information system.
◦ Include patient ID, sample ID, collection date and time, and
analysis date and time.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use of certified QC materials to ensure accuracy.
• Contingent repeat testing for any out-of-range QC results.
• Documentation of instrument calibration and QC results.
7. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves, eye
protection).
• Dispose of waste materials appropriately.
• Handle mercury standards and urine specimens following
biosafety and chemical hygiene guidelines.
8. REFERENCE RANGES
• Occupational exposure: Reference intervals are dependent on
workplace standards and exposure history.
