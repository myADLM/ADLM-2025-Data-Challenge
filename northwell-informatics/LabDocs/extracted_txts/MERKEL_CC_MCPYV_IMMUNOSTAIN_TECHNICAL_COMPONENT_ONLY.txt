Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for staining
and generating results for Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV)
using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. This procedure applies to
the technical component only and ensures accuracy and
consistency in test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory staff are responsible
for performing the staining procedure and ensuring accuracy of
results. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing
the procedure to ensure compliance with this SOP.
3. DEFINITION MCPyV Immunostaining: An
immunohistochemical technique used to detect the presence of
Merkel Cell Polyomavirus in tissue sections.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS The specimen must:
• Be formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Include a minimum of 4µm section mounted on positively charged
slides.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody against MCPyV large T antigen (e.g., CM2B4)
• Secondary antibody and detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated
polymer)
• DAB substrate solution
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Xylene-based mounting medium
• Incubator set at 37°C and humidity control
• Appropriate control slides (known positive and negative MCPyV
tissue sections for quality control)
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Drying oven
• Automated IHC stainer (if available)
• Light microscope
• Deionized/Distilled water
• Hot plates or similar equipment for slide incubation
1. PROCEDURE A. Slide Preparation
2. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4µm thickness using the
microtome.
3. Mount tissue sections on positively charged slides.
4. Place slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes or an equivalent
drying protocol to ensure optimal tissue adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in 3 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols (100%, 95%,
and 70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 1 minute.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using the preferred method (e.g.,
heat-induced epitope retrieval HIER) in sodium citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) for 20 minutes at 95-100°C.
2. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by TBS or PBS buffer for
5 minutes.
D. Staining Protocol
1. Apply a hydrophobic barrier around the sections using a
suitable marking pen.
2. Incubate slides with the primary anti-MCPyV large T antigen
antibody for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at
4°C, as per antibody manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Rinse slides in TBS or PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
4. Incubate slides with the appropriate secondary antibody and
detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated) for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
5. Rinse slides again with TBS or PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
6. Develop chromogenic signal with DAB substrate, monitoring
under the microscope until adequate color development
(usually 5-10 minutes).
7. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in tap water until clear.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and 100%) for
1 minute each.
4. Clear slides in xylene for 3 minutes each.
5. Mount coverslips using xylene-based mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Include known positive and negative control slides in each run
to ensure proper staining.
8. Evaluate controls first to ensure assay performance.
9. Document any discrepancies or staining issues and take
corrective actions as necessary.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Review slides under a microscope and determine the presence
of MCPyV antigen by detecting brown chromogenic signal
localized to cell nuclei and/or cytoplasm.
12. Document technical findings and interpret as positive or
negative for MCPyV presence.
13. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS),
ensuring they are verified by the technologist and reviewed by
the pathologist for correlation with clinical findings.
