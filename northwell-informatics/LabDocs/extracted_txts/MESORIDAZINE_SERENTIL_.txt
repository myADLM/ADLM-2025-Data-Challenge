Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
MESORIDAZINE (SERENTIL)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the analytical methods for
generating accurate and reliable results for MESORIDAZINE
(SERENTIL) in patient samples. MESORIDAZINE is an antipsychotic
medication, and monitoring its levels in patient specimens is essential
for ensuring therapeutic efficacy and safety. This protocol includes
steps for sample preparation, instrument calibration, analysis, and
result reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis,
documenting all relevant steps, and taking corrective action if
necessary. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
the protocol and managing any deficiencies.
1. DEFINITION
MESORIDAZINE (SERENTIL): An antipsychotic medication
belonging to the phenothiazine class, used in the treatment of
schizophrenia.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred specimen: Serum or plasma collected in EDTA, heparin,
or sodium citrate tubes.
• Specimens should be collected, processed, and transported to
the lab promptly to ensure stability.
• Stability: MESORIDAZINE is stable in serum/plasma for up to 24
hours at room temperature or up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, insufficient volume (<0.5
mL), or samples with prolonged exposure to extreme
temperatures.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
1. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detection.
2. MESORIDAZINE standards and controls.
3. Mobile phase reagents (e.g., methanol, water, phosphate
buffer).
4. Sample vials and syringe filters (0.45 µm).
C. Instrument Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration standards of MESORIDAZINE in a range of
concentrations (e.g., 50, 100, 200, 400 ng/mL).
2. Calibrate the HPLC system using these standards according to
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Document calibration results, ensuring all results fall within
acceptable limits.
D. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma.
2. Transfer serum/plasma into labeled sample vials.
3. Add an internal standard to each vial, if applicable.
4. Filter samples using syringe filters (0.45 µm) to remove
particulates.
E. Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to standard operating
procedures with an appropriate mobile phase (e.g.,
methanol:water:phosphate buffer).
2. Inject prepared samples into the HPLC system.
3. Record chromatograms and peak areas for MESORIDAZINE
and internal standard, if used.
4. Use calibration curves to calculate the concentrations of
MESORIDAZINE in each sample.
5. Ensure the system's performance criteria (e.g., peak resolution,
retention time) are met throughout the analysis.
F. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations alongside patient samples.
2. Compare QC results to established reference ranges and
document any deviations.
3. Implement troubleshooting steps for any QC failures and notify
supervisor.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Verify the accuracy of calculated MESORIDAZINE
concentrations.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and authorize results for release.
4. Document any actions taken if results are outside expected
therapeutic ranges (e.g., notification of responsible clinician,
repeat testing).
H. Method Limitations:
Refer to manufacturer's HPLC system and reagent inserts for specific
limitations related to matrix interferences, sensitivity, and specificity of
MESORIDAZINE detection.
References: Refer to the relevant HPLC system user manuals,
MESORIDAZINE product inserts, and clinical guidelines on
antipsychotic therapeutic drug monitoring for detailed instructions and
limitations.
This SOP has been reviewed and approved by laboratory
management. All personnel performing MESORIDAZINE analysis
must be adequately trained and proficient in the use of HPLC and
laboratory practices related to drug monitoring.
