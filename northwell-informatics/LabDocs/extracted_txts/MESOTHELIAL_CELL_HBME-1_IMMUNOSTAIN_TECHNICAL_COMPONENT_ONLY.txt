STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: MESOTHELIAL CELL (HBME-1) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the technical component of
generating results for Mesothelial Cell (HBME-1) immunostain
analysis. This SOP outlines the protocol for performing the
immunohistochemical staining of histological sections to detect the
presence of mesothelial cells using the HBME-1 antibody.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all qualified laboratory personnel
performing mesothelial cell immunostaining in the histology
laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing and documenting the
staining process. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure that the process is carried out as per the procedures and that
all equipment is maintained and calibrated.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
3.1 Reagents:
• Primary Antibody: HBME-1 (ready-to-use or as per manufacturer's
instructions)
• Blocking Solution
• Secondary Antibody (suitable for HBME-1 detection)
• Chromogen/Substrate solution (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting Medium
• Wash Buffers (e.g., PBS or TBS)
3.2 Materials:
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Histological glass slides with tissue sections
• Cover slips
• Immunostaining kit (if applicable)
• Humidity chamber or moisture box
• Microscope
• Timer
• Pipettes and tips
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Tissue Sections:
• Ensure tissue sections are adequately fixed (usually in 10%
neutral buffered formalin) and embedded in paraffin.
• Cut 4-5 µm thick sections and mount them on positively charged
glass slides.
• Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour or as required.
4.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in three changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
• Rehydrate sections by passing through graded alcohols: 100%
alcohol (2 x 3 min), 95% alcohol (2 x 3 min), 70% alcohol (3 min),
and rinse in distilled water.
4.3 Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate method (e.g.,
heat-mediated using a microwave or pressure cooker with citrate
buffer at pH 6.0) for 10-20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse in wash buffer (PBS or TBS) for 3 x 5 minutes.
4.4 Blocking:
• Apply blocking solution to the slides to reduce nonspecific
binding. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
• Drain off the blocking solution (do not wash).
4.5 Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply HBME-1 primary antibody to the sections. Ensure the
sections are completely covered.
• Incubate in a humidified chamber, typically at room temperature
or as directed by the antibody manufacturer, for 30-60 minutes.
4.6 Washing:
• Rinse slides in wash buffer for 3 x 5 minutes to remove unbound
primary antibody.
4.7 Secondary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply the secondary antibody to the sections and incubate for the
specified time (usually 30 minutes) at room temperature in the
humidity chamber.
• Ensure that sections do not dry out during this period.
4.8 Washing:
• Rinse slides in wash buffer for 3 x 5 minutes to remove unbound
secondary antibody.
4.9 Chromogen Development:
• Apply the chromogen/substrate solution (e.g., DAB) to the
sections for 2-10 minutes or until desired staining intensity is
achieved (monitor under a microscope).
• Rinse immediately in distilled water once desired staining is
achieved.
4.10 Counterstaining:
• Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Blue the sections in running tap water for 5 minutes.
4.11 Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols, starting at 70% and
proceeding to 100% (each step for 1-2 minutes).
• Clear in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
• Mount cover slips using mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control tissues with each run to
ensure the reliability of the staining procedure.
• Document the control results in the laboratory logbook.
• Check the slides microscopically to ensure proper staining.
• Retain all documents including staining logs and equipment
maintenance logs.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The interpretative reading and reporting of HBME-1 immunostain
results are performed by a qualified pathologist.
• Ensure all slides and reagents are properly labeled and stored
appropriately.

1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents and specimens as potentially hazardous.
This SOP is effective from [insert date] and must be reviewed and
approved by the laboratory supervisor annually or as required by
procedure update.
