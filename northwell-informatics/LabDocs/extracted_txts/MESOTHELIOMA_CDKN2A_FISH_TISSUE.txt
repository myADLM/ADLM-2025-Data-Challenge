Standard Operating Procedure for MESOTHELIOMA,
CDKN2A FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection of CDKN2A (p16)
gene deletion in tissue samples of mesothelioma patients using
Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH).
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to the Cytogenetics Laboratory for the
processing and analysis of tissue samples submitted for the detection
of CDKN2A deletions in mesothelioma cases using FISH.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
FISH analysis and documenting all procedures and results according
to this protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure adherence to this protocol and to handle any deviations that
may arise.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections (4-5
µm thick)
• FISH probes specific for CDKN2A (p16) gene
• Centromeric control probe (CEP 9)
• Heat pretreatment equipment (e.g., water bath, hot plate)
• Deparaffinization reagents (e.g., xylene, ethanol)
• Protease digestion solution
• Fluorescent microscope
• Hybridization chamber
• DAPI counterstaining solution
• FISH hybridization buffer
• Humidified hybridization oven
• Appropriate positive and negative control slides
5. PROCEDURE:
5.1 Deparaffinization and Pretreatment:
1. Bake FFPE tissue sections at 60°C for 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 10 minutes
each.
3. Rehydrate slides through a series of ethanol washes (100%,
95%, and 70%), 5 minutes each.
4. Immerse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
5.2 Protease Digestion:
1. Immerse slides in a pre-warmed protease solution at 37°C for
10-30 minutes (time may vary based on tissue type).
2. Rinse slides in 2X SSC solution at room temperature for 5
minutes.
5.3 FISH Probe Hybridization:
1. Apply 10 µL of FISH probe mixture (CDKN2A and CEP 9) to
each slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and seal edges with rubber cement.
3. Denature the tissue and probe by placing the slides on a pre-
warmed hot plate at 75°C for 5 minutes.
4. Transfer slides to a humidified hybridization chamber and
incubate overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C.
5.4 Post-hybridization Wash:
1. Remove rubber cement and coverslips from slides.
2. Immerse slides in 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 solution at room
temperature to gently remove the coverslip.
3. Wash slides in pre-warmed 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 solution at
72°C for 2 minutes.
4. Wash slides in room temperature 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 solution
for an additional 2 minutes.
5.5 Counterstaining:
1. Apply DAPI counterstain to each slide and cover with a clean
coverslip.
2. Allow slides to dry in the dark for 10-15 minutes.
5.6 Fluorescence Microscopy and Analysis:
1. Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped with
filters for DAPI, FITC, and TRITC.
2. Evaluate at least 100 interphase nuclei per slide for signals of
CDKN2A and CEP 9.
3. Score cells based on the presence or absence of CDKN2A
signals relative to CEP 9 signals.
4. Document the percentage of cells showing deletion of
CDKN2A.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each run to
ensure the specificity and sensitivity of the assay.
2. Record temperatures, times, and any observations in the
laboratory logbook.
3. Evaluate control results before analyzing patient samples to
confirm assay performance.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS:
1. A deletion of CDKN2A is indicated if more than 20% of scored
nuclei lack CDKN2A signals.
2. Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
technologist or pathologist.
3. Report findings to the ordering physician, including the
percentage of cells with CDKN2A deletion, assay limitations,
and clinical implications where appropriate.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Not applicable as results are expressed as a percentage of cells with
CDKN2A deletion.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the FISH probe manufacturer’s insert for limitations specific
to the assay. Potential limitations include signal artifacts due to tissue
processing, variations in probe hybridization, and potential for
incomplete digestion or hybridization.
