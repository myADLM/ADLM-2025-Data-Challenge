Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for MESOTHELIOMA
PANEL (WT1/KRT5/TTF1/PCEA) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
Purpose: To provide a standardized procedure for the
immunohistochemical staining and analysis of the MESOTHELIOMA
PANEL (WT1/KRT5/TTF1/PCEA) to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the staining procedure, quality control checks, and
documentation of results. All laboratory personnel must adhere to the
procedures outlined in this SOP and report any deviations or issues
to the supervisor.
Specimen Requirements: This SOP assumes that the specimen
has already been collected, received, and accessioned. The following
guidelines pertain to the analytical phase of processing.
1. Specimen Types: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
2. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Positive-control slides
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (graded series 100%, 95%, 70%)
◦ Distilled water
◦ Antigen retrieval solutions (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
◦ Primary antibodies: WT1, KRT5, TTF1, PCEA
◦ Secondary antibody detection system
◦ DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) chromogen
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Immunostainer (automated instrument, e.g., Ventana
BenchMark, Leica Bond)
3. Procedure:
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 micron sections from FFPE blocks using a
microtome.
◦ Place the sections on positively charged microscope slides.
2. Drying:
◦ Place slides in a 60°C oven for at least 1 hour or overnight
to dry.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene three times for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydration:
◦ Immerse slides in 100% ethanol twice for 3 minutes each.
◦ Immerse slides in 95% ethanol twice for 3 minutes each.
◦ Immerse slides in 70% ethanol for 3 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a heat-resistant container with antigen
retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using your laboratory's validated
method (e.g., microwave, pressure cooker, or automated
system).
D. Immunostaining:
1. Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Follow the automated immunostainer's protocol for primary
antibody application.
◦ Incubate sections with primary antibodies WT1, KRT5,
TTF1, and PCEA according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
2. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
◦ Use the automated immunostainer to apply secondary
antibody and detection reagents.
3. Chromogen Development:
◦ Incubate sections with DAB solution until the desired stain
intensity develops.
◦ Rinse slides thoroughly with distilled water.
E. Counterstain and Mounting:
1. Counterstain:
◦ Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-3 minutes.
◦ Rinse with tap water.
2. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate the sections through graded ethanol series (70%,
95%, 100%).
◦ Clear in xylene.
◦ Apply a coverslip using mounting medium.
F. Quality Control:
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative control slides with
each run.
◦ Verify the results against control slides to ensure staining
quality and specificity.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record the date, time, technician initials, and any deviations
from the procedure.
◦ Document quality control results and any corrective actions,
if necessary.
Reporting Results:
• The technical processing results are reviewed by a pathologist or
designated personnel.
• Document and store results following laboratory guidelines.
• Only the technical component of the immunostain is performed;
interpretation is to be completed by the appropriate medical
professional.
Reference Documentation:
• Primary antibody datasheets (WT1, KRT5, TTF1, PCEA)
• Immunostainer operator’s manual
• Relevant literature and guidelines for quality assurance in
immunohistochemistry
Review and Validation:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever new
techniques, reagents, or equipment are introduced.
References:
• Current immunohistochemistry standards and guidelines.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for antibodies and reagent kits.
This protocol is designed to ensure the consistent and accurate
processing of specimens for MESOTHELIOMA PANEL (WT1/KRT5/
TTF1/PCEA) immunostaining, adhering to quality control measures
and documentation requirements.
