Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MESQUITE, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and reliable
measurement of MESQUITE and IgE in serum specimens. This
document outlines the procedures for the preparation, analysis, and
reporting of results for these assays, ensuring adherence to CLIA
standards and laboratory best practices.
1. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type:
• Serum: Collected in a BD Vacutainer SST (Gold Top or Red/Black
Top tube).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum may be stored at room temperature (20-25°C) for up to 24
hours, refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 72 hours, or frozen (-20°C or
colder) for long-term storage up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens without proper labeling (missing collection date/time,
patient identification).
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• MESQUITE assay kit (specific brand as per lab procurement)
• IgE assay kit (specific brand as per lab procurement)
• Calibrators, controls, and internal standards for MESQUITE and
IgE
• Microplate reader (or relevant measurement instrument)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
1. Procedure
A. Preparation of Reagents and Samples:
1. Ensure all reagents and calibrators are brought to room
temperature.
2. Prepare working solutions according to manufacturer
instructions.
3. Thaw serum specimens if frozen. Mix well using a vortex mixer.
4. Centrifuge specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
B. MESQUITE Assay:
1. Load calibrators, control samples, and patient specimens into
the microplate wells according to the assay kit manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Follow the step-by-step procedures outlined in the MESQUITE
kit insert for reagent addition, incubation times, and wash steps.
3. Measure the optical density (OD) or relevant signal on the
microplate reader at the specified wavelength.
C. IgE Assay:
1. Load calibrators, control samples, and patient specimens into
the assay plate according to the assay kit manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Follow the step-by-step procedures outlined in the IgE kit insert
for reagent addition, incubation times, and wash steps.
3. Measure the OD or relevant signal using the microplate reader
at the specified wavelength.
D. Quality Control:
1. Ensure calibration curves are generated with each assay run.
2. Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations to verify assay accuracy.
3. Accept or reject assay runs based on QC results as per lab-
specific guidelines.
E. Calculations and Reporting Results:
1. Validate calibration curves and calculate patient results using
the appropriate software.
2. Compare patient results with reference intervals for MESQUITE
and IgE:
◦ MESQUITE: Refer to assay-specific reference ranges
(provided in kit insert).
◦ IgE: < 100 IU/mL for adults (age-specific ranges may apply).
3. Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review.
4. Review and verify results prior to release to ensure no errors or
inconsistencies.
5. Method Limitations
Refer to assay kit inserts for method-specific limitations and
interferences:
• MESQUITE assay limitations
• IgE assay limitations

1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of all designated staff to perform the
MESQUITE and IgE assays according to this SOP, report any
deviations, and document any corrective actions taken. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring compliance with SOP procedures and
addressing any issues arising during the analytical phase.
End of SOP
This protocol ensures a standardized approach to the analytical
phase of generating results for MESQUITE and IgE in serum,
maintaining quality and accuracy.
