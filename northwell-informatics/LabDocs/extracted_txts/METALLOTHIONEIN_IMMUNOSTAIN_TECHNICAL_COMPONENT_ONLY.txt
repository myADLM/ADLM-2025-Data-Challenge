Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Metallothionein Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the technical component of generating
results for metallothionein immunostain. This involves the staining of
tissue sections on slides with metallothionein antibodies to identify
and evaluate the presence and distribution of metallothionein in the
tissue samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel performing the technical
component of metallothionein immunostaining in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory technologists responsible for performing
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining techniques.
• The Laboratory Supervisor for overseeing adherence to this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Metallothionein: A family of low-molecular-weight proteins that
bind heavy metals and have a role in their regulation and
detoxification.
• Immunostaining: A laboratory method that uses antibodies to
detect specific proteins in tissue sections.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
mounted on microscope slides.
• Tissue slides should be cut at a thickness of 4-5 micrometers.
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody for Metallothionein (dilution per manufacturer's
instructions)
• Secondary Antibody (appropriate for primary antibody host
species)
• Chromogen Substrate
• Blocking Solution
• Antigen Retrieval Solution
• Washing Buffers (PBS or TBS)
• Mounting Medium
• Positive Control Slide (contains tissue known to express
metallothionein)
• Negative Control Slide (tissue sections without primary antibody)
7. EQUIPMENT
• Humidified Chamber
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• Incubator (set at 37°C)
• Appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
• Automated Staining System (if available)
8. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Slide Preparation
◦ Cut tissue sections from FFPE blocks at 4-5 micrometers.
◦ Place tissue sections on positively charged microscope
slides.
◦ Allow slides to dry overnight at room temperature or
incubate at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure tissue adherence.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene (3 changes of 5
minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohol series (100%, 95%, 70%,
50%; 3 minutes each).
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER)
◦ Preheat antigen retrieval solution in a microwave or
pressure cooker.
◦ Place slides in the preheated solution and microwave at a
low power setting or use pressure cooker as per
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow to cool for 20 minutes until solution reaches room
temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Blocking
1. Endogenous Enzyme Blocking
◦ Incubate slides in hydrogen peroxide solution (3%) for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
2. Protein Blocking
◦ Apply protein blocking solution (per kit instructions) and
incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 10 minutes to
prevent non-specific binding.
◦ Blot slides gently to remove excess solution.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Primary Antibody Application
◦ Apply an appropriately diluted metallothionein primary
antibody to each tissue section on the slide.
◦ Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
2. Rinsing
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS (3 changes for 5 minutes each).
E. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Secondary Antibody Application
◦ Apply secondary antibody (appropriate to detect primary
antibody) and incubate in a humidified chamber for 30
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS (3 changes of 5 minutes each).
F. Chromogen Development
1. Chromogen Application
◦ Apply chromogen substrate solution (per kit instructions)
and incubate until desired color intensity develops, typically
5-10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
G. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes and rinse in
distilled water.
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohol series (50%, 70%,
95%, 100%; 3 minutes each).
H. Mounting
1. Mounting Medium
◦ Clear slides in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
◦ Apply mounting medium and cover slips to slides.
◦ Allow slides to dry thoroughly.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Record observations of control slide staining to ensure consistent
results.
• Document any deviations from the expected results and notify the
supervisor.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Slides are forwarded to the pathologist for review and
interpretation of metallothionein staining.
• Results are documented according to site-specific guidelines for
IHC reporting.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for metallothionein primary antibody

• Laboratory's Quality Control and Safety Protocols.
12. REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed annually, and updates will be made as
necessary to ensure compliance with best practices and
regulatory guidelines.
13. HISTORY
• Document any revisions or updates to this SOP with dates and a
brief description of changes made.
