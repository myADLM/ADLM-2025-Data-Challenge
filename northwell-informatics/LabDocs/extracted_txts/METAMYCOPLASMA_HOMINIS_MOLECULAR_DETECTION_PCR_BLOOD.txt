Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for METAMYCOPLASMA
HOMINIS, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To define the standardized procedure for the detection of
Metamycoplasma hominis DNA in blood specimens using
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This protocol ensures proper
execution and documentation of all steps involved in the PCR
process.
Responsibility: All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this protocol accurately and documenting any deviations or
issues. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure that all
personnel understand and comply with this procedure.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR workstation (DNA-free)
• Thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes (2µL to 1000µL) with sterile, aerosol-resistant tips
• Refrigerators (2-8°C) and Freezers (-20°C and -80°C)
• Biosafety cabinet for sample preparation
• UV spectrophotometer
Reagents:
• Metamycoplasma hominis PCR master mix (containing specific
primers and Taq polymerase)
• Positive control DNA template
• Negative control (nuclease-free water)
• DNA extraction kit suitable for blood specimens
• Sterile nuclease-free water
• 70% Ethanol
Supplies:
• Blood collection tubes (EDTA or heparin)
• 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes or plates
• Pipette tips with aerosol barriers
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PPE
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA or heparin tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL of blood.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants other
than EDTA or heparin.
• Insufficient volume (<5 mL) of blood.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours post-collection.
Storage:
• Whole blood: Before processing, store at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours.
• Extracted DNA: Store at -20°C for short-term use or -80°C for
long-term storage.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Ensure all reagents and the DNA extraction kit are at room
temperature.
2. Prepare samples and controls (positive and negative) using
aseptic techniques to avoid contamination.
3. Vortex and centrifuge the blood collection tubes to mix the
contents properly.
4. Follow the DNA extraction kit manufacturer’s instructions
precisely.
5. Elute the DNA in a final volume of 50 µL of nuclease-free water.
6. Measure the DNA concentration and purity using a UV
spectrophotometer. Ensure DNA quality for PCR (A260/A280
ratio around 1.8).
B. PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents, including the PCR master mix, DNA
samples, and controls, on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR mix in the designated PCR workstation:
◦ PCR master mix: 25 µL
◦ Template DNA: 5 µL (sample or controls)
◦ Nuclease-free water: 20 µL Total: 50 µL
3. Vortex and briefly centrifuge the PCR mix to ensure a thorough
mix.
4. Aliquot 50 µL of the PCR mix into each PCR tube or well of a
PCR plate.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Program the thermal cycler according to the following profile for
Metamycoplasma hominis:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
2. Load the PCR tubes or plate into the thermal cycler and start
the run.
D. Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Prepare for gel electrophoresis or another approved method for
PCR product analysis.
2. Run the PCR products on a 2% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide or an alternative fluorescent dye.
3. Include DNA ladder and positive/negative controls in the gel.
4. Visualize the PCR products using a UV transilluminator.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive Result: A distinct band corresponding to the expected
size of the Metamycoplasma hominis amplicon in the sample lane
consistent with the positive control.
• Negative Result: Absence of a band in the sample lane and
appropriate presence of bands in positive control and absence in
negative control.
• Invalid Result: Presence of a band in the negative control or
absence of a band in the positive control. If this occurs, repeat the
PCR process for the affected samples using new reagents.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform DNA extraction quality controls with each batch of
samples.
• Run PCR controls (positive and negative) with each set of
samples.
• Document all control results. Investigate any failed controls and
repeat the analysis if necessary.
• Maintain the calibration and maintenance logs for equipment
according to the manufacturer's specifications.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the PCR results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Report positive results immediately to the requesting clinician,
following laboratory reporting guidelines.
• Negative results and resolution of any invalid results should be
reported according to laboratory protocol.
1. REFERENCES
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
and PCR master mix.
• Include peer-reviewed scientific literature or guidelines for
Metamycoplasma hominis PCR testing as necessary.
• Maintain up-to-date documentation of all protocols and ensure
they are accessible to laboratory personnel.
This concludes the SOP for METAMYCOPLASMA HOMINIS,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, BLOOD. All personnel must follow
this procedure accurately to guarantee reliable and reproducible
results.
