Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) METAMYCOPLASMA
HOMINIS, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the analytical steps
required to perform the molecular detection of Metamycoplasma
hominis in plasma samples using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory and is to
be followed by all personnel trained in the procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to accurately follow
this SOP to ensure the correct detection and reporting of
Metamycoplasma hominis. The supervisor is responsible for the
overall quality control and assurance of this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Plasma collected in EDTA or lavender-top
tubes.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric plasma samples.
◦ Plasma samples received more than 24 hours after collection
without freezing (frozen plasma preferred).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Metamycoplasma hominis-specific primers and probes
• PCR Master Mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Pipettes and sterile aerosol-resistant tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Positive and negative control samples
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes or plates
• Ice or cold block
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction:
1. Thaw plasma samples, positive control, and negative control on
ice.
2. Follow the DNA Extraction Kit protocol to isolate DNA from 200
µL plasma samples.
3. Elute the DNA in 50 µL of nuclease-free water.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not used immediately for PCR.
6.2. PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions including primers and probes specific for
Metamycoplasma hominis.
2. Aliquot 20 µL of the Master Mix into each PCR tube or well.
3. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to the respective tube or well.
Include negative control (nuclease-free water) and positive
control (known Metamycoplasma hominis DNA).
4. Seal the tubes or plate to prevent contamination.
5. Gently mix by tapping and briefly centrifuge to ensure all liquid
is at the bottom.
6.3. PCR Amplification:
1. Place the tubes or plate into the thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Number of cycles: 40
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
3. Start the PCR run.
6.4. Post-PCR Analysis:
1. At the end of the PCR run, proceed with the detection of
amplified DNA.
2. Using a suitable detection method (e.g., gel electrophoresis or
real-time PCR detection system), analyze the PCR products.
3. Compare the signals from the unknown samples with the
positive and negative controls to determine the presence of
Metamycoplasma hominis DNA.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Each PCR run must include a positive control to verify
amplification and a negative control to check for contamination.
2. Review and document the results of positive and negative
control samples. A test run is valid only if:
◦ The positive control shows the expected amplification.
◦ The negative control shows no amplification.
3. If controls do not perform as expected, troubleshoot the
procedure, and repeat the assay.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Report results as follows:
◦ Positive: Metamycoplasma hominis DNA detected.
◦ Negative: Metamycoplasma hominis DNA not detected.
◦ Invalid: Test failed due to control failure or sample issues.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay depend on the
quality of the DNA extraction and PCR conditions.
2. False positives may occur due to contamination; strict
adherence to aseptic techniques is essential.
3. False negatives can occur if PCR inhibitors are present in the
sample. Repeat the extraction and PCR if suspicion arises.
