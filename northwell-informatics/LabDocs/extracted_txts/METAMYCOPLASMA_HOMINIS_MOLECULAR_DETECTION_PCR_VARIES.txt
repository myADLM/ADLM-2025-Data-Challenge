Standard Operating Procedure: METAMYCOPLASMA HOMINIS,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the molecular detection of
Metamycoplasma hominis using PCR in the clinical laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing PCR-
based molecular detection.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure the quality and
accuracy of the test results and raise any concerns to the
supervisor immediately.
2. DEFINITION
Metamycoplasma hominis: A bacterial pathogen that can cause
urogenital and respiratory disorders, detected via molecular
techniques such as PCR.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Urine, urogenital swabs, or respiratory samples.
• Collection: Ensure proper sample collection; swabs should be
placed in transport media immediately after collection.
• Storage: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C up to 24 hours or at
-20°C for longer periods.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• PCR Instrument (e.g., Real-Time PCR Machine)
• Extraction Kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• Metamycoplasma hominis-specific primers and probes
• Master Mix for PCR
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive Control (known Metamycoplasma hominis DNA)
• Negative Control (Nuclease-free water)
Procedure:
A) DNA Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction using the
extraction kit.
2. Ensure all equipment and surfaces are free from contamination.
3. Validate the presence of DNA by determining the quality and
quantity using spectrophotometry or a suitable alternative.
B) PCR Setup
1. Label all tubes clearly.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix in a designated PCR preparation
area following the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Add nucleic acid samples to the master mix in the PCR reaction
tubes.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
5. Seal each tube or use compatible PCR plates and cover.
C) PCR Cycling
1. Setup the PCR instrument according to the following thermal
cycling conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 mins
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 secs
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 secs
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 secs
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 5 mins
2. Monitor the real-time amplification using the PCR machine
software.
Quality Control
• Perform quality control validation with each batch of tests.
• Positive control results must be positive for Metamycoplasma
hominis.
• Negative control must show no amplification.
D) Interpretation of Results
1. Analyze the data using the PCR instrument software.
2. Compare the sample amplification curves to those of the
controls.
3. A sample is considered positive if fluorescence exceeds the
threshold value before the designated cycle threshold.
4. Negative samples will not display significant amplification
curves compared to the baseline.
E) Reporting Results
• Log the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Positive results should include the comment: "Detected"
• Negative results should include the comment: "Not Detected"
• Any invalid or inconclusive results should prompt retesting
according to the procedure.
Reference Intervals:
• Positive: Metamycoplasma hominis detected
• Negative: Metamycoplasma hominis not detected
F) Sample Integrity
• Check for possible inhibitors or contaminants.
• If the sample integrity is in doubt, perform additional verification
steps or request a new specimen.
Critical Results:
• Critical results should be immediately communicated to the
appropriate medical personnel and documented.
Method Limitations:
Refer to the PCR kit and instrument manufacturer's instructions
regarding limitations and troubleshooting guidelines.
