Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Metanephrines, Fractionated, 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for measuring the levels of
fractionated metanephrines (metanephrine and
normetanephrine) in 24-hour urine samples. Accurate
measurement of these analytes is essential for diagnosing and
monitoring the treatment of catecholamine-secreting tumors
such as pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: The specimen required is a 24-
hour urine collection.
Acceptable Specimen:
◦ 24-hour urine collection with 30 mL aliquot provided in a
clean container.
◦ The collection should be refrigerated during the collection
period and sent to the laboratory within 2 hours after
completion.
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Incompletely or improperly collected 24-hour urine samples.
◦ Specimens stored at room temperature for prolonged
periods.
◦ Specimens with preservatives that interfere with the assay,
such as boric acid.
◦ Specimens without appropriate labeling or collection time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Chromatography instrument (HPLC or LC-MS/MS)
◦ Urine metanephrine and normetanephrine assay reagents
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Gloves, lab coats, safety glasses
4. PROCEDURE: A) Sample Preparation: 1. Verify the
completeness and proper labeling of the 24-hour urine
collection. 2. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen well by gently
swirling the container. 3. Aliquot 30 mL of the urine specimen
into a clean container. 4. Centrifuge the aliquot at 3000 RPM for
10 minutes to remove any particulate matter. 5. Transfer the
clear supernatant to a labeled specimen vial.
B) Calibration and Control: 1. Prepare calibration standards and
quality control samples according to the manufacturer's
instructions. 2. Ensure the chromatography instrument is
properly calibrated and controls are run prior to patient
samples. 3. Follow manufacturer guidelines for handling and
preparing calibration and control samples.
C) Instrument Setup: 1. Set up the chromatography instrument
according to manufacturer instructions and laboratory protocol.
2. Load prepared samples, calibration standards, and quality
control samples into the instrument. 3. Verify instrument
settings, including detection wavelengths and mobile phase
conditions. 4. Run a blank sample to ensure no carryover or
contamination.
D) Analysis: 1. Initiate the run sequence for the prepared
samples, calibration standards, and quality control materials. 2.
Monitor the run to ensure proper functioning of the instrument.
3. Record the retention times and peak areas for metanephrine
and normetanephrine. 4. Use the calibration curve to convert
peak areas into quantitative concentrations.
E) Verification and Documentation: 1. Review the instrument
output, ensuring the expected retention times and peak shapes.
2. Verify the results of the quality control samples to ensure
assay precision and accuracy. 3. Document any deviations or
issues encountered during the run. 4. Enter results into the LIS
for verification by the technologist.
5. REPORTING RESULTS: A) Verify patient results with
technologist review. B) Transmit verified results to the LIS. C)
Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines,
including reference intervals.
6. QUALITY CONTROL: A) Ensure the chromatography
instrument runs internal controls at defined intervals. B)
Document control results in the quality control log. C) Perform
troubleshooting and corrective action in the event of control
failure. D) Calibration and control material validation should be
re-performed with each new lot number or batch received.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS: A) Refer to manufacturer’s insert for
analytical limitations associated with the metanephrines assay.
B) Address issues related to interference by medications, diet,
or other substances as per manufacturer guidelines.
REFERENCE: Refer to manufacturer’s instructions and kit insert for
detailed instructions and validation criteria for metanephrine and
normetanephrine assays.
