1. PURPOSE:
This SOP aims to outline the procedure for the analysis of
Metanephrines, Fractionated, Free, Plasma in order to ensure the
accurate and timely generation of test results. This assay is crucial
for diagnosing pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, as well as for
monitoring patients with these conditions.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of Metanephrines, Fractionated, Free, Plasma testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the testing according to the
outlined procedure, document results, and ensure adherence to
the protocol.
• Supervisors: Review and verify results, provide guidance on
troubleshooting, and ensure overall compliance with this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Metanephrines: Metabolites of catecholamines, specifically
metanephrine and normetanephrine, measured in plasma to
diagnose catecholamine-secreting tumors.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection: Collect blood in an EDTA tube.
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL of plasma.
• Stability: Store plasma at -20°C if not analyzed immediately.
Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column suitable
for separation of metanephrines
• Calibrators and controls for metanephrine and normetanephrine
• Mobile phase reagents
• Sample preparation kits (e.g., protein precipitation reagents)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex Mixer
7. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the EDTA tube at 3000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma.
2. Plasma Aliquot:
◦ Transfer plasma into a clean, appropriately labeled
polypropylene tube and immediately store at -20°C if not
proceeding directly with analysis.
3. Thawing and Mixing:
◦ Thaw plasma at room temperature and vortex gently to mix
thoroughly.
4. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Add an appropriate volume of protein precipitation reagent
to a measured volume of plasma (e.g., 200 µL of plasma
and 800 µL of acetonitrile).
◦ Vortex thoroughly and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C.
5. Supernatant Transfer:
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC vial
without disturbing the pellet.
B) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Instrumentation Setup:
◦ Set up the LC-MS/MS system with the appropriate HPLC
column and mobile phase parameters.
◦ Ensure the system is calibrated and quality controls are
within the acceptable range before starting sample analysis.
2. Injection:
◦ Load the prepared plasma supernatant into the LC-MS/MS
autosampler.
◦ Inject an appropriate volume (e.g., 20 µL) for analysis.
3. Chromatographic Separation:
◦ Separate metanephrines using the prescribed HPLC
conditions (e.g., column, flow rate, gradient).
4. Mass Detection:
◦ Detect metanephrines by monitoring specific ion transitions
for metanephrine and normetanephrine.
5. Data Acquisition:
◦ Collect and process data using the LC-MS/MS software.
◦ Ensure peak integration and quantification are set according
to method validation criteria.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Internal QC:
◦ Run calibration standards and quality control samples at the
beginning and end of each batch.
◦ Ensure within-run and between-run controls are within the
acceptable range.
• External QC:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs and act on
feedback from external quality assessors.
9. RESULTS INTERPRETATION:
• Review and Verification:
◦ Interpret results using the established reference ranges.
◦ Verify results by reviewing QC data and chromatographic
outputs.
• Reporting:
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Notify the requesting clinician of any critical or abnormal
values following laboratory policy.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Instrumental Issues:
◦ Refer to LC-MS/MS instrument manual for troubleshooting
steps.
◦ Contact instrument service engineer if issues persist beyond
internal troubleshooting capabilities.
• Analytical Issues:
◦ Re-prepare samples if results fall outside of QC limits or if
chromatographic separation is inadequate.
◦ Ensure reagents and columns are within their expiration date
and properly conditioned.
11. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain records of all calibration, controls, sample runs, and any
corrective actions taken.
• Ensure traceability of results back to original samples through
proper labeling and documentation.
