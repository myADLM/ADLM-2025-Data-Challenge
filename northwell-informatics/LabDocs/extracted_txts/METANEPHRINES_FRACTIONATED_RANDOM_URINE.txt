Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Metanephrines, Fractionated, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of fractionated
metanephrines in random urine samples to ensure accurate and
consistent test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of
metanephrines, fractionated, random urine samples in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to perform
the procedure as outlined and report any deviations or issues to the
supervisor.
4. SPECIMENS
4.1 Acceptable Specimens
• Freshly collected random urine
• Urine specimens without preservatives and delivered to the
laboratory within 24 hours of collection
• Specimens stored at 2-8°C to avoid degradation until analysis
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection
• Urine specimens with visible contamination or improper labeling
• Specimens that have been improperly stored above or below the
specified temperature range prior to delivery

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls
1. Prepare calibration standards: according to manufacturer
instructions, ensuring concentration levels encompass the
expected range in patient samples.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples: using known
concentrations traceable to certified reference materials.
3. Store calibration and QC materials: at 2-8°C until ready for
use.
6.2 Sample Preparation
1. Aliquot 1-2 mL of urine: into a labeled centrifuge tube.
2. Centrifuge the sample: at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
3. Pipette the supernatant: into a clean, labeled sample vial.
4. Adjust the pH if necessary: to within the pH range suitable for
HPLC analysis (typically pH 4-7).
6.3 System Preparation
1. Turn on the HPLC system: and the electrochemical detector.
Allow the system to equilibrate according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Prime the HPLC pump: with the mobile phase to ensure no air
bubbles are present in the system.
3. Run a blank sample: to ensure system stability and to check
for any carryover or contamination.
4. Inject calibration standards: and verify the linearity and
accuracy of the calibration curve.
6.4 Sample Analysis
1. Inject 20 µL of sample: or an appropriate volume according to
the HPLC system setup.
2. Run the samples, calibration standards, and QC materials:
through the HPLC as per the validated method.
3. Record retention times and peak areas: for metanephrine
and normetanephrine.
6.5 Data Analysis
1. Process the chromatograms: using the HPLC system’s
software to quantify metanephrine and normetanephrine levels
in each sample.
2. Compare results: of patient specimens to the calibration curve
to determine concentration.
3. Evaluate QC results: to ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
6.6 Reporting Results
1. Review results: for each patient sample for accuracy and
completeness.
2. Report findings: in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Flag any critical values: following laboratory protocols and
inform the supervising clinician if necessary.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run QC samples: at the beginning, during, and at the end of
each analysis batch.
2. Verify that QC results: fall within established limits before
accepting any patient results.
3. Document any deviations: from the acceptable ranges and
initiate appropriate corrective actions.
8. MAINTENANCE
8.1 HPLC System Maintenance
1. Clean and maintain the HPLC and detector: according to the
manufacturer’s maintenance schedule.
2. Record all maintenance activities: in the instrument logbook.
