Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Metanephrines with 3-Methoxytyramine,
24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedure for the quantification of
metanephrines and 3-methoxytyramine in a 24-hour urine collection
to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the laboratory personnel responsible for
the analysis of metanephrines and 3-methoxytyramine using the
specified analytical methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP and
ensuring accurate documentation and handling of samples
throughout the analytical process. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to this SOP and addressing any deviations.
4. DEFINITIONS
Metanephrines: Metabolites of catecholamines (e.g., norepinephrine
and epinephrine) used for diagnosing and monitoring
pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. 3-Methoxytyramine: A
metabolite of dopamine, also used in diagnosing specific sympathetic
nervous system tumors.
5. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STORAGE
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine, preserved with acid if required by
the specific method.
• Volume: Minimum of 200 mL, prefer full 24-hour collection.
• Acceptable: Properly labeled and timely delivered specimens
within the specified storage conditions.
• Unacceptable: Urine not preserved according to the method
requirements or specimens received more than 72 hours after the
end of the collection period.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
• Calibrators and controls specific to metanephrines and 3-
methoxytyramine
• Mobile phase reagents
• Specific derivatizing reagents for urine sample processing
• Appropriate column per manufacturer's specifications
• Internal standards
• Glassware, pipettes, and necessary supplies for urine preparation
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls according to
manufacturer instructions appropriate for the detection method.
2. Verify stock solutions and dilute accordingly to establish
working standards.
3. Store standards and controls according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Sample Receipt and Logging:
◦ Record specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Ensure the 24-hour urine collection is homogenous - mix
well.
◦ Aliquot a portion of the urine for analysis, typically 5-10 mL.
2. Initial Processing:
◦ Acidify the aliquot if required (refer to the kit or method
guidelines).
◦ Utilize solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges if specified
for pre-analytical processing.
3. Derivatization:
◦ Add derivatization agents to the urine samples per the
method protocol.
◦ Incubate samples as necessary to complete the reaction.
4. Internal Standards Addition:
◦ Spike each specimen, calibrator, and quality control sample
with the appropriate internal standard.
C. Chromatographic Analysis
1. HPLC/LC-MS Preparation:
◦ Ensure the columns are properly conditioned.
◦ Prepare the mobile phase and set up the HPLC/LC-MS
system.
2. Injection:
◦ Load prepared samples, calibrators, and quality controls
onto the auto-sampler.
◦ Inject a specified volume (e.g., 20 μL) of each sample into
the HPLC/LC-MS.
3. Separation and Detection:
◦ Follow the chromatographic run conditions specified by the
method (e.g., gradient elution).
◦ Set detection parameters for metanephrines and 3-
methoxytyramine.
4. Data Acquisition:
◦ Utilize software for acquiring and analyzing data.
◦ Ensure adequate resolution and peak identification.
8. RESULT CALCULATION AND VALIDATION
1. Quantification:
◦ Generate calibration curves using known standards.
◦ Calculate concentration of metanephrines and 3-
methoxytyramine in patient samples based on the
calibration curve.
◦ Integrate peaks and apply appropriate corrections using
internal standards.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Evaluate quality control samples’ results to ensure they fall
within expected ranges.
◦ Re-run analysis if QC samples fall outside acceptable
ranges.
3. Result Verification:
◦ All results should be reviewed by a qualified technologist.
◦ Flag any results that are outside of the reference range or
require further review.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the LIS.
◦ Maintain thorough documentation of the analytical run,
including standard and control results.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Reference intervals should be applied to determine normal
versus abnormal results.
◦ Provide flagged interpretations for abnormal results.
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Routine checks:
◦ Perform regular maintenance on analytical equipment.
◦ Engage in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons.
2. Record Keeping:
◦ Archive all relevant data, logs, and maintenance records as
per regulatory standards.
11. LIMITATIONS
• Artifacts caused by improper sample storage, handling, or
preparation.
• Instrumentation calibration and performance are critical to
accurate results – follow manufacturer protocols.
