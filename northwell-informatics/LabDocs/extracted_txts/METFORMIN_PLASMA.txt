Standard Operating Procedure
Metformin, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the measurement of
Metformin concentration in plasma samples using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all samples received in the laboratory that
require testing for Metformin concentrations.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying out this
procedure in accordance with the outlined steps and for ensuring
quality and accuracy in results. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for reviewing and verifying results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Specimen Collection: 4 mL of whole blood should be collected in
a green-top (lithium heparin) vacutainer tube.
• Specimen Handling: After collection, the specimen should be
gently inverted to mix with the anticoagulant and centrifuged at
1500-2000 g for 10 minutes at room temperature. Plasma should
be separated and transferred to a labeled polypropylene tube
promptly.
• Storage: Plasma specimens can be stored at 2-8°C if analysis will
be performed within 24 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at
-20°C or below.

6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen integrity and labeling against
corresponding requisition forms.
2. Centrifuge blood samples at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma for analysis.
3. Transfer the plasma to new labeled polypropylene tubes.
4. If not analyzed immediately, store samples at 2-8°C (up to 24
hours) or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
Analytical Procedure
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Samples:
◦ Prepare calibration standards and QC samples in the same
matrix as patient samples, using known concentrations of
Metformin.
◦ Both samples and standards should be subjected to the
same preparation steps.
2. Sample Preparation for HPLC:
◦ Add an equal volume of internal standard solution and
vortex to mix.
◦ Filter the sample through a 0.22 µm syringe filter into HPLC
vials.
3. HPLC Analysis:
◦ Set up the HPLC system with a suitable C18 column, and
equilibrate with the mobile phase.
◦ Inject 20 µL of sample onto the column.
◦ Use a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a UV detection wavelength
of approximately 233 nm.
◦ Run a gradient or isocratic method as validated for
Metformin separation.
4. Data Collection and Integration:
◦ Identify the Metformin and internal standard peaks by their
retention times.
◦ Calculate the concentrations of Metformin in patient
samples using the calibration curve generated from the
standards.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Analyze QC samples with each batch of patient samples to
ensure accuracy and precision.
◦ Review QC results to meet acceptance criteria before
reporting the patient sample results.
◦ QC results should fall within ±15% of the nominal
concentration.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure
continuous external quality validation.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all data for each analytical batch.
2. Verify that QC samples are within acceptable limits.
3. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review by a supervisor.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the laboratory-specific reference ranges for Metformin, which
typically range from 0.1 to 1.0 µg/mL in patients on therapeutic
doses. These ranges may vary based on the calibration and local
population data.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Metformin concentrations outside of measurable range need to be
diluted and reanalyzed. Assess all samples for the possibility of
hemolysis or interference from other medications.
11. SAFETY AND HAZARDS
Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols, including PPE use and safe
chemical handling, according to the laboratory’s safety manual.
