Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Methadone and
Metabolites, Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of Methadone and
its metabolites (EDDP and EMDP) in serum to ensure accurate and
reproducible test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
testing and reporting of Methadone and its metabolites in serum
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this SOP
in order to ensure the accuracy and integrity of test results.
• The designated supervisor is responsible for reviewing all test
results and ensuring proper documentation.
• The Quality Assurance team is responsible for monitoring
compliance with this SOP and conducting periodic audits.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Serum
• Preferred Container: Red or gold top serum separator tube
(SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL of serum
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
5. UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin)
• Specimens with excessive hemolysis or lipemia
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or lack collection date/
time
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Methadone, EDDP, and EMDP standards
• Calibrators and control materials
• Sample preparation kits (e.g., serum extraction kits)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verify specimen compliance with acceptance criteria.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
3. Transfer 2 mL of serum to a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
B. Extraction
1. Follow the sample preparation kit instructions for serum
extraction.
2. Add the appropriate volume of extraction solution to the serum
sample.
3. Vortex the tube for 30 seconds.
4. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet any particulate
matter.
5. Transfer supernatant to a clean, labeled vial.
C. Instrument Setup
1. Perform initial instrument calibration using methadone, EDDP,
and EMDP standards.
2. Prepare calibrators and run them according to the instrument's
user manual.
3. Perform instrument QC checks using control materials.
D. Analysis
1. Load prepared serum samples onto the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
instrument.
2. Run samples according to the established method parameters.
◦ Injection volume: 10 µL
◦ Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min
◦ Detector settings: appropriate wavelengths for methadone
and its metabolites
3. Analyze chromatograms and mass spectra for peaks
corresponding to methadone, EDDP, and EMDP.
E. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the results against calibrators and control samples.
2. Quantify methadone, EDDP, and EMDP concentrations using
calibration curves.
3. Ensure all controls are within acceptable limits.
4. Document any anomalies and take corrective actions as
necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification.
2. The technologist will review the results for accuracy and
completeness.
3. Critical values, if any, will be immediately communicated to the
ordering physician as per laboratory policy.
4. Verify and release results according to site-specific guidelines.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC: Perform daily checks with QC materials for
Methadone, EDDP, and EMDP.
• Comparison Studies: Conduct monthly inter-instrument
comparison studies to ensure consistency between instruments.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's inserts for Methadone, EDDP, and EMDP
analyzers.
• Laboratory Quality Management System (QMS) protocols.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC checks, and corrective
actions.
• Store all chromatograms and mass spectra for future reference
and audit purposes.
12. TRAINING
All laboratory personnel performing this procedure must undergo
training and demonstrate proficiency as per laboratory training
protocols.
13. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change in
methodology or instrumentation.
