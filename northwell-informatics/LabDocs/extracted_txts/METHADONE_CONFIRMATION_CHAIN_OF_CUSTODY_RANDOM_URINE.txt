SOP for Methadone Confirmation, Chain of Custody, Random,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for Methadone Confirmation tests, ensuring the integrity and
accuracy of results while maintaining strict adherence to the chain of
custody for random urine samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the duty of all laboratory personnel to follow this procedure to
ensure accurate and reliable results, while maintaining the integrity of
the chain of custody.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Methadone Confirmation: A specific test to confirm the presence
of methadone in a urine sample.
• Chain of Custody: A documented process that tracks the
handling and storage of a sample from collection to reporting of
results.
• Random Urine: A urine sample collected at a non-scheduled time
to prevent predictability.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Receipt and Documentation
◦ Ensure that all received samples are properly documented
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Verify that the chain of custody form is complete and that
the sample container is properly labeled with unique
identifiers matching the requisition form.
2. Initial Inspection
◦ Inspect the sample for proper volume (minimum 30 mL
required) and any signs of tampering or damage.
◦ Ensure the sample is at an appropriate temperature range
(32-38°C) if required to confirm recent collection.
B. Sample Aliquoting
1. Aliquot Preparation
◦ Gently mix the urine sample to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Using a new pipette tip, aliquot 5 mL of urine into a labeled
specimen tube designated for methadone confirmation
testing. Ensure the label includes sample ID, date, and time
of aliquoting.
◦ Retain the original sample under properly controlled storage
conditions.
2. Chain of Custody Documentation
◦ Record all aliquoting activities on the chain of custody form,
including the date, time, and technician’s initials.
C. Methadone Confirmation Testing
1. Reagents and Equipment
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within the expiration date and
have been stored under proper conditions.
◦ Use a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) system for the confirmation test.
◦ Perform daily calibration and QC checks on the instrument
following manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Testing Protocol
◦ Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples.
◦ Load the samples, standards, and controls onto the
instrument.
◦ Run the analysis according to the established method for
methadone confirmation.
◦ Review the preliminary results to ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
D. Result Analysis and Reporting
1. Data Review
◦ Verify that all quality control samples and standards are
within acceptable limits before proceeding with sample
result analysis.
◦ Review chromatograms/mass spectra for each sample to
confirm the presence of methadone, using retention time
and fragmentation patterns as criteria.
2. Calculation and Validation
◦ Quantify the concentration of methadone in the sample.
◦ Validate results by comparing with control samples and
repeat analysis if any discrepancies are found.
3. Reporting
◦ Record the final confirmed concentration of methadone in
the sample.
◦ Enter the results into the LIS, ensuring they are matched to
the correct patient and sample ID.
◦ Deliver the results to the authorized personnel, maintaining
the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
E. Quality Control and Maintenance
1. Quality Control Samples
◦ Include positive and negative controls with every batch of
samples analyzed.
◦ Ensure control results are within specified ranges before
accepting batch results.
2. Instrument Maintenance
◦ Perform routine maintenance on the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
systems as recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Document all maintenance activities in the instrument
logbook.
F. Storage and Disposal
1. Sample Storage
◦ Store all tested samples at 2-8°C for a minimum of 1 week
post-analysis to allow for potential re-testing or verification.
◦ Ensure chain of custody documentation continues to be
updated with storage and handling details.
2. Disposal
◦ Dispose of all samples and material used in the analysis
(e.g., pipette tips, vials) following the laboratory's biohazard
disposal procedures.

6. REVISION AND APPROVAL
This SOP shall be reviewed annually or as required by regulatory
changes and approved by the Laboratory Director. Revisions will be
documented, and updated versions will be disseminated to all
relevant laboratory staff.
