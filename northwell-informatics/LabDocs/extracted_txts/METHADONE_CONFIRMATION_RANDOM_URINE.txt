Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Methadone
Confirmation, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE: To provide detailed instructions for the analytical
phase of generating results for Methadone Confirmation using
random urine specimens in the laboratory.
2. DEFINITIONS:
Methadone: A synthetic opioid used for pain management and as
part of drug addiction detoxification and maintenance programs.
Confirmation Testing: A specific, definitive test typically using Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to confirm
the presence and concentration of substances identified by initial
screening tests.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 30 mL of random urine collected in a clean, unpreserved
container.
• Ensure the sample is properly labeled with patient identification,
date, and time of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in containers with preservatives.
• Specimens without patient identification or collection information.
• Specimens received more than 72 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• GC-MS or LC-MS/MS instrument
• Urine sample containers
• Standard laboratory glassware (vials, pipettes, etc.)
• Calibration standards and control samples
• Methadone reference standard
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid) for
LC-MS/MS
• Derivatization reagents for GC-MS (if applicable)
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation
1. Recording and Storage:
◦ Upon receipt, log the specimen into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) with the patient's details and
accession number.
◦ Store the urine sample at 2-8°C if analysis is not immediate.
2. Sample Aliquoting:
◦ Mix the urine specimen thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot a sufficient volume (typically 1-2 mL) of the urine
sample into a clean, appropriately labeled vial.
◦ For GC-MS, derivatize the aliquot according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, if required.
B. Instrument Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS instrument according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines using methadone calibration
standards.
◦ Ensure calibration covers the expected range of methadone
concentrations in patient samples.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control (QC) samples, including negative,
low positive, and high positive controls with each batch of
specimens.
◦ Verify QC results fall within the predetermined acceptance
criteria before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Running Samples:
◦ Load the prepared sample vials and QC samples onto the
instrument’s autosampler.
◦ Initiate the analysis phase according to the analysis method
specific to the instrument (e.g., LC-MS/MS method for
methadone).
2. Instrument-Specific Analysis:
◦ For LC-MS/MS: a. Use a reversed-phase column. b. Mobile
phase: Typically a gradient with acetonitrile and water, both
containing 0.1% formic acid. c. Injection volume: 5-10 µL. d.
Run time: ~10-15 minutes.
◦ For GC-MS: a. Derivatize the sample if needed. b. Use a
capillary column appropriate for methadone. c. Carrier gas:
Helium. d. Injection volume: 1-2 µL. e. Run time: ~10-20
minutes.
3. Data Acquisition and Review:
◦ Collect the data generated by the instrument.
◦ Review chromatograms/mass spectra to confirm the
presence and concentration of methadone.
◦ Verify peak retention times and mass spectral patterns
match the methadone reference standard.
D. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Interpret results based on the calibration curve and
instrument response.
◦ Confirm methadone presence only if it meets the criteria
(e.g., retention time, ion ratio).
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document the methadone concentration in the LIS.
◦ Attach instrument printouts and chromatograms/mass
spectra to the patient record.
3. Review and Verification:
◦ Have results reviewed by a qualified laboratory scientist.
◦ Verify results before reporting, ensuring QC criteria have
been met.
4. Reporting Results:
◦ Report methadone concentration in the final patient lab
report.
◦ Include any comments on sample quality or deviations
encountered during analysis.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Maintain thorough records of calibration, QC results, and
maintenance logs.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for methadone
confirmation.
• Periodically review and update SOPs and ensure compliance with
regulatory requirements.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS instruments.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards and guidelines.
• Operator’s manuals for reference standards and reagents.
