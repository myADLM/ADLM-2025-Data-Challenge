Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Methadone, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized method for the
analysis of methadone in urine specimens. This document outlines
the procedures for preparing samples, operating equipment,
interpreting results, and maintaining quality control to ensure reliable
and accurate testing.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform
methadone testing in accordance with this SOP, document all
findings, and implement corrective actions when necessary.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to procedures
and addressing any issues that may arise during testing.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: 30 mL freshly voided urine, collected in a
sterile container.
• Specimens should be sent to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection.
• Unacceptable: Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24
hours after collection, specimens without collection date/time
indicated, or specimens that are improperly stored or transported.
Note: Refrigerate urine specimens at 2-8°C when not analyzed
immediately and bring to room temperature prior to analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine collection containers
• Methadone ELISA kit or equivalent immunoassay platform
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge (if required)
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Incubator (if applicable)
• Disposable gloves
• Calibrators and control materials (negative and positive)
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Handling:
1. Verify the specimen integrity and ensure proper labeling.
2. Bring the specimen to room temperature if refrigerated.
3. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by vortexing for 5 seconds.
B) Methadone Testing Using ELISA Kit:
1. Set up the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add appropriate controls, calibrators, and patient specimens to
designated wells.
◦ Ensure that volumes and placement match the kit
instructions.
3. Follow the incubation and washing steps as specified in the
ELISA kit insert.
◦ Incubate samples for the specified time at the appropriate
temperature.
◦ Wash steps should be repeated as instructed to remove
unbound substances.
4. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate as specified.
5. Stop the reaction with the stopping solution provided.
6. Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at the
wavelength specified in the manufacturer’s protocol.
C) Result Interpretation:
1. Compare the sample absorbance values to the calibrators to
determine methadone concentration.
2. Record the results on the appropriate worksheet or
electronically.
3. Review the control results to ensure assay validity (QC must fall
within established criteria).
Note: If control results fall outside of acceptable ranges, repeat
the assay. Document and follow troubleshooting steps as
necessary.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Materials:
• External controls (negative and positive)
• Methadone ELISA kit internal controls
B) Frequency:
• Run daily controls at the start of every batch of specimens.
• Monthly, bi-weekly, or with each new lot of ELISA kits.
C) Procedure:
1. Prepare controls according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Include controls in the assay run as per the kit protocol.
3. Record readings and compare against expected ranges.
4. If controls are out of acceptable ranges, investigate and re-test
if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be generated according to established guidelines
and reviewed by the technologist before releasing to the LIS
system.
• Positive methadone results need to be verified and possibly
retested depending on clinical protocol.
• Document all findings, anomalies, and corrective actions in the
laboratory information management system.

8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the methadone ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related
to interference, cross-reactivity, and sensitivity.
This protocol ensures accurate and reliable methadone urine testing
through standardized procedures and appropriate quality controls.
Ensure all staff members are trained on this SOP and that it is
regularly reviewed and updated as needed.
