Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Methaqualone Confirmation, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To confirm the presence of methaqualone in urine specimens using
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).
1. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all methaqualone confirmation tests
performed in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform,
document, and report the methaqualone confirmation test as
described in this SOP. All personnel must ensure that they follow the
procedure accurately, maintain records, and ensure quality control.
1. SPECIMEN
4.1 Specimen Type: Urine 4.2 Collection: a. Freshly collected urine
samples are preferred. b. Urine should be collected in a clean, dry,
plastic container.
4.3 Specimen Storage: a. Store specimens at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately. b. If longer storage is needed, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment: a. GC-MS system b. Centrifuge c. Volumetric pipettes
d. Analytical balances e. Vortex mixer
5.2 Reagents: a. Methaqualone standard b. Internal standard (e.g.,
deuterated methaqualone, if available) c. Extraction solvent (e.g.,
ethyl acetate) d. Derivatizing agent (if applicable) e. Calibration
standards
5.3 Supplies: a. Sample vials and caps b. Glass pipettes c. GC-MS
columns and consumables
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation: a. Upon receipt, document the specimen
information. b. Mix the urine specimen well and aliquot 5-10 mL into a
labeled centrifuge tube.
6.2 Extraction: a. Add internal standard to the urine specimen and
vortex to mix. b. Perform liquid-liquid extraction by adding an
appropriate volume of extraction solvent. c. Vortex the mixture for 1-2
minutes to ensure thorough extraction. d. Centrifuge the mixture at
3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the layers. e. Carefully remove
the organic layer and transfer to a clean vial for analysis.
6.3 Preparation of Calibration Standards: a. Prepare calibration
standards by spiking control urine with known concentrations of
methaqualone. b. Treat calibration standards in the same manner as
the specimens.
6.4 GC-MS Analysis: a. Load the prepared samples and calibration
standards into the GC-MS auto sampler. b. Program the GC-MS for
methaqualone analysis with the following parameters (example): i.
Injection temperature: 250°C ii. Oven temperature program: Initial:
100°C, hold for 2 min Ramp: 10°C/min to 280°C, hold for 10 min iii.
Carrier gas: Helium, flow rate: 1.0 mL/min iv. Ionization: Electron
ionization or other appropriate settings v. Mass range: Selected ion
monitoring (SIM) for methaqualone and internal standard ions. c. Run
the GC-MS sequence and acquire data.
6.5 Data Analysis: a. Integrate and quantify the peaks corresponding
to methaqualone and internal standards. b. Compare the sample
results to the calibration curve to determine methaqualone
concentration. c. Verify that all quality control (QC) samples meet
acceptance criteria.
6.6 Reporting Results: a. Document all raw data and calculations. b.
Review and verify results for accuracy and completeness. c. Report
results according to site-specific guidelines. d. If methaqualone is
detected above the threshold limit, confirm by second tier analysis if
required.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Perform QC with each batch of specimens, including: a. Positive
controls b. Negative controls c. Internal standards
7.2 QC results must fall within acceptable ranges prior to reporting
patient results.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
8.1 Handle all biological specimens with universal precautions. 8.2
Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses. 8.3 Follow all chemical safety
guidelines for handling and disposal of solvents and reagents.

1. DOCUMENTATION
10.1 Maintain thorough records of specimen receipt, extraction,
analysis, QC, and results. 10.2 Ensure all records are stored securely
and maintained in accordance with laboratory policies and
regulations.
