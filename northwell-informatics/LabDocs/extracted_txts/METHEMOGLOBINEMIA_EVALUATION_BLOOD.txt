Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Methemoglobinemia
Evaluation, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical protocol for generating
accurate results for methemoglobinemia evaluation from blood
specimens. Methemoglobin levels are assessed to diagnose
methemoglobinemia, a condition where hemoglobin is oxidized to
methemoglobin, resulting in impaired oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected using a blood gas syringe
or heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST).
• Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure the blood is adequately mixed to prevent clot
formation.
◦ Expel air from the syringe, remove the needle, and cap the
syringe securely.
◦ If using a capillary tube, fill completely, cap both ends, and mix
thoroughly.
• Transport the specimen immediately to the laboratory:
◦ Preferably via pneumatic tube.
◦ If transported by a staff member, place the specimen in a
plastic bag.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/
oxalate, or EDTA tubes.
◦ Evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g., Vacutainers or
Microtainers).
◦ Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10% of specimen
volume).
◦ Specimens with needles attached.
◦ Specimens that have clotted.
◦ Blood collected in a Microtainer (not acceptable for
methemoglobin analysis).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ABL 90 blood gas analyzer or equivalent.
• Heparinized blood gas syringe or heparinized vacutainer (dark
green or PST).
• Calibrated traceable thermometer for quality assurance.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Verify the specimen is properly labeled and meets the
acceptance criteria.
2. Prepare the specimen and the analyzer for analysis:
◦ Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and quality control
measures are met.
◦ Mix the blood specimen thoroughly.
B. Methemoglobin Analysis:
1. Load the specimen into the ABL 90 blood gas analyzer.
2. Follow the analyzer's operational protocol for methemoglobin
quantification.
3. Ensure the analyzer settings and parameters are within
acceptable ranges.
C. Quality Control:
1. Apply internal quality control measures as per the ABL 90
protocols.
2. Analyze three levels of quality control material according to the
automated schedule.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during testing.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and review results on the LIS interface.
• Automatically transmit valid results to ensure integrity and
accuracy.
• If sample integrity is questionable, centrifuge an aliquot to check
for issues such as hemolysis.
Critical Results:
• Follow the established policy for reporting critical values.
• Document communication of critical results properly.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ABL 90 analyzer's product insert for individual analyte
limitations.

8. ADDITIONAL NOTES
Ensure proper documentation of all steps and results in the
laboratory's information system, adhering to CLIA certification
standards and regulatory guidelines. Regularly update staff on any
changes to protocols or equipment.
This protocol ensures the reliable and accurate assessment of
methemoglobin levels for diagnosing methemoglobinemia while
adhering to rigorous quality standards and procedures.
