1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide clear and standardized
instructions for the analysis and interpretation of methemoglobinemia
levels in blood specimens. This protocol ensures accurate detection
and measurement of methemoglobin to aid in the diagnosis and
management of methemoglobinemia.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of blood samples for the measurement of methemoglobin
levels using the designated analytical instruments in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow this
procedure accurately to ensure that methemoglobin measurements
are precise and reliable. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to the procedure and addressing any issues that arise
during the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
a) Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Blood gas syringe containing either low concentration or balanced
lithium heparin.
• Heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST).
b) Specimen Handling:
• After specimen procurement, expel air in contact with the blood
specimen, remove the needle, cap the syringe, and adequately
mix the blood.
• Store and transport specimens at room temperature and analyze
promptly to minimize changes in methemoglobin levels.
c) Unacceptable Specimens:
• Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, and EDTA specimens.
• Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10%), needles attached,
or that have clotted.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a) Equipment:
• A blood gas analyzer capable of measuring methemoglobin levels
(e.g., ABL 90).
• Heparinized syringes and vacutainers.
b) Reagents:
• Low concentration or balanced lithium heparin as anticoagulant.
c) Supplies:
• Blood gas syringes
• Heparinized vacutainers
1. PROCEDURE
a) Blood Collection and Preparation:
1. Collect blood into a heparinized syringe or vacutainer to prevent
clotting.
2. Expel any air from the syringe, remove the needle, cap the
syringe, and mix the specimen thoroughly.
3. Label the specimen with the appropriate patient identification
information.
b) Measurement:
1. Ensure the blood gas analyzer is properly calibrated and quality
control checks have been performed.
2. Load the specimen into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Initiate the analysis and wait for the completion of the
measurement cycle.
4. Review the analyzer output for methemoglobin levels and any
error codes.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
a) Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze three levels of quality control material (low, medium, and
high) according to the set schedule.
• Record and assess the quality control results. If any quality
control results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot the
analyzer and re-run the quality control tests.
b) External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs for methemoglobin
measurement as required.
1. LIMITATIONS
Refer to the blood gas analyzer's manufacturer's insert for limitations
specific to methemoglobin measurements.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a) Review the results for methemoglobin and other parameters. b)
Verify the results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System) and
ensure they are transmitted accurately. c) Notify the responsible
clinician of critically high methemoglobin levels as per the laboratory’s
critical values policy.
1. CRITICAL VALUES
a) Critical methemoglobin levels: ≥15%
• Immediately report critical values to the clinician in charge of the
patient.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the analyzer’s operator manual and manufacturer’s package
insert for detailed instructions and additional information on
methemoglobin measurement and limitations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
a) Record all relevant information in the laboratory's quality control
logs and patient result records. b) Document any corrective actions
taken in response to quality control issues or instrument errors.
This protocol is effective as of [Date] and will be reviewed and
updated annually or as necessary to ensure compliance with industry
standards and best practices.
