Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Methemoglobin and Sulfhemoglobin, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedure for generating accurate and
reliable results for Methemoglobin and Sulfhemoglobin in blood
specimens. This SOP ensures consistency in testing to aid in the
diagnosis and management of conditions such as
methemoglobinemia and sulfhemoglobinemia.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists and medical laboratory
scientists are responsible for performing the tests according to this
SOP and documenting all necessary information. It is the
responsibility of the supervisory staff to ensure that all trained
personnel adhere to this protocol and address any issues related to
deviations or instrument failures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Heparinized whole blood (dark green top
tube or PST).
• Volume: At least 1 mL of whole blood.
• Stability: Specimens should be analyzed as soon as possible after
collection. If immediate analysis is not possible, specimens must
be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Clotted specimens, specimens with
significant air bubbles, and specimens that have been collected in
tubes other than heparinized tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Oximeter or blood gas analyzer capable of measuring
Methemoglobin and Sulfhemoglobin
• Heparinized syringes or Vacutainers
• Calibration gas or liquid standards as specified by the instrument
manufacturer
• Quality control materials (3 levels covering low, normal, and high
ranges)
• Laboratory gloves and PPE
• Biohazard waste containers
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control: Run three levels of quality control
material (low, normal, high) at the beginning of each shift and
after maintenance or calibration events. Document results and
ensure they fall within acceptable limits.
• Calibration: Perform daily calibration using calibration materials as
per the manufacturer’s guidelines. Calibrate after major
maintenance or any other event that may affect the instrument's
performance.
Procedure:
1. EQUIPMENT SETUP a. Ensure the blood gas analyzer is
powered on and has completed its self-check. b. Verify that the
analyzer has been calibrated and internal quality control checks
have been performed. c. Ensure that all necessary reagents are
available and not expired.
2. SPECIMEN PREPARATION a. Confirm specimen integrity
(properly labeled, no clots, minimal air bubbles). b. Mix the
specimen thoroughly (e.g., gentle inversion 10-15 times).
3. ANALYSIS a. Load the specimen into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. b. Ensure there are no air bubbles
in the sample line. c. Start the analysis and allow the analyzer
to run the specimen.
4. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW a. Print or electronically
store the results from the analyzer. b. Review results for any
error codes or flags. Troubleshoot any issues following the
manufacturer's guidelines. c. Compare the patient’s results with
the quality control results to ensure accuracy.
5. REPORTING RESULTS a. Transmit results to the LIS
(Laboratory Information System). b. Verify and validate the
results in the LIS. c. For critical values, follow the laboratory’s
critical value notification policy.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING a. Error Codes: Refer to the instrument
manual or troubleshooting guide. Repeat the analysis if
necessary. b. Calibration Failure: Recalibrate the analyzer,
repeat the quality control checks, and re-run the samples. c.
Quality Control Failure: Follow the laboratory’s SOP for quality
control failures - typically involving identifying the source of the
deviation, resolving the issue, and rechecking controls before
analyzing patient samples.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results may be affected by the presence of other hemoglobin
variants.
• Extremely high levels of bilirubin or lipemia may interfere with the
accuracy of results.
