Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Methemoglobin, Arterial, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable determination of methemoglobin
levels in arterial blood samples.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all arterial blood samples received for
methemoglobin determination.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All technologists and laboratory staff processing and analyzing
samples for methemoglobin are responsible for implementing this
SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Methemoglobin: An oxidized form of hemoglobin that is unable to
bind oxygen effectively, potentially leading to methemoglobinemia.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment:
• Blood gas analyzer capable of measuring methemoglobin (e.g.,
ABL 90 analyzer).
• Traceable thermometer (for checking the temperature of
equipment if required).
• Centrifuge (for specimen integrity checks if required).
• Lab timer.
5.2 Reagents:
• Quality control materials (three levels as provided by the vendor).
• Calibrators as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Internal control materials specific for methemoglobin analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
6.1 Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen: Arterial blood collected in a blood gas
syringe containing low concentration or balanced lithium heparin.
• Ensure no air contamination by removing any visible air bubbles.
6.2 Specimen Handling:
• Samples must be transported to the lab immediately after
collection.
• If transported via pneumatic tube, ensure the specimen is placed
in a plastic bag.
• Reject samples if received in inappropriate containers, contain
significant air bubbles (>10%), or exhibit clotting.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Sample Preparation:
• Upon receipt, confirm the sample integrity by checking for the
presence of clots or air bubbles.
• If necessary, centrifuge a small aliquot to verify the absence of
hemolysis or other integrity issues.
7.2 Analyzer Setup:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the setup of the ABL 90
analyzer.
• Perform quality control checks with control materials before
patient samples are analyzed.
• Ensure that the analyzer is properly calibrated and within
operational parameters.
7.3 Analysis:
• Load the specimen into the analyzer ensuring the warming cycle
is complete if the analyzer is in standby.
• Initiate the analysis cycle as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Monitor the analysis ensuring the analyzer runs within referenced
tolerances.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
8.1 Quality Control:
• Analyze three levels of quality control materials daily (before
running patient samples) to ensure accuracy.
• Repeat analysis if any QC result falls outside acceptance criteria
and resolve issues before proceeding.
8.2 Instrument Validation:
• Validate new solution packs or sensor cassettes as per the SOP
(see Equipment Protocol) before using them for patient samples.
8.3 Intralab Comparison:
• Bi-weekly, perform a sample comparison using blood gas syringes
on multiple analyzers and record findings for consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
9.1 Review and Verification:
• Ensure results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Review analyzer messages and sample integrity indicators before
verifying results.
• Any discrepancies or error codes should be resolved by repeating
the test or using another analyzer.
9.2 Critical Results:
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider immediately of any
critical high methemoglobin levels (>10%) and document the
communication per laboratory policy.
9.3 Sample Integrity:
• If sample integrity is in question, document issues and report
results with appropriate comments for clinical interpretation.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Record all data (temperatures, control and patient results,
calibrations, equipment maintenance) in the laboratory information
system (LIS) or on appropriate log sheets ensuring all documentation
is clear, accurate, and maintained as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for ABL 90 analyzer.
• Internal laboratory quality control guidelines and policy.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and standards for methemoglobin
testing.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as needed based
on operational changes, updated equipment, or procedural
modifications.
