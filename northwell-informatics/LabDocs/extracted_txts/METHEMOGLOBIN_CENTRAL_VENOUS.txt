Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Determination of Methemoglobin, Central Venous Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for analyzing methemoglobin
levels in central venous blood samples using the established
methodology in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the methemoglobin analysis according to this SOP and
ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Central venous blood collected using a
blood gas syringe or a heparinized vacutainer (dark green).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/
oxalate, EDTA specimens, specimens with greater than a 10%
proportion of air bubbles, specimens with the needle attached,
clotted specimens, and microtainers.
• Note: The syringe must be free of air bubbles, the needle must be
removed after collection, and the sample must be capped and
properly mixed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ABL90 FLEX Blood Gas Analyzer
• Quality Control Materials (three levels)
• Heparinized blood gas syringes or heparinized vacutainer tubes
(dark green)
• Pneumatic tube or transportation worker for specimen transport
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Collection and Preparation
• Verify the sample integrity upon receipt. Ensure the sample meets
the acceptable specimen requirements outlined above.
• If the specimen is heparinized venous blood, ensure proper
mixing by gently inverting the sample 8-10 times.
• Check for any visible clots or air bubbles. If large air bubbles
(>10%) or clots are present, reject the sample, and request a new
one.
4.2 Equipment Preparation
• Ensure the ABL90 FLEX analyzer is calibrated and has passed
quality control checks. If quality control fails for any analyte,
refrain from using the instrument until it has been recalibrated and
passed the QC checks.
4.3 Analysis
• Enter the patient information into the ABL90 FLEX analyzer.
• Position the blood gas syringe or vacutainer tube into the
analyzer's sample port.
• Initiate the analysis by selecting the appropriate test panel that
includes methemoglobin.
• Allow the analyzer to process the sample. The processing time
may vary but is typically within a few minutes.
4.4 Quality Control
• Perform internal quality control according to the set schedule:
three levels of control material should be analyzed automatically
by the ABL90 FLEX.
• Record the QC results. If QC results fall outside the acceptable
limits, investigate and take corrective actions before processing
patient samples.
4.5 Result Interpretation
• Review the results generated by the ABL90 FLEX analyzer for
validity.
• Any results marked with "?" or accompanied by an error message
should be validated by reanalyzing the sample or conducting a
troubleshooting protocol.
• For methemoglobin levels, ensure the results fall within the
expected physiological range for interpretation.
• Critical results should be prioritized for reporting as per laboratory
policy.
4.6 Reporting Results
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS), where they must be reviewed and
verified by the laboratory technologist.
• Report any critical methemoglobin results immediately following
the laboratory's reporting guidelines.
1. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Document all results, including any quality control checks and
corrective actions taken during the analysis.
• If a methemoglobin result is critical, ensure that it is
communicated promptly to the healthcare provider as per the
critical results protocol.

interpretation
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, air bubbles, and excessive clotting can interfere with
accurate measurement.
• Refer to the ABL90 FLEX analyzer manual for specific limitations
related to the methodology and analyte measurement.
