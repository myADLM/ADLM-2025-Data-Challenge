Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Methemoglobin, Pulmonary Artery
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for analyzing methemoglobin from
pulmonary artery blood samples using a blood gas analyzer in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. It ensures accurate and reliable results and
details quality control measures and reporting protocols.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring the accuracy of the results, and adhering to this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing staff and ensuring
compliance with this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Pulmonary artery blood sample.
Collection Device:
• Blood gas syringe or heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST).
Collection Procedure:
• Collect the sample in accordance with standard blood gas
collection procedures, ensuring adequate mixing and removal of
air bubbles.
• Immediate transportation to the laboratory after collection is
essential to ensure sample integrity.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with needle attached.
• Specimens significantly contaminated with air bubbles (>10% of
the specimen).
• Specimens that have clotted.
• Blood collected in Microtainer for methemoglobin analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ABL90 blood gas analyzer.
• Pneumatic tube system (preferred for transportation).
• Heparinized syringes or vacutainers.
Reagents:
• Electrolyte balanced or low concentration heparin.
• Sensor cassette and solution pack for ABL90.
Supplies:
• Capped blood gas syringes.
• Heparinized capillary tube with flea and magnet for capillary
samples.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Handling:
• Ensure the blood sample is mixed thoroughly immediately after
collection.
• Use the pneumatic tube system or transportation worker for
immediate delivery to the laboratory.
Analyzing the Sample:
• Ensure the ABL90 blood gas analyzer is calibrated, and quality
control measures are in place.
• Insert the syringe containing the blood sample into the analyzer.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for running the
methemoglobin analysis.
Quality Control:
• Perform internal quality control using three levels of QC material
scheduled automatically.
• Compare patient samples between two ABL90 analyzers monthly,
ensuring instrument stability.
• Validate new sensor cassettes and solution packs following the
established protocols.
Troubleshooting:
• Review any error messages or questionable results reported by
the analyzer.
• Repeat analysis on another analyzer if necessary.
• Consult the supervisor if unresolved issues persist.
1. RESULT REPORTING
Review and Verification:
• Results automatically transmitted to the LIS must be reviewed
and verified by the technologist.
• Report critical results following established guidelines and ensure
proper documentation.
Sample Integrity:
• Assess sample integrity by centrifuging a small aliquot if
necessary.
• Use best judgment in reporting results if sample integrity concerns
arise.
Critical Values:
• Follow guidelines for reporting critical results, including potassium
results as specified, and ensure appropriate action is taken.
• Oximetry values greater than 100% should be reported as 100%.
Data Integrity:
• Investigate and resolve issues with any printed result marked with
a "?" or message code following established troubleshooting
steps.
• Report with smart phrases if analyzer issues prevent reporting
specific analytes.
