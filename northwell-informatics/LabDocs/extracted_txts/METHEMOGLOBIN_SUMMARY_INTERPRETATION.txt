Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
for Generating Results for Methemoglobin Summary
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for generating,
interpreting, and reporting methemoglobin results during the
analytical phase in a CLIA-certified laboratory to ensure accuracy,
reliability, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
analysis according to this SOP.
• The technologist should ensure that all methemoglobin results are
accurate and reliable before reporting them.
• Any discrepancies or issues should be brought to the attention of
the supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Methemoglobin: A form of hemoglobin in which the iron in the
heme group is in the ferric (Fe³⁺) state, not the ferrous (Fe²⁺) state
of normal hemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying
capacity.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Blood gas syringe or heparinized
vacutainer (dark green or PST).
• Unacceptable Specimen: Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/
oxalate, EDTA specimens, evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g.,
Vacutainers or Microtainers), or clotted specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Blood gas analyzer capable of measuring methemoglobin levels
(e.g., ABL90 analyzer).
• Quality control materials.
• Calibrated thermometers to ensure specimen integrity during
transport.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Specimen Collection and Handling
◦ Collect blood using a blood gas syringe or heparinized
vacutainer.
◦ Ensure all air is expelled, remove the needle, cap the
syringe, and mix the blood adequately.
◦ Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately, either
via pneumatic tube or by transportation worker.
2. Sample Analysis
◦ If specimen integrity is in question, centrifuge a small aliquot
to check for hemolysis.
◦ Load specimen onto the blood gas analyzer as per
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ The analyzer will provide methemoglobin levels along with
other blood gas parameters.
3. Quality Control
◦ Perform daily quality control checks using three levels of QC
material.
◦ Ensure the results fall within acceptable limits set by the
manufacturer.
◦ Document all QC activities and remediate any issues before
analyzing patient samples.
4. Generating Results
◦ Verify all results generated by the blood gas analyzer.
◦ Review any flagged results for issues such as instrument
calibration, sample quality, or analyte interference.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
1. Methemoglobin Level Interpretation
◦ Normal levels: <1% of total hemoglobin.
◦ Elevated levels: ≥2% of total hemoglobin, indicating
potential methemoglobinemia.
◦ Critical levels: ≥10%, requiring immediate clinical
intervention.
2. Reporting Criteria
◦ Ensure that reported results are free of instrument error,
hemolysis, or sample issues.
◦ Report critical values immediately following the lab’s
protocol for critical results reporting.
◦ Utilize the laboratory information system (LIS) to document
and transmit results.
3. Addressing Erroneous Results
◦ If the analyzer flags a result, review instrument logs and
repeat the analysis if necessary.
◦ For persistent issues, report with ‘No value’ and add the
comment: “No result due to interference.”
8. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
1. Methemoglobin results will be reviewed and verified by the
technologist before being reported.
2. Print and review each result report with ‘?’ or error messages;
troubleshoot and repeat analysis if necessary before final
reporting.
3. Ensure consistency and reliability of methemoglobin results.

• CLIA Laboratory Regulations.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guidelines.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Record specifics of every analysis in the laboratory logbook.
• Ensure all quality control measures are documented and available
for review.
• Critical results reporting should include documentation of whom
the results were communicated to and any follow-up actions.
