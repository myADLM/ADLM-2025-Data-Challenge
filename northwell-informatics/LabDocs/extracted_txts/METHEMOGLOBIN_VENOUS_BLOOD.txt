Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Methemoglobin, Venous, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and reliable analysis of
methemoglobin in venous blood specimens. This protocol ensures
standardized processing, quality control, and reporting of results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of venous blood specimens for methemoglobin.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
analysis, quality control, and initial data review.
• Supervisors: Responsible for validating protocols, reviewing any
deviations, and ensuring overall compliance with SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Venous blood sample collected in a blood
gas syringe or heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST).
• Collection: After specimen procurement, ensure:
◦ Air in contact with the blood specimen is expelled.
◦ Needle is removed.
◦ Syringe is capped or vacutainer securely closed.
◦ Blood is adequately mixed by gentle inversion.
• Transport: Transport the specimen to the lab immediately. It is
recommended to use pneumatic tube system for quick delivery.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/
oxalate, EDTA vacutainers. - Specimens with needles attached. -
Clotted specimens. - Significant air bubble inclusion (> 10% of
specimen volume). - Microtainers for specimens requiring ionized
calcium or blood gas components.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Blood gas analyzer capable of methemoglobin measurement
(e.g., ABL90 series).
• Quality control materials (e.g., three levels from regulatory-verified
vendors).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Automated analysis of three levels of quality control material
according to a set schedule.
◦ Results outside acceptable limits halt the analyzer for the
affected analytes.
◦ Perform patient comparisons between two ABL instruments
when indicated by QC failure or sensor cassette/solution pack
change.
• Additional Bi-weekly Checks:
◦ Analyze a >1ml blood gas syringe sample on the ABL90 and
perform intralab comparison tests.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow the specimen to reach room temperature if
transported on ice.
3. Analyzer Preparation:
◦ Ensure the blood gas analyzer is properly calibrated.
4. Specimen Analysis:
◦ Identify specimen via LIS. Input into the analyzer.
◦ Position the sample for analysis ensuring the ABL90 optimal
contact.
5. Data Acquisition:
◦ Wait for the measured methemoglobin (MHb) levels to be
processed and displayed.
6. Data Verification:
◦ Review results for any anomalies or flagged data (e.g.,
message codes).
◦ Troubleshoot flagged results according to the analyzer’s
manual.
7. Quality Assurance:
◦ Cross-check results with QC standards:
▪ Reanalyze specimens if necessary.
▪ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
8. Reporting Results:
◦ Transmit results automatically to LIS.
◦ Verify and review results within LIS.
◦ Report any critical results according to the laboratory’s
critical result handling policies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Critical results and anomalies are flagged for immediate attention,
documented and communicated as per lab policy.
• Results are verified and corrected as needed before final release
to ensure accuracy.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Verify the sample for any integrity issues (e.g., hemolysis) through
centrifuging and visual inspection if necessary.
• Use professional judgement to determine reporting validity.

• Manufacturer’s instrument manual and maintenance guide.
• Calibration and control material instructions (vendor-specific).
• Laboratory’s Quality Assurance and Safety Manual.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on updates in
equipment, reagents, or laboratory practices.
