Standard Operating Procedure: MRSA Screening - Analytical
Phase
1. PURPOSE To detect and report the presence of Methicillin-
Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in clinical specimens to aid
in the treatment and control of infections caused by this pathogen.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to clinical microbiology laboratory
personnel conducting MRSA screening on patient specimens using
culture-based or molecular methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Lab personnel responsible for conducting
MRSA screening are required to follow this SOP accurately and
promptly report any deviations to their supervisor. Staff performing
MRSA assays must be trained in these specific methods and adhere
to safety and quality control guidelines.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Samples: Nasal swabs, wound swabs, sputum, urine,
or any other sterile site as indicated by the physician.
• Specimens must be collected and transported according to
standard guidelines to maintain viability and integrity.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• MRSA selective agar (e.g., CHROMagar MRSA)
• Blood agar plates
• Mueller-Hinton agar with oxacillin or cefoxitin discs
• Sterile inoculating loops and swabs
• Incubator set at 35-37°C
• PCR assay kits for MRSA (if performing molecular testing)
• Sterile saline for specimen suspension
• Quality control strains (e.g., MRSA ATCC 43300, MSSA ATCC
25923)
6. PROCEDURE: CULTURE METHOD 6.1. Initial Inoculation
• Label the media appropriately.
• Using a sterile swab or loop, inoculate the specimen onto a blood
agar plate for general bacterial isolation.
• Inoculate a separate MRSA selective agar plate with the
specimen.
6.2. Incubation
• Incubate blood agar and MRSA selective agar plates at 35-37°C
for 24-48 hours.
6.3. Screening and Identification
• Examine the agar plates after 24 hours.
• On MRSA selective agar, look for characteristic colony
morphology indicative of MRSA (e.g., pink/mauve colonies on
CHROMagar MRSA).
• Perform a Gram stain and catalase test on suspicious colonies
from MRSA selective agar.
• Subculture suspect colonies to blood agar and incubate to obtain
pure isolates.
• Perform coagulase testing on subcultured isolates.
6.4. Confirmation by Susceptibility Testing
• Prepare a 0.5 McFarland standard suspension of the isolated
colonies in sterile saline.
• Using a sterile swab, inoculate Mueller-Hinton agar uniformly.
• Place an oxacillin (1 μg) or cefoxitin (30 μg) disc on the agar.
• Incubate at 35-37°C for 16-24 hours.
• Measure the zone of inhibition around the discs:
◦ Resistance indicated by a zone diameter ≤ 21 mm for oxacillin
or ≤ 22 mm for cefoxitin.
6.5. Molecular Method (if utilized)
• Extract DNA from the specimen or isolated colonies using a
validated extraction method.
• Set up PCR reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions
provided in the MRSA assay kit.
• Include appropriate controls (positive control, negative control,
and internal control).
• Perform PCR amplification and analyze results.
• Confirm the presence of MRSA-specific gene (e.g., mecA or
mecC).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Control Strains
• Include MRSA (ATCC 43300) and MSSA (ATCC 25923) as
controls to verify the accuracy and specificity of both culture-
based and molecular methods.
7.2. Media Quality Control
• Check each batch of media for sterility and performance against
control strains.
7.3. Equipment Calibration and Maintenance
• Ensure incubators, PCR machines, and other critical equipment
are calibrated and maintained as per the lab's equipment
maintenance schedule.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive results: Report as “MRSA detected”. Record organism's
identity and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern.
• Negative results: Report as “MRSA not detected”.
• Notify the ordering clinician of positive MRSA results promptly.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all test results, quality control results, and any deviations
or issues encountered during testing.
• Maintain logs of specimen accession, media preparation, and
equipment calibration as per laboratory documentation standards.
10. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for MRSA
selective media and molecular assays.
• Relevant peer-reviewed publications and laboratory manuals for
microbiological and molecular procedures.
11. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL MEASURES
• Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling clinical specimens and
disposing of biohazardous waste according to institutional
policies.
12. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP shall be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
ensure conformity with the latest standards and practices.
