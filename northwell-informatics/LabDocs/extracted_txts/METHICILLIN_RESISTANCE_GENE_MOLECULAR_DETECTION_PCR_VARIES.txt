Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Detection of Methicillin Resistance Gene (mecA), Molecular
Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required for the molecular detection
of the methicillin resistance gene (mecA) using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR). Accurate detection of the mecA gene is critical in
identifying methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
providing appropriate treatment options for patients.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing the PCR-based
detection of the methicillin resistance gene (mecA) in clinical samples
in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for sample preparation,
PCR setup, running the PCR instrument, data analysis, and
documentation.
• Supervisors: Responsible for verifying results, troubleshooting
issues, and ensuring adherence to SOPs and quality control
measures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Clinical isolates (e.g., bacterial colonies from
culture plates).
• Specimen Storage: Upon arrival, store specimens at 4°C for
immediate use or at -20°C for long-term storage.
• Specimen Rejection: Specimens that are not labeled correctly,
leaking, or not collected in appropriate containers will be rejected.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Master Mix
• Primers specific for mecA gene
• Positive control (known mecA positive strain)
• Negative control (known mecA negative strain)
• DNA extraction kit or reagents
• PCR clean-grade water
• Microcentrifuge tubes (0.2 mL and 1.5 mL)
• PCR tubes or plates
• Nucleic acid-free pipette tips
• Thermal cycler
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction
• Begin by obtaining bacterial colonies from culture plates using a
sterile loop.
• Transfer a small amount of the colony into a microcentrifuge tube
containing the lysis buffer provided in the DNA extraction kit.
• Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA. Ensure the
final elution volume is compatible with PCR requirements.
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C until PCR setup.
6.2. PCR Setup
• Thaw PCR Master Mix, primers, and DNA samples on ice.
• Prepare a PCR reaction mix according to the following
components:
◦ PCR Master Mix: XX µL
◦ Forward primer (10 µM): XX µL
◦ Reverse primer (10 µM): XX µL
◦ DNA template: XX µL
◦ PCR clean-grade water: Adjust to a final volume of XX µL
• Aliquot the reaction mix into PCR tubes or plates.
• Include a positive control (known mecA positive strain) and a
negative control (known mecA negative strain) in each run.
• Seal the tubes or plates and place them in the thermal cycler.
6.3. PCR Cycling Conditions
• Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: XX°C for 30 seconds (adjust based on primer
Tm)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
6.4. Gel Electrophoresis
• Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or an
alternative nucleic acid stain.
• Load PCR products and a DNA ladder on the gel.
• Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
• Visualize the bands using a UV transilluminator.
6.5. Interpretation of Results
• Compare sample bands to the positive control band to identify the
presence of the mecA gene.
• A band matching the expected size of mecA indicates a positive
result.
• No band or a band differing in size indicates a negative result.
• Ensure that the positive control and ladder show expected results;
if not, the PCR run must be repeated.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform positive and negative controls with each PCR run.
• Document all steps, reagent lot numbers, and any deviations from
the protocol.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the thermal cycler and gel
electrophoresis equipment.
• Document all results and any issues encountered in the PCR run
logbook.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the PCR fails to produce amplification, verify the integrity and
purity of DNA samples.
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored properly.
• Re-check the primer concentrations and annealing temperatures.
• Consult the supervisor if issues persist.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
throughout the procedure.
• Handle all specimens and reagents according to laboratory safety
guidelines.
• Dispose of all waste, including gels and used consumables,
according to biohazard protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the PCR Master Mix and DNA
extraction kit.
• Relevant peer-reviewed journal articles on mecA gene detection.
• Laboratory quality assurance and safety manuals.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This SOP is reviewed annually or as needed by the laboratory
supervisor or quality manager.
• Document any updates or revisions and obtain necessary
approvals.
