Standard Operating Procedure for Methicillin-Resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), PCR, Nasal Swab
1. PURPOSE
To detect Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DNA
using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from nasal swab
specimens.
This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and repeatable results for
clinical diagnosis and epidemiological studies.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists and technicians are responsible for
performing the analysis and ensuring all steps are followed as
outlined in the procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, validating
results, and addressing any issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITION
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of
bacteria that is resistant to several antibiotics, including methicillin,
and can cause severe infections. The PCR assay detects the mecA
gene responsible for methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus
bacteria.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Type:
• Nasal swab specimens collected in appropriate transport media.
Equipment and Reagents:
• PCR machine (thermal cycler)
• Nucleic acid extraction kits
• MRSA PCR assay kits
• Nasal swabs in transport media
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sterile disposable gloves
Preparation:
• Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, face shield or mask,
etc.).
• Clean the workspace with a suitable disinfectant before and after
handling specimens.
A) Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Vortex the nasal swab specimen for 10 seconds.
2. Transfer 200 µL of the specimen transport medium into a
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Follow the nucleic acid extraction kit instructions to extract
MRSA DNA from the specimen.
4. Elute the DNA in an appropriate volume of elution buffer,
typically 50 µL.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents from the MRSA PCR assay kit and keep
them on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the assay kit instructions.
Typically, this includes:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Primers and probes specific for MRSA
◦ Taq polymerase
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
4. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each PCR reaction tube.
5. Include positive control (known MRSA DNA) and negative
control (nuclease-free water) in each run to ensure assay
validity.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. Place the PCR tubes or plate into the thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler as per the assay kit instructions. A
typical MRSA PCR cycling program may include:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 35-40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Start the PCR run.
D) Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the PCR run, verify the amplification using
the thermal cycler's software.
2. Analyze the data to determine the presence of the mecA gene.
3. Confirm the positive and negative controls are valid. Positive
controls should show amplification, and negative controls
should not.
E) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Positive MRSA PCR Result:
◦ Presence of the mecA gene indicates MRSA in the nasal
swab specimen.
2. Negative MRSA PCR Result:
◦ Absence of the mecA gene indicates no detectable MRSA in
the nasal swab specimen.
3. Inconclusive Result:
◦ Rerun the specimen if controls fail or if there is any
ambiguity in results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document the findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Communicate critical results immediately to the appropriate
healthcare provider.
• Maintain records of all PCR runs, including control results and any
anomalies.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the PCR machine and other
equipment.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
assay reliability.

This Standard Operating Procedure is designed to ensure the
accurate and reliable identification of MRSA from nasal swab
specimens using PCR methodology. It is essential to follow all steps
meticulously and maintain stringent quality control measures
throughout the process.
1. REVIEW DATE: This SOP must be reviewed annually or as
needed due to procedural changes or updates. The next review
date is scheduled for October 2024.
