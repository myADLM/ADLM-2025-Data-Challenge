Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Methotrexate Analysis in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate analysis of
Methotrexate (MTX) levels in plasma specimens.
Responsibility: Technologists and laboratory personnel are
responsible for sample preparation, processing, analysis, and result
verification of Methotrexate plasma levels as defined in this
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 3-5 mL plasma collected in a lithium heparin or EDTA tube. The
sample must be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection
to avoid degradation.
• Specimens should be spun down immediately and plasma should
be transferred to a labeled tube for storage and analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are lipemic, icteric, or hemolyzed.
• Plasma collected in incorrect tubes, such as sodium citrate or
fluoride/oxalate tubes.
• Specimens received greater than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration or greater than 72 hours if refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV/Vis detector or similar validated instrumentation.
• Mobile phase and solvents as specified in the instrument’s
method protocol.
• Methotrexate calibrators and quality control materials.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Methotrexate-specific assay kit, if applicable.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge plasma samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to ensure complete separation of plasma from cells.
2. Transfer the plasma carefully to a clean, labeled tube, avoiding
the transfer of any cells or debris.
3. Store the plasma at 2-8°C if immediate analysis is not possible.
For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Allow stored plasma samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. Prepare a series of Methotrexate calibrators and quality control
samples according to the manufacturer's guidelines or in-house
validated protocols.
3. Ensure the HPLC system is properly set up, calibrated, and
passed performance checks before starting the analysis.
4. Pipette an appropriate volume of each calibrator, quality control
material, and plasma sample into labeled vials suitable for the
HPLC system.
5. Vortex mix each sample to ensure homogeneity.
6. Load the prepared vials into the HPLC autosampler.
7. Program the HPLC system as per the validated method,
including setting parameters for mobile phase composition, flow
rate, detection wavelength, and run time.
8. Start the analysis run, ensuring all documentation is up to date
in the instrument log book.
C. Post-Analysis Data Handling
1. Once the run is complete, review chromatograms for all
calibrators, control samples, and patient specimens.
2. Ensure that the calibration curve meets the acceptance criteria
(e.g., linear correlation coefficient > 0.995).
3. Validate quality control sample results against pre-determined
ranges.
D. Troubleshooting
1. If the calibration curve or control sample results do not meet
acceptance criteria: a. Recheck the preparation and handling of
calibrator and control materials. b. Re-run the calibration and
control samples. c. If issues persist, notify the supervisor and
investigate potential sources of error (e.g., equipment
calibration, reagent issues).
2. If patient results fall outside expected ranges, check for sample
integrity issues such as hemolysis or contamination.
E. Reporting Results
1. Results for Methotrexate levels are automatically transmitted to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed
and verified by the technologist.
2. Report the results as µmol/L or ng/mL as per the laboratory’s
reporting guidelines.
3. Flag and communicate any critical values to the appropriate
medical personnel according to the laboratory's critical results
policy.
4. Document all actions taken in the laboratory records.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Use at least two levels of control material to ensure the accuracy
and precision of the assay.
• Record and review quality control results, taking corrective
actions if controls fall outside acceptable limits.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs if available.
