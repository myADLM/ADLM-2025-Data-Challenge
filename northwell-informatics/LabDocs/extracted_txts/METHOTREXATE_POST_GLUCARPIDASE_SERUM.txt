Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Methotrexate Post Glucarpidase, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the method for the analytical phase of
generating Methotrexate Post Glucarpidase levels in serum samples.
Methotrexate (MTX) is an antineoplastic chemotherapy drug and
immune system suppressant. This procedure ensures accurate and
reliable results required for monitoring post-glucarpidase
administration.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory staff responsible for the analysis
of Methotrexate Post Glucarpidase, Serum samples in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to adhere
to this SOP and ensure proper implementation. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for training staff, monitoring compliance,
and correcting deviations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Collection:
1. Collect blood in a plain, red-top serum tube.
2. Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed for 30 minutes
to one hour at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge the tube to separate the serum from the clot within
two hours of collection.
Specimen Volume:
• Preferred volume: 1 mL
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
Transport and Storage:
• Store at 2-8°C if the analysis will occur within 48 hours.
• For longer storage periods, freeze samples at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Hemolysis
• Lipemia
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (i.e., EDTA, citrate,
heparin)
5. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents: - Methotrexate Calibrators - Methotrexate Controls (High
and Low) - Assay specific reagent kits
Materials: - Disposable pipettes - Serum separator tubes (red-top) -
Calibrated volumetric flasks
Equipment: - Centrifuge - Laboratory Freezer (-20°C or colder) -
ELISA, radioimmunoassay (RIA), or High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) analyzer specific for methotrexate detection
- Calibrated micropipettes and tips
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify patient information and testing requirements on the test requisition form.
2. Log sample details into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Ensure sample integrity, checking for proper handling and storage.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run Methotrexate calibrators according to manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Perform quality control procedures using high and low
Methotrexate controls before sample testing.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
◦ Vortex samples thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot appropriate sample volume (typically 50-100 µL) to
the assay plate or appropriate analyzer-specific container.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the specific
methotrexate detection assay (ELISA/RIA/HPLC).
◦ Initialize the analyzer, ensuring proper functioning and
readiness for testing.
◦ Load samples, calibrators, and controls in appropriate
positions on the analyzer.
◦ Start the assay run, following prompts and ensuring
adherence to timing and volume instructions specific to the
assay kit.
4. Result Generation:
◦ Upon completion of the run, review analyzer printouts for
sample result interpretation.
◦ Confirm that control results fall within acceptable ranges to
validate assay performance.
◦ Verify results in LIS, ensuring appropriate flagging of results
for critical/high values.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the results into the LIS.
2. Verify and release the results.
3. Communicate critical results immediately to the requesting
physician, and document the communication in the LIS.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Perform quality control tests each day of assay use,
documenting results in the QC log.
2. Evaluate control data for trends or shifts indicating potential
assay problems.
3. Take corrective action if controls are out of range, such as re-
running tests, recalibrating, or contacting technical support.
4. Document troubleshooting steps and resolutions.
9. RECORD KEEPING
All result printouts, including control data, calibration information,
reagent lot numbers, and maintenance logs, should be retained in
accordance with regulatory and laboratory guidelines.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the specific assay kit insert for reference intervals. These
may vary depending on the assay and should be validated according
to the patient population and clinical requirements.
11. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
For detailed assay procedures, refer to the specific assay kit insert.
This includes troubleshooting for specific errors or issues, limitations,
cross-reactions, and validation criteria.
