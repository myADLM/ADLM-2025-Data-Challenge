SOP for Analytical Phase of Methotrexate, Serum Measurement
1. Purpose This protocol outlines the procedural steps for
analyzing methotrexate (MTX) levels in serum specimens using
validated analytical techniques. The protocol ensures accurate
and precise measurement of drug concentration to assist
clinicians in patient management.
2. Definition Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent
and immune system suppressant. It is critical to measure its
serum levels to avoid toxicity and ensure therapeutic efficacy.
3. Specimen Requirements and Stability Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a red-top vacutainer (no gel) or SST
(serum separator tube).
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
◦ Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days at
2-8°C. If a longer storage period is anticipated, freeze the
serum at -20°C or lower for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in EDTA, sodium fluoride, or citrate
tubes.
◦ Specimens showing visible hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulant-treated tubes.
Preparation of Specimens:
◦ Centrifuge blood sample to separate serum within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Aliquot the serum into a clean, properly labeled tube.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
or Immunoassay Analyzer.
◦ Methotrexate calibrators and controls.
◦ Methotrexate assay reagents specific to the chosen
analytical platform.
◦ Disposable pipettes and tips.
◦ Sample tubes and storage containers.
◦ Centrifuge.
5. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature or 4°C.
2. Mix the sample thoroughly by gentle inversion, avoiding
frothing.
HPLC Method:
1. Prepare the HPLC system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load methotrexate calibrators, quality controls, and
patient serum samples onto the system.
3. Run the HPLC analysis according to the standard
operation settings defined for methotrexate.
4. Record the chromatographic data including retention
times, peak areas, and concentrations calculated by the
software.
Immunoassay Method:
1. Load the immunoassay analyzer with methotrexate assay
reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient specimens.
2. Follow the instrument-specific protocol for running the
methotrexate assay.
3. Verify that the instrument's software automatically
processes the raw data to produce the final concentration
values.
6. Quality Control
◦ Perform quality control (QC) at the start of each analytical
batch, and after any maintenance or recalibration
procedure.
◦ Use at least two levels of methotrexate QC materials,
typically covering a therapeutic and toxic range.
◦ Record QC results and evaluate them against defined
acceptable criteria. Documentation should include date,
time, and initials of the staff member.
◦ If QC results are out of acceptable ranges, investigate,
resolve the issue, and re-run QC before patient samples.
7. Reporting Results
◦ Validate the results against calibration and QC data.
◦ Enter the confirmed methotrexate serum concentrations into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results prior to releasing them to the
clinician.
Reference Intervals:
◦ Therapeutic range: 0.1 – 1.0 μmol/L
◦ Toxic level: >1.0 μmol/L
8. Critical Results:
◦ Immediately report critical results (>1.0 μmol/L) according to
laboratory policy.
◦ Document all communications including date, time, and
person contacted.
9. Documentation and Record Keeping
◦ Keep thorough records of all sample processing, analytical
runs, calibrations, quality controls, maintenance, and
instrument issues.
◦ Ensure compliance with regulatory and accreditation
requirements for record retention and data integrity.
10. References:
◦ Instrument manufacturer's instructions for use and reagent
inserts.
◦ CLSI guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring.
◦ Relevant clinical publications and pharmacokinetics of
methotrexate.
