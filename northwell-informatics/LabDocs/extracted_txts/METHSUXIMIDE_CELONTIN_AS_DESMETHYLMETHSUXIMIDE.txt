Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Determination
of Methsuximide (Celontin) as Desmethlymethsuximide
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Methsuximide (Celontin) as
Desmethlymethsuximide, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
Responsibility: Designated staff will be responsible for performing
and documenting all steps in the analytical phase of testing.
1. DEFINITION Methsuximide is an anticonvulsant and is
measured as Desmethlymethsuximide in clinical samples.
2. PROCEDURE A. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with UV detector
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Volumetric flasks and pipettes
• Methsuximide and Desmethlymethsuximide standards
• Mobile phase (typically methanol/water mixture)
• Serum or plasma samples
• Sample preparation reagents (e.g., acetonitrile)
• Calibration curves
B. PREPARATION OF STANDARDS AND CONTROL SAMPLES
1. Prepare stock solutions of Methsuximide and
Desmethlymethsuximide standards in methanol.
2. Prepare a series of dilutions to create a calibration curve.
3. Prepare quality control (QC) samples with known
concentrations of Methsuximide and Desmethlymethsuximide.
C. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Collect plasma or serum samples according to established
procedures.
2. Label and centrifuge samples to separate serum or plasma.
3. Add an internal standard to each sample if applicable.
4. Extract the analytes using liquid-liquid extraction with
acetonitrile.
5. Centrifuge samples to remove precipitated proteins.
6. Transfer the supernatant to HPLC vials for analysis.
D. HPLC ANALYSIS
1. Set up the HPLC system with appropriate column and mobile
phase.
2. Calibrate the HPLC system using the prepared calibration
standards.
3. Inject samples and controls into the HPLC system.
4. Monitor the UV detector signal, and record chromatograms.
5. Identify peaks corresponding to Methsuximide and
Desmethlymethsuximide based on retention time.
6. Quantify the analytes by comparing sample peak areas to
calibration curve.
E. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run control samples alongside clinical samples to ensure
system performance.
2. Review QC results to ensure system is within acceptable limits.
3. RESULTS REPORTING
4. Evaluate chromatograms and quantify Desmethlymethsuximide
using calibration curve.
5. Verify results according to laboratory protocols.
6. Document all results, including any deviations or issues
encountered during analysis.
7. Report final results to the appropriate clinical team or upload to
LIS system.
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
9. Assess sample integrity by evaluating clarity post-
centrifugation.
10. When concerns arise due to hemolysis or other issues, repeat
analysis or consult supervisor.
11. CRITICAL RESULTS
12. Ensure critical results as defined by laboratory policy are
logged and reported promptly.
