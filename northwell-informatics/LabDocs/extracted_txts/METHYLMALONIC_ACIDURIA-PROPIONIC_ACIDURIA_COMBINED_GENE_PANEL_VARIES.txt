Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP): Methylmalonic Aciduria-
Propionic Aciduria Combined
Gene Panel
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate, precise, and reliable
testing results for the Methylmalonic Aciduria-Propionic Aciduria
Combined Gene Panel. This procedure includes guidelines for the
analytical phase of generating results, ensuring compliance with CLIA
standards.
2. Responsibility
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing gene
panel testing as outlined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all
staff to adhere to the defined protocols to ensure the accuracy and
proficiency of analytical results. Supervisors must ensure compliance
to the SOP and manage any necessary corrective actions.
3. Equipment and Reagents
Equipment:
• Real-Time PCR System
• Thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips (sterile, filter tips recommended)
• PCR Plates or Tubes
• Plate Seals
• Laboratory Freezer and Refrigerator
• DNA Sequencer (Next-Generation Sequencing platform or Sanger
Sequencer, depending on the laboratory capacity)
Reagents:
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Methylmalonic Aciduria-Propionic Aciduria Gene Panel Multiplex
PCR Kit
• Master Mix for PCR (including DNA Polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2,
reaction buffer)
• Positive and Negative Controls
• Nuclease-Free Water
• Specific Primer and Probe Sets for Target Genes
• Library Preparation Kit (if utilizing Next-Generation Sequencing)
4. Sample Preparation
Specimen Requirements:
• Peripheral Blood, Buccal Swab, or Saliva
◦ Blood: Collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Buccal Swabs: Use sterile swabs in a DNA stabilizing solution.
◦ Saliva: Saliva sample collection in appropriate collection
tubes.
Sample Handling:
• Ensure all specimens are correctly labeled and stored at
appropriate conditions to prevent nucleic acid degradation.
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours for optimal DNA
yield; otherwise, store at -20°C or -80°C for long-term storage.
5. DNA Extraction
• Perform DNA extraction using the designated DNA Extraction Kit
according to manufacturer instructions.
• Quantify and assess the quality of DNA using a Nanodrop or
similar spectrophotometer (ideal purity: A260/A280 ratio of
1.8-2.0).
• Aliquot DNA to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PCR Amplification
• Prepare PCR master mix containing DNA Polymerase, primers,
probes, dNTPs, MgCl2, reaction buffer, and nuclease-free water.
• Add the appropriate amount of extracted DNA to the reaction
wells as outlined in the PCR kit instructions.
• Include positive control and negative (no-template) control
reactions in each run.
• Seal the PCR plate/tubes to prevent evaporation and
contamination.
Thermal Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
• 35-40 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
7. Post-PCR Analysis
• For Real-Time PCR: Analyze the data for amplification plots and
Ct values using the designated software.
• For Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable): Load PCR products on a
1-2% agarose gel stained with GelRed or Ethidium Bromide and
run DNA electrophoresis to visualize bands under UV light.
• For Next-Generation Sequencing: Proceed with library
preparation according to the library kit instructions, followed by
sequencing on the designated platform.
8. Sequencing and Data Analysis
• Load the prepared DNA library onto the sequencing platform and
follow the manufacturer’s protocol for sequencing run setup.
• Analyze the sequencing data using bioinformatic tools designed
for genetic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation
specific to Methylmalonic Aciduria and Propionic Aciduria gene
panels.
• Apply quality control checks on generated data, including read
depth, coverage, and variant call quality.
9. Result Interpretation and Reporting
• Review and interpret the detected genetic variants in context with
reference databases and clinical significance.
• Results must be double-checked for accuracy and reliability prior
to reporting.
Documentation:
• Document all controls and instrument maintenance logs. Include
details of any deviations or corrective actions taken.
• Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
generate the final report. Ensure compliance with Methylmalonic
Aciduria-Propionic Aciduria combined gene panel reporting
standards.
10. Quality Control
Internal Quality Controls:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay performance.
• Regularly perform proficiency testing with known standards to
verify the accuracy and consistency of results.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external proficiency testing as available to assess
laboratory performance and inter-laboratory comparability.
