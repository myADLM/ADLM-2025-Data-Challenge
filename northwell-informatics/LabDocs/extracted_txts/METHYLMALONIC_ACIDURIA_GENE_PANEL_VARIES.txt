STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) 4:
METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA GENE PANEL ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Methylmalonic Aciduria (MMA) Gene Panel, ensuring
accurate, consistent, and reliable genetic testing.
2. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis and interpretation of genetic data for the Methylmalonic
Aciduria Gene Panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to conduct the
analysis and ensure the accuracy and completeness of results based
on this SOP. Supervisors must review and validate the results and
address any deviations or issues identified during the process.
4. SPECIMENS
The specimen requirements are assumed to have been collected,
received, and accessioned.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sequencer (Next Generation Sequencing: NGS or Sanger
Sequencing)
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Reagents for DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing as per
manufacturer recommendations
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR primers for MMA genes
• Sequencing libraries and adapters
• Positive and negative controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from the patient's blood or tissue sample
using a commercially available DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantitate and assess purity of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and/or fluorometry (e.g.,
Qubit).
6.2 PCR Amplification
1. Design specific primers for known genes implicated in
Methylmalonic Aciduria.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the reagent
manufacturer’s instructions including DNA template, PCR
buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2, primers, and Taq DNA polymerase.
3. Set PCR conditions with appropriate cycling parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes.
◦ 30–35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Annealing at 55-65°C (depending on primer Tm) for 30
seconds.
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.
6.3 Library Preparation and NGS (if using NGS platform)
1. Purify PCR products using a suitable purification kit.
2. Quantify purified PCR products.
3. Prepare sequencing libraries using the purified PCR products
according to the NGS library preparation guide.
4. Perform quality control and quantification of the libraries.
5. Load libraries onto the sequencing instrument following the
manufacturer's protocol.
6.4 Sequencing and Data Analysis
1. Sequence the prepared libraries using a next-generation
sequencer.
2. Perform quality checks on sequencing data and filter out low-
quality reads.
3. Map sequencing reads to the human reference genome.
4. Perform variant calling using validated bioinformatics pipelines.
6.5 Sanger Sequencing Validation (if applicable)
1. Design primers for the regions of interest if Sanger sequencing
is used for validation.
2. Perform PCR as above.
3. Purify PCR products.
4. Sequence the purified products using specific sequencing
primers and capillary electrophoresis.
5. Analyze sequencing results to confirm variants.
6.6 Data Interpretation and Reporting
1. Interpret the identified genetic variants following the American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.
2. Correlate genetic findings with clinical data to determine the
significance of the variants.
3. Compile the results into a comprehensive report, including:
◦ Patient information and sample details
◦ Methodology
◦ Identified variants and their clinical significance
◦ Interpretation and recommendations for further steps
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each analytical run to
ensure assay integrity.
2. Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Participate in external proficiency testing programs for genetic
testing when available.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Follow standard laboratory biosafety guidelines for handling
biological specimens and reagents.
2. Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab
coats, and eye protection.
3. Dispose of waste materials in compliance with institutional and
regulatory guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for equipment and reagents.
• ACMG guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants.
• Laboratory-specific quality management system documents.
10. DOCUMENTATION
Record all procedures, observations, and results in the laboratory
information system (LIS). Ensure all records are legible, accurate,
and retrievable for future reference and audits.
By adhering to these procedures, we ensure that genetic testing for
Methylmalonic Aciduria is performed consistently, with high reliability
and accuracy, for effective patient diagnosis and care.
I have structured the document to ensure all steps, responsibilities,
and critical quality controls relevant to the analytical phase are
thoroughly covered as per standardized SOP practices. If you have
additional information regarding specific regulatory guidelines or
institutional preferences that you would like to consider, please let me
