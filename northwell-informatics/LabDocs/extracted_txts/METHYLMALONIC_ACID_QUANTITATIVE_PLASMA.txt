Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Methylmalonic
Acid, Quantitative, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed steps for the accurate and reliable analytical
phase of generating results for Methylmalonic Acid (MMA),
Quantitative, Plasma.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in
the analysis of plasma samples for methylmalonic acid (MMA)
quantification using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory staff to perform the
analysis according to this SOP, ensuring the accuracy and reliability
of test results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are
trained and competent in performing the procedure and for
addressing any issues that arise during the analysis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 2 mL of plasma collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma samples must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection and stored at -20°C or colder if analysis is delayed.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with the
assay and are considered unacceptable.

6. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Sample Preparation 1.1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at
room temperature. 1.2. Vortex each sample briefly. 1.3. Centrifuge
the plasma samples at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
particulates. 1.4. Transfer 200 µL of plasma to a labeled
microcentrifuge tube. 1.5. Add 20 µL of internal standard (deuterated
MMA) to each sample. 1.6. Add 500 µL of acetonitrile to precipitate
proteins. 1.7. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds. 1.8. Centrifuge the
mixture at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. 1.9. Transfer the supernatant to a
new labeled microcentrifuge tube. 1.10. Evaporate the supernatant to
dryness under a stream of nitrogen or in a vacuum concentrator.
Step 2: Sample Reconstitution 2.1. Reconstitute the dried residue
in 100 µL of mobile phase (e.g., 50% acetonitrile/50% water with
0.1% formic acid). 2.2. Vortex the reconstituted sample for 30
seconds. 2.3. Transfer the reconstituted samples to LC-MS/MS
sample vials.
Step 3: Calibration and QC Preparation 3.1. Prepare calibration
standards ranging from the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to the
upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) by serial dilution of MMA stock
solutions. 3.2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, mid, and
high concentrations within the calibration range. 3.3. Process
calibration standards and QC samples using the same procedure as
the plasma samples.
Step 4: LC-MS/MS Analysis 4.1. Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.2. Set the
chromatographic conditions appropriate for MMA separation (e.g.,
column type, mobile phase composition, gradient program). 4.3.
Create a sample queue including calibration standards, QC samples,
and patient samples. 4.4. Inject 10-20 µL of each prepared sample
into the LC-MS/MS system. 4.5. Monitor the mass transitions specific
for MMA and the internal standard.
Step 5: Data Analysis and Result Generation 5.1. Integrate the
peaks of MMA and the internal standard using the LC-MS/MS
software. 5.2. Calculate the concentration of MMA in each plasma
sample based on the calibration curve and the internal standard
response. 5.3. Review the calibration curve and QC results to ensure
they meet acceptance criteria. 5.4. Report results according to site-
specific guidelines and Laboratory Information System (LIS)
protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Include at least one set of QC samples (low, mid, high) in each
batch of samples analyzed. 7.2. Ensure that the QC results are within
acceptable limits before reporting patient results. 7.3. Perform regular
maintenance and calibration of the LC-MS/MS system. 7.4. Maintain
detailed records of all analytical runs, quality control data, and
instrument maintenance logs.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist. Ensure all results are
documented accurately, and any deviations or anomalies are
investigated.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals for methylmalonic acid in plasma should be
established based on the laboratory's validation data or refer to
established clinical guidelines.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay.
• Matrix effects should be evaluated and minimized during method
development.
