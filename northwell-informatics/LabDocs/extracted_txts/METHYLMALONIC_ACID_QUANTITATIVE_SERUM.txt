PROTOCOL FOR METHYLMALONIC ACID, QUANTITATIVE,
SERUM ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE: To outline the standard procedures for the
quantitative analysis of Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) in serum.
The analysis involves preparation, extraction, and quantification
of MMA using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing MMA quantification in accordance
with this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to adhere to
these procedures and report any deviations or instrument
malfunctions to a supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
◦ Specimen type: Serum.
◦ Collection container: Serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
◦ Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 7 days of collection. For longer storage,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder and are
stable for up to 3 months.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Equipment:
▪ Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometer
(LC-MS/MS)
▪ Centrifuge
▪ Pipettes and tips
▪ Vortex mixer
▪ Nitrogen evaporator (if necessary)
◦ Reagents:
▪ Internal standard solution (e.g., deuterated MMA)
▪ Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile)
▪ Calibrators and quality control (QC) samples
◦ Supplies:
▪ Vials for LC-MS/MS
▪ Syringes and filters for sample preparation
5. PROCEDURE: A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to separate serum from cells.
2. Transfer the supernatant serum into a clean tube.
3. Add a fixed volume of internal standard solution to each
sample, calibrator, and QC sample.
4. Vortex the samples for 30 seconds to ensure thorough
mixing.
B. Extraction and Cleanup:
1. Add appropriate extraction solvents to the sample (e.g., a
mixture of organic solvents such as methanol).
2. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
3. Centrifuge the mixture at 1500 x g for 5 minutes.
4. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean vial.
5. (Optional) Evaporate the supernatant under a stream of
nitrogen and reconstitute in mobile phase solvent.
C. Chromatographic and Mass Spectrometric Conditions:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions and ensure proper calibration
and tuning.
2. Use an appropriate LC column (e.g., C18) and mobile
phase (e.g., water/acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid).
3. Inject a fixed volume of the sample (e.g., 10 µL) into the
LC-MS/MS system.
4. Set the LC-MS/MS parameters:
▪ Flow rate: 0.3 mL/min
▪ Column temperature: 40°C
▪ Ionization mode: Electrospray ionization (ESI), positive
mode
▪ Monitor the specific mass transitions for MMA and
internal standard.
D. Quantification:
1. Analyze the samples, calibrators, and QCs using the LC-
MS/MS system.
2. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the ratio of the
peak area of MMA to the internal standard against the
concentration of the calibrators.
3. Determine the concentration of MMA in the serum
samples by extrapolation from the calibration curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Perform analysis of two levels of QC samples (low and high)
with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Ensure that QC results fall within acceptable range as
determined by laboratory guidelines.
◦ Any batch with QC results outside the acceptable range
must be reanalyzed.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Review and validate all quantification results.
◦ Report MMA concentrations in micromoles per liter (µmol/L)
using the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Maintain detailed records of all analysis performed,
including any deviations and corrective actions.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ The reference interval for serum MMA levels will be
provided based on current clinical guidelines and
established through laboratory validation.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Ensure proper sample storage and handling to avoid
degradation.
◦ Interference may occur from structurally similar compounds;
carefully monitor chromatographic separation and mass
spectrometric resolution.

procedures.

accurate quantification of Methylmalonic Acid in serum specimens,
thus aiding in the diagnosis and management of related metabolic
disorders.
