Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
METHYLMALONIC ACID, QUANTITATIVE, URINE
1. Purpose
This procedure outlines the steps for the quantitative analysis of
Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) in urine specimens to ensure reliable and
accurate results. The aim is to provide clinicians with vital information
for diagnosing and managing conditions related to MMA elevation.
1. Specimen Requirements
Acceptable specimens:
• Freshly collected urine in a clean, contamination-free container.
• A minimum volume of 10 mL urine collected within 6 hours of
voiding.
• 24-hour urine collection in a clean container with proper
preservatives as indicated if specified by clinician.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens received more than 6 hours post-collection without
refrigeration or preservatives.
• Specimens in dirty or contaminated containers.
• Specimens lacking proper collection date/time labels.
1. Equipment and Supplies
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
or Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Clean glass or plastic test tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated storage unit (2-8°C)
• MMA standard solutions
• Quality control materials
• Appropriate reagents for derivatization (if necessary)
• Safety gear (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
1. Reagents
• Internal standards for MMA
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, methanol)
• Derivatization reagents (if required)
• Calibration and control solutions
1. Procedure
Preparation:
1. Place the urine specimen in a clean test tube.
2. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any solid debris.
3. Transfer the supernatant into a fresh, clean test tube.
Calibration and Sample Preparation:
1. Prepare calibration standards using MMA standard solutions
ranging from the known lower limit of quantification to the upper
analytical range.
2. Prepare quality control samples at different concentration
levels.
3. If the method requires derivatization, follow the manufacturer's
instructions for derivatizing agents and incubation times.
Sample Analysis:
1. Load the calibrants, controls, and urine specimens onto the LC-
MS/MS or GC-MS system.
2. Operate the system using the predefined method parameters
established during method validation, ensuring proper
ionization and detection settings.
3. Monitor the analysis, ensuring no deviations occur in the
retention times or ion intensities.
Data Collection and Processing:
1. Extract the data from the mass spectrometer.
2. Analyze the chromatograms for MMA peaks and calculate their
concentrations using the calibration curve.
3. Ensure all quality control samples meet acceptable criteria
before reporting patient results.
Quality Control and Validation:
1. Run QC samples alongside patient specimens. Verify that
results fall within acceptable predefined ranges.
2. Confirm that calibration curve plots demonstrate linearity within
the given concentration range.
3. Address any deviations or errors in the quality controls,
recalibrate, and rerun samples if necessary.
4. Reporting Results
5. Verify the calculated MMA concentrations.
6. Review for any quality control flags or deviations.
7. Report validated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
8. Include detailed notes if there are any deviations or aspects
needing attention.
9. Reference Intervals
• Normal ranges for MMA in urine samples, established by
validated the test method and clinical guidelines.
1. Quality Assurance
• Follow internal quality control procedures including routine
checks, maintenance of equipment and reagent batch verification.
• Document any irregularities or corrective actions taken during the
test process.
1. Safety and Precautions
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment while handling urine samples and
reagents.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to laboratory safety
regulations.
