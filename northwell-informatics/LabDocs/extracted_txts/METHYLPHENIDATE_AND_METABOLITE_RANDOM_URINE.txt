SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for Methylphenidate and Metabolite
Testing in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures for the detection and
quantification of methylphenidate and its metabolite in random urine
samples. Ensures accurate and reproducible results in compliance
with CLIA standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
implementing and adhering to the following procedures. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring the correct execution of protocols and
timely interventions in case of discrepancies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system.
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerator and freezer
Reagents:
• Methylphenidate and metabolite calibration standard solutions
• Internal standards
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile, water, formic
acid)
• Quality control samples (negative and positive controls)
Supplies:
• Urine collection containers
• Sample centrifuge tubes
• Sample vials
• Calibration curves for standard solutions
• Gloves and lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that the urine sample has been received and
accessioned properly.
2. Record the volume of the urine sample.
3. Mix sample well before aliquoting using a vortex mixer.
4. Aliquot 1 mL of urine sample into a labeled sample centrifuge
tube.
5. Add internal standard solution to each sample according to pre-
determined concentrations.
6. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer supernatant into a properly labeled vial for analysis.
B) Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration curves using methylphenidate and
metabolite standard solutions.
2. Run the standards through the LC-MS/MS system to ensure
proper setup.
3. Verify the calibration curve by checking for linearity and
accuracy as per site-specific guidelines.
C) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Load prepared samples, external controls, and standards into
the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Follow manufacturer-specific instructions for setting up the
chromatographic column and mobile phases.
3. Set MS detection parameters specific to methylphenidate and
its metabolite (e.g., ionization mode, collision energy).
4. Run the analysis following specified acquisition methods.
D) Quality Control:
1. Include negative and positive quality control samples in each
batch of the analysis.
2. Check all QC samples for accuracy and precision.
3. Document any deviations and initiate corrective actions if QC
samples fall outside acceptable limits.
E) Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Review chromatograms and MS/MS data for integration and
peak identification.
2. Quantify methylphenidate and its metabolite using calibration
curves.
3. Validate all results by ensuring proper internal standards
incorporation.
4. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
F) Troubleshooting:
1. Inspect samples identified with anomalies (e.g., unexpected
peaks, poor resolution).
2. Analyze QC samples to determine if analytical errors are
occurring.
3. If required, reanalyze the sample or perform a system check as
per manufacturer recommendations.
4. Document corrective actions taken on the temperature
monitoring log or appropriate records.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Results documentation:
• Results are transmitted to the LIS automatically.
• Review results for accuracy and consistency.
• Verify results in the LIS.
Reference Intervals: Refer to site-specific reference intervals for
methylphenidate and its metabolite.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Ensure continuous monitoring and documentation of all the analytical
procedures, maintain logs detailing sample preparation, instrument
calibration, data acquisition, and reporting.
All changes or maintenance to the analytical equipment must be
documented.
