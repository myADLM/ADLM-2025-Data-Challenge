Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Methylphenidate
Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for the quantitative measurement of
methylphenidate in serum, including sample preparation,
instrumentation used, quality control measures, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
Laboratory scientists are responsible for conducting the test
according to this SOP and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the
results. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring staff
adherence to the SOP and addressing any discrepancies or issues
during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separation tube
(SST).
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• After collection, allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes, then
centrifuge at 1,300-2,000 x g for 10 minutes.
• Serum should be separated from cells as soon as possible.
• Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C and can be
frozen at -20°C for up to 1 month.
Unaccepted Specimens:
• Plasma samples.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
Reagents:
• Methylphenidate standard solution
• Internal standard solution (e.g., deuterated methylphenidate)
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol, formic acid)
• Extraction reagents (e.g., protein precipitation solution or solid-
phase extraction (SPE) columns)
Supplies:
• Laboratory glassware
• Vials and caps for HPLC
• Microcentrifuge tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature if necessary.
2. Vortex the sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 0.5 mL of serum into a microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 50 µL of internal standard solution to each sample.
5. Add 1 mL of protein precipitation solution (e.g., acetonitrile).
6. Vortex for 30 seconds to mix.
7. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes.
8. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for HPLC analysis.
B. HPLC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Configure the HPLC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up the HPLC column with an appropriate mobile phase
(e.g., a gradient mixture of water with 0.1% formic acid and
acetonitrile).
3. Inject 10 µL of the prepared serum sample into the HPLC
system.
4. Run the sample through the HPLC-MS/MS system.
5. Quantify the methylphenidate concentration using a calibration
curve generated from methylphenidate standards.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Controls:
• Prepare quality control (QC) samples at three different
concentrations (low, medium, high) using pooled human serum.
• Run QC samples at the beginning and end of each batch and
after every ten samples.
Internal Standard:
• Ensure the consistent addition of internal standards to all
samples, standards, and QC samples to correct for extraction
efficiencies and instrumental variability.
Calibration Curve:
• Use a calibration curve with at least five concentrations of
methylphenidate standards, ranging from the lower limit of
quantification to higher than expected clinical levels.
• Verify linearity of the calibration curve and correlation coefficient (r
≥ 0.995).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Review:
• Check the chromatography and mass spectra for appropriate
peak shape and retention time.
• Ensure all controls are within acceptable limits before accepting
the run.
Result Calculation:
• Use the calibration curve to calculate the concentration of
methylphenidate in patient samples.
• Verify results against QC sample concentrations.
Documentation:
• Document all specimen processing and analysis details in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and verify results according to laboratory protocol before
releasing to the physician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
Reference Interval:
• As there are no universally established reference intervals for
methylphenidate, consult the latest clinical guidelines or
laboratory-specific reference intervals.
Critical Values:
• Notify the supervising clinician of any results that fall outside the
therapeutic range (typically this is interpreted based on clinical
judgment).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with the
assay.
• Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds must be
acknowledged, and confirmatory testing is advised if critical
results are obtained.
