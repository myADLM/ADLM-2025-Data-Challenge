Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP) Immunostain - Tech
Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for Methylthioadenosine
Phosphorylase (MTAP) Immunostain using tissue samples received
and accessioned in the laboratory. This will ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel trained
in performing MTAP immunostain analysis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP precisely and to ensure the integrity and traceability of the
test results. Any deviations or issues should be reported to the
laboratory supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
MTAP: Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase - an enzyme that can be
used as a biomarker for various cancers. Immunostain: A technique
used to visualize the presence and location of specific antigens in
tissues using labeled antibodies. MTAP Immunostain: A specific
immunostain test used to detect the presence of the MTAP enzyme in
tissue samples.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• MTAP Antibody (as specified by manufacturer)
• Secondary Antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) Substrate
• Mounting Medium
• Cover Slips
• Positive and Negative Control Slides
• Slide Storage Racks
• Xylene and Alcohol (for deparaffinization and rehydration)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Hematoxylin (for counterstaining)
• Slide Scanner or Microscope
1. REAGENTS
• Primary Antibody: Purchase from an authorized supplier, specific
for MTAP
• Secondary Antibody: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
• DAB Substrate Kit: Store as per manufacturer’s instructions
• Mounting Medium: Non-aqueous mounting medium
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Cut 4 μm thick sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks using a microtome.
2. Place sections on positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes to ensure adequate
adherence of the tissue.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols (100%, 95%,
70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2x 3 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a microwave or pressure cooker
method in 10 mM Citrate Buffer (pH 6.0) or as recommended by
the antibody manufacturer.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature.
D. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4. Incubate sections with the primary MTAP antibody at the
dilution and duration recommended by the manufacturer
(generally 60 minutes at room temperature).
5. Rinse slides in PBS for 3x 5 minutes.
6. Incubate sections with the appropriate HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature.
7. Rinse slides in PBS for 3x 5 minutes.
8. Develop the signal using DAB Substrate solution according to
manufacturer’s instructions (generally 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute, rinse in tap water.
2. Dehydrate slides in graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) for 3
minutes each.
3. Clear in xylene for 2x 5 minutes.
4. Mount coverslips using non-aqueous mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
7. Inspect control slides to ensure staining specificity and
sensitivity:
◦ Positive Control: MTAP positive tissue should show
appropriate specific staining without background.
◦ Negative Control: No staining should be seen in tissues
known to lack MTAP.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Scan or examine the stained slides under a microscope.
10. Evaluate the staining intensity and localization in the context of
the appropriate controls.
11. Record the results according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
12. Verify and transmit results to the Pathologist for final
interpretation.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Specific to the MTAP test depending on the diagnostic criteria set by
the clinical context and histopathological review.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the antibody manufacturer’s guidelines for troubleshooting
common issues such as non-specific staining, weak signals, or
antigen retrieval problems. Always consult with the laboratory
supervisor if issues persist.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain detailed records of:
• Specimen accession number
