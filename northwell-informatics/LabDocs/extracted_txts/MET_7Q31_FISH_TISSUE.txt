Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MET (7Q31), FISH Analysis
on Tissue Specimens
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for performing MET (7Q31)
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis on tissue
specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The primary objective is to
ensure accurate and reliable testing and result reporting for the
detection of MET gene amplification.
1. SCOPE
This procedure is intended for use by trained laboratory personnel
performing MET FISH analysis on tissue specimens. It provides
detailed instructions on specimen preparation, hybridization,
washing, and signal detection.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the FISH
analysis according to the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring compliance with the SOP
and for addressing any issues that may arise during the analysis
process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABLE
SPECIMENS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Fresh tissue specimens collected and processed according to
standard protocols.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with indications of improper fixation or preservation.
• FFPE tissue samples that show signs of degradation or have
incomplete clinical information.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• MET (7Q31) FISH probe set
• Microscope with fluorescence capability
• Hybridization oven
• Pretreatment reagents (e.g., Proteinase K, sodium chloride/
sodium citrate buffer)
• Wash buffers (e.g., SSC, NP40)
• Mounting medium
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Preparation
◦ Section tissue blocks at a thickness of 4-5 µm and mount
sections on glass slides.
◦ Bake slides at 56°C for 1 hour to ensure proper adherence.
3. Pretreatment
◦ Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 20 minutes followed by
rehydration through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) and
finally rinse in distilled water.
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using appropriate reagent (e.g.,
Proteinase K) and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Probe Hybridization
◦ Apply approximately 10 µL of MET FISH probe solution to
the target area on each tissue section.
◦ Cover with a glass coverslip and seal the edges with rubber
cement.
◦ Denature slides at 73°C for 5 minutes followed by
hybridization at 37°C overnight (12-16 hours) in a
hybridization chamber.
5. Post-hybridization Wash
◦ Remove coverslips carefully and rinse slides in washing
buffer to remove excess probe material.
◦ Perform stringency washes using SSC wash buffers at 45°C
followed by washes in NP40 buffer.
6. Detection and Signal Visualization
◦ Counterstain slides using DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole) for nuclear visualization.
◦ Mount coverslips using fluorescent mounting medium.
◦ View and analyze slides under a fluorescence microscope.
7. Interpretation and Scoring
◦ Evaluate signals in at least 50 non-overlapping nuclei per
specimen.
◦ Count MET signals and compare with control probe signals
to ascertain amplification.
8. Quality Control
◦ Include positive and negative control slides to ensure the
reliability of the FISH assay.
◦ Review signal patterns to confirm the accuracy of results.
◦ Document results and include QC outcomes.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the integrity and quality of FISH signals before reporting.
• Document MET FISH results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Include specific comments regarding observed amplification
status (e.g., amplified or non-amplified) and signal patterns.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• FISH analysis is dependent on specimen quality and appropriate
probe performance.
• Inaccurate results may arise from improper tissue handling,
fixation, or technical errors during the assay.

1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Address common issues such as weak signals or high
background by reviewing specimen preparation and pretreatment
protocols.
• Consult with supervisors and peers for advice on resolving
unusual signal patterns.
