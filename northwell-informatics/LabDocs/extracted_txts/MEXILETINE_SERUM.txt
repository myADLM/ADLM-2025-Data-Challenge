Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measuring Mexiletine
Levels in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedure for measuring mexiletine levels in
serum specimens to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all staff trained to perform mexiletine
measurements using the designated analytical instruments within the
clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the test
according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the staff
adheres to this SOP and for overseeing the maintenance and
validation of the equipment used.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: Collect blood in a red-top tube (no anticoagulants) or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1,500 g to separate serum.
◦ Transfer the serum into a sterile, labeled polypropylene tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum is required for analysis.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens exhibiting hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Serum collected in anticoagulants other than specified.
• Serum samples that have been stored at room temperature for
over 48 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) instrument.
• Mexiletine-specific reagent kit.
• Quality control materials (2 levels: low and high controls).
• Calibrators and traceable standards.
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles.
• Calibration and maintenance logs for the LC-MS/MS.
• Laboratory Timer.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
1. Allow the reagents, calibrators, and quality control materials to
reach room temperature.
2. Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Perform a daily calibration using traceable standards.
4. Run two levels of quality control materials to ensure the system
is running correctly and within acceptable limits:
◦ Low Control
◦ High Control
6.2 Patient Sample Analysis:
1. Label the aliquot of serum with the appropriate patient
identification.
2. Load the sample into the LC-MS/MS system maintaining the
order of the worklist.
3. Start the analysis according to the pre-programmed method for
mexiletine.
6.3 Post-Analysis Duties:
1. Review results to ensure they are within the expected range.
2. Validate the run by confirming Quality Control results are within
acceptable limits.
3. Record the patient's results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Note and report any critical values immediately to the ordering
clinician according to laboratory policy.
5. If an error occurs or a result is outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot following the provided diagnostic protocols or
notify the supervisor.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control testing at the start of each run, after any
calibration or repair, and at specified intervals throughout the
working day.
• Document all quality control results and corrective actions taken
in the QC log.
• If QC results fall outside of acceptable limits, re-calibrate the
instrument, re-prepare QC samples, and re-run affected patient
samples.
8. MAINTENANCE
• Perform and document routine maintenance as outlined in the
manufacturer's manual.
• Maintain logs of daily, monthly, and annual maintenance activities.
• Validate the instrument after each maintenance or repair
procedure.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify all results manually or through the LIS.
2. Ensure that results are transmitted to the appropriate electronic
medical records system accurately.
3. Notify the ordering healthcare provider immediately of any
critical values.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Analyze samples using LC-MS/MS due to its specificity and
sensitivity for mexiletine.
• Hemolyzed specimens may affect the accuracy of the results and
should be avoided.
