Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for MGMT PROMOTER
METHYLATION, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for MGMT promoter methylation in tumor
samples. This SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results
for the detection of MGMT promoter methylation status, which is
critical for determining therapeutic strategies in oncology.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure and ensuring the integrity of the analytical process.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and addressing any deviations promptly.
1. DEFINITIONS
MGMT Promoter Methylation: The methylation of the promoter region
of the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene,
which can be indicative of tumor response to alkylating agents.

1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction from Tumor Tissue:
1. Use the designated DNA extraction kit and follow the
manufacturer's instructions to extract DNA from the tumor
tissue sample.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer to
ensure it meets the required concentration and quality
standards for downstream analysis.
3. Document the DNA concentration and quality assessment
results.
B. Bisulfite Conversion:
1. Perform bisulfite conversion on the extracted DNA using the
designated bisulfite conversion kit, following the manufacturer's
protocol.
2. Verify successful bisulfite conversion through QC checks as per
the kit instructions.
3. Document the bisulfite conversion process and any QC results.
C. Real-Time PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix using the MGMT-specific primers
and probes in designated nuclease-free conditions.
2. Aliquot the bisulfite-converted DNA into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add the PCR master mix to each tube or well, ensuring proper
mixing and avoiding contamination.
4. Seal the tubes or plates and centrifuge briefly to collect the
contents at the bottom.
D. Real-Time PCR:
1. Load the sealed PCR tubes or plates into the real-time PCR
instrument.
2. Select the appropriate assay parameters and thermal cycling
conditions specific to MGMT promoter methylation detection.
3. Monitor the amplification process and ensure the real-time PCR
instrument records fluorescence intensity data.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Analyze the real-time PCR data using the instrument's software
to determine the methylation status of the MGMT promoter.
2. Confirm the presence or absence of methylation by comparing
sample data to positive and negative controls.
3. Calculate the percentage of methylation if applicable and
interpret the clinical significance.
4. Document the results and ensure proper data storage and
security.
F. Quality Control:
1. Perform regular QC checks on equipment, reagents, and
analytical processes to ensure standardization and reliability.
2. Record and address any deviations or equipment malfunctions
immediately.
3. Validate new batches of reagents and primers according to
laboratory protocols before use in the procedure.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Documenting Results:
1. Ensure all results are accurately recorded in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Review the results for any inconsistencies or errors.
3. Provide a detailed report including the methylation status and
its clinical implications for the patient’s therapeutic strategy.
B. Reviewing and Verifying Results:
1. The technologist reviews the generated results for accuracy
and completeness.
2. Verify that the controls performed as expected and that all QC
criteria are met.
3. A supervisor double-checks the results for final validation.
C. Reporting to Clinician:
1. Report the validated results to the requesting clinician promptly.
2. Include any relevant notes or comments regarding the sample
integrity or analytical observations.
D. Retaining Records:
1. All analytical records and results should be retained as per the
laboratory’s documentation policy.
2. Ensure secure and organized storage of records for future
reference and quality audits.
