Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for MI-
HEART CERAMIDES, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE: To ensure accurate, precise, and reliable
measurement of ceramide levels in plasma to assist in the
diagnosis and management of myocardial infarction (MI) risk.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing analytical tests and ensuring the accuracy of results.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and validating results, and
implementing corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS: MI-HEART Ceramides - A set of ceramide lipid
species used as biomarkers for assessing the risk of
myocardial infarction.
2. PROCEDURE:
A) Equipment and Materials:
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Plasma specimens
• Reagent kits specific to MI-HEART Ceramide analysis
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Sample vials (glass or compatible polymeric material)
• Calibration standards and internal standards
• Sample preparation buffer
• Mobile phase solvents (HPLC grade or better)
• Quality control (QC) materials
B) Plasma Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure the specimen has arrived within the acceptable time
frame and is adequately labeled.
2. Centrifuge the plasma specimen at 1500xg for 10 minutes at
4°C to remove any particulates. Ensure that the plasma is clear
before proceeding.
3. Transfer the supernatant plasma into a clean sample vial.
4. If the specimen has been refrigerated or frozen, bring to room
temperature before analysis.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards and QC samples according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Process the calibration standards, QC samples, and patient
samples in the same manner.
3. Include one blank and at least two levels of QC samples in
each analytical run.
D) Sample Analysis:
1. Vortex the sample, calibration, and QC vials to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Load the prepared samples into the LC-MS system.
3. Set the LC-MS parameters as per the manufacturer's
instructions specific to ceramide analysis.
4. Ensure the column temperature, flow rate, and gradient
conditions are optimal for ceramide separation.
5. Inject the samples and start the run.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatographic data using appropriate software
provided by the LC-MS system.
2. Calculate the concentrations of ceramides in the samples using
the calibration curve.
3. Review the results for the QC samples to ensure they fall within
the acceptable range.
4. Validate the patient results based on the QC sample
performance.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure that critical results are flagged and transmitted to the
appropriate healthcare provider promptly.
3. Adhere to confidentiality and data integrity protocols during data
handling and reporting.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
5. Utilize internal standards to monitor system performance.
6. Analyze QC materials at the beginning and end of each run to
verify system appropriateness.
7. Implement corrective actions if QC samples fall outside the
acceptable range.
