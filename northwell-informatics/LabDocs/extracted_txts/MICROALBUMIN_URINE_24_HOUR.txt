Protocol for the Analysis of Microalbumin in 24-Hour Urine
Samples
1. PURPOSE To provide the procedure for accurate and reliable
measurement of microalbumin in 24-hour urine samples.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis of microalbumin in 24-hour urine
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all personnel are trained
and for monitoring adherence to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Specimen: 24-hour urine collection.
• Collection: Ensure thorough mixing before taking an aliquot.
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL is required for analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical balance.
• Centrifuge.
• Microalbumin reagent kit (specific to the analyzer being used,
e.g., Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay [CMIA]).
• Urine cups.
• Standard laboratory glassware.
• Pipettes and tips.
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Label the sample with patient details and date/time of collection
completion.
2. Store the specimen at 2-8°C until analysis if not analyzed
immediately.
3. Mix the 24-hour urine thoroughly before taking an aliquot.
Analysis Procedure
1. Preparation: a. Ensure all reagents and the urine sample are
at room temperature before analysis. b. Calibrate the analyzer
according to manufacturer specifications using the provided
standards.
2. Loading Sample: a. Centrifuge the urine sample at 2000 rpm
for 10 minutes to remove particulate matter. b. Pipette the
required volume of supernatant (as specified by the reagent kit/
procedure) into a sample cup.
3. Analyzer Setup: a. Load the prepared sample into the
appropriate analyzer. b. Input the required information into the
analyzer, including sample ID and test type.
4. Testing: a. Initiate the test according to the analyzer’s
operating instructions. b. Allow the analyzer to process the
sample and generate results.
5. Reporting Results: a. Once the analysis is complete, review
the results for any flags or error messages. b. Document the
results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control (QC) samples with known concentrations of
microalbumin alongside patient samples.
2. Acceptable ranges should be established by the laboratory and
any out-of-range results investigated.
3. Document all QC results and corrective actions taken if controls
are outside acceptable limits.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal: <30 mg/24 hours
• Microalbuminuria: 30-300 mg/24 hours
• Macroalbuminuria: >300 mg/24 hours
9. LIMITATIONS
• Physical exercise, urinary tract infections, hematuria, and other
interferences may cause elevated results.
• Improper collection, handling, or storage of samples may affect
results.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent kit insert or analyzer manual for specific
limitations regarding reagent stability, detection limits, and any
potential interferences.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING
• Record test results in LIS.
• Maintain logs of QC records, calibration records, and any
maintenance performed on the analyzer.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer instructions for the specific microalbumin reagent
kit.
• Analyzer operating manual.
• Laboratory Quality Management documentation.
