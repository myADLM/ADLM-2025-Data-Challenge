Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for MICROALBUMIN, URINE, TIMED
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical phase protocol for the quantitative
determination of microalbumin in a timed urine sample. The purpose
of this document is to provide standardized procedures ensuring
accuracy and consistency in test results.
Responsibility:
Certified laboratory staff are responsible for performing urine
microalbumin analysis as defined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure the accuracy of test results and to
identify and correct any issues during testing.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Timed urine collection (e.g. 24-hour urine collection)
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen: 24-hour urine collection
• Instructions for patient: • Collect all urine voided for a specified
period (e.g., 24 hours). • Store the urine in a provided container
and keep refrigerated during the collection period. • Note the start
and end times of the urine collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no collection start/end times indicated.
• Specimens with visible contamination or not stored properly.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Urine dipstick (for preliminary screening)
• Analyzer (e.g., Immunoturbidimetric or Nephelometric analyzer)
• Micropipette and tips
Reagents:
• Microalbumin reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls (for quality control)
Supplies:
• Timed urine collection containers
• Test tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Verify that specimen collection times are indicated and that the
specimen is properly labeled.
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of
albumin.
Preliminary Screening:
• Perform a urine dipstick test to screen for the presence of
albumin.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge an aliquot of the mixed urine sample at 3000 rpm for
5 minutes to remove any particulate matter.
2. Transfer a specified volume (e.g., 100 µL) of the clear
supernatant to a test tube.
Reagent and Analyzer Setup:
1. Refer to the instructions of the microalbumin reagent kit for
preparation.
2. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators.
3. Prepare quality control materials as per kit instructions.
Analysis:
1. Load the prepared urine sample, calibrators, and quality control
samples onto the analyzer.
2. Run the analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Record the results, including any QC data, to ensure validity
and accuracy.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control measures once per day of use and with
every new batch of reagents.
• Utilize both high and low-level controls.
• Document QC results. If control results fall outside acceptable
ranges, investigate and repeat the analysis before proceeding
with patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• The technologist must review and verify the results before
releasing them to ensure accuracy.
• Report microalbumin results in mg/L and calculate the albumin
excretion rate in mg/24 hours using the reported urine volume.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Range: <30 mg/24 hours
• Microalbuminuria: 30-300 mg/24 hours
• Clinical Albuminuria: >300 mg/24 hours
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper specimen collection and handling to avoid pre-
analytical errors.
• High concentrations of substances such as hemoglobin may
interfere with test results.
• Extreme pH or specific gravity variations may also affect the
accuracy of results.
