Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Microhematocrit Results for Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to define the
standard operating procedures (SOPs) for performing
microhematocrit tests on various body fluids, ensuring
accuracy, reliability, and uniformity in test results as well as
ensuring compliance with Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the medical
laboratory scientists to perform microhematocrit testing and to
ensure proper documentation in accordance with this SOP.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring all
personnel are trained and competent in these procedures.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY 3.1. Specimen
Types:
◦ Pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, synovial fluid,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), etc. 3.2. Collection Method:
◦ Collected in sterile containers without anticoagulants. 3.3.
Specimen Stability:
◦ Specimens must be analyzed within 2 hours of collection; if
delayed, the samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
tested within 24 hours.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES 4.1. Equipment
◦ Microhematocrit centrifuge
◦ Hematocrit capillary tubes
◦ Clay sealant for sealing capillary tubes
◦ Microhematocrit reader
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE) 4.2. Reagents
◦ None 4.3. Supplies
◦ Sterile specimen containers
◦ Fine point permanent marker
◦ Quality control materials (low and high hematocrit controls)
5. PROCEDURE 5.1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all safety equipment, such as gloves, lab coat, and
eyewear, is worn.
◦ Label the capillary tubes with the patient’s identification
number. 5.2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the body fluid sample by gentle inversion.
◦ Using a capillary tube, fill it 2/3 to 3/4 with the sample
through capillary action.
◦ Seal one end of the capillary tube with clay sealant. 5.3.
Centrifugation:
◦ Place the sealed capillary tubes in the microhematocrit
centrifuge, ensuring balance.
◦ Centrifuge at 10,000 to 12,000 RPM for 5 minutes, or as
recommended by the centrifuge manufacturer. 5.4. Reading
Results:
◦ Remove the capillary tubes from the centrifuge carefully.
◦ Place the tube on the microhematocrit reader.
◦ Align the top of the clay plug with the “0” mark and read the
value at the top of the plasma meniscus.
◦ Record the hematocrit percentage for each sample. 5.5.
Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control (QC) on each day of testing or per
shift with known low and high hematocrit controls.
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat until acceptable results are obtained.
6. REPORTING RESULTS 6.1. Ensure results are documented
properly in the lab information system (LIS). 6.2. Review results
for consistency. 6.3. Immediately inform the requested
healthcare provider of any critically high or low results, per
laboratory policy. 6.4. Follow lab’s protocol for verifying,
approving, and electronically logging results.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS (General Guidance)
• Reference intervals may vary based on fluid type and clinical
context.
• Establish specific reference intervals based on lab historical data
and validation studies.
1. LIMITATIONS 8.1. Any presence of hemolysis may affect
accuracy. 8.2. Delay in testing samples beyond recommended
stability may invalidate results. 8.3. Excessive sample agitation
may cause cellular disruption leading to inaccurate readings.
8.4. Sample contamination can alter results.
2. TROUBLESHOOTING 9.1. If the microhematocrit centrifuge
does not operate, verify power supply or call for maintenance.
9.2. If capillary tubes break during centrifugation, ensure proper
balance and even loading distribution. 9.3. Recheck any
unusual or unexpected results with a fresh aliquot of the
sample.
3. TRAINING AND COMPETENCY All personnel performing
microhematocrit testing must undergo training and demonstrate
competency before performing tests independently. Continuous
competency assessment is required biannually.
4. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION 11.1. Maintain records of
QC results, patient results, maintenance logs, and calibrations
as required by CLIA. 11.2. Ensure all results and documentation
are accurately logged in the LIS.
5. REFERENCES 12.1. Manufacturer’s Manual for
Microhematocrit Centrifuge. 12.2. Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. 12.3. CLIA guidelines.
6. AMENDMENTS AND REVIEWS This SOP should be reviewed
annually or as needed based on regulation updates, equipment
changes, or procedural improvements. Changes should be
documented and approved by laboratory management.

of body fluids, contributing to high-quality patient care and laboratory
compliance.
