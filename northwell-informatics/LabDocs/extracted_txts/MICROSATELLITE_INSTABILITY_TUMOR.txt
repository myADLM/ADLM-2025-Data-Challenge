Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Microsatellite Instability (MSI) Testing in Tumor Samples
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and reliable protocol for performing
Microsatellite Instability (MSI) testing in tumor samples. The objective
is to identify defects in mismatch repair (MMR) genes which may
influence therapy decisions and provide insight into the genetic
predisposition to Lynch syndrome.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of MSI testing on tumor specimens in the Molecular
Pathology Laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated Molecular Pathology
Technologist to perform MSI testing according to this SOP. Quality
control and assurance will be overseen by the laboratory supervisor.
Any deviations or issues encountered must be documented and
reported to the supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• MSI: Microsatellite Instability – a condition of genetic
hypermutability that results from impaired DNA mismatch repair
(MMR).
• MMR: Mismatch Repair – a system within the cell for correcting
errors that occur during DNA replication.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction – a method used to amplify
DNA.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal Cycler
• Electrophoresis apparatus (e.g., capillary electrophoresis)
• DNA extraction kit
• Primers for MSI markers (e.g., BAT-25, BAT-26, D2S123,
D5S346, D17S250)
• PCR reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffers)
• Positive and negative control samples
• Computer with appropriate software for results analysis
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction
1. Isolate DNA from both normal and tumor tissue samples using
a validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer (e.g.,
NanoDrop) and ensure an adequate quantity and quality for
downstream applications.
6.2. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix using the following components per
reaction:
◦ DNA template: 50-100ng
◦ Primer pairs specific for MSI markers (e.g., BAT-25, BAT-26,
D2S123, D5S346, D17S250)
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTPs mix
◦ Taq polymerase
◦ Distilled water to final volume
2. Load the reaction mixture into the thermal cycler and use the
following PCR cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 min
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 sec
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 sec
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 sec
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 min
6.3. Electrophoresis and Data Analysis
1. Separate the PCR products using capillary electrophoresis.
2. Run the control samples (positive and negative) alongside
patient samples to ensure the accuracy and validation of the
run.
3. Analyze PCR products using appropriate software to determine
the size of microsatellite alleles.
4. Compare allele sizes in tumor DNA to those in matched normal
DNA.
6.4. Interpretation of Results
1. An MSI-High (MSI-H) status is typically indicated by instability
in 2 or more of the 5 markers tested.
2. An MSS (Microsatellite Stable) status will show no instability in
any of the markers.
3. If only one marker shows instability, the result is typically
classified as MSI-L (Low).
4. Document and report results according to laboratory protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Use validated control samples in each run to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to maintain
high standards of testing accuracy.
3. Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment as per
manufacturer specifications.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results will be reviewed and verified by the Molecular Pathologist
prior to release. Positive MSI results must include a note advising
correlation with clinical and other laboratory data for comprehensive
patient care management. All data will be uploaded to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for record keeping.

Standards Institute (CLSI), and relevant published literature on MSI
testing.
10. REVISION
This protocol is subject to annual review and revisions to incorporate
any new scientific findings, technological advancements, or
regulatory updates.
