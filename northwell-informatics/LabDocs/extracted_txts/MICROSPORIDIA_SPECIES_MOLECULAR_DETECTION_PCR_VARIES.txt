Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MICROSPORIDIA
SPECIES, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of
Microsporidia species using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
technique in clinical specimens. This procedure ensures accurate
and reliable results by defining the reagents, equipment, and
methods used.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the PCR test for the detection of
Microsporidia species are responsible for following this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel are
trained and competent in this procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh stool samples
• Tissue biopsies
• Respiratory samples (e.g., sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage)
• Urine samples
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in non-sterile containers
• Specimens with improper or no labeling
• Specimens that have been at room temperature for more than 24
hours
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Biological safety cabinet
• Centrifuge
• PCR thermal cycler
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV transilluminator
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit specific to the sample type (e.g., stool, tissue)
• PCR master mix
• Microsporidia-specific primers
• Nuclease-free water
• Agarose
• Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
• DNA ladder (molecular weight marker)
5. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
suitable for the sample type.
2. Ensure that all specimens are handled in a biological safety
cabinet during processing.
3. Extract DNA from approximately 200 mg of stool, tissue, or
appropriate volume of respiratory or urine sample.
4. Elute the extracted DNA in a final volume of 50 µL of elution
buffer or nuclease-free water.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, including the following components:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTP mix
◦ MgCl2
◦ Taq DNA polymerase
◦ Forward and reverse primers specific for Microsporidia
species
◦ Nuclease-free water
2. Add 2 µL of the extracted DNA template to each PCR tube
containing the master mix.
3. Include a positive control (known Microsporidia DNA) and a
negative control (nuclease-free water) in each run.
4. Mix the contents of each PCR tube by gently tapping or
vortexing, then spin down briefly in a centrifuge.
C) PCR Thermal Cycling:
1. Place the PCR tubes in the thermal cycler.
2. Run the PCR program with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
D) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or
alternative DNA stain.
2. Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into each well
of the agarose gel.
3. Include a DNA ladder in one well to serve as a molecular weight
marker.
4. Run the gel at 100V for 60 minutes.
5. Visualize the bands under UV light using a transilluminator.
E) Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the bands from the samples to the bands from the
positive control and DNA ladder.
2. Presence of a band at the expected size for Microsporidia
species indicates a positive result.
3. Absence of any band in the negative control validates the test
run.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with every batch of samples
to verify the accuracy of the PCR.
2. Record all control results in the laboratory logbook.
3. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of all equipment
used in the PCR process.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the results of each PCR run, including sample
identification and interpretation of results.
2. Report all positive and negative results to the ordering
physician or appropriate clinical personnel.
3. Include a note on any sample or run where technical issues
were identified, and retesting may be necessary.
