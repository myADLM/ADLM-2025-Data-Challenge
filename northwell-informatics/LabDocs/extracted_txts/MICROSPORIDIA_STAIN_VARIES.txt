Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Microsporidia Stain,
Varies Laboratory Section: Microbiology Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Reviewed Date: [Insert Date]
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
steps for conducting a Microsporidia stain on various
specimens to detect the presence of microsporidia species.
This protocol is applicable to stool, urine, duodenal contents,
respiratory specimens, and tissue sections.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing microsporidia
stains are responsible for following this SOP to ensure consistent and
accurate results.
1. SCOPE: This procedure is applicable to the Microbiology
Laboratory and is to be followed by all trained laboratory
personnel who are responsible for the preparation, staining,
and microscopic examination of specimens submitted for
Microsporidia detection.
2. SPECIMEN: Specimen Types:
• Stool
• Urine
• Duodenal contents
• Respiratory specimens (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage)
• Tissue sections
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Specimens must be properly labeled with patient identification
and date/time of collection.
• Stool specimens should be collected in a clean, dry, leak-proof
container and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible.
• Urine specimens should be collected as a clean catch or
midstream specimen in a sterile container.
• Duodenal contents should be collected via endoscopy.
• Respiratory specimens should be collected in sterile containers.
• Tissue sections should be fixed in formalin and processed for
histology.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Light microscope with 100X oil immersion objective
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Stains: a. Modified trichrome stain b. Calcofluor white stain
(optional)
• Immersion oil
• Positive and negative control slides
• Staining rack
• Forceps
• Absorbent paper
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE: A. Preparation of Specimen Smear:
2. Use an applicator stick or pipette to place a small amount of
specimen (e.g., stool, urine, duodenal fluid) on a clean glass
slide.
3. Spread the specimen to form a thin smear and allow it to air dry
completely.
4. For tissue sections, ensure they are mounted on slides and
fixed appropriately.
B. Staining with Modified Trichrome Stain:
1. Fix the air-dried smear or tissue section on the slide by placing
it in a fixative solution for 5 minutes.
2. Remove the slide from the fixative and place it on a staining
rack.
3. Flood the slide with the modified trichrome stain and stain for
10 minutes.
4. Gently rinse the slide with distilled water until no stain remains
in the wash.
5. Differentiate the stain by dipping the slide in acid alcohol for 3-5
seconds.
6. Rinse the slide briefly with distilled water.
7. Counterstain the slide with a light green or another appropriate
counterstain for 1-2 minutes.
8. Rinse the slide with distilled water and allow it to air dry.
C. Optional Calcofluor White Stain:
1. Prepare the Calcofluor white stain according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply the stain to the fixed smear or tissue section and
incubate for 10 minutes in the dark.
3. Rinse the slide with distilled water and allow it to air dry.
4. Examine the slide under a fluorescence microscope.
D. Microscopic Examination:
1. Place a drop of immersion oil on the stained smear and cover
with a coverslip.
2. Examine the slide under a light microscope using the 100X oil
immersion objective.
3. Scan the entire slide systematically for the presence of
microsporidia spores, characterized by their small size (1-2 µm)
and distinctive internal structure.
4. Record findings noting the presence or absence of
microsporidia and any relevant morphological details.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Process positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient slides.
• Ensure that the staining protocol is followed accurately.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during staining
and microscopy.
• Review and verify results by a senior technologist or laboratory
supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Record the presence or absence of microsporidia spores in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Provide the results to the requesting physician, including any
relevant comments or interpretive notes.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Negative: No microsporidia spores observed.
• Positive: Presence of microsporidia spores observed; report with
a description of the number and appearance of spores.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Staining quality may affect the visibility of microsporidia spores;
ensure proper staining technique.
• Interpretation of results requires expertise in identifying
microsporidia; ensure personnel are adequately trained.
