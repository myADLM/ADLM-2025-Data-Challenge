Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Midazolam (Versed), Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
standardized procedures for the analysis of Midazolam
(Versed) levels in serum samples in order to generate accurate
and reliable results. This includes the preparation, processing,
analysis, and reporting of results for Midazolam in serum.
Responsibility: Laboratory personnel trained in the handling,
processing, and analysis of serum samples are responsible for
following this SOP. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
compliance and documentation of all procedures outlined in this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable: - 2 mL
serum collected in a plain red-top tube or a serum separator
tube (SST), separated from the cells as soon as possible
(within 2 hours of collection).
Unacceptable: - Specimens with visible hemolysis. - Specimens
that have been stored at room temperature for more than 24
hours. - Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants
(e.g., EDTA, heparin).
Storage: - Serum specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to
48 hours. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Standard reference material of Midazolam
◦ Appropriate solvents and reagents for sample preparation
and analysis (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile, water, buffer
solutions)
◦ Calibrators and quality control (QC) samples
◦ Laboratory glassware (e.g., vials, tubes, volumetric flasks)
3. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation: 1. Thaw frozen serum
samples at room temperature, if applicable. 2. Vortex each
sample for approximately 1 minute to ensure homogeneity. 3.
Centrifuge samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
any residual cells or particulate matter. 4. Transfer an
appropriate aliquot of the serum (e.g., 200 μL) to a clean glass
vial. 5. Add internal standard (if used) and an appropriate
volume of extraction solvent (e.g., methanol or acetonitrile) at a
volume ratio of 1:3 (serum:solvent). 6. Vortex the mixture for 2
minutes. 7. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
8. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean vial or tube. 9. If
further purification is required, perform solid-phase extraction
(SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) as per laboratory
protocols.
B. Calibration and Quality Control: 1. Prepare calibration
standards of Midazolam at appropriate concentrations from the
standard reference material. 2. Prepare QC samples at low,
medium, and high concentrations within the calibration range.
3. Analyze a set of calibration standards and QC samples
before and after the batch of unknown samples. 4. Ensure that
calibration standards and QC samples meet acceptance criteria
(e.g., calibration curve correlation coefficient ≥ 0.995, QC
samples within ±15% of nominal concentration).
C. Analytical Procedure (Using HPLC or LC-MS): 1. Set up the
HPLC or LC-MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 2. Inject an appropriate volume (e.g., 10 μL) of
each sample, calibrator, and QC into the system. 3. Follow the
instrument-specific analysis method to separate and quantify
Midazolam in the serum samples. 4. Ensure that the system
suitability criteria are met (e.g., resolution, sensitivity,
reproducibility). 5. Calculate the concentrations of Midazolam in
the serum samples based on the calibration curve.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review data for accuracy and integrity.
◦ Ensure all results fall within the dynamic range of the
method.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify results according to laboratory verification protocols.
◦ Report critical values as necessary following laboratory
policy.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include at least one set of QC samples (low, medium, high)
in each analytical run.
◦ Monitor control chart trends and take corrective action when
QC results exceed acceptable limits.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of analytical
instruments as per manufacturer's recommendations.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Therapeutic: 0.04 – 0.24 µg/mL (typical therapeutic range)
◦ Toxic: ≥ 0.5 µg/mL (toxic level, interpretation should consider
clinical context)
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the specific method or
instrumentation insert for potential interferences, matrix effects,
and specific analyte limitations.
8. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instrument and reagent inserts
◦ Relevant clinical guidelines and publications on Midazolam
testing
9. DOCUMENT CONTROL Ensure that all steps, samples,
calibrators, QC, and results are documented accurately and
retained according to the laboratory’s record retention policy.
Periodic review and updates of this SOP to maintain
compliance with regulatory and accreditation standards.
