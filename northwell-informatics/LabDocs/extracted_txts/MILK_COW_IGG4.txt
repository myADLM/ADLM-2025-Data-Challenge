Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: MILK COW
IGG4
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized steps for the analytical phase of generating
results for Milk Cow IGG4 testing.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory staff are responsible for performing the Milk Cow
IGG4 test following this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that staff adhere to the established procedures, and for
verifying and authorizing test results.
1. DEFINITION
Milk Cow IGG4 is used to detect specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)
antibodies to cow’s milk proteins, typically used in allergy testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader
• Milk Cow IGG4 assay kit (e.g., ELISA)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the Milk Cow IGG4 assay
• Microplate washer (if using ELISA)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Incubation equipment (e.g., water baths, ovens)
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and other PPE
• Appropriate waste disposal containers
Storage Conditions:
• Store kits and reagents according to manufacturer specifications,
typically 2-8°C for most ELISA kits
• Store calibrators and controls under specified conditions, typically
stated in the insert
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen: Serum or plasma Collection volume: Minimum 1
mL Stability: Store serum/plasma for up to 7 days at 2-8°C or freeze
at -20°C for longer storage. Labeling: Specimens must be clearly
labeled with patient ID, date, and time of collection
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolysed or lipemic samples
• Specimens with incomplete or unclear labeling
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify specimen integrity and appropriateness
2. Ensure specimens meet storage and labeling requirements
3. Allow any refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature
before testing
Preparation of Controls and Calibrators:
1. Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions
2. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before beginning
the assay
Assay Procedure: Using ELISA:
1. Set up the microplate and dispense specified volumes of
reagents as per the kit instructions
2. Add serum/plasma specimens to wells following the layout plan
3. Incubate the plate as per kit instructions (typically 37°C for
specified time)
4. Wash the plate using appropriate microplate washer; follow the
manufacturer's washing procedure
5. Add conjugate and incubate; follow with additional washes
6. Add substrate and develop color as specified; monitor
incubation times
7. Stop the reaction with the appropriate stop solution once
optimal color development has been reached
8. Read plate using the ELISA reader at the specified wavelength
Using Automated Analyzers:
1. Load serum/plasma specimens into analyzer sample trays
2. Program the analyzer according to the Milk Cow IGG4 assay
protocol provided by the manufacturer
3. Run the assay and follow prompts for adding reagents and
verifying results
Trouble-shooting steps:
• If QC results fall outside specified limits, stop the assay and check
all reagents and equipment. Repeat assay after resolving issues.
• Report and document any irregularities and notify the supervisor
immediately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Quality control samples are included with each assay run.
Procedure:
1. Run quality control samples in parallel with patient specimens
for each batch.
2. Verify that QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
3. Document QC results according to site-specific guidelines;
investigate out-of-range results and repeat the assay as
necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines:
1. Report quantitative results for Milk Cow IGG4 via the laboratory
information system (LIS)
2. Verified results should be reviewed and authorized by the
qualified supervisor before release
Reference Intervals: Follow the manufacturer’s reference intervals
and document for reporting purposes.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Milk Cow IGG4 assay kit insert for limitations of the
assay, including factors that may interfere with IGG4 detection.
1. REFERENCES
Include manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for Milk Cow
IGG4 assay kits utilized.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All steps taken within the analytical phase should be documented
appropriately in laboratory records and logs. Ensure proper
documentation of any deviations from the SOP and the subsequent
corrective measures taken.
This procedure ensures conformity with CLIA standards and provides
reliable, accurate results for Milk Cow IGG4 testing.
