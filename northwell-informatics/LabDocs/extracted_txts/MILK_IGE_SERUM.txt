Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Milk Allergy (IgE) Testing in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical procedures required for the
quantitative determination of Milk-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
levels in serum samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or other approved methods. The results generated will
aid in the diagnosis of milk allergies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory scientist or
technician to follow this procedure and ensure the accuracy and
validity of the test results. Additionally, it is the collective responsibility
of the laboratory staff to report and address any issues or deviations
from the standard protocol to the supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Automated Plate Washer
• Microplate Reader (capable of reading at 450 nm and 620 nm)
• Calibrated reference standards and controls
• Timer
• Assay buffer and diluents
• Milk-specific IgE ELISA kit or equivalent
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
• Serum must be centrifuged and separated from clot within 2 hours
of collection
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Plasma samples
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA, citrate,
or heparin
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples stored at 2-8°C are stable for up to 7 days.
• For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
2. Mix by gentle inversion, avoiding foam formation.
3. Centrifuge samples at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
4. Label all standards, controls, and patient samples clearly.
4.2 ASSAY PROCEDURE
1. Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples into
respective wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Add 100 µL of assay buffer to each well.
3. Incubate the plate for 2 hours at room temperature while
shaking gently.
4. Wash the wells 5 times using an automated plate washer with
the wash buffer provided in the kit.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature while shaking
gently.
7. Wash the wells again 5 times as before.
8. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
11. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader,
with a reference wavelength of 620 nm.
4.3 QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Ensure that control values are within the expected ranges.
3. If the controls fall outside the expected ranges, do not report
patient results. Investigate and address any issues before
repeating the assay.
4.4 RESULT CALCULATION AND REPORTING
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards and plot absorbance against concentration.
3. Interpolate the IgE concentrations of the patient samples from
the standard curve.
4. Multiply any dilutions by the appropriate dilution factor.
5. Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Reference Intervals:
• 0-0.35 kU/L: Negative
• 0.35-0.70 kU/L: Low positive
• 0.70-3.50 kU/L: Moderate positive
• 3.50 kU/L: High positive
1. LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens may occur.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may yield inaccurate results.
• Variations in technique and execution timing can affect the assay
outcome.
