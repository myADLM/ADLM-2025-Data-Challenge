Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MILK, PROCESSED,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the analysis and generation of results for Milk, Processed, IgE in
serum specimens. The procedure ensures consistency, reliability, and
accuracy in testing Milk, Processed, IgE levels in patient serum
samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis of Milk, Processed, IgE, and generate results
following this SOP. All personnel must be trained and competent in
the procedure.
3. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of Milk, Processed, IgE in human
serum specimens within the certified laboratory.
4. DATA SOURCES
• Specimen: Human serum
• Equipment: Immunoassay analyzer
• Reagents and Supplies: IgE assay kits, controls, calibrators, and
consumables required for the immunoassay
• Calibration Standards and QC Materials
5. PROCEDURE
A. PRE-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Specimen Handling and Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Accept only non-hemolyzed, non-lipemic, and non-icteric
serum samples.
◦ Specimens must be properly labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes
at room temperature within 2 hours of collection to obtain
serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a properly labeled secondary tube if
necessary, and store at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed (up to
72 hours). For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
2. Equipment Preparation:
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and that
daily maintenance is performed as per manufacturer
guidelines.
◦ Document any equipment malfunctions and notify the
supervisor.
B. ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Preparation of Reagents and Controls:
◦ Prepare reagent, control, and calibrator solutions according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Calibrators and controls must be brought to room
temperature before usage.
◦ Thoroughly mix all reagents, controls, and calibrators by
gentle inversion.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer with each new lot of
reagents or as recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Perform calibration verification with each run; acceptable
limits for calibration are as specified in the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze at least two levels of quality control (positive and
negative) at the beginning of each run, after calibrations,
and at the end of each run.
◦ QC Acceptance Criteria: Results must fall within the
laboratory’s established control ranges.
◦ Record all QC results and take corrective actions if QC fails.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load prepared specimen aliquots, calibrators, and controls
onto the immunoassay analyzer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Select the specific assay for Milk, Processed, IgE on the
analyzer.
◦ Verify that sample identifiers match with the laboratory
information system (LIS).
5. Recording Results:
◦ Follow the analyzer's prompts to complete the run and
generate raw data.
◦ Review the results on the analyzer; ensure no flags or errors
are associated with the results.
◦ Transfer results to the LIS for automated recording and
preliminary verification.
C. POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Result Verification:
◦ Compare analyte concentrations against established
reference ranges.
◦ Any results falling outside the reference range should be
reviewed carefully by a technologist.
◦ Verification of unexpected results includes repeat testing
and examination of any pre-analytical or analytical factors
that may affect results.
2. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Document all steps, including samples processed, reagent
lot numbers, and any deviations or corrective actions taken
during the analysis.
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a trained
technologist before being reported.
◦ Report critical values according to laboratory policy,
ensuring prompt communication to the ordering healthcare
provider.
3. Disposal:
◦ Dispose of biohazard waste, including used reagent
containers, control vials, and specimens, according to the
laboratory’s waste disposal SOP.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to manufacturer guidelines for specific reference intervals
for Milk, Processed, IgE levels in serum.
• Update intervals as new information becomes available or as
advised by clinical pathologists.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can affect the test results.
• Ensure proper specimen handling to avoid false interpretations.
