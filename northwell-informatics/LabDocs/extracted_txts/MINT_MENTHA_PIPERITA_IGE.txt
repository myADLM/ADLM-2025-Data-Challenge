Protocol for Analysis of Mentha Piperita (Mint) IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide the steps necessary for
the accurate and efficient analysis of serum IgE specific to Mentha
Piperita (Mint). This protocol ensures the quality and reliability of test
results for diagnosing potential allergic responses to Mentha Piperita.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis as per the outlined procedure. Laboratory staff and
supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this protocol
and addressing any deficiencies or issues encountered during the
analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
Freshly collected and properly labeled serum sample. Serum
specimen should be transported to the laboratory within 12 hours of
collection and kept at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable:
Samples with hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination.
Specimens arriving more than 12 hours after collection and without
proper labeling including date/time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader • Centrifuge • Refrigerated Incubators at 2-8°C and
37°C • Adjustable pipettes and tips • Microplate washer • ELISA
plates designed for IgE detection • Specific IgE against Mentha
Piperita antigen • Controls and calibrators • Substrate solution
• Stop solution • Disposable gloves and lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation and Setup: a. Bring all reagents and specimens to
room temperature (20-25°C) prior to assay setup. b. Prepare the
control and calibrator samples according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4.2 Assay Procedure: a. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and
patient serum samples to appropriate wells of the ELISA plate. b.
Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour. c. Wash the wells thoroughly
with the washing solution (at least 3 cycles). d. Add 100 µL of specific
IgE conjugate to each well and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour. e. Wash
the wells again with the washing solution (at least 3 cycles). f. Add
100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate the plate at room
temperature (20-25°C) for 15-30 minutes, protecting it from direct
light. g. Stop the reaction by adding 100 µL of stop solution to each
well. h. Read the optical density of each well using an ELISA reader
set to the appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm).
1. QUALITY CONTROL a. Run quality control samples as per
laboratory guidelines. b. Ensure calibration curves are created
and validated for each assay run. c. Monitor and document all
control and calibrator results. Take corrective actions if control
results fall outside the acceptable range.
2. REPORTING RESULTS a. Calculate patient sample
concentrations using the standard curve created with the
calibrator samples. b. Verify and review each result for
consistency and accuracy. c. Report results according to site-
specific guidelines.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS < 0.35 kUA/L: Not detected ≥ 0.35
kUA/L: Detected
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the assay kit insert for specific
limitations regarding cross-reactivity, interference, and
sensitivity.
5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Handle all biological specimens
as potentially infectious material. Follow appropriate biosafety
protocols.
