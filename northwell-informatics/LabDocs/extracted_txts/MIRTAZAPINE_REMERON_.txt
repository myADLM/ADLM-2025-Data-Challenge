Analytical Phase Protocol for MIRTAZAPINE (REMERON) Testing
1. PURPOSE
This document provides the standard operating procedure (SOP) for
the analytical phase of generating results for Mirtazapine (Remeron).
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and precise
measurement of Mirtazapine concentrations in biological specimens,
while maintaining consistency, reliability, and traceability.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated staff (laboratory
technologists/technicians) to perform the analytical procedure for
Mirtazapine following this SOP and document findings accordingly.
The laboratory supervisor/manager is responsible for overseeing the
process, ensuring adherence to the SOP, and verifying the results.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Mirtazapine: An antidepressant medication commonly used in the
treatment of major depressive disorder.
• HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, a technique in
analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each
component in a mixture.
• MS: Mass Spectrometry, an analytical technique that measures
the mass-to-charge ratio of ions.
• Internal Standard: A compound added to a sample in a constant
amount to correct for variances in sample preparation and
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• HPLC system coupled with a Mass Spectrometer (HPLC-MS)
• Standard solutions of Mirtazapine and Internal Standard
• High-purity reagents and solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile,
water)
• Calibration curves and quality control (QC) samples
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes
• HPLC vials
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Laboratory documentation (logs, worksheets, QC forms)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Standards and Quality Control Samples
• Prepare standard solutions of Mirtazapine at various
concentrations in the appropriate solvent (e.g., methanol or
acetonitrile).
• Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations.
• Store standards and QC samples at -20°C when not in use.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Extraction:
◦ Add a known volume of internal standard to the biological
samples (e.g., plasma, serum) and QC samples.
◦ Vortex well.
2. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Add cold acetonitrile to the sample in a 2:1 ratio relative to
the sample volume.
◦ Vortex mix for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Collect the supernatant for analysis.
3. Filtration (if necessary):
◦ Filter the supernatant through a 0.2 µm filter into HPLC
vials.
C. HPLC-MS Analysis
1. HPLC Conditions:
◦ Column: C18 reverse-phase column or equivalent.
◦ Mobile Phase: Gradient or isocratic conditions using a
mixture of water (with 0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile.
◦ Flow Rate: 0.3-0.5 mL/min.
◦ Injection Volume: Typically 5-10 µL.
◦ Temperature: 25-30°C.
2. MS Conditions:
◦ Ionization: Electrospray Ionization (ESI) in positive mode.
◦ Monitoring: Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) for
Mirtazapine and internal standard.
◦ Calibration: Perform a calibration run before sample
analysis using standard solutions.
3. Procedure:
◦ Load HPLC vials into the autosampler.
◦ Program and run the HPLC-MS system according to the
optimized method parameters.
◦ Analyze the calibration standards and QC samples.
◦ Analyze the extracted biological samples.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Use the calibration curve to quantify Mirtazapine
concentrations in the biological samples.
◦ Ensure that QC results are within acceptable limits.
D. Reporting Results
• Verify the results with the supervisor or manager.
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and make sure all data are accurately recorded, including
any deviations or issues encountered.
• Retain all relevant documentation and reports as per regulatory
requirements.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine quality control, including the use of internal
standards and periodic calibration verification.
• Analyze QC samples with every batch of patient samples to
ensure accuracy and precision.
• Follow established procedures to investigate and document any
out-of-specification results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to established therapeutic ranges for Mirtazapine
concentrations, typically 15-80 ng/mL in plasma/serum.
• Any deviation from the reference interval should be flagged and
reviewed by the supervising technologist or lab manager.
