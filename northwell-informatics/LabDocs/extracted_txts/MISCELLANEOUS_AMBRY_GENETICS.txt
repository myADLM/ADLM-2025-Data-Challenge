Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MISCELLANEOUS AMBRY GENETICS
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase in generating
results for MISCELLANEOUS AMBRY GENETICS tests, ensuring
accuracy, consistency, and adherence to regulatory and laboratory
standards.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis as per this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the protocol is followed,
results are reviewed, and any necessary corrective actions are
taken.
1. DEFINITIONS
MISCELLANEOUS AMBRY GENETICS: Genetic tests performed for
various genetic conditions as requested by the clinician, not falling
under a specific predefined category.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood (preferred), buccal swabs, or saliva samples
Specimen Container:
• Blood: EDTA (lavender top) tube
• Buccal swabs/Saliva: Provided in collection kits from Ambry
Genetics
Specimen Stability:
• Blood samples: Store at 2-8°C, stable for 48 hours
• Buccal swabs/Saliva samples: Room temperature, stable for up to
5 days
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted blood samples
• Incorrectly labeled or unlabeled specimens
• Specimens stored beyond stability limits
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR reagents and consumables
• Real-time PCR machine
• Capillary electrophoresis system
• DNA sequencer and associated reagents
• Ambry Chemistry Library Prep Kit
• Ambry enrichment probes
• QC materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Verify and log the specimen information in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Perform DNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s
protocol for the extraction kit used.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA via
spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis.
4. Record the DNA concentration and quality metrics in the LIS.
B. PCR and Library Preparation:
1. Set up PCR reactions according to the specific requirements of
the genetic test.
2. Amplify target regions by PCR, using protocols provided by
Ambry Genetics.
3. Purify PCR products using a standard purification kit.
4. Quantitate and validate PCR products before proceeding.
5. Set up library preparation using the Ambry Chemistry Library
Prep Kit following the provided protocol.
6. Enrich target regions using Ambry enrichment probes.
7. Quantify and validate the prepared libraries.
C. Sequencing:
1. Load prepared libraries onto the DNA sequencer following the
instrument's protocol.
2. Run the sequencing protocol according to manufacturer’s
guidelines.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics team.
2. Analyze sequence data using pipeline provided by Ambry
Genetics.
3. Validate sequencing data quality and coverage.
4. Perform variant calling and annotation as per Ambry Genetic’s
guidelines.
5. Review and interpret variants by comparing with reference
databases and guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control for each test run will include:
1. Running positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
2. Monitoring PCR efficiency via control amplification curves.
3. Ensuring each sequencing run meets the minimum quality
metrics.
4. Documenting all controls and standard values in the QC
logbook.
5. Reanalyze any batch if controls fall outside acceptable ranges
and troubleshoot as necessary.
6. Validate each analysis result with at least one other
independent technologist.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Results are to be reviewed by a senior technologist and verified
by a supervisor.
9. Document any potential issues or deviations from the protocol.
10. Enter verified results in the LIS with appropriate references and
interpretations.
11. Communicate critical results immediately to the requesting
clinician following the lab’s critical results policy.
12. Generate a detailed report including test interpretation,
methodology, and any detected variants.
13. Submit the final report to the clinician electronically and ensure
confidentiality and data security as per laboratory protocols.

1. DOCUMENTATION
All steps of the procedure including the sample reception, extraction,
library preparation, sequencing, data analysis, QC results, and
reporting should be meticulously documented in the relevant
laboratory logs and the LIS. Ensure that the records are retained as
per laboratory retention policies.
1. TRAINING
All personnel performing these procedures must be trained and
deemed competent in these techniques. Training documentation and
records must be maintained and reviewed annually.
