STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP): MISCELLANEOUS
ARUP TESTING
1. PURPOSE: To describe the steps taken in performing
miscellaneous ARUP tests, ensuring accuracy, precision, and proper
handling of specimens while adhering to established laboratory
quality standards.
2. SCOPE: This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing miscellaneous tests sent to ARUP Laboratories.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
following this SOP accurately. Supervisors must ensure compliance
and address any queries or discrepancies encountered during
testing.
4. MATERIALS/EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• ARUP test catalog (current version)
• Appropriate specimen containers (e.g., Vacutainer tubes, SST,
EDTA tubes)
• Centrifuge
• Aliquot tubes
• Specimen bags
• Shipping supplies, including dry ice (if applicable)
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coats, face shields)
• Accession logs and documentation forms
• Specimen transport media (if required)
• Refrigerators, freezers
5. DEFINITIONS/ACRONYMS: ARUP – Associated Regional and
University Pathologists Laboratories PPE – Personal Protective
Equipment SST – Serum Separator Tube EDTA –
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1 Specimen Collection:
• Refer to the ARUP test catalog for specific specimen
requirements.
• Collect the specimen using the appropriate container as listed for
each specific ARUP test.
• Ensure that specimens are appropriately labeled with patient
identification, collection date, and time.
6.2 Specimen Handling and Transport:
• Maintain specimen integrity by storing and transporting under
recommended conditions (e.g., refrigerated, frozen, or room
temperature).
• If specimen requires separation, centrifuge as per laboratory
guidelines and transfer the supernatant to an aliquot tube.
• Ensure all aliquot tubes are properly labeled indicating the
necessary patient information.
6.3 Documentation and Accessioning:
• Record all collected specimens and their details in the accession
log.
• Complete any necessary requisition forms ensuring all necessary
fields are filled out correctly.
• Verify the patient information against requisitions to ensure
accuracy and avoid specimen mix-up.
6.4 Sample Preparation for Testing:
• Verify that the specimen meets ARUP acceptance criteria (e.g.,
proper labeling, collection methods, absence of hemolysis, etc.).
• If specimen requires transport media, follow the ARUP guidelines
for the use of such media.
• Package specimens in leak-proof containers, ensuring care
during handling to prevent breakage.
6.5 Specimen Shipment:
• Prepare specimens for shipment by following ARUP's shipping
guidelines, maintaining recommended temperature range.
• Use appropriate shipping materials and methods, such as dry ice
for frozen samples or cold packs for refrigerated samples.
• Ensure timely dispatch to ARUP Laboratories to prevent any delay
in sample integrity.
6.6 Quality Control:
• Adhere to the internal quality control procedures to ensure the
reliability of test results.
• In case of any issues with the sample (e.g., compromised
integrity, labeling errors), notify the supervisor immediately to take
corrective action.
• Maintain logs with detailed records of test performance, including
any issues and the actions taken.
6.7 Generating and Reporting Results:
• Upon receiving test results from ARUP, verify and review them for
accuracy.
• Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Report critical values according to the laboratory’s critical result
policy, ensuring appropriate clinical consultation if needed.
• Ensure proper documentation and follow-up actions for any
questionable or discrepant results.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow appropriate PPE guidelines while handling biological
specimens.
• Ensure all safety protocols are adhered to while transporting,
handling, and storing potentially hazardous materials.
• Follow all biohazard guidelines as stipulated by the laboratory
safety manual.

• ARUP Test Directory (latest version)
• Laboratory Safety Manual
• Internal Quality Control Guidelines
9. APPROVAL AND DISTRIBUTION: This SOP will be subjected to
periodic review and approval. It will be distributed to all relevant
laboratory personnel and training sessions will be conducted as
required to ensure comprehension and compliance.
