MISCELLANEOUS ATHENA TESTING
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analytical phase
of miscellaneous Athena testing ensuring accurate, reproducible, and
timely generation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting the
testing as described in this protocol. All laboratory staff must
understand and adhere to these procedures and report any
irregularities to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Serum
• Plasma
• Whole blood (when applicable)
• Urine
Specimen Requirements:
• Refer to specific Athena test guidelines for specimen type,
collection methods, and stability requirements.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are clotted (if plasma/serum is required)
• Hemolyzed specimens (unless otherwise specified)
• Specimens that are improperly labeled
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Athena Analyzer
• Athena Test Kits and Reagents (Lot-specific)
• Calibrators and Control Materials (provided in the test kit)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Sample Cups/Vials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Verify that the Athena Analyzer is calibrated and in working order
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure daily maintenance and QC checks are completed and
within acceptable limits.
• Allow all reagents, calibrators, and control materials to reach
room temperature before use.
B. Specimen Handling
• Verify and log specimen receipt.
• Ensure specimens are at the correct temperature as defined in
test-specific procedures:
◦ Serum/Plasma/Whole Blood: 2-8°C
◦ Urine: room temperature (20-25°C)
• Centrifuge blood specimens to obtain serum or plasma if required.
• Aliquot specimens if necessary, ensuring proper labeling.
C. Test Procedure
• Load specimens, reagents, calibrators, and control materials onto
the analyzer following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Program the Athena Analyzer with the correct test protocol.
• Label all samples with appropriate identification as defined in the
testing protocol.
• Initiate the testing process and monitor the analyzer for any alerts
or warnings during the run.
D. Internal Quality Control
• Run internal quality controls as indicated:
◦ Level 1(negative), Level 2 (mid), and Level 3 (high positive)
controls must be performed at the start of each day or batch.
• Document control results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to
manufacturer guidelines and repeat as necessary.
E. Result Generation
• Interpret results using the Athena Analyzer's software.
• Print results and review for any flags or error codes.
• If results are flagged or have error codes, repeat testing on a new
aliquot of the same specimen, if available.
• Confirm the validity of results by comparing with historical data (if
available) for consistency.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure that all result entries are accurate and complete.
• Review results for critical values and follow established protocols
for reporting critical results immediately to the responsible
healthcare provider.
• Make corrections in LIS if necessary, maintaining documentation
of any changes.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the specific Athena test guidelines for reference intervals
appropriate to the demographic being tested (e.g., age, sex).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Consult the Athena test kit insert for test-specific limitations and
any known interferences.
• Record any observed limitations or unusual occurrences during
testing and report to a supervisor.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Maintain records of all quality controls, calibrations, and
maintenance activities.
• Participate in proficiency testing and external quality assurance
programs as required.
• Regularly review and update SOPs to align with the latest
manufacturer guidelines and regulatory requirements.
