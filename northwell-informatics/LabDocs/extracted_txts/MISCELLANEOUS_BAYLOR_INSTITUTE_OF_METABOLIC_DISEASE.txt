Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Results from
Miscellaneous Baylor Institute of Metabolic Disease
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and guidelines for the analytical phase in
generating results for testing performed under the Miscellaneous
Baylor Institute of Metabolic Disease protocols in compliance with
CLIA laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
tests according to this SOP, ensuring the accuracy and reliability
of results.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to oversee the
process, troubleshoot any anomalies, and ensure compliance with
this SOP and regulatory requirements.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Types: Plasma, serum, urine, etc, as specified in the
relevant Baylor Institute protocol.
• Volume: Minimum volume requirements will be determined per
specific tests.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Analytical instruments and systems per the test
requirements, including centrifuges, pipettes, and analyzers.
• Reagents: Certified reagents per the specific test requirements,
stored according to manufacturer guidelines.
• Calibration Standards: Appropriate for instruments and
methodology used.
1. PRE-TEST SET UP (Daily Setup Routine)
• Verify the calibration status of analytical instruments such as
mass spectrometers, HPLC, and others as applicable to ensure
they are within tolerance limits.
• Perform instrument maintenance as needed and document in the
instrument log.
• Prepare reagents as per manufacturer instructions, ensuring no
components are past their expiry date.
• Confirm that the quality control materials are within acceptable
control limits for the analytes being tested.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Label and document receipt of samples in the laboratory
information system.
2. Verify that the specimen meets the specific requirements such
as proper collection and stable condition (e.g., correctly
preserved, appropriate transport temperature).
3. Centrifuge blood specimens to separate plasma/serum if
applicable.
4. Aliquot and prepare samples as required ensuring no
contamination.
B. Conducting Tests
1. Initialize the instrument start-up procedures as per
manufacturer instructions.
2. Load the prepared samples into the analytical instruments.
3. Execute the analytical run following instrument-specific
operating instructions.
4. Monitor the run for any instrument alerts or error messages,
and take corrective action if needed.
C. Quality Control
1. Include quality control samples for every batch of tests run.
2. Verify that quality control results are within the specified
acceptable range.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken in the
quality control log.
D. Data Analysis
1. Collect and analyze data generated by the analytical
instruments.
2. Review results for accuracy, ensuring it meets predefined
criteria for acceptance.
3. Re-run tests as necessary if results fall outside of acceptable
limits or if QC fails.
4. Utilize internal/external standard methods for semi-quantitative
and quantitative analyses as required by the specific test.
5. RESULT REPORTING
• Transfer analytical results to the laboratory information system.
• Review and verify results ensuring calculated or derived results
are consistent with expected patterns.
• Report any critical results immediately to the requesting clinician
as per laboratory protocols.
• Check all results by an authorized personnel before final
verification and release.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform routine maintenance and cleaning of analytical
instruments at the end of daily testing, adhering to manufacturer
guidelines.
• In the event of instrument malfunction or deviation in test results,
notify the laboratory supervisor immediately.
• Document and rectify any issues encountered, and if necessary,
contact the technical support from the instrument manufacturer.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Retain all records of specimen processing, test results,
calibrations, quality control data, and maintenance logs.
• Ensure proper archiving of printed reports and electronic data
following laboratory and regulatory guidelines.
• Maintain confidentiality and follow all data protection regulations
relating to patient information.
1. REFERENCE STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
• Adhere strictly to the manufacturer’s instructions for all
instruments and reagents used.
• Comply with all relevant CAP, CLIA, and local regulatory
standards.
