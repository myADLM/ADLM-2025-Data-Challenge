1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standard procedure for the analytical phase
associated with generating results for miscellaneous tests conducted
at the Baylor Medical Genetics Laboratories. It ensures the reliability
and accuracy of test results and the integrity of data within the
stipulated guidelines and standards.
Responsibility:
• All laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this SOP during
the analytical phase.
• Designated supervisors ensure compliance and quality control.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all miscellaneous tests processed in the
Baylor Medical Genetics Laboratories. This includes, but is not limited
to, DNA sequencing, genotyping, and other genetic analyses.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment and Reagent Preparation
1. Calibrate Analytical Instruments:
◦ Confirm calibration status of all required instruments (e.g.,
PCR machines, sequencers) before analysis.
◦ Record calibration verification in the equipment log.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Validate the lot number and expiration date of all reagents.
◦ Prepare reagents according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Maintain storage conditions as per reagent requirements to
ensure stability.
B) Sample Processing
1. Specimen Verification and Preparation:
◦ Verify the identity and integrity of the specimens. Ensure
they meet the acceptance criteria.
◦ Document any discrepancies and notify the supervisor
immediately.
◦ Perform necessary pre-analytical treatment of specimens
(e.g., DNA extraction, quantification).
2. Amplification/Preparation:
◦ Set up the PCR reaction or equivalent amplification method
as required for the specific analysis.
◦ Follow the specific protocol outlined for each type of genetic
test.
3. Sequencing/Analysis:
◦ Load PCR products or genomic DNA into sequencing
instruments according to the standard protocol.
◦ Ensure proper settings and parameters are selected for the
specific test being conducted.
C) Analytical Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests.
◦ Verify that control results meet established parameters
before interpreting patient results.
◦ Document all quality control results in the appropriate log.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ Re-run any tests which do not meet quality control
parameters.
◦ Refer persistent issues to the supervisor and document
actions taken in the testing log.
D) Result Interpretation and Verification
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Utilize appropriate software tools for sequence analysis and
interpretation.
◦ Review the raw data files first to confirm the quality of the
sequencing run.
◦ Analyze the sequences and identify variants using validated
pipelines and databases.
2. Result Review:
◦ Cross-verify the results with the initial testing requisition to
confirm all required analyses were conducted.
◦ Validate questionable results through retest or additional
confirmatory methods, if necessary.
3. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Complete the test report with necessary details, attaching
quality control data and interpretation notes.
◦ All results should be reviewed and signed off by a qualified
geneticist or designated supervisor.
4. Critical Results:
◦ Notify the requesting physician immediately if the results
indicate life-threatening or urgent medical conditions.
◦ Document the critical call in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
E) Post-Analysis Protocol
1. Data Storage:
◦ Ensure all analytical data is backed up and stored securely
in accordance with data retention policies.
◦ Maintain confidentiality and adhere to data protection
regulations.
2. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Clean and decontaminate the work area and instruments
after completing the assays.
◦ Record the maintenance status in the equipment log.
