Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results: MISCELLANEOUS BIOAGILYTIX
DIAGNOSTICS
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedures to accurately and efficiently
generate analytical results for miscellaneous BioAgilytix diagnostics
in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for executing the
procedures and ensuring the accuracy and quality of the
analytical results.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure
implementation, addressing deficiencies, and ensuring corrective
actions when necessary.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instruments/Equipment
• Reagents specific to each assay
• Sample containers (e.g., vials, tubes)
• Calibrators and Standards
• Control Materials (Positive and Negative)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
• Ensure specimens are collected, received, and accessioned in
compliance with the laboratory’s pre-analytical procedures.
• Specimens must be appropriately labeled, free of contamination,
and processed (centrifuged, if necessary) as required for each
assay.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation
1. Review the test requisition and verify patient information with
the specimen label.
2. Confirm that all required reagents, controls, and calibrators are
available and not expired.
3. Prepare and calibrate equipment per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Allow reagents, controls, and samples to come to room
temperature if required.
4.2 Performance of Assay
1. Follow the specific analytical procedure for the designated
BioAgilytix diagnostic.
2. Log the date, time, analyst’s initials, and any pertinent
information in the laboratory logbook.
3. Document each step of the assay in detail, including any
deviations or issues encountered.
4.3 Quality Control and Calibration
1. Perform quality control checks at the commencement of each
run and after equipment calibration.
2. Utilize control materials to verify the accuracy and precision of
the assay.
3. Compare obtained values with established control ranges and
document results.
4. If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
and repeat the assay. Notify the supervisor of persistent issues.
4.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Analyze the raw data and apply required calculations to
determine the final result.
2. Utilize any specific software tools provided by the equipment
manufacturer or follow the assay protocol for analysis.
3. Review the results for accuracy and consistency; compare with
expected ranges or values where applicable.
4.5 Documentation and Reporting
1. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting to clinicians.
3. Document any critical results per laboratory policy and initiate
the notification protocol.
4. Store and archive all assay data as per laboratory policy for
future reference.
4.6 Post-Analytical Procedures
1. Dispose of reagents, biohazard waste, and used specimens
according to safety and disposal policies.
2. Clean and maintain equipment as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
3. Restock and reorder supplies to ensure continuous workflow.
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
5. Regularly audit all procedures and documentation to ensure
compliance with Standard Operating Procedures and regulatory
requirements.
6. Implement corrective actions for any identified deficiencies in
the procedure or results.
7. Engage in continuous staff training and competency
assessments to maintain high standards of analytical
performance.
