Analytical Phase SOP for Generating Results for MISCELLANEOUS
BLUEPRINT GENETICS INC.
1. PURPOSE To outline the standardized protocols and quality
control measures for analyzing and generating genetic testing
results for MISCELLANEOUS BLUEPRINT GENETICS INC.
genetic tests.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to follow this protocol to ensure accurate
and timely generation of genetic test results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained in this protocol
and that the procedures are correctly followed.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) Platform
• PCR Thermocyclers
• DNA extraction kits (Company/brand specific)
• Positive Control DNA
• Negative Control DNA
• Laboratory Pipettes and Tips (Sterile, filter tips)
• Thermal Cyclers
• Electrophoresis equipment
• Reagents for library preparation and sequencing
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis (Blueprint Genetics
Custom-Built Software)
• Clean Benches and Biosafety Cabinets
• Centrifuge and Microcentrifuge
• Gloves, Lab Coats, and other PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction and Quantification
1. Extract genomic DNA from the received specimen following the
DNA extraction kit protocols.
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a Qubit Fluorometer or
Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
3. Record DNA concentration and quality (A260/280 ratio) in the
DNA specimen tracking log.
B. Library Preparation
1. Generate DNA libraries following the NGS platform library
preparation kit protocol.
2. Include a positive control DNA sample and a negative control
(no template control) in each batch.
3. Perform PCR amplification as per manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Clean up PCR products using magnetic beads designed for
DNA purification.
5. Quantify the amplified library using standard methods (Qubit/
Nanodrop) and run a sample on an agarose gel to check for
correct fragment size.
C. Sequencing
1. Set up sequencing runs according to the NGS platform
instructions.
2. Load DNA libraries onto the sequencing instrument.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality assurance according to
the platform-specific guidelines.
4. Ensure that sequencing metrics (Q30 scores, cluster density,
etc.) meet acceptable laboratory standards.
D. Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data files to the bioinformatics
pipeline.
2. Use Blueprint Genetics Custom-Built Software to perform
alignment, variant calling, and annotation.
3. Ensure that the software includes built-in quality control
algorithms and flags suspicious variants or low-confidence
areas.
4. Review the generated variant call format (VCF) files and
determine correlations to known disorders, variants of unknown
significance (VUS), and other findings.
E. Reporting Results
1. Compile a detailed report incorporating the findings from the
bioinformatics analysis.
2. Ensure that the report follows the Blueprint Genetics report
template including:
◦ Patient Identifier
◦ Specimen Information
◦ Results Summary
◦ Detailed Variant Information
◦ Clinical Correlations
◦ Recommendation for Follow-Up or Confirmation Testing
3. Review the report for accuracy and completeness in
accordance with laboratory quality control standards.
4. Verify and sign off on the report by the authorized personnel.
5. Send the finalized report to the ordering physician or relevant
healthcare provider.
F. Quality Control
1. Run Positive and Negative Controls with each batch and
document results.
2. Perform bi-weekly calibration verification of sequencing
instruments.
3. Monthly QC checks on PCR thermocyclers and reagents.
4. Document all maintenance and calibration activities in the
quality control log.
5. Record any anomalies or failures and report to the supervisors
for corrective action.
6. SAFETY Ensure all laboratory work is performed using
appropriate PPE and in compliance with biosafety regulations.
Handle all biological samples with caution, using biosafety
cabinets and following established safety protocols.
7. REFERENCES Refer to manufacturers’ manuals for detailed
procedures for DNA extraction kits, PCR reagents, NGS
platforms, and bioinformatics software. Refer to the Blueprint
Genetics standard documentation for interpretation and
reporting guidelines.
8. REVIEW AND AUDIT This SOP shall be reviewed annually or
as necessary to reflect current best practices and regulatory
requirements. Regular audits shall be performed to ensure
compliance and areas for improvement shall be documented
and addressed promptly.
This protocol ensures standardization, accuracy, and reliability of
genetic testing results processed in our laboratory in association with
