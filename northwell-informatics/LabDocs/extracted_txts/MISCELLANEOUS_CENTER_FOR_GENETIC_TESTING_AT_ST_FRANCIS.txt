1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps taken during the analytical phase of
genetic testing in the Miscellaneous Center for Genetic Testing at St.
Francis. This includes the handling, preparation, and analysis of
samples to generate accurate and reliable genetic test results, as
well as the documentation and reporting of these results.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
analytical procedures as defined in this protocol. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory director and supervisor to ensure
compliance with all procedures and to address any issues that may
arise during the analytical phase.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all genetic tests conducted in the laboratory,
including but not limited to, DNA sequencing, polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), and other genetic testing methodologies.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION
4.1. Receipt and Verification: a. Verify that the specimens have been
properly accessioned and labeled. b. Confirm that the test requisition
form is complete and correctly corresponds with the specimen. c.
Document the condition of the specimen and any discrepancies.
4.2. Specimen Preparation: a. Perform DNA/RNA extraction following
the SOP for the respective extraction method. b. Quantify and assess
the purity of nucleic acids using spectrophotometry or similar
validated methods. c. Store extracted nucleic acids at -20°C or
appropriate conditions until analysis.
1. TESTING PROCEDURES
5.1. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): a. Prepare PCR master mix
according to the specific test protocol. b. Add extracted DNA/RNA
sample to the master mix. c. Amplify the target region using a
validated thermal cycler as per the PCR cycling conditions specified.
d. Confirm amplification via gel electrophoresis or using fluorometric
detection.
5.2. DNA Sequencing: a. Set up sequencing reactions using the
appropriate sequencing kit. b. Run the prepared samples on a DNA
sequencer. c. Analyze sequencing data using approved software. d.
Verify sequencing quality and coverage before proceeding.
5.3. Whole Genome/Exome Sequencing: a. Prepare libraries
according to the library preparation kit instructions. b. Perform quality
control of prepared libraries. c. Sequence the libraries using next-
generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. d. Perform bioinformatics
analysis to align reads and call variants using accredited pipelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
6.1. Internal Quality Control: a. Include positive and negative controls
in each run to ensure the accuracy of the testing. b. Document and
review control results regularly to detect any deviations or trends.
6.2. External Quality Assessment: a. Participate in proficiency testing
and external quality assessment schemes. b. Regularly review
results and implement any required corrective actions.
1. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
7.1. Raw Data Processing: a. Process raw data generated from the
respective tests following the approved analysis pipelines. b. Check
for quality parameters and remove any low-quality data.
7.2. Variant Calling and Annotation: a. Perform variant calling using
validated bioinformatics tools. b. Annotate the identified variants with
genetic databases and classification guidelines (e.g., ACMG).
7.3. Interpretation: a. Interpret the clinical significance of detected
variants based on current guidelines. b. Generate test reports
summarizing findings and interpretations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1. Review and Verification: a. Ensure that the test results and
interpretations are reviewed by a qualified professional. b. Verify the
accuracy of all reported results prior to release.
8.2. Report Generation: a. Generate the test report using the
laboratory information system (LIS). b. Provide a comprehensive
interpretation and relevant clinical recommendations.
8.3. Results Communication: a. Deliver results to the requesting
healthcare provider in a secure and timely manner. b. Facilitate
communication for any inquiries related to test results and
interpretations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
9.1. Record Keeping: a. Maintain detailed records for all specimens,
tests conducted, and results generated. b. Store electronic and hard
copy records securely for the duration specified by the laboratory’s
retention policy.
9.2. Incident Reporting: a. Document any incidents, deviations, or
discrepancies encountered during the analytical phase. b. Implement
corrective actions and preventive measures to address the reported
incidents.
