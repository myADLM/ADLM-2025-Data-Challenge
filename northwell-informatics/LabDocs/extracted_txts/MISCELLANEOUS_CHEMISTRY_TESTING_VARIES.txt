SOP for Miscellaneous Chemistry Testing
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely processing of specimens for
various miscellaneous chemistry tests that are not categorized under
routine testing protocols. This SOP establishes procedures for the
analysis, documentation, and reporting of patient test results for
miscellaneous chemistry assays, ensuring compliance with CLIA
guidelines and maintaining the highest quality standards and patient
care.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to perform miscellaneous chemistry testing, monitor the process,
document results, and take corrective actions if necessary.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the adherence to this SOP
and addressing any identified deficiencies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum, Plasma, Urine, or other bodily fluids as applicable
depending on the specific test.
• Ensure proper labeling of the specimen container with patient's
identification, collection date, and time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not meeting the specific collection requirements or
guidelines.
• Specimens arriving without proper identification or in
compromised condition (e.g., hemolysis, clotting in plasma,
contamination).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzers (as specified for particular tests)
• Manual pipettes, centrifuges, and other necessary laboratory
equipment
• Calibrated and validated reagents and standards according to the
manufacturer's instructions
• Appropriate specimen containers and collection devices
Equipment Maintenance: Ensure regular maintenance and calibration
of equipment. Document all maintenance activities and corrective
actions.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
• Log received specimens in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Verify specimen integrity. Refrigerate or freeze specimens if
required by specific assays.
• All specimens must be brought to room temperature before
analysis if applicable.
B. Test Preparation:
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions regarding reagent preparation
and instrument set-up.
• Perform quality control tests as per standard guidelines to validate
analyzers prior to running patient samples.
C. Analysis:
1. Load specimens onto the analyzer or prepare manually as
required.
2. Select appropriate test profile according to the order requisition
and specimen type.
3. Initiate analysis using the validated procedure for each test.
4. Monitor the testing process to ensure proper functioning of
equipment and timely completion of analysis.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Evaluate the results according to the reference ranges provided
in the assay instructions.
2. Verify and review results for consistency and possible errors.
3. Troubleshoot any flagged results or discrepancies using
instrument logs, repeat testing if necessary.
E. Documentation:
1. Record all results, including patient identification, test
performed, date, and time of analysis.
2. Document any external factors or issues encountered during
testing.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Review results and release them to LIS.
2. Ensure results are properly verified and documented before
being reported to the physician or clinical staff.
3. Follow specific site guidelines for reporting critical results
immediately.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Materials:
• Utilize appropriate quality control materials and maintain records
of QC testing.
• QC testing should be performed daily and with each new reagent
batch.
• Monthly proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons for
validation.
Procedure:
1. Perform daily QC tests according to instrument and test-specific
requirements.
2. Document QC results, including corrective actions taken if
results fall outside acceptable limits.
3. Refer to manufacturer guidelines for correcting any issues with
QC failures.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult specific test inserts and package labeling for established
reference intervals. Ensure these intervals are appropriately updated
in the LIS for accurate interpretation of patient results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to individual test protocols and insert sheets for limitations and
performance characteristics specific to each assay. Document
potential interferences or conditions that may affect accurate testing.
1. REFERENCES
Consult relevant technical references, manufacturer’s inserts, and
CLIA guidelines applicable to individual tests for comprehensive
details related to assay performance, quality control, and result
interpretation.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed every six months and revised as
necessary to comply with updated guidelines, incorporate new
equipment or methodologies, and improve laboratory practices.
This protocol serves as a standardized guide to performing
miscellaneous chemistry testing in the laboratory setting, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and high-quality patient care.
