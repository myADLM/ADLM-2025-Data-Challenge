1. PURPOSE: To ensure accurate and reliable results for
miscellaneous laboratory tests performed at Children’s Hospital
Los Angeles. This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for
various tests, including specimen handling, test performance,
and result verification.
2. SCOPE: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
handling and analyzing miscellaneous tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory staff to follow this protocol accurately and to ensure
that the results are precise, accurate, and timely.
4. DEFINITIONS: • Miscellaneous tests: Tests that do not fall
under specific common laboratory panels and may require
varied handling and analysis techniques.
5. SPECIMEN HANDLING: • Ensure specimens for miscellaneous
tests are collected, transported, and stored according to the
test-specific guidelines. • Check specimen labels for proper
identification, collection date/time, and ensure they match the
test requisition form.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES: • Utilize specific
equipment, reagents, and supplies specific to the
miscellaneous test being performed. • Ensure all equipment
and reagents are properly maintained, calibrated, and within
their expiration dates.
7. PROCEDURE: A. General Analytical Procedure for
Miscellaneous Tests:
1. Verify that the specimen meets the test requirements.
2. Perform any necessary pre-analytical preparations, such
as centrifugation or aliquoting.
3. Follow the specific, validated test method as per
associated test kit instructions or laboratory standard
protocol.
4. Record all necessary information, including reagent lot
numbers, instrument settings, and any deviations from the
standard method.
5. Utilize quality control materials to verify the accuracy and
precision of each test batch, and document results.
B. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control for each batch of tests according to
laboratory guidelines.
2. Ensure that QC results fall within the predefined acceptable
range.
3. Take appropriate corrective actions if QC falls outside
acceptable limits and document all actions taken.
C. Result Interpretation and Validation:
1. Compare test results against reference ranges or criteria for
normal and abnormal findings.
2. Validate all results by double-checking against test requisitions.
3. Document any discrepancies or issues with specimen integrity
and notify a supervisor if needed.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Ensure all critical or STAT results are communicated promptly
to the relevant clinical team, as per hospital policy.
3. Follow specific site guidelines for documenting and reporting
results.
4. POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE: A. Data Management:
1. Securely store all raw data, instrument printouts, and QC
records.
2. Back up electronic data daily to prevent loss in case of
system failures.
B. Documentation:
1. Maintain comprehensive logs for all tests performed, including
dates, times, and personnel involved.
2. Archive all records in compliance with hospital retention
policies.
3. REFERENCES: Provide an up-to-date reference list of all test
kit inserts, equipment manuals, and additional literature
relevant to the tests.
4. REVIEW AND APPROVAL: This SOP will be reviewed annually
or whenever significant changes are made to the procedures.
Approval must be documented by the laboratory director and
supervisory staff.
