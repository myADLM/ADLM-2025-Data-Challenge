Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Miscellaneous Tests at the
Children's Hospital of Colorado
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for performing miscellaneous tests in
the laboratory, ensuring the accuracy and precision of results while
maintaining patient safety and laboratory efficiency.
Responsibility:
Designated staff conduct miscellaneous testing as defined in this
procedure. All staff are responsible for identifying any deficiencies or
opportunities for improvement and alerting supervisors as necessary.
Supervisors ensure that testing is performed and documented
according to procedure, including any corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
Specimen type varies according to the test ordered. Ensure the
correct specimen type and volume is collected according to the
physician's order and the test's specific requirements.
Specimen Stability:
Follow individual test guidelines for specimen stability. Typically,
specimens should arrive at the laboratory within the stability period
defined by the testing protocol.
Unacceptable Specimens:
Specimens that do not meet the requirements for type, volume, or
stability as defined in each test's protocol. Specimens with leakage,
contamination, or improper labeling will also be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instruments specific to each test.
• Quality-controlled reagents.
• Supplies such as pipettes, microtubes, vacutainers, etc.
Equipment, reagents, and supplies must be properly stored and
maintained as per manufacturer's guidelines and laboratory
protocols.
1. PROCEDURE
Analytical Procedure:
1. Verify Patient Details:
◦ Ensure patient's name, DOB, and other identifiers match the
requisition.
2. Preparation:
◦ Inspect and prepare equipment.
◦ Confirm reagents are within expiration dates and adequately
prepared.
3. Testing:
◦ Follow specific test protocols as defined by manufacturer or
standardized procedures.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during
testing.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run appropriate quality control samples.
◦ Record all results and validate that they fall within
acceptable limits.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot according to test protocol and re-
run as necessary.
5. Results Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results before final submission.
◦ Communicate any critical results promptly to the ordering
physician.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Reporting:
• Results will be documented in the LIS and transmitted to
electronic health records (EHR).
• Critical values must be communicated directly by phone to the
ordering physician and documented in the LIS.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Maintain routine checks and calibrations on equipment.
• Perform regular competency assessments.
• Document QC results and address any discrepancies
immediately.
Inter-laboratory Comparisons:
• Monthly proficiency testing using split samples.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer inserts or laboratory-defined limitations for
each test. Ensure all technologists are trained and aware of these
limitations.
1. REFERENCES
Appropriate manufacturer guidelines, product inserts, and
standardized laboratory protocols. Additional references may include
peer-reviewed journals and clinical guidelines relevant to
miscellaneous testing.
