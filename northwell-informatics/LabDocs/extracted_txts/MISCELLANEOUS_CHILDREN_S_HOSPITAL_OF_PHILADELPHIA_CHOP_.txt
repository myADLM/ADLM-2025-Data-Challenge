Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Miscellaneous Tests at Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to ensure standardized,
accurate, and reliable analytical procedures for processing
miscellaneous laboratory tests specific to the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP). This SOP is intended to guide the laboratory
staff in the analytical phase, ensuring all steps are consistently
followed to provide high-quality results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory technologists and
personnel involved in the processing and analysis of miscellaneous
laboratory tests at CHOP. These tests may include, but are not
limited to, pediatric metabolic panels, rare disease markers, specific
enzyme assays, and other specialized tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel must adhere to the
protocols outlined in this document and ensure compliance with CLIA
requirements and CHOP guidelines. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the implementation, and any deviations must be reported
and addressed immediately.
4. DEFINITIONS Miscellaneous Tests: Specialized or non-routine
laboratory tests that may require unique handling and analysis
procedures, typically not included in standard panels.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Various reagents specific to each test (refer to individual test
reagent lists)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Specific assay kits and controls
• Reagent-grade water
• Standard laboratory glassware
• LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-analytical Preparation
• Ensure all specimens have been collected, received, and
accessioned correctly.
• Verify that all specimens are properly labelled with unique
identifiers.
• Store specimens at appropriate temperatures as per specific test
requirements.
6.2 Instrument and Reagent Preparation
• Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintenance logs are
up to date.
• Prepare reagents following specific test protocols and
manufacturer's instructions.
• Run appropriate quality controls to validate reagent and
instrument performance.
6.3 Analytical Procedure
General Steps:
1. Specimen Handling
◦ Centrifuge specimens if required and separate serum/
plasma promptly.
◦ Aliquot specimens if necessary into labeled vials for testing.
2. Instrument Setup
◦ Set up the analytical instruments as per the manufacturer's
instruction.
◦ Verify calibration using known standards.
3. Test Analysis
◦ Follow specific test protocols detailed in the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Analyze specimens by adding them to the appropriate
reaction vessels or instrument modules.
◦ Ensure all steps are performed within the recommended
time frames to maintain the integrity of the assay.
4. Data Collection
◦ Collect and record data generated by the instruments.
◦ Ensure all data are accurately entered into the LIMS.
5. Quality Controls and Validation
◦ Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens.
◦ Ensure all QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6.4 Post-analytical Procedure
• Review all generated data for discrepancies or unusual results.
• Verify the accuracy of results before reporting.
• Document all findings in the LIMS.
6.5 Result Interpretation and Reporting
• Interpret results based on the specific test reference ranges and
clinical guidelines.
• Report results following CHOP's reporting protocols.
• Ensure critical results are communicated directly to the treating
physician per established guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES
• Conduct routine instrument maintenance and calibration.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs.
• Regularly review and update SOPs to ensure compliance with the
latest standards.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all documentation records, including calibration logs,
quality control logs, maintenance records, and test reports for a
minimum duration as per CLIA requirements and hospital policy.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all assay kits and instruments
used.
• CHOP internal guidelines and laboratory protocols.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
10. REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate
any updates in technology, regulations, or hospital policies.
