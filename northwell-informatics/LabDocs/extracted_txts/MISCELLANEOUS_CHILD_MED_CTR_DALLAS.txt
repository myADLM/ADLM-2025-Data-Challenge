MISCELLANEOUS CHILD MED CTR DALLAS Analytical Phase
Protocol
1. PURPOSE
This procedure aims to ensure the accurate, timely, and compliant
processing of miscellaneous tests requested by the Children's
Medical Center Dallas, focusing on standard practices for generating
results in the analytical phase of testing.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedure outlined below to perform tests accurately and promptly.
Lab supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring adherence to best practice guidelines.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all miscellaneous tests requested by the
Children's Medical Center Dallas, covering a variety of test types,
sample handling, and result reporting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen types, collection methods, and storage conditions vary by
test type. For each test:
• Confirm the specimen type (e.g., blood, urine, CSF, tissue).
• Verify the collection method (e.g., venipuncture, lumbar puncture,
biopsy).
• Ensure specimen collection date and time are documented.
• Check for appropriate transport and storage conditions prior to
analysis.
• Reject specimens that do not meet the criteria (e.g., improper
labeling, inappropriate collection method, storage issues).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
List all necessary equipment, reagents, and supplies for each test
type, including:
• Analytical instruments (e.g., hematology analyzers, urinalysis
strips, GC-MS).
• Reagents specific to each test (manufacturer guidelines and
storage conditions).
• Supplies (pipettes, syringes, centrifuge tubes).
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Follow specimen-specific guidelines for preparation
(centrifugation, aliquoting).
• For blood samples, ensure mixing and removal of air bubbles
where applicable.
• For urine samples, warm refrigerated samples to room
temperature before analysis.
Testing Protocol:
• Ensure instruments are calibrated and maintained as per
manufacturer recommendations.
• Perform tests according to established procedures for each test
type.
• Document all steps including time, date, and initials of the
operator.
Quality Control:
• Run control samples alongside patient specimens as per QC
guidelines.
• Record and analyze QC results to ensure reliability and accuracy.
• Troubleshoot any issues by following corrective action guidelines.
1. RESULT REPORTING
Standard Reporting:
• Verify test results against established reference ranges.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Document any observations or limitations in the LIS notes section.
Critical Values:
• Identify critical values as per hospital guidelines.
• Immediately report critical results to the requesting physician or
department following established communication protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific test guidelines and manufacturer instructions for
limitations influencing accuracy and reliability. Document and
communicate any limitations affecting test results.
1. REFERENCES
List all relevant references, such as:
• Manufacturer's product inserts.
• Clinical guidelines specific to Children's Medical Center Dallas.
• Peer-reviewed journals and standard reference works.
APPENDIX: SAMPLE REPORTING TEMPLATES
Include templates for common result forms used for miscellaneous
tests offered by the Children's Medical Center Dallas.
This protocol is established to ensure that miscellaneous tests are
processed efficiently, accurately, and according to the highest
standards of clinical laboratory practice.
