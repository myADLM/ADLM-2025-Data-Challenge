Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase: Generation of
Results for Miscellaneous Hematology/Oncology Testing
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, consistent, and timely generation of results for
miscellaneous hematology/oncology blood tests, in alignment with
Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center standards and
regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated lab personnel are responsible for carrying out
hematology/oncology tests, documenting results, and ensuring timely
reporting. Responsibilities also include identifying any anomalies or
issues which may affect test results and notifying the supervisor
immediately.
3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Automated hematology analyzers (e.g., Sysmex XN series)
• Reagents and standard solutions
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibrators and controls
• Blood collection tubes: EDTA (lavender top), Heparin (green top),
etc.
• Data entry and Laboratory Information System (LIS) access
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Sample Verification: Confirm patient samples are correctly
labeled with patient ID, date, and time of collection.
2. Inspection: Inspect samples for any issues like hemolysis, clot
formation, or incorrect tube type and reject if necessary,
documenting reasons.
3. Mixing: Gently mix blood samples in EDTA or Heparin tubes by
inversion 8-10 times to prevent clotting.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Daily Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the hematology analyzer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Use traceable calibrators to validate the accuracy of
equipment and document results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control (QC) checks at the beginning of each
shift using high, normal, and low controls.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective actions if QC
results are outside acceptable ranges. Notify the supervisor
in case of recurring QC failures.
C) Test Execution
1. Primary Testing:
◦ Place the samples on the hematology analyzer according to
standard procedures.
◦ Select the profiles/tests relevant to the hematology/oncology
panel which may include Complete Blood Count (CBC),
reticulocyte count, peripheral blood smears, flow cytometry
for immunophenotyping, and specific molecular/genetic
tests.
2. Analyzer Running:
◦ Initiate sample processing on the automated analyzer.
◦ Monitor the running process to identify any flags or errors.
3. Microscopic Analysis:
◦ For flagged results or based on the clinical request, prepare
peripheral blood smears and perform manual differential
counts or other specific staining procedures (e.g. Wright-
Giemsa).
4. Complex Testing:
◦ For tests requiring additional steps (e.g. flow cytometry),
follow specific protocols and reagents as per the test
requirements.
D) Result Validation
1. Automated Results Review:
◦ Review automated results using LIS, cross-reference with
QC, calibration data, and history for consistency.
2. Manual Reviews:
◦ Verify results from manual differentials or other specialized
tests performed.
3. Critical Results Handling:
◦ Any critical values or unexpected findings must be reviewed
by a senior technologist or supervisor.
◦ Notify the physician immediately of any critical results
following the notification protocol and document the
communication.
E) Data Entry and Reporting
1. Result Entry:
◦ Enter final results into the LIS accurately, including any
relevant comments or necessary interpretative data.
2. Verification:
◦ Double-check entries for accuracy before verification and
submission.
3. Documentation:
◦ Maintain all records associated with the assay performance,
calibration, QC, and equipment logs according to regulatory
requirements and hospital policy.
4. Reporting:
◦ Ensure timely reporting of test results as per hospital
guidelines. Fax, email, or electronically report results to
concerned departments, physicians, or directly to patients'
records.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The performance of the test may be affected by factors such as
incorrect sample handling, improper calibration, and reagent
expiry.
• Refer to manufacturer’s instructions and reagent inserts to
understand specific limitations and interferences for each test
component.

7. CONTINGENCY PLAN
In cases where the primary equipment is down:
• Perform testing manually, if feasible, following equivalent manual
protocols.
• Notify supervising staff and coordinate with technical support for
equipment repair.
• Document all issues and actions taken in the downtime log.
