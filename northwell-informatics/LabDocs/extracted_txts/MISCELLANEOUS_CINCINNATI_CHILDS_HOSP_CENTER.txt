Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Miscellaneous Tests for Cincinnati
Children's Hospital Center
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
generating results for miscellaneous tests at Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Center. It covers each step from the receipt of accessioned
specimens to the validation of test results, ensuring compliance with
CLIA regulations and guaranteeing accurate and reliable outcomes
for pediatric patients.
2. SCOPE:
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing
miscellaneous test analyses in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital
Center laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
All laboratory personnel are responsible for following this protocol.
The laboratory supervisor and designated personnel must ensure
adherence and conduct periodic reviews to validate proper
implementation.
4. DEFINITIONS:
Miscellaneous Tests: Tests that are not routinely performed but are
conducted based on specific requests from physicians at the
Cincinnati Children's Hospital Center.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimens: Plasma, serum, whole blood, urine, CSF,
any other relevant body fluids.
• Collection: Obtain specimens using standard collection
techniques. Use appropriate containers and labels with necessary
patient information.
• Stability and Storage: Follow test-specific guidelines for storage
temperatures and stability requirements to maintain specimen
integrity.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Analytical instruments as per test requirements (ensure
calibration and maintenance records).
• Specific reagents corresponding to each test. Store reagents as
recommended by the manufacturer.
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Instrument Calibration and Maintenance:
1. Ensure instruments are calibrated as per manufacturer's
instructions before use.
2. Document calibration activities and maintenance checks in the
instrument log.
B. Specimen Processing:
1. Verify specimen ID and match with the test requisition form.
2. Centrifuge blood specimens if plasma or serum is required,
following the centrifugation protocol.
3. Process other body fluids as needed.
4. Store specimens at specified temperatures until analysis.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run appropriate quality control (QC) samples before patient
samples.
2. Follow QC schedules and use manufacturer’s control materials.
3. Document all QC data
4. Accept or reject QC results based on pre-defined criteria.
5. If QC is out of range, perform troubleshooting. If unresolved,
notify the supervisor.
D. Analytical Procedure:
1. Load specimens and controls into the analyzer following
instrument instructions.
2. Select test protocols according to physician orders.
3. Initiate the analysis and monitor processes.
4. Record any deviations or technical issues encountered.
5. Allow instruments to complete analysis and ensure the data is
captured properly.
E. Result Review and Validation:
1. Verify all results against QC data.
2. Review results for any inconsistencies or flags.
3. For abnormal or critical values, follow laboratory critical value
notification protocols.
4. Document all validated results and initial or electronically sign
off.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify results according to site-specific guidelines.
3. Ensure critical values are appropriately documented and
delivered to the requesting physician promptly.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING:
1. Maintain accurate records of all testing activities, QC results,
calibrations, and corrective actions.
2. Store all records safely and accessibly per regulatory
requirements.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. Document and report any instrument malfunctions or
procedural deviations.
2. Follow manufacturer guidelines for resolving issues.
3. If issues are unresolved, consult with the laboratory supervisor.
11. REFERENCES:
1. Specific test inserts and manufacturer guidelines corresponding
to each instrument and reagent used.
2. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
3. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Center laboratory policy
documents.
12. REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
This SOP is subject to review and approval by laboratory
management annually or as needed. All amendments must meet
regulatory requirements and enhance operational efficacy.
