MISCELLANEOUS TESTING PROCEDURES AT CLEVELAND
CLINIC LABORATORY
1. Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for miscellaneous tests performed
at Cleveland Clinic laboratory. This procedure covers the steps from
specimen preparation to generation of results, ensuring compliance
with regulatory standards and adherence to quality control measures.
2. Scope: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for carrying out miscellaneous testing procedures within
the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities:
• Laboratory Technologists must follow this protocol strictly to
ensure test accuracy.
• Supervisors must ensure adherence to this protocol by
conducting regular audits and providing support for
troubleshooting.
• Quality Control (QC) Personnel are responsible for validating
instruments and reagents before use and documenting all QC
activities.
4. Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Blood, urine, and other biological fluids as specified for each
test.
◦ All specimens must be labeled with patient identification,
collection date and time, and must be accompanied by a
completed requisition form.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, icteric, or contaminated.
◦ Specimens without proper identification or those that do not
meet the required storage/stability criteria.
5. Equipment and Reagents:
• Specific equipment and reagents for each test must be prepared
and validated prior to use according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• All equipment and reagents must be logged, recorded, and stored
appropriately as per the laboratory guidelines.
6. Procedure:
6.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Verify and document specimen integrity and appropriateness for
the test.
• For blood specimens, centrifuge if necessary to obtain plasma or
serum following standard centrifugation procedures.
• For urine or other fluids, ensure that samples are processed and
aliquoted as required by specific test protocols.
6.2 Test Execution:
• Follow the detailed instructions specific to the test being
performed, referring to the manufacturer’s guidelines and
laboratory SOPs.
• Ensure correct calibration of instruments and that Quality Control
(QC) runs are performed before patient samples are analyzed.
• For manual testing, strictly adhere to the timing, reagent mixing,
and other procedural steps to minimize variability.
6.3 Quality Control:
• Perform QC checks for all instrumentation and reagents as
required.
• Evaluate QC results for acceptability. In case of QC failure, halt
patient testing and perform necessary corrective actions.
• Document all QC activities including corrective actions taken.
6.4 Data Analysis and Validation:
• Verify results against standard reference values and laboratory-
specific criteria.
• Perform duplicate testing where results are unusual or fall within
critical ranges.
• Utilize Laboratory Information System (LIS) to record and verify
results.
7. Reporting Results:
• Review and verify the generated results before inputting them into
the LIS.
• Report results following the laboratory policy. For critical values,
immediately notify the responsible clinician and document the
notification accordingly.
8. Reporting Critical Results:
• Critical results that must be addressed immediately will be clearly
flagged within the LIS.
• Notification must be documented, including the date, time, and
the individual contacted.
9. Record Keeping:
• Maintain records of test procedures, QC logs, equipment and
reagent logs, calibration records, and results.
• Ensure records are stored securely and are easily accessible for
regulatory review.
10. Troubleshooting and Maintenance:
• In case of instrument errors or inconsistent test results, follow the
troubleshooting guidelines provided by the instrument
manufacturer.
• Notify the supervisor immediately for any unresolved issues.
• Regular maintenance checks should be performed as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations and documented accordingly.
11. References:
• Reference each test procedure with appropriate documents,
including package inserts, reagent inserts, manufacturer
guidelines, and internal detailed SOPs for respective tests.
12. Appendices:
• Attach relevant forms and logs for QC, equipment maintenance,
and troubleshooting documentation.
• Ensure access to training material for the staff regarding the use
of LIS and relevant test procedures.
By adhering to this protocol, we ensure the reliability of test results,
compliance with regulatory requirements, and maintaining the highest
standards of patient care within the Cleveland Clinic laboratory.
