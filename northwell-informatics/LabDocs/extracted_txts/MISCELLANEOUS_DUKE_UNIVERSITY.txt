Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Miscellaneous Duke University Tests
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, reliable, and timely generation of results for
miscellaneous laboratory tests as requested by clinicians associated
with Duke University. These protocols guide laboratory staff in
processing and analyzing specimens following standard operating
procedures and adhering to quality control measures.
Responsibility:
1. Designated laboratory staff are responsible for processing,
analyzing, and reporting miscellaneous tests according to this
procedure.
2. All laboratory personnel must report any issues or deviations
from the standard procedure to their supervisor promptly.
3. DEFINITION
Miscellaneous tests include, but are not limited to, any non-routine or
special laboratory tests not covered under primary categories such
as hematology, chemistry, microbiology, or urinalysis. These tests
may require unique handling, particular analytical instruments, or
specific reagents.
1. PROCEDURE
I. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Ensure specimen integrity upon receipt:
- Verify suitable labeling with patient details, collection date/time, and test requisition.
- Confirm appropriate specimen type and volume as defined by test requirements.
- Inadequate specimens (e.g., unlabelled, insufficient volume, inappropriate container) should be rejected per the laboratory’s rejection criteria protocol.
2. Store specimen under appropriate conditions until processing:
- Refrigerate if required (2-8°C)
- Freeze if required (-20°C or -80°C as specified)
- Maintain at room temperature if required (20-25°C)
- Ensure timely processing to maintain sample integrity based on test-specific stability criteria.
II. Data Entry and Accessioning:
1. Enter the specimen data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS), generating appropriate accession numbers.
2. Double-check entered data against the specimen and requisition form for accuracy.
III. Instrumentation and Analytical Process:
Equipment, Reagents & Supplies:
- Instruments as specified by miscellaneous test requirement.
- Reagents and controls appropriate for selected instruments and specific assays.
- Disposable supplies specific to each test (e.g., pipette tips, cuvettes).
Procedure:
1. Set up the instrument per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Prepare reagents according to the assay protocol, ensuring they are within acceptable expiration dates.
3. Calibrate instruments using manufacturer’s specified standards and/or calibration materials.
4. Run quality control (QC) samples before processing patient specimens:
- Two levels of QC material (normal and abnormal) should be run and documented.
- QC results should fall within predefined acceptable ranges before proceeding to patient samples.
- If QC fails, troubleshoot per manufacturer guidelines and do not proceed until corrective actions are successful.
5. Process patient specimens:
- Follow specific assay protocol instructions (e.g., pipetting steps, incubation times, temperatures, and reading endpoints).
- Use appropriate control and reference materials to ensure accuracy.
- Document all steps and any deviations during the procedure.
IV. Quality Control and Results Validation:
1. Review QC results to ensure performance meets laboratory standards.
2. Validate all patient results:
- Compare with reference ranges.
- Repeat testing if necessary to confirm unusual or critical results.
- Discuss any anomalies with the supervisor.
1. Document results in the LIS and ensure results are verified by a
qualified technologist prior to release. 4. Ensure critical results
and results variance are communicated to the requesting
clinician immediately per laboratory policy. 5. For instruments
with internal error/alarm systems, follow manufacturer's
troubleshooting guidelines if errors occur.
V. Reporting Results:
1. Results are reviewed for accuracy and completeness before being entered into the LIS.
2. System-generated reports are cross-checked with the electronic records.
3. Results must be validated and authorized by the reporting technologist before release.
4. Critical values must be reported immediately:
- Follow established protocols for documenting the notification of the healthcare provider.
- Repeat critical values must follow specific guidelines for repeat verification.
VI. Record Keeping and Documentation:
1. Maintain records of all QC, instrument logs, and maintenance logs.
2. Record any incidents or deviations and actions taken.
3. Documentation must comply with regulation standards and retained for review and audits.
1. MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE
I. Instrument Maintenance:
1. Routine instrument maintenance should be performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines to ensure continued accuracy and reliability.
2. Maintain records of all maintenance activities.
II. Continuous Quality Improvement:
1. Participate in internal and external proficiency testing programs.
2. Regularly review and update SOPs to stay in compliance with current best practices and regulatory requirements.
By adhering to these guidelines, laboratory staff can ensure high-
quality results that accurately reflect the patients’ health status,
thereby supporting effective patient care and clinical decisions.
