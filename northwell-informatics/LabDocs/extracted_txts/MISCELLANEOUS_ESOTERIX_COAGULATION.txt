Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Miscellaneous Esoterix Coagulation
1. PURPOSE
To provide a clear and consistent procedure for the analytical phase
of generating results for Miscellaneous Esoterix Coagulation tests,
ensuring accuracy and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
All trained laboratory personnel involved in the analytical phase are
responsible for following this SOP to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of test results. Supervisors must ensure proper training,
adherence, and monitoring of this procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Miscellaneous Esoterix Coagulation tests refer to coagulation tests
not routinely performed in-house and requiring specialized
methodologies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen type: Citrated plasma (light blue-top tube) Volume: A
minimum of 1.0 mL of plasma Storage: Specimens must be
centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15 minutes promptly to separate plasma,
then aliquoted and frozen at -70°C until analysis. Acceptable:
Properly labeled specimens that meet volume and storage
conditions. Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled
specimens will be rejected and noted.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer • Reagents as specified by Esoterix
Coagulation reference lab • Calibration and control materials •
Pipettes and tips • Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE) •
Freezer (-70°C) • Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents Preparation and Verification:
1. Prepare reagent lyophilization and reconstitution following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Verify expiry dates, proper storage, and lot numbers.
3. Allow reagents to equilibrate to room temperature before use if
necessary.
4. Perform quality control (QC) on reagents per the lab’s QC plan.
B. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration using the specified calibration standards
provided by the manufacturer.
2. Record calibration data, including lot numbers, dates, times,
and initials of the personnel performing the calibration.
3. Validate calibration results against acceptable limits before
proceeding with sample analysis.
C. Sample Processing:
1. Identify and confirm correct samples with unique identification
numbers against the test requisition form.
2. Thaw frozen plasma samples at 37°C for 15 minutes, gently
mixing to ensure homogeneity without causing froth or
hemolysis.
3. Centrifuge the thawed samples at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to
remove any residual cells or debris.
D. Analysis:
1. Set up the coagulation analyzer according to the specific test
protocols provided by Esoterix Coagulation.
2. Load the samples, reagents, and controls into the analyzer.
3. Run the samples by selecting the correct panel for
Miscellaneous Esoterix Coagulation.
4. Monitor the run for error messages or alerts. Handle any errors
per the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide.
5. Document the times, reagent lot numbers, and any
observations during the run.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run internal QC samples along with patient samples.
2. Verify the QC results immediately after the run.
3. If QC results are within the acceptable range, proceed to
validate patient results.
4. If QC results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot per
the laboratory’s QC protocol and re-run the QC and patient
samples if necessary.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Review the results, including any flag or alert indicators.
7. Validate and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
8. If results are outside the reference range, follow the laboratory’s
protocol for critical values and notification.
9. Transmit the results to the requesting physician or department
following laboratory policy.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals are specific to each test and can be found in the
Esoterix Coagulation test menu documentation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to Esoterix Coagulation test inserts and the manufacturer’s
guidelines for individual test limitations and interferences.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
QA includes:
• Documenting all processes, deviations, and corrective actions in the
provided logs or electronically. • Regularly scheduled equipment
maintenance and validation by qualified personnel. • Participation in
external proficiency testing programs.
