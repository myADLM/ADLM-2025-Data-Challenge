STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
MISCELLANEOUS ESOTERIX GENETIC LABORATORIES, LLC -
MA ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To define and ensure the correct procedures for the analytical phase
of generating results from specimens received, including the
processing, analysis, quality control, and reporting steps necessary
for accurate and reliable genetic testing results.
1. SCOPE

to ensure accuracy and consistency in testing.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
addressing any issues that arise throughout the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Specimen: Biological material received for genetic analysis.
• Analyte: A specific substance or chemical constituent being
analyzed.
• QC: Quality control measures implemented to ensure and monitor
the accuracy and precision of the testing process.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR machines
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Sequencers
• Micropipettes
• Centrifuges
Supplies:
• Reagents specific to test protocols
• Nucleic acid extraction kits
• Pipette tips
• Microtubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coats
1. PROCEDURES
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Receive and verify specimen with accompanying requisition.
2. Document the receipt, accession number, and storage condition
of the sample.
3. If required, store the specimen under appropriate conditions
until analysis can be started.
B. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Follow the specific extraction protocol provided in the kit insert
or institutional protocol.
2. Document starting and ending volume of final extract.
3. Store extracted nucleic acids appropriately until further
analysis.
C. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):
1. Prepare the PCR mix according to the specific protocol,
ensuring reagent volumes are accurate.
2. Apply extracted nucleic acids to the PCR mix.
3. Load the mixture into the PCR machine and initiate the cycling
program as per the protocol.
4. Document the PCR run details in the logbook, including any
deviation or issues encountered.
D. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
1. Prepare agarose gel as per required concentration.
2. Load PCR products along with a molecular marker.
3. Run electrophoresis at specified voltage.
4. Visualize and document results under UV light.
E. Sequencing:
1. Prepare sequencing reactions according to the standardized
protocol.
2. Verify sequence data quality by visual inspection.
3. Perform necessary data analysis and interpretation using
appropriate software.
F. Quality Control and Validation:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
2. Analyze QC results and document them in the QC log.
3. Investigate and document any out-of-range QC results,
including corrective actions taken.
G. Result Interpretation:
1. Review raw data and processed data for accuracy and
completeness.
2. Interpret genetic findings based on standardized guidelines.
3. If required, refer to genetic experts for confirmation.
4. Document interpretation and any findings that require follow-up.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Review Process:
1. Preliminary results must be reviewed by trained personnel.
2. Ensure all data entries are accurate and consolidated according
to protocol.
3. Flag any result which appears inconsistent or out-of-range for
re-analysis.
B. Final Report Generation:
1. Generate the final report using laboratory information systems
(LIS).
2. Include all relevant details such as test performed, findings,
interpretation, and recommendations.
3. Verify the report by a supervisor or qualified personnel before
release.
C. Results Documentation and Communication:
1. Ensure results are communicated in a timely manner to the
requesting physician.
2. File a hard copy or electronic copy of the report in the
laboratory records.
3. Include any corrective measures or notes if deviations occurred
during testing.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. QC Measures:
1. Perform regular maintenance checks on all equipment.
2. Use certified reference materials where applicable.
3. Maintain calibration records of all instrumentation used.
4. Conduct inter-laboratory comparisons periodically to assess
accuracy.
B. Documentation and Audit:
1. Maintain accurate logs of all procedures, results, QC checks,
and audits.
2. Review and sign-off by responsible personnel should be
documented.
3. Store records securely and retain them as per institutional
policy and regulatory requirements.
