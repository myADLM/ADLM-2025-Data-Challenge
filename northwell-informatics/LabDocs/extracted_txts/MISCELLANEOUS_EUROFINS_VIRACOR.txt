Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
MISCELLANEOUS EUROFINS VIRACOR Tests
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidelines for the
analytical phase of generating results for Miscellaneous Eurofins
Viracor tests within the laboratory. This SOP ensures consistency,
accuracy, and reliability in test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure accurately and consistently.
1. SPECIMEN INFORMATION
Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable Specimen Types: Blood, serum, plasma, urine, or
other bodily fluids as specified by the test order.
• Collection: The specimen should be collected in the appropriate
container as specified by the test order.
• Storage: Store specimens at temperatures specified by the test
where applicable (refrigerated or frozen).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that do not meet the above requirements or that are
improperly labeled will be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated analyzers and manual labware as required by the
specific test method.
• Eurofins Viracor test kits and reagents.
• Calibrators and controls.
• Traceable thermometers and temperature monitoring devices.
• Appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Verify that the specimen has been accessioned and meets all
the acceptance criteria.
2. Process the specimen according to the specific test method, as
provided in the Eurofins Viracor test kit insert.
3. Label the processed specimen appropriately to avoid mix-ups.
B) Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Verify that the required equipment is clean and properly
maintained.
2. Ensure the equipment is in working order by performing routine
maintenance checks.
3. Calibrate the equipment using the manufacturer’s calibration
standards.
4. Document the calibration results and take corrective actions if
the calibration is not within acceptable limits.
C) Running Controls:
1. Prepare and run positive and negative controls as per the test
kit instructions.
2. Verify that the control results fall within the acceptable range.
3. Troubleshoot and perform corrective actions if controls do not
meet specification limits.
4. Document all control results.
D) Sample Testing:
1. Load the prepared specimen onto the analyzer.
2. Follow the specific test instructions included in the Eurofins
Viracor test kit for running the test.
3. Observe and record any instrument alerts or anomalies during
the testing phase.
E) Validation and Verification of Results:
1. Review the analyzer output and ensure the values meet
expected ranges.
2. Compare patient results with control results to confirm the
accuracy.
3. Repeat the test for any specimen with suspicious or outlier
results.
4. Validate and verify the final results by a qualified laboratory
supervisor.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
7. Verify that all patient demographics and test specifics are
correctly entered.
8. Ensure that critical and abnormal results follow the standard
reporting guidelines.
9. Transmit results to the ordering healthcare provider according
to the laboratory’s protocols.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
11. Routine QC checks should be conducted and documented as
per the defined laboratory schedule.
12. The QC practices must comply with internal and external
standards.
13. Address any QC discrepancies immediately to maintain the
integrity of the test results.
14. SAFETY MEASURES
15. Follow all laboratory safety protocols and use PPE.
16. Handle and dispose of biological specimens and chemical
reagents according to biosafety and environmental safety
guidelines.
17. Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for specific
reagent hazards.
