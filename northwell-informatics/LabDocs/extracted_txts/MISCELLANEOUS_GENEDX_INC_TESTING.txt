4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• GeneDx, Inc. test kits and reagents
• Nuclease-free water
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Micropipettes and tips
• PCR and sequencing equipment
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control for GeneDx, Inc. testing includes:
• Running positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
• Ensuring instruments are calibrated and maintained according to
the manufacturer’s specifications.
• Documenting results on QC logs and following corrective actions
if necessary.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparations
• Specimen receipt and accessioning: Ensure that the
specimens have already been collected, received, and
accessioned with appropriate documentation.
• Specimen integrity check: Verify that specimens are labeled
properly, not compromised, and meet the requirements set forth
by GeneDx, Inc.
6.2 Sample Processing
• DNA/RNA Extraction:
◦ Utilize the provided extraction kits from GeneDx, Inc.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for DNA/RNA
extraction.
• Quantification and Quality Check:
◦ Quantify the DNA/RNA using spectrophotometry or
fluorometry.
◦ Assay the purity by evaluating A260/A280 and A260/A230
ratios.
6.3 PCR Amplification
• Setup Reaction Mixture:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the GeneDx, Inc.
test protocol.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Amplification:
◦ Program the thermal cycler as specified by the test kit
instructions.
◦ Load samples into the thermal cycler and execute the run.
6.4 Post-Amplification Processing
• Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
◦ Validate the presence and size of the PCR products using
agarose gel electrophoresis.
• Purification (if applicable):
◦ Clean PCR products to remove excess primers and dNTPs
using a commercial purification kit.
6.5 Sequencing (if applicable)
• Setup Sequencing Reactions:
◦ Prepare the sequencing reaction according to GeneDx, Inc.
instructions.
◦ Run each sample and control.
6.6 Data Analysis
• Data Review and Interpretation:
◦ Analyze data from sequencing or other assay formats
following GeneDx, Inc. methodology.
◦ Compare results to reference sequences or databases
provided by GeneDx, Inc.
◦ Document findings in the analysis software.
6.7 Report Generation
• Result Verification:
◦ Cross-check the results against quality controls.
◦ Confirm that all controls passed and results fall within the
acceptable range.
• Report Compilation:
◦ Compile the result data in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Generate a comprehensive report in the format specified by
GeneDx, Inc.
6.8 Report Verification and Release
• Peer Review:
◦ Have the results double-checked by a second qualified
technologist.
• Approval:
◦ Obtain final approval from the laboratory director or
designated supervisor.
• Result Communication:
◦ Release the final report to the ordering clinician via secure
method as per the laboratory policy.
7. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
• Dispose of biological and chemical waste according to the
laboratory’s biohazard and chemical waste disposal guidelines.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs for specimen receipt, processing steps, control
results, and equipment calibration.
• Store all records according to laboratory standards and regulatory
requirements.
By adhering to these detailed procedures, we ensure the accuracy
and reliability of the GeneDx, Inc. genetic testing, thereby providing
high-quality data for clinical interpretation and treatment planning.
