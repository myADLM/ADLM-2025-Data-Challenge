Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results at Miscellaneous Greenwood Genetic Center
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for the analytical phase for processing and
generating results for genetic tests at the Miscellaneous Greenwood
Genetic Center. This protocol ensures that results are accurately,
efficiently, and consistently generated, validated, and reported
following the laboratory standards and regulatory requirements.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Technologists and designated staff are responsible for following this
SOP during the analytical phase of genetic testing. Staff and
supervisors must ensure that the procedures are followed accurately,
corrective actions are taken when necessary, and that results are
appropriately documented.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens must be collected, received, and accessioned before the
analytical phase. Ensure all specimens are adequately labelled with
patient information and relevant test requisition details.
PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Verification
1. Specimen Verification
◦ Confirm specimen integrity and volume.
◦ Verify that all specimens have appropriate labelling and
accompanying documentation.
◦ Reject any specimens that fail to meet the acceptance
criteria (e.g., improperly labelled, inadequate volume,
compromised integrity).
2. Reagent and Equipment Preparation
◦ Prepare required reagents and ensure they are not expired.
◦ Calibrate and validate equipment/instruments used for
genetic analysis.
◦ Document calibration and preparation steps as per
laboratory guidelines.
B. Analytical Processing
1. DNA/RNA Extraction
◦ Follow the standard protocol for DNA/RNA extraction.
◦ Ensure purified DNA/RNA meets the required quantity and
quality specifications.
◦ Document extraction results in the corresponding logs.
2. Quality Control of Extracted DNA/RNA
◦ Perform spectrophotometric analysis and/or gel
electrophoresis.
◦ Verify concentrations and purity ratios (A260/A280, A260/
A230).
◦ Log results and address any deviations as per QC
guidelines.
3. Amplification and Sequencing
◦ Set up PCR reactions according to the specific genetic test
protocols.
◦ Validate amplification success by appropriate methods (e.g.,
gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR).
◦ Document amplification outcomes.
◦ Prepare samples for sequencing (e.g., Sanger sequencing,
Next-Generation Sequencing).
◦ Verify sequence data quality through appropriate software
and tools.
◦ Document sequencing results and address any QC failures.
C. Data Analysis
1. Bioinformatics Analysis
◦ Process raw sequence data using in-house or validated
external bioinformatics pipelines.
◦ Align sequences to reference genomes, call variants, and
annotate genetic variations.
◦ Ensure data integrity through redundant checks and
software verifications.
2. Interpretation of Results
◦ Analyze genetic variants based on clinical significance and
available databases (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP).
◦ Refer to guidelines (e.g., ACMG standards) for variant
classification.
◦ Consult with geneticists for complex cases requiring expert
interpretations.
◦ Document interpretations in the patient report thoroughly.
D. Quality Control and Validation
1. Internal Quality Controls
◦ Run positive and negative controls as part of each analytical
batch.
◦ Verify that control results meet the expected outcomes.
◦ Investigate and resolve any control failures before
proceeding to result reporting.
2. Inter-Laboratory Comparisons
◦ Participate in proficiency testing schemes and quality
assurance programs.
◦ Benchmark results against external standard organizations.
◦ Document outcomes and implement corrective actions for
any discrepancies.
E. Reporting
1. Result Documentation
◦ Compile all analytical data and interpretations in the LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report detailing patient identifiers,
test methodologies, results, and interpretations.
◦ Ensure critical findings are communicated promptly and
appropriately.
2. Result Verification
◦ Review results for consistency and accuracy before final
verification.
◦ Perform secondary review as mandated by laboratory
policies.
◦ Verify the report in the LIS before transmitting results to
ordering physicians and clinicians.
