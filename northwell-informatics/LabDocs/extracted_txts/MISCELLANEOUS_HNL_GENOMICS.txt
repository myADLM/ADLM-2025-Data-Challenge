1. Purpose The purpose of this standard operating procedure
(SOP) is to define the analytical processes for generating
results in MISCELLANEOUS HNL GENOMICS. This
encompasses the utilization of genomic data obtained from
various next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, the
interpretation of results, and the quality control measures
needed for accurate and reliable reporting.
2. Definitions
• NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): High-throughput sequencing
methodologies enabling large-scale sequencing of genomes.
• Bioinformatics Analysis: Computational analysis of genomic data.
• Variant Calling: Process of identifying variants (e.g., SNPs,
insertions, deletions) from sequence data.
1. Procedure
A) Specimen Preparation and Handling
• Upon receiving the specimens, ensure that they are properly
labeled, stored, and transported according to accessioning SOPs.
• Extract genomic DNA from specimens using designated and
validated extraction methods.
• Quantitate and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorescence-based
quantification (e.g., Qubit).
B) Library Preparation
• Utilize the appropriate NGS library preparation kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform fragmentation, end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and
PCR amplification steps specific to the library kit.
• Clean and size-select the libraries using magnetic beads or gel
electrophoresis.
• Quantitate and assess the quality of the prepared libraries using
qPCR or Bioanalyzer.
C) Sequencing
• Load the prepared libraries onto the designated NGS platform
(e.g., Illumina, ThermoFisher, PacBio) following the
manufacturer's protocol.
• Ensure the sequencing run parameters (read length, depth of
coverage, etc.) are set according to the study design.
• Monitor the sequencing run and troubleshoot any issues that
arise, following instrument-specific SOPs.
D) Data Processing
• Transfer raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) to the designated
bioinformatics server.
• Perform initial quality control on sequencing reads using tools like
FastQC.
• Use a suitable aligner (e.g., BWA, STAR) to align reads to the
reference genome.
E) Variant Calling
• Use validated variant calling pipelines (e.g., GATK, FreeBayes) to
identify genomic variants.
• Filter variants based on quality metrics and annotations.
• Annotate variants with biological information using databases like
dbSNP, ClinVar, etc.
F) Data Analysis and Interpretation
• Review and interpret the variant data.
• Use bioinformatics tools and integrative genome viewers (e.g.,
IGV) to visualize variants.
• Consult relevant literature and databases for potential clinical
significance.
• Generate a draft report of the significant findings including variant
details, interpretations, and any associated annotations.
G) Quality Control
• Perform internal quality control measures at every critical step
(e.g., variant calling, data logging).
• Utilize external quality assessment programs for periodic external
validation.
• Maintain a log of quality control activities and outcomes in the
laboratory information management system (LIMS).
H) Reporting
• Validate and finalize the report ensuring that it includes all
relevant findings.
• Have the report reviewed by a senior genomicist or laboratory
director for accuracy and completeness.
• Ensure proper documentation and archival of all data and reports
for future reference.
1. Responsibility All laboratory personnel involved in the
processing, analysis, and reporting of the genomic data must
adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the designated
senior genomicist or laboratory director to oversee and ensure
adherence to these procedures.
2. References

• Human genome reference databases (e.g., GRCh37, GRCh38)
• Genetic variant databases (e.g., dbSNP, ClinVar)
• Internal laboratory SOPs for DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis
1. Approval and Review

upon significant changes in technology or methodology.
• Document approved by: [Laboratory Director Name]
• Date of approval: [Date]
• Next review date: [One year from approval date]
End of Protocol
Note: Although every effort is made to streamline this SOP for
MISCELLANEOUS HNL GENOMICS, certain specific adjustments
may be necessary based on particular case studies or unique
specimen types.
