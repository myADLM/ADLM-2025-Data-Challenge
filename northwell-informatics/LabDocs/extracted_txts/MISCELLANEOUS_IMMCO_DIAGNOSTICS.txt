STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: Analytical Phase for
Miscellaneous Immco Diagnostics
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps involved in the analytical phase of
processing and generating results for miscellaneous diagnostic tests
using Immco Diagnostics kits. The objective is to ensure accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to execute the
analytical process described herein. All laboratory personnel must
ensure adherence to the procedures to maintain the integrity of the
diagnostic results.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
For all Immco Diagnostics tests, ensure that:
- Specimens are labeled correctly with patient information and collection date/time.
- Specimens are stored and handled according to specific assay requirements.
- Any deviations or issues in specimen integrity are documented and resolved before processing.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ Immco Diagnostics kit specific to the test being performed.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Micropipettes and tips.
◦ Assorted laboratory glassware.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Calibrated timers.
◦ ELISA reader (if applicable).
◦ Incubator (if required by the kit protocol).
2. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Read the assay-specific protocol provided by Immco
Diagnostics.
2. Allow all reagents to come to room temperature (unless
otherwise specified).
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare all reagents as directed in the assay kit protocol.
2. Reconstitute any lyophilized reagents with the appropriate
volume of diluent.
C. Sample and Control Handling
1. Place specimens, calibrators, controls, and standards in
appropriate wells/containers.
2. Be sure to vortex/mix specimens, controls, and calibrators
adequately before use.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Follow step-by-step instructions provided within the assay
protocol. Generally, this will involve:
◦ Addition of samples, controls, calibrators into designated
wells.
◦ Incubation steps at indicated temperatures and durations.
◦ Washing steps to remove unbound materials.
◦ Addition of conjugates and substrates.
◦ Reading the results in an ELISA reader or other specified
equipment.
2. Ensure timing is precise for each step to maintain test integrity.
3. Use the provided or recommended calibration curve for
quantitation, if applicable.
E. Incubation and Washing Steps
1. Adhere strictly to incubation times and temperatures specified
in the kit insert.
2. Perform washing steps using automated washers or manually
as indicated, ensuring complete removal of wash solutions
between steps to prevent cross-contamination.
F. Result Generation and Calculation
1. Measure the assay endpoint using the appropriate detection
method (e.g., absorbance, fluorescence).
2. Record raw data for all specimens, controls, and calibrators.
3. Calculate test results using system-specific software or manual
calculation as outlined in the kit protocol.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Controls
1. Include positive and negative controls with each assay to
validate test performance.
2. Document control results and compare them to acceptable
ranges specified in the kit literature.
B. External Quality Controls
1. Participate in relevant external quality assessment programs to
ensure the assay's accuracy over time.
2. Review and address any discrepancies identified during
external quality assessments.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Validate all data before reporting, checking for errors, and
ensuring control results are within acceptable limits.
5. Enter verified results into the laboratory information system
(LIS), ensuring that all data points are accurately recorded.
6. Include interpretive comments where applicable as advised by
the Immco Diagnostics kit.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the troubleshooting guide provided in the Immco Diagnostics
kit literature for handling common issues such as:
• Unexpected control values.
• Poor replicate agreement.
• Inconsistent standard curve.
1. DOCUMENTATION
2. Record all relevant data on standardized forms or electronic
records.
3. Maintain logs of reagent preparation, assay runs, control
results, and any deviations observed.
4. Ensure all records are stored securely and are accessible for
verification and audits.
5. REFERENCE MATERIALS
Refer to Immco Diagnostics kit inserts, performance specifications,
and other technical documentation provided by the manufacturer.
Conclusion
Adhering to this SOP ensures the reliability and accuracy of results
generated using Miscellaneous Immco Diagnostics kits, thereby
upholding the laboratory's standards of quality and compliance.
