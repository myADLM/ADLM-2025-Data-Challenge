MISCELLANEOUS INTER SCIENCE INSTITUTE:
ANALYTICAL PHASE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
(SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP defines the standardized process for the analytical phase
in generating results for the Miscellaneous Inter Science Institute.
The goal is to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analytical phase as per the procedures outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the team adheres to
the SOP and for addressing any issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION
Miscellaneous tests refer to a variety of assays not classified under
routine tests. This may include specialized tests depending on the
lab's capability and the needs of the clinical or research studies.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preliminary Assessment:
• Confirm the test required from the requisition form.
• Ensure the specimen is appropriate for the requested test.
Unsuitable specimens must be noted and rejected as per
laboratory policy.
B. Equipment Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment and instruments needed for the test are
properly calibrated and validated.
• Set up the required assay kits, reagents, and supplies as
recommended by the manufacturer and laboratory protocols.
• Perform pre-analytical quality control checks to verify equipment
performance.
C. Test Execution:
1. Follow Manufacturer Guidelines:
◦ Detailed test procedures must be followed as per the
specific test manufacturer guidelines or laboratory validated
protocols.
◦ Document any deviations or modifications made to the
standard procedure along with justification.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Process the specimen as outlined in the test's procedural
steps.
◦ Document all relevant information for each test run,
including batch numbers of the reagents, equipment used,
and any anomalies observed.
◦ Ensure all assay steps are conducted within the
recommended time frames to prevent delays and
degradation.
3. Intermediate Quality Control:
◦ Include appropriate quality control materials in each test run.
◦ Compare the observed values against the established
acceptance ranges.
◦ If any quality control results fall outside the acceptance
range, identify and troubleshoot potential errors, then re-run
the affected samples.
D. Data Recording and Results Generation:
• Enter the raw data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
or relevant software.
• Perform any necessary calculations as per the test method to
derive the final results.
• Verify data accuracy by cross-referencing entries and
calculations.
E. Results Validation:
• A designated technologist or supervisor must review and validate
the test results.
• Compare the results to reference ranges or expected values
specific to the test method used.
• Release the results upon verification that all internal controls meet
acceptance criteria and the results are accurate.
F. Documentation and Reporting:
• Document all findings, including necessary quality control
measures, within the test records.
• Report results according to laboratory protocols and report any
critical values immediately following institutional guidelines.
• Hardcopy and electronic records should be maintained securely
and must comply with regulatory standards.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• Document any instruments or quality control failures.
• Engage in root cause analysis for any discrepancies or anomalies
observed.
• Implement corrective actions as required and document all steps
taken.
• Notify management for further action if the issue cannot be
resolved at the operator level.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Ensure continuous quality improvement by participating in
proficiency testing and external quality control programs.
• Periodically review and update this SOP to reflect changes in
testing procedures, regulatory requirements, or technological
advancements.

• This protocol references specific test manufacturer guidelines,
internal laboratory protocols, and standard operating procedures,
which are on file with the laboratory.
