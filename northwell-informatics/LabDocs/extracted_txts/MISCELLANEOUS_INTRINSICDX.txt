STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedures for Generating Results for
Miscellaneous IntrinsicDX
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed
instructions for the analytical phase in processing and generating
results for Miscellaneous IntrinisicDX tests, ensuring consistency,
accuracy, and compliance with regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in
processing and analyzing samples for Miscellaneous IntrinsicDX
tests within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Staff: Responsible for following the procedures defined
in this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to the SOP and address any
deviations or issues that arise.
• Quality Control Personnel: Perform and review QC measures and
troubleshoot any issues.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Miscellaneous IntrinsicDX: Refers to a group of specialized
diagnostic tests not categorized under other common laboratory
tests.
• QC: Quality Control
• LIS: Laboratory Information Systems
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• Analytical Instruments specific to IntrinsicDX tests
• Reagents and calibration standards
• Quality Control materials
• A traceable thermometer for temperature-dependent equipment
• Specimen containers
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1. Preparation and Instrument Set-Up:
1. Check that all equipment, especially those that are
temperature-dependent, are within the specified tolerance
limits.
2. Daily instrument checks and calibration should be performed as
per the manufacturer’s instructions and documented.
3. Ensure all reagents and QC materials are within their expiration
dates and stored as per the labels.
4. Check and document the room temperature and humidity to
ensure they are within target limits.
6.2. Sample Processing:
1. Confirm each specimen matches the accessioning information
(e.g., patient ID, test ordered).
2. Prepare samples according to specific test requirements
(aliquot, mix, etc.).
3. Load samples onto the designated analytical instrument.
6.3. Running Tests:
1. Select the correct method for the IntrinsicDX test on the
instrument.
2. Run the test according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Monitor the instrument during testing to observe for any errors
or alerts.
4. Record all actions and findings in the logbook.
6.4. Quality Control (QC):
1. Perform QC checks according to the QC schedule detailed in
the instrument manual.
2. Analyze QC results within the acceptable ranges as per the
manufacturer’s specifications.
3. If QC results are out of range, perform troubleshooting as
follows: a. Re-run QC materials. b. Check for instrument
maintenance issues. c. Contact technical support if issues
persist.
4. Document all QC procedures, results, and actions taken.
6.5. Result Analysis:
1. Ensure that all test results fall within acceptable ranges and that
controls meet acceptance criteria.
2. Review data carefully for any abnormalities or discrepancies.
3. Verify results in the LIS following the appropriate procedures.
6.6. Reporting Results:
1. After verification, ensure results are accurately and promptly
reported in the LIS.
2. Document any critical results according to the protocol,
including notifying the relevant healthcare provider or
department.
3. Store patient reports securely and ensure confidentiality.
6.7. Sample Integrity Checks:
1. Observe and document the sample condition upon receipt and
after processing.
2. Monitor for any signs of hemolysis, clotting, or contamination.
3. If sample integrity is questionable, consult the supervisor and
consider repeating the analysis with a new sample.
6.8. Equipment Maintenance and Calibration:
1. Follow regular calibration schedules for equipment and
document all activities.
2. Perform periodic maintenance as specified by the
manufacturer.
3. Use a traceable thermometer for validating temperature-
dependent equipment post-service.
7. DOCUMENTATION:
• Temperature Monitoring Logs
• Instrument Maintenance Logs
• Quality Control Logs
• Sample Processing Logs
• Result Verification Records
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instrument manual for IntrinsicDX analytical
equipment.
• CAP or CLIA guidelines for laboratory procedures.
• Current laboratory policies and protocols.
