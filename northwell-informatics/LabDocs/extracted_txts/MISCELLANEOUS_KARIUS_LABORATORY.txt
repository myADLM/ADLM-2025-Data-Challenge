Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results at Miscellaneous Karius Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for various tests conducted at the Karius Laboratory, ensuring
accuracy, reliability, and timely reporting while adhering to CLIA
certification requirements.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow this SOP and
ensure all steps are accurately performed and documented.
Supervisors must ensure compliance with this procedure and
address any issues that arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
Samples - Specimens received for analysis, including blood, urine,
tissue, and other biological materials. Analyzers - Equipment used for
analysis, including spectrophotometers, ELISA readers, PCR
machines, etc. QC - Quality Control materials used to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Confirm the sample identity with the requisition form.
2. Document the sample receipt and accession number.
3. Check the sample integrity; reject samples that do not meet the
acceptable criteria (e.g., hemolysis, insufficient volume,
incorrect container).
4. Prepare samples according to assay requirements (e.g.,
centrifugation, dilution).
B) Analytical Instrumentation:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and operating within
manufacturer specifications.
◦ Perform daily instrument checks and document readiness.
◦ Load samples appropriately based on the instrument
guidelines.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for each specific test.
◦ Include appropriate controls (positive, negative, and blank)
for all assays.
◦ Start the analysis and monitor the instrument for any errors
or deviations.
3. Data Collection:
◦ Ensure data is collected and transferred to the laboratory
information system (LIS) without errors.
◦ Verify the instrument-generated data for completeness and
accuracy.
C) Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control (QC) tests:
◦ Use manufacturer-recommended QC material.
◦ Run QC tests at designated intervals (e.g., start of the day,
after calibration, after service).
◦ Record QC results and compare them against established
criteria.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC fails, assess the issue, retest QC materials, and
document findings.
◦ Do not proceed with sample analysis until QC results are
within acceptable ranges.
◦ Consult the supervisor if issues persist.
D) Data Analysis and Verification:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the data according to the established protocol.
◦ Cross-check results with expected control values and
reference ranges.
2. Verification:
◦ Review all test results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Document any discrepancies or unexpected findings, and
take corrective action if needed.
◦ Flag critical results for immediate review and reporting to the
appropriate personnel.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Results Entry:
◦ Enter results into the LIS accurately.
◦ Ensure all results are recorded following laboratory reporting
guidelines.
2. Verification:
◦ Have a second technologist or supervisor review critical and
borderline results.
◦ Verify and sign off on all reported results.
3. Communication:
◦ Notify the requesting physician or healthcare provider of
critical results following established protocols.
◦ Document all communications in the patient’s record.
F) Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Sample Retention:
◦ Store samples as per laboratory policy for possible
reanalysis or verification.
◦ Dispose of samples following biohazard regulations and
guidelines.
2. Maintenance:
◦ Conduct routine maintenance on all analytical instruments.
◦ Record maintenance activities in the instrument logbook.
3. Documentation and Review:
◦ Complete all documentation related to the analytical phase.
◦ Participate in regular review meetings to discuss any issues,
improvements, and updates.
4. REFERENCES
Include any relevant guidelines, manufacturer manuals, and internal
documents specific to tests conducted in the Karius Laboratory.
By adhering to this SOP, the Karius Laboratory ensures high-quality,
accurate, and reliable results for all tests performed, maintaining
compliance with CLIA certification standards.
