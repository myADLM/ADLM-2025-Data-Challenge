Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Miscellaneous Tests - Kennedy Krieger Institute
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for miscellaneous tests performed at Kennedy
Krieger Institute (KKI). This document ensures consistency, accuracy,
and adherence to quality standards in the analysis of these tests.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP and ensuring the accurate and timely analysis of miscellaneous
tests. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results and ensuring
compliance with this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Ensure that all specimens have been properly collected, received,
and accessioned prior to analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instruments (e.g., centrifuge, spectrophotometer,
analyzers)
• Reagents and standards specific to each test
• Calibrators and controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result entry
5. PROCEDURE
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Verify each specimen has been properly labeled with patient
identification and test requisition.
◦ Prepare the specimen according to the specific test
requirements (e.g., centrifugation, aliquoting).
2. Instrument Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate instruments using appropriate standards and
calibrators following manufacturer instructions.
◦ Perform quality control testing with each batch of specimens
using control materials. Document results and ensure they
fall within acceptable ranges.
3. Test Analysis:
◦ Follow the specific procedural steps for the miscellaneous
test being performed. Each test may have unique
instructions which will be detailed in individual test SOPs.
◦ Document the date, time, and initials of the analyst
performing the test.
4. Result Documentation and Verification:
◦ Enter test results into the LIS immediately upon completion
of analysis.
◦ Perform a secondary review of results to ensure accuracy.
◦ For critical results or out-of-range values, follow the KKI
policy for critical result reporting and immediate
communication to the relevant healthcare provider.
5. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
◦ If a result falls outside expected ranges or control values
indicate a problem, troubleshoot according to the specific
test procedure.
◦ Document all corrective actions taken and notify the
supervisor if issues cannot be resolved.
6. Final Review and Submission:
◦ Supervisor or qualified personnel must perform a final
review of results to ensure accuracy and completeness.
◦ Validate and release results in the LIS for clinician access.
7. Documentation and Records Keeping:
◦ Maintain all logs, including instrument maintenance,
calibration, quality control, and result documentation.
◦ Store records according to KKI laboratory policies and
regulatory requirements.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials should be analyzed with each batch of
specimens to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
Control results should be reviewed and documented. Any deviations
must be addressed immediately, and corrective actions documented.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results in the LIS ensuring that all data is reviewed and
verified.
• Notify relevant healthcare providers of critical values immediately
following the institution's critical value policy.
• Ensure that all reporting adheres to KKI’s confidentiality and data
protection policies.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for reagent kits and instruments
• Kennedy Krieger Institute laboratory policies and procedures
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines
9. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed and revised periodically or as needed to
reflect new procedures and best practices. All changes will be
documented and communicated to relevant personnel.
