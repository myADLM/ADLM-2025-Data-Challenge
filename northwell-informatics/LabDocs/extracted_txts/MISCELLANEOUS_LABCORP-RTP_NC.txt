Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Miscellaneous - LabCorp RTP,
NC Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE To outline the process for the analytical phase of
generating results for miscellaneous tests sent to LabCorp RTP,
NC, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and compliance with relevant
regulatory standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following the procedure and generating accurate results. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing and validating the work performed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY 2.1 Preferred/
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimen types as specified in the test instructions (serum,
plasma, whole blood, urine, etc.)
◦ Specimens collected in appropriate containers (e.g., SST,
EDTA, heparin tubes)
◦ Specimens properly labeled with the patient's full name,
date, and time of collection
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens with incorrect or missing
labeling - Specimens that do not meet the volume requirements
specified in the test instructions - Specimens showing signs of
contamination or improper storage/transport
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Appropriate analytical instruments as specified for the test
◦ Calibrated pipettes, centrifuges, and other laboratory
equipment
◦ Specific reagents and controls as outlined in the test
procedure
2. PROCEDURE 4.1 Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify test requisition and match with patient information.
◦ Perform any required pre-analytical treatments (e.g.,
centrifugation, aliquoting).
◦ Properly label all tubes and containers.
4.2 Analysis: - Set up the specific analyte test as dictated by the
manufacturer’s instructions. - Validate the status of all equipment,
ensuring that maintenance and calibration logs are up to date. -
Prepare reagents, standards, and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions. - Load samples onto the analyzer
following the instrument’s specific protocol. - Verify the inclusion of
relevant quality controls with each batch run.
4.3 Instrument Operation: - Start the run according to the instrument
operation manual. - Monitor the instrument during the run for any
errors or alerts. - Document any deviations or troubleshooting events
in the instrument log.
4.4 Interpretation of Results: - Review results displayed on the
instrument’s interface. - Verify results against control materials and
reference ranges provided by LabCorp. - Investigate any flagged or
out-of-range results as per laboratory protocol.
4.5 Reporting Results: - Transmit results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review. - Validate transmitted results for
accuracy, completeness, and appropriate documentation. - Authorize
and release results in compliance with reporting guidelines.
4.6 Storage and Management of Results: - Store residual specimens
according to standard laboratory protocols. - Maintain secure and
confidential storage of all documentation and electronic data. -
Adhere to the specified retention period for specimen storage.
1. QUALITY CONTROL 5.1 Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run appropriate controls with each batch of samples.
◦ Compare results to established control limits.
◦ Any control failures require repeating the test batch and
investigative action as necessary.
5.2 External Quality Control: - Participate in proficiency testing
programs as scheduled. - Review and assess performance in
external programs. - Implement corrective actions for any outliers or
unacceptable performance results.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
◦ Follow standard laboratory safety protocols and wear
appropriate personal protective equipment.
◦ Adhere to biohazard waste disposal regulations for
handling, storing, and disposing of biohazard materials.
2. REFERENCES
◦ Follow specific LabCorp RTP, NC test inserts and instrument
user manuals for each analyte.
◦ Refer to laboratory's quality management manual for
detailed procedures on quality control and calibration.
3. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain accurate worksheets and logs for all activities.
◦ Document calibration, maintenance, and quality control in
corresponding logs.
This protocol ensures that the analytical phase of generating results
for miscellaneous tests at LabCorp RTP, NC is carried out accurately
and consistently while adhering to regulatory standards and
maintaining high levels of precision and reliability.
