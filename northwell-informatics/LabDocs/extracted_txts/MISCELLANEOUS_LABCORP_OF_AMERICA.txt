Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Miscellaneous LabCorp of America
1. PURPOSE
This SOP is designed to outline the standard procedures required
during the analytical phase of generating results for miscellaneous
tests sent to LabCorp of America. The goal is to maintain
consistency, accuracy, and compliance with CLIA regulations
throughout all analytical processes.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
carrying out the analytical steps and ensuring that all quality control
measures are in place. Supervisors must ensure regular training and
proficiency testing of staff.
1. DEFINITION
Miscellaneous tests include any laboratory tests that do not fall under
routine panels and are sent to LabCorp of America for specialized
testing.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Receipt and Processing:
• Ensure that specimens received are appropriately labeled and
have been accessioned correctly.
• Verify that all required documentation and requisitions accompany
the samples.
• Confirm that the specimen meets the criteria for acceptability
(adequate volume, correct container, proper storage/
transportation conditions).
3.2 Specimen Preparation:
• Centrifuge specimens, if required, according to the test
specifications.
• Aliquot the necessary volume of the specimen as defined in the
test requisition.
• Label aliquots with unique identifiers to ensure traceability.
3.3 Equipment and Reagents:
• Ensure that all analytical equipment is calibrated and maintained
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Validate reagents and controls used in the testing against expiry
dates and quality control logs.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers and quality control
results in a quality control logbook.
3.4 Analysis:
• Follow LabCorp of America’s specific testing protocol as outlined
in the test requisition or procedure manual.
• Perform the analysis within the specified time frame to maintain
sample integrity.
• Record the results accurately, ensuring to note any deviations,
instrument flags, or anomalous findings.
3.5 Quality Control:
• Run appropriate quality control samples at the beginning and end
of each analytical batch.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
necessary, before releasing patient results.
• Follow troubleshooting and corrective action guidelines to address
any outliers in quality control measures.
3.6 Result Verification:
• Review and verify all test results against reference ranges
provided by LabCorp of America.
• Double-check manually entered data and automatically
transmitted results for consistency and accuracy.
• Ensure that critical values are highlighted and follow established
procedures for notification.
3.7 Reporting Results:
• Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) following appropriate documentation practices.
• Ensure that results are electronically sent to LabCorp of America’s
database as per the agreement terms.
• Maintain confidentiality and data integrity throughout the process.
3.8 Record Keeping:
• Maintain all records of testing, including raw data, calculations,
quality control results, and transmission logs.
• Archive samples as per laboratory retention policies in case of
dispute or need for re-analysis.
3.9 References and Resources:
• Keep updated copies of LabCorp of America’s procedure manuals
and testing protocols in an accessible format.
• Refer to manufacturer-specific inserts for detailed analytical steps
for particular assays.
• Use CLIA guidelines to ensure compliance throughout the
analytical process.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
4.1 Addressing Reagent or Control Failures:
• If a reagent or control fails, stop the testing process and replace
the defective item.
• Document the incident and corrective actions in the instrument’s
logbook.
• Revalidate new batches of reagents or controls before resuming
testing.
4.2 Instrument Malfunction:
• Refer to the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide and accompany
any actions following your facility's downtime protocol.
• Utilize backup analyzers if available and log all issues and
resolutions in the maintenance record.
4.3 Reporting Anomalous Results:
• Repeat analysis on anomalous samples to confirm results.
• Consult with a supervisor for complex issues and document all
findings and corrective measures.
