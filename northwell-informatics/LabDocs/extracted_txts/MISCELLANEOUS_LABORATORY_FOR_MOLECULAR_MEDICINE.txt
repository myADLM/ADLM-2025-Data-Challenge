Analytical Phase Protocol for MISCELLANEOUS LABORATORY
FOR MOLECULAR MEDICINE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating and validating test results at the Miscellaneous Laboratory
for Molecular Medicine. The intent is to ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible laboratory results in compliance with regulatory
standards.
Responsibility:
All laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting analytical
procedures as outlined in this protocol. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for overseeing adherence to the protocol and
implementing corrective measures when needed. 2. DEFINITION
Analytical Phase: The phase during which laboratory tests are
conducted on specimens to generate results. This phase includes the
preparation, testing, and initial data analysis processes.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
Specimen Verification: Verify that the specimen is suitable for
analysis. Check for proper labelling (patient name, ID, and collection
date/time), appropriate quantity, and adherence to the required
storage conditions. Reagent Preparation: Ensure all reagents
required for the test are prepared according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Check expiry dates and document lot numbers in the
reagent log. Equipment Calibration: Ensure all instruments and
equipment (e.g., PCR thermocyclers, centrifuges, sequencers) are
calibrated and functioning correctly. Documentation of calibration and
maintenance must be kept. B. Analytical Testing
1. DNA/RNA Extraction:
Extract DNA/RNA from the specimen using the appropriate
extraction kit and protocol for the specific test being conducted.
Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted nucleic acids
using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer. Document the
concentrations and purity ratios (A260/A280) in the Extraction
Log.
2. PCR Amplification:
Set up the PCR reaction according to the established protocol.
Include positive and negative controls in every run. Perform the
PCR amplification in a thermocycler following the specified
cycling conditions. Document the run details, including the
thermocycler ID, lot numbers of reagents, and the initial and
final volumes of the master mix.
3. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
Prepare the agarose gel according to the protocol and load the
PCR products alongside a molecular weight marker. Run the
gel and visualize the bands under UV light. Document the
results by taking photographs of the gel and logging the
presence or absence of expected bands.
4. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (if applicable):
Set up the qPCR reaction with appropriate reagents, standards,
and samples. Run the qPCR assay on an appropriate real-time
PCR platform. Analyze the data using the associated software
to determine cycle thresholds (Ct values) and quantify the
target nucleic acid. Document the run details, including plate
layout, standard curve data, and Ct values.
5. Sequencing (if applicable):
Prepare the sequencing reaction according to the established
protocol. Load the prepared samples onto the sequencer and
initiate the run. After the run, retrieve the raw data and align it
against the reference sequence using bioinformatics tools.
Document the sequencing run details, including lot numbers of
sequencing reagents and raw data analysis results.
C. Data Analysis
Review Data: Review the data generated from the analytical testing,
ensuring all controls have performed as expected. Interpret Results:
Interpret the results based on the established criteria for the specific
test. Document Results: Record the results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and initial the entry. Include any deviations
from the standard protocol and subsequent justifications. D. Quality
Control and Assurance
Quality Control (QC):
Perform QC checks on each run using internal (e.g., reference
standards) and external (e.g., proficiency testing samples) quality
controls. Document the QC results and take immediate corrective
actions if any control falls outside of the acceptable range. Ensure all
personnel involved in the testing are trained and competent. E.
Reporting Results
Verify and Validate: The technologist and a supervisor will review the
test results in the LIS for accuracy and completeness. Release
Results: Once verified, results will be released to the ordering
physician or clinician through the LIS. Critical Results: If any critical
results are identified, follow the established protocol for immediate
notification to the relevant healthcare provider. 4. REFERENCES
