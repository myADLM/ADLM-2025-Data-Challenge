Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MISCELLANEOUS
Machaon Diagnostics
1. Purpose: This protocol outlines the steps and procedures for
the analytical phase involved in generating results for
MISCELLANEOUS MACHAON DIAGNOSTICS. This SOP
ensures that the analytical phase is carried out with accuracy,
consistency, and reliability to deliver high-quality diagnostic
results.
2. Specimen: Preferred/Acceptable Samples:
• Various types of biological specimens depending on the test
required (e.g., blood, urine, tissue samples, CSF).
• Specimen should be labeled correctly with patient details,
collection date, and time.
• Specimen should be stored and transported according to the
specific test requirements (e.g., temperature guidelines,
preservatives).
Unacceptable Samples:
• Specimen collected in inappropriate containers.
• Specimen without proper labeling or identification.
• Specimen not compliant with specified test requirements (e.g.,
beyond stability limits, stored at incorrect temperatures).
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Ensure all necessary equipment, reagents, and supplies are
available and properly maintained according to manufacturer
guidelines and SOPs.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of laboratory
equipment regularly.
• Validated consumables, external controls, and reagents should be
used.
1. Analytical Procedures:
Step-by-Step Procedure:
• Confirm the specimen's identity using the provided requisition
form.
• Depending on the type of diagnostic tests required, prepare the
specimen according to specific guidelines (e.g., centrifugation,
aliquot preparation).
• Utilize the appropriate analytical instrument or method designated
for the test (e.g., PCR, ELISA, immunohistochemistry).
• Follow manufacturer-specific protocols or validated laboratory
procedures for each diagnostic test.
• Document all pertinent data, including equipment settings,
reagent lot numbers, calibration details, and any deviations or
observations during the analytical process.
Quality Control:
• Ensure quality control measures are in place, including running
control samples with each batch of test samples.
• Use internal and external controls regularly to monitor the
accuracy and precision of the diagnostic procedures.
• Evaluate and validate results against established reference
ranges and performance criteria.
• Any deviation or anomaly observed should be documented and
referred to the supervisor for corrective action.
1. Reporting Results:
• Once the analysis is complete, review the generated results for
accuracy and completeness.
• Verify the results against quality control measures and accept or
reject based on established criteria.
• Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and final reporting.
• Ensure critical values are communicated promptly to the
appropriate clinical personnel following laboratory policy.
1. References:
• Follow all referenced guidelines, including equipment manuals,
reagent inserts, and specific Machaon Diagnostics protocols.
1. Record Keeping:
• Maintain detailed records of all procedures, including specimen
handling, analytical operations, quality control data, and result
reporting.
• Records must be stored securely and be accessible for review
and audit as required.
1. Supervisor Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of supervisory staff to oversee the analytical
process, ensure compliance with SOPs, and address any issues
or deviations in the procedure.
• Supervisors must ensure that staff are trained and competent to
perform the necessary analytical tests.
1. Review and Update of SOP:
• This SOP should be reviewed periodically and updated as
necessary to reflect changes in protocols, updated guidelines, or
advancements in testing techniques.
This SOP ensures systematic and reliable production of high-quality
diagnostic results for the specified MISCELLANEOUS MACHAON
DIAGNOSTICS. All laboratory personnel are required to adhere
strictly to these guidelines.
