Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results - Miscellaneous MDX Health Inc.
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and reliable
generation of laboratory results during the analytical phase for
miscellaneous medical diagnostic tests. This protocol includes step-
by-step procedures for performing various types of assays,
maintaining quality control, and reporting results.
1. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of testing at Miscellaneous MDX Health Inc.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
carry out procedures as defined in this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
process, ensuring compliance, and addressing any issues
promptly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Analytical instruments (e.g., PCR machines, spectrophotometers,
immunoassay analyzers)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Reagents specific to the tests being performed
• Quality control materials
• Required consumables (e.g., microcentrifuge tubes, gloves)
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for results input and
transmission
1. PROCEDURE:
A) PRE-ANALYSIS:
1. Ensure all equipment has been calibrated and is functioning
correctly.
2. Check the expiration dates and lot numbers of all reagents and
quality control materials to ensure they are valid.
3. Perform instrument daily and periodic maintenance as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Set up the workspace to prevent contamination and
interference.
B) SAMPLE HANDLING:
1. Verify the label and integrity of each specimen. Only properly
labeled and intact specimens will be analyzed.
2. For tests involving blood, ensure it is adequately mixed before
analysis.
3. If aliquots are required, remember to label each aliquot
correctly and store according to the test requirements.
4. Note any unusual appearance or inconsistencies of samples
needing special handling or remarks in the LIS.
C) ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE:
1. Prepare reagents and samples following detailed instructions
for each specific test. This may include preparation of working
solutions, reagent mixing, and sample dilutions.
2. Load samples and reagents into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s specifications.
3. Perform the test run.
◦ Follow instrument prompts and ensure all steps are
conducted accurately.
◦ For manual methods, adhere strictly to the specified times
and temperatures detailed in the test SOP.
D) QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run quality control samples according to the test requirements
and the lab's internal QC schedule.
2. Compare quality control results to the established acceptable
ranges.
3. Document QC results and any deviations from acceptable
limits.
4. Do not release any sample results until QC samples are within
acceptable limits.
5. In the event of QC failure:
◦ Re-calibrate the equipment if needed.
◦ Re-run the QC samples to confirm results.
◦ Document all corrective actions taken and notify the
supervisor.
E) RESULTS GENERATION:
1. After completion of the test, review all generated data and
results.
2. Compare patient results to reference ranges.
3. Enter generated results into the LIS carefully, ensuring
accuracy in transcription.
4. Review results critically and validate results based on quality
control and instrument performance.
5. For results requiring verification or repeat testing, follow
designated protocols, ensuring compliance with accepted
standards.
F) REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION:
1. Report results according to laboratory protocols and patient
request formats.
2. Note any deviations or unusual findings in the LIS and
communicate promptly with the responsible clinician or medical
provider if results are critical.
3. All results should be verified and signed off by a qualified staff
member before being released.
4. Maintain complete documentation, including QC logs,
calibration records, maintenance logs, and test result records to
ensure traceability and compliance with regulatory standards.
5. SAFETY:
6. Follow all laboratory safety protocols and wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
7. Handle biological specimens and reagents as per the
laboratory's safety guidelines to prevent contamination and
ensure biosafety.
8. Dispose of all hazardous waste according to the laboratory's
waste disposal procedures.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's manuals and guidelines for each specific analyzer
and reagent.
• Internal Quality Control and Quality Assurance Standards.
• Relevant regulatory and accreditation bodies' guidelines (e.g.,
CLIA, CAP).
1. REVIEW OF SOP:
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary by the laboratory
supervisory team to incorporate updates in practices, new
technologies, and changes in regulatory requirements.
