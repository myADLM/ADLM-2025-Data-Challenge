STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
MISCELLANEOUS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER
ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for generating analytical test results for
miscellaneous specimens received from MD Anderson Cancer
Center, ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely results.
2. SCOPE:
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
processing and analyzing miscellaneous specimens from MD
Anderson Cancer Center.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Manager: Oversee the implementation of this protocol
and ensure personnel adherence.
• Technologists: Perform analyses as specified and document all
actions taken.
• Supervisors: Monitor performance, address any deviations from
protocol, and ensure corrective actions are taken and
documented.
4. DEFINITION:
Miscellaneous MD Anderson Cancer Center specimens generally
include a variety of biological samples such as blood, tissue, body
fluids, and other pathological samples requiring specialized testing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Analytical Instruments (specific to test type)
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents specific to the tests being
performed
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
• Laboratory documentation forms (electronic/paper)
6. PROCEDURE:
A) SPECIMEN RECEPTION AND HANDLING:
1. Verify specimen identification and accompany the
documentation.
2. Assess specimen integrity (suitability and compliance with
specimen requirements) as specified in the submission
guidelines.
3. Log specimen details into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
B) SPECIMEN PREPARATION:
1. Appropriate preparation (e.g., spinning, aliquoting, or staining)
as per specific analyte requirement.
2. Label and securely transport to designated analysis area.
C) QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Implement quality control procedures for each analytic run
including:
◦ Negative and positive controls
◦ Inter-laboratory comparison if required
2. Verify function by checking calibration status and confirming
controls fall within predetermined ranges.
3. Document all QC results and any troubleshooting steps taken in
response to QC failures.
D) ANALYTICAL TESTING:
1. Perform the designated analytical tests according to the
manufacturer's instructions and laboratory protocols.
2. Record all pertinent data including:
◦ Instrumentation used
◦ Reagent lot numbers
◦ Technologist initials
◦ Date and time of analysis
3. For tests involving manual procedures, follow the detailed steps
to ensure adherence to standardized techniques.
E) DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULT GENERATION:
1. Evaluate data for accuracy and precision.
2. Review and validate results; any results falling outside
reference ranges or showing analytical flags should be
investigated.
3. If needed, consult with the supervisor for deviation
management.
F) REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Enter results into the LIS, ensuring accuracy and
completeness.
2. Authorized personnel to certify results before release.
3. Highlight critical values necessitating rapid reporting following
established guidelines.
4. Generate official reports and electronically transmit to MD
Anderson Cancer Center.
G) CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
1. For out-of-range QC or other non-conformities, perform
appropriate corrective actions according to laboratory
standards.
2. Document corrective actions taken in the laboratory
management system.
3. Notify supervisory personnel of any significant issues
immediately.
7. RECORD KEEPING:
1. Maintain documentation for each specimen analysis, including
raw data, instrument printouts, and QC records.
2. Retain records in compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS:
1. Reference intervals for each test will be based on the
laboratory’s established data and MD Anderson Cancer Center-
specific reference guides.
2. Method limitations must be acknowledged and documented per
the test method’s guidelines.
9. RELATED DOCUMENTS:
• Laboratory Quality Management System
• Equipment Calibration and Maintenance Logs
• LIS User Manuals
• Test-Specific SOPs
