Analytical Phase SOP for MISCELLANEOUS MEDICAL COLL OF WI
(MMCW)
1. PURPOSE
This protocol delineates the procedures for conducting and validating
analytical testing in our CLIA-certified laboratory to ensure the
generation of accurate and reliable results. It covers the verification
of test results, proper equipment use, and quality control measures.
This procedure is intended to guide laboratory personnel in the
analytical phase of testing to maintain compliance with regulatory
standards and ensure the integrity of test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to the
procedures outlined in this document. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring staff compliance and managing any issues that may arise
during the analytical process.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Relevant analytical instruments (e.g., analyzers, centrifuges,
incubators, microscopes)
• Reagents and control materials specific to each test
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
1. PROCEDURE
A) PRE-ANALYTICAL CHECK
1. Verify that the specimen has been correctly received, labeled,
and accessioned.
2. Ensure that the specimen meets the criteria for acceptability.
3. Confirm that the initial specimen handling, including storage
conditions and pre-analytical preparations, has been performed
correctly.
B) INSTRUMENT SETUP AND VERIFICATION
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and within its maintenance
schedule.
2. Perform daily and pre-run checks on instruments as outlined in
specific instrument SOPs.
3. Record instrument settings, checks, and any anomalies in the
instrument logbook.
C) ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
1. Select the appropriate test method for the specimen according
to the test requisition and laboratory protocol.
2. Prepare reagents and control materials as specified in the
assay protocol.
3. Perform the test procedure as outlined for the specific analyte.
This may include: a. Loading the specimen on the instrument.
b. Adding the necessary reagents. c. Running the instrument as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Follow strict adherence to timing and environmental conditions
specified for the test.
D) QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run appropriate quality controls (QCs) with each assay batch.
2. Ensure controls fall within the specified ranges. Document and
troubleshoot any QC failures before proceeding with the
analysis of patient specimens.
3. Re-run controls if initial results are outside acceptable limits.
4. Document all QC activities in the Quality Control Log.
E) RESULT VERIFICATION AND REPORTING
1. Compare the assay results to the controls and reference
ranges.
2. Validate the test results in the LIS before final verification.
3. Review any flags or instrument alerts that may indicate
potential issues with specimen integrity or analysis.
4. Any discrepancy or unexpected result must be reviewed, and
retesting should be performed if necessary.
5. Verify and sign off on the results in the LIS.
6. Report results through the LIS to the appropriate healthcare
provider, ensuring compliance with patient confidentiality and
HIPAA regulations.
F) TROUBLESHOOTING AND DOCUMENTATION
1. If an issue arises at any stage of the analytical process, follow
the troubleshooting steps outlined in the relevant instrument or
assay SOP.
2. Document any errors, deviations, and corrective actions taken
in the maintenance and troubleshooting logbook.
3. Notify the supervisor of persistent or unresolved issues.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
Reference intervals for tests and any critical values will align with the
established laboratory standards and be readily available for
reference within the LIS and relevant manuals.
1. REFERENCES
• Instrument and reagent package inserts.
• Manufacturer manuals for specific assay and equipment
instructions.
• MMCW's specific quality and reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
The Quality Assurance team will perform regular audits of records
and logs to ensure compliance with SOPs. All incidents and
deviations will be reviewed and addressed according to the
laboratory’s Quality Management System (QMS).
