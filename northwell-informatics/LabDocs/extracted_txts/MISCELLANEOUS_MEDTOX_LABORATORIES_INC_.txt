Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generating
Results
1. PURPOSE: To outline the protocol for the analytical phase in
generating results for MISCELLANEOUS MEDTOX
LABORATORIES, INC. This includes the preparation,
processing, analysis, and documentation of laboratory test
results ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and compliance with
established quality standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory staff are responsible for
following these procedures accurately. Laboratory supervisors
must ensure adherence to protocol, review results, and
implement corrective actions if needed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: Specimen criteria must meet
acceptance standards as detailed in specimen collection
protocols. All specimens received must be accessioned and
verified for integrity and labeling accuracy before proceeding
with analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS: Ensure all equipment and
reagents used are validated, calibrated, and within their
expiration dates: a. Analytical Instruments (e.g.,
spectrophotometers, analyzers) b. Temperature-dependent
equipment (e.g., refrigerators, freezers) c. Reagents and
Consumables:
◦ Store as per manufacturer recommendations
◦ Include controls and calibration materials along with the test
samples
5. PROCEDURE:
A. PREPARATION:
1. Verify specimen labeling against requisition.
2. Check specimen integrity (e.g., hemolysis, clots).
3. Ensure all required reagents and supplies are available and
within expiration dates.
4. Confirm equipment calibration and temperature settings.
B. PROCESSING:
1. Log specimen details and assign tracking codes.
2. Perform initial checks and pre-analytical treatments
(centrifugation if needed, adequate mixing).
3. Follow instrument-specific loading and operation protocols.
C. ANALYSIS:
1. Operate the analytical instruments according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and lab-specific SOPs.
2. Ensure consistent monitoring of instrument performance
throughout the analysis.
3. Document results immediately upon generation.
D. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run controls as per predetermined intervals (daily, bi-weekly,
monthly) and document results.
2. Compare results from the current lot of reagents to control and
historical results to ensure consistency.
3. Follow corrective actions outlined if any QC fails.
E. DOCUMENTATION:
1. Log results directly into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results by technologists/supervisors before
final reporting.
3. Report critical results following established clinical guidelines.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Print results and review for accuracy.
2. Ensure adherence to reporting criteria and reference
ranges.
3. Notify proper contacts for critical values following
established communication protocols.
4. Ensure proper documentation in both electronic and print
format as required.
5. SAMPLE INTEGRITY:
1. Validate sample integrity post-analysis if necessary.
2. For hemolyzed samples or samples with air bubbles:
▪ Note condition and follow up as per lab SOPs.
▪ Re-run analysis if needed.
6. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
1. Address analyzer alerts and error codes immediately.
2. Perform secondary analysis if the result is out of expected
range.
3. Document all corrective actions thoroughly.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
1. Monthly comparative analysis with external proficiency
standards.
2. Regular review sessions for protocol adherence and
result consistency.
3. Continuous improvements based on systematic review of
results and incidents.
8. REFERENCES: Include instrument manuals, reagent inserts,
and laboratory control range documentation for each test
performed.
9. REVIEW AND VALIDATION:
• SOP Review schedule – semi-annually.
• SOP Validation schedule – annually or upon significant updates.
Approval:
Lab Supervisor

Note: Customization of the SOP is specific to the laboratory’s testing
panel and instrumentation. Ensure the alignment of this SOP with
specific regulatory and accreditation requirements.
