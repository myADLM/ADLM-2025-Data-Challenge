STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
MISCELLANEOUS MIRAVISTA DIAGNOSTICS
1. PURPOSE
The SOP outlines the analytical phase process for generating
laboratory results for Miscellaneous Miravista Diagnostics. It serves
to ensure accurate, precise, and timely analysis, documentation, and
reporting of results for various diagnostic tests provided by Miravista
Diagnostics.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the test analyses,
troubleshoot issues, and document results.
• Supervisors: Monitor the adherence to procedures, validate
results, and address any analytical discrepancies.
• Quality Assurance (QA) Team: Perform routine quality control
checks and ensure compliance with CLIA regulations.
1. MATERIALS REQUIRED
• Reagents and control materials specified by Miravista Diagnostics
for each test.
• Standard laboratory equipment including pipettes, centrifuges,
incubators, and analytical instruments.
• Specimen collection and storage containers.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result documentation and
reporting.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
• Ensure all specimens are labeled correctly and match the
requisition form.
• Verify the integrity of the specimens upon receipt.
• Store specimens as per the guidelines provided by Miravista
Diagnostics until the analysis is to be performed.
• Specimens should be processed within the specified time frames
to avoid degradation.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Verify that all required reagents, equipment, and supplies are
available and have not expired.
• Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintain a temperature
required for specific assays as per the instrument manual and
maintenance logs.
5.2 Analysis
• Follow Miravista Diagnostics-specific protocols for each
diagnostic test. For critical steps and detailed procedures, refer to
updated protocol manuals.
• Run a set of controls alongside patient specimens to ensure the
proper functioning of the test process.
• Document the lot numbers of reagents and controls used in the
processing of each batch.
• For tests with predefined incubation times or steps, use a
calibrated timer to ensure adherence to instructed durations.
• Record all observations including any abnormalities during testing
in the laboratory notebook and/or LIS.
5.3 Monitoring and Troubleshooting
• Monitor all equipment and reagents during the testing process.
• If any control does not fall within the specified range, do not
proceed with patient sample analysis until the cause is identified
and rectified.
• Document all corrective actions taken during troubleshooting.
5.4 Quality Control
• Include internal quality control measures with every test batch,
specifically the levels of control material recommended.
• Ensure the quality control results are within acceptable ranges
before patient results are released.
• Maintain quality control logs and adhere to routine test
calibrations as per Miravista Diagnostics protocols.
5.5 Data Management
• Utilize the LIS to log patient results accurately.
• Review all results for correctness before verification.
• Enter any required data or comments regarding sample condition,
QC issues, and troubleshooting steps in the LIS where applicable.
5.6 Reporting
• Verified results must be reported according to laboratory and
Miravista Diagnostic’s standard protocols.
• Notify the appropriate personnel immediately for any critical
results following the laboratory's critical value notification policy.
• Ensure all results are communicated to the relevant healthcare
provider in a timely manner.
1. MAINTENANCE & CALIBRATION
• Schedule regular maintenance and calibration of all laboratory
equipment as per the manufacturer's guidelines and document it.
• Use traceable calibration standards to ensure the accuracy of
analytical instruments.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s operation manual for equipment.
• Miravista Diagnostics test protocol manuals.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory operations.
