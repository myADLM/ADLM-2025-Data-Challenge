Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MISCELLANEOUS MML REFERRAL
TEST 1
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed procedures
and responsibilities involved in the analytical phase for
processing and reporting results for MISCELLANEOUS MML
REFERRAL TEST 1.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel involved in the
handling and testing of MISCELLANEOUS MML REFERRAL
TEST 1 to ensure that they adhere to the procedures outlined in
this SOP. It is also the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to
enforce this SOP and ensure compliance.
3. DEFINITION
MISCELLANEOUS MML REFERRAL TEST 1 refers to a
specifically designated test which needs to be carried out based
on referral requirements from the originating medical request.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ Automated Analyzer appropriate for MISCELLANEOUS
MML REFERRAL TEST 1
◦ Calibrated Pipettes
◦ Reagents specific to MISCELLANEOUS MML REFERRAL
TEST 1
◦ PPE: gloves, lab coat, eye protection
◦ Specimen collection tubes (as specified)
◦ Centrifuge (if required)
◦ Appropriate quality controls material for testing
◦ Logbooks and data recording sheets
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens must comply with the MML specifications for
MISCELLANEOUS REFERRAL TEST 1.
◦ Ensure proper labeling of all specimens.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that do not comply with the specified handling
and collection requirements.
◦ Specimens that have labeling discrepancies or are
improperly labeled.
Specimen Handling Procedure:
◦ Upon receipt, confirm that specimens are correctly labeled
and meet the specified acceptance criteria.
◦ Document the receipt and condition of the specimen in the
laboratory information system.
◦ Store specimens at the appropriate temperature as per the
specific test requirements if immediate processing is not
possible.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens.
◦ Set up and calibrate the automated analyzer as per
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Verify that all required reagents are within the expiry date
and properly conditioned.
Analysis:
◦ Label each control and specimen tube with a unique
identifier.
◦ Using a calibrated pipette, aliquot the required volume of
each specimen into the designated wells or tubes as per
automated analyzer's protocol.
◦ Place the tubes/wells into the analyzer according to the
instrument’s operational protocol.
Automated Analysis Process:
◦ Start the automated analysis as per the instrument’s
manual.
◦ While the analysis is in progress, carefully monitor the
instrument for any error messages or malfunction
indications.
◦ Record all relevant instrument settings and observations in
the laboratory logbook.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run appropriate quality controls in parallel with patient
specimens.
◦ Document results of quality control runs and ensure that
they fall within the predefined acceptable range.
◦ If QC results are out of range, stop all testing, troubleshoot
the problem, take corrective actions, and document all
actions taken before resuming patient specimen testing.
8. RECORDING AND REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Upon completion of the analysis, review the results
generated by the analyzer.
◦ Record the test results in the laboratory information system
along with the date, time, and initials of the technician.
◦ Results must be verified by a senior technologist or
laboratory supervisor before reporting.
9. RESULT VALIDATION AND REVIEW
◦ Verify that all quality control criteria are met and document
results.
◦ Correlate patient test results with clinical information if
available and ensure consistency and logical coherence.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Identify and document any limitations that impact the
interpretation of results.
◦ Communicate any limitations or discrepancies found to the
referring physician or healthcare provider.
11. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for the automated analyzer.
◦ Laboratory information system guidelines.
◦ Quality assurance protocols of the laboratory.
12. DOCUMENTATION AND ARCHIVING
◦ Maintain all logs, quality control records, and validation
reports for a minimum of 2 years or as per governing
regulations.
◦ Ensure proper archiving of test reports both electronically
and physically where required.
This SOP ensures thorough and consistent handling of specimens for
the MISCELLANEOUS MML REFERRAL TEST 1, maintaining high
standards of accuracy and reliability in laboratory results.
