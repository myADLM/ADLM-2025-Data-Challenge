Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Miscellaneous MML Referral Test 2
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for Miscellaneous MML
Referral Test 2 (MMLRT2), ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
2. Specimen Requirements
◦ Acceptable Specimen Types: Refer to the specific test
requirements from the reference laboratory. Typical
specimens include serum, plasma, or urine.
◦ Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of serum/plasma or 10 mL of
urine is required, unless otherwise specified.
◦ Storage: Store the specimen at 2-8°C until processing. If
longer storage is required, freeze at -20°C or lower.
3. Equipment and Supplies
◦ Calibrated centrifuge
◦ Approved specimen tubes (serum, plasma, or urine
collection tubes)
◦ Transfer pipettes
◦ Labeling materials
◦ Transport containers
◦ Shipping materials compliant with biological specimen
regulations
4. Procedure
A) Pre-Analytical Checks
◦ Verify that the specimen has been correctly collected,
received, and accessioned.
◦ Ensure that the specimen is not hemolyzed or lipemic, if
applicable, and there is no visible contamination.
◦ Confirm patient identification and ensure all required
information is provided on the laboratory requisition form.
B) Processing Specimens
◦ Serum/Plasma: Centrifuge the collection tube at 3,000
RPM for 10-15 minutes to separate the serum/plasma from
the blood cells. Transfer the clear supernatant into a labeled
transfer tube. Inspect for any signs of hemolysis.
◦ Urine: No additional processing is typically required. Ensure
the sample is well mixed before aliquoting if necessary.
C) Documentation
◦ Complete all documentation required for the referral,
including required details in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and on the requisition form.
◦ Include unique identifiers on all specimens and forms to
ensure traceability.
D) Packaging for Transport
◦ Use appropriate secondary containment for the specimens
to prevent leakage during transportation.
◦ Place the labeled transfer tube(s) along with the completed
requisition form into the transport container.
◦ Seal the container securely.
◦ Ensure that the transport container complies with shipping
regulations for diagnostic specimens.
E) Shipping
◦ Ship specimens under specified conditions (e.g.,
refrigerated, frozen, or at ambient temperature) to the
designated reference laboratory.
5. Quality Control
◦ Verify calibration and maintenance records for the centrifuge
and any other equipment used in specimen preparation.
◦ Confirm that all handling and processing steps comply with
established quality assurance policies.
6. Reporting Results
◦ Await test results from the referral laboratory.
◦ Ensure that results are entered into the LIS accurately and
promptly upon receipt.
◦ Review results for consistency with expected reference
ranges and clinical context before releasing them to the
ordering clinician.
7. Record-Keeping
◦ Maintain a comprehensive log of all processed specimens,
including patient details, specimen type, processing steps,
shipment details, and results.
◦ Retain copies of shipment receipts and correspondence with
the reference laboratory for audit purposes.
8. References
◦ Refer to the specific guidelines provided by the reference
laboratory for detailed test-specific specimen requirements
and handling instructions.
9. Revision History
◦ Document any changes made to this SOP along with the
date of implementation and the person responsible for the
change.
10. Contacts for Queries
◦ Designated team lead/supervisor.
◦ Reference laboratory contact person (for test-specific
queries).
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the proper handling
and processing of specimens for Miscellaneous MML Referral Test 2,
thereby guaranteeing the accuracy and reliability of test results.
