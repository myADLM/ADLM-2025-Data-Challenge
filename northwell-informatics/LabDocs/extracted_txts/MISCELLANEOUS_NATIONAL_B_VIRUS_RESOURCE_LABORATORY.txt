STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for MISCELLANEOUS
NATIONAL B VIRUS RESOURCE LABORATORY
Effective Date: [Date]
Revised Date: [Date]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps and
responsibilities in the analytical phase for generating accurate and
reliable results for miscellaneous samples tested in the National B
Virus Resource Laboratory.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the
analytical phase of testing at the National B Virus Resource
Laboratory. It includes the processes of sample preparation, assay
performance, result generation, and verification.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for preparing samples,
performing assays, and documenting results as outlined in this
protocol.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the
process, verifying results, and ensuring corrective actions are
taken when necessary.
• Quality Control Personnel: Responsible for monitoring the
quality of test results and ensuring compliance with SOPs and
quality standards.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Analytical Phase: The part of the testing process where the
actual analysis of the sample is performed, leading to the
generation of test results.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Analytical instruments specific to B Virus detection (e.g., PCR
machines, ELISA readers)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Assay kits and reagents
• Temperature and humidity monitoring devices
• Quality control materials
• Laboratory notebooks and logbooks
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
• Ensure that all samples have been properly collected, received,
and accessioned as per standard protocols.
• Verify the integrity of the sample containers (no leaks, appropriate
labeling).
• Prepare samples according to the specific requirements of the
assay being performed (e.g., nucleic acid extraction for PCR).
6.2. Assay Performance
• Follow assay-specific protocols for B Virus detection:
◦ PCR Assay:
1. Thaw all reagents and samples at room temperature.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Add the appropriate volume of sample and controls to
wells/tubes.
4. Run the PCR program on the thermocycler according to
established parameters.
◦ ELISA Assay:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature.
2. Prepare samples and controls as specified.
3. Add samples and controls to wells.
4. Follow incubation and washing steps as per the kit
instructions.
5. Add substrate and stop solution, then read the plate
using an ELISA reader.
6.3. Result Generation
• Carefully record observations and numerical data from analytical
instruments.
• Ensure all results are documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• For tests with critical results, follow established protocols for
immediate reporting and action.
6.4. Quality Control
• Incorporate quality control samples with each batch of tests:
◦ Internal Controls: Use positive and negative controls in every
assay.
◦ External Controls: Regularly participate in proficiency testing
and inter-laboratory comparisons.
• Document and review quality control data daily.
• If QC results fall outside of acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
according to manufacturer guidelines and laboratory SOPs.
6.5. Data Verification and Reporting
• Verify all test results by comparing assay runs against controls
and previous results, when applicable.
• Laboratory supervisors should review and approve all results
before final reporting.
• All verified results should be reported accurately in the LIS and
communicated with the relevant parties (e.g., physicians,
researchers).
6.6. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
• If there are discrepancies or issues with the test results:
◦ Re-evaluate the sample preparation procedure.
◦ Re-run the assay using a fresh preparation of reagents.
◦ Consult the equipment manual and perform system checks or
necessary calibrations.
◦ Document all troubleshooting steps taken in the laboratory
logbook.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records of test results, quality control data, and
instrument maintenance logs.
• Ensure all records are easily accessible and stored according to
laboratory guidelines and regulations.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer Instructions for Use (IFU) for specific assay kits
• Laboratory Quality Manual
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Relevant scientific literature on B Virus detection methods
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL This SOP will be reviewed annually or
as needed by laboratory management to ensure compliance and
accuracy. Approval is required by the Laboratory Director or the
designated authority.
