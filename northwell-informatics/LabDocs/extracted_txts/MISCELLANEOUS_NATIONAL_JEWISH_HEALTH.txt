Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Miscellaneous National Jewish Health
Tests
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and
reliable results are generated for miscellaneous tests pertaining to
National Jewish Health. This document outlines the standardized
analytical procedures to be followed by laboratory personnel.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the
analytical phase of processing miscellaneous National Jewish Health
samples. The protocol ensures detailed handling, processing, and
analysis of specimens, as well as appropriate documentation and
quality control measures.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Conduct analysis as per this SOP.
• Supervisors: Oversee the adherence to SOP, validate results, and
address discrepancies.
• Quality Control Personnel: Ensure equipment calibration and QC
materials are within specified ranges.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Acceptable Specimens: Specific to test type (refer to individual
test requirements).
• Specimen Storage: Follow individual test guidelines for
temperature and stability.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Any deviation from test-specific
requirements, improperly labeled specimens, or those that exceed
specified timeframes for stability.
5. PRE-ANALYTICAL PREPARATION
• Verify specimen integrity, volume, and labeling upon receipt.
• Document any discrepancies in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Process samples immediately or store as per individual test
requirements.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Ensure all equipment and reagents are calibrated and within
expiration dates.
• Maintain an inventory log for consumables and reagents.
7. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
7.1. General Procedure:
• Verify that the equipment calibration and maintenance logs are up
to date.
• Ensure all instruments required for the testing are checked for
proper functionality.
• Prepare the workspace with all necessary materials and PPE.
• Document all procedures in the LIS.
7.2. Detailed Test-Specific Protocols:
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for the specific test.
• Maintain detailed step-by-step documentation for each test
procedure (protocols should be referenced from the specific test
literature provided by National Jewish Health).
• Precisely measure and use reagents as specified.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Daily QC: Run controls with each batch of patient specimens to
verify accuracy.
• Document results in QC logs. Investigate and resolve any out-of-
control situations.
• Periodically analyze split samples between instruments or
methods for consistency.
• Maintain records of QC assessments, including trends and
corrective actions.
9. RESULT REVIEW AND VALIDATION
• Preliminary Review: Technologist reviews raw data and QC
results.
• Data Entry: Enter validated results into the LIS.
• Supervisor Review: Perform second-level review including trend
analysis and validation.
• Results Authorization: Authorized supervisor or technologist signs
off before releasing results to ensure accuracy.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure results are reported according to the specific protocol for
each test.
• Automated Transmission: Results are directly transmitted to the
LIS.
• Manual Reporting: If required, ensure accuracy and completeness
before release.
• Critical Results: Follow the institution's critical result reporting
policy, including documentation and immediate notification to the
appropriate healthcare provider.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of the analytical procedures, QC results, and
corrective actions in a detailed logbook or electronically within the
LIS.
• Ensure records are stored securely and are accessible for audit
purposes.
