Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Miscellaneous Nationwide Children's
Hospital Tests
1. PURPOSE This SOP describes the standardized process for the
analytical phase of generating results for miscellaneous tests
conducted at the Nationwide Children's Hospital laboratory. This
ensures test results are accurate, reliable, and reported promptly.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the duty of all medical laboratory scientists
to adhere to this SOP and ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results. This responsibility includes the use and maintenance of
analytical instruments, the performance of tests as per prescribed
protocols, and the review and validation of results. Supervisors
should verify that staff are following the procedures and address any
issues that may arise during the analytical phase.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Analytical Instruments: hematology analyzers, chemistry
analyzers, immunoassay analyzers, etc.
• Reagents and Calibrators specific to each test
• Quality Control (QC) materials
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, centrifuges, sample
containers, etc.)
4. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure all specimens are correctly labeled and meet
acceptance criteria.
2. If required, centrifuge specimens to separate serum/plasma
from cells.
3. Aliquot specimens into appropriate sample containers for
analysis, ensuring minimal handling time.
B. Calibration and Maintenance of Instruments
1. Calibrate instruments as per manufacturer’s instructions and
laboratory protocols before use.
2. Perform routine maintenance checks and log any maintenance
activity in the instrument maintenance log.
3. Confirm that all reagents and consumables are within their
expiration dates and properly stored.
C. Running the Tests
1. Perform the necessary reagent setup according to the test
being conducted.
2. Load specimens onto the analyzer and ensure the correct test
profile is selected in the LIS.
3. Execute the test run according to the manufacturer's
instructions and laboratory SOPs.
4. Continuously monitor the analyzer during the test run for any
error messages or unusual occurrences and take corrective
actions if necessary.
D. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples at specified intervals to ensure test
accuracy: a. High, medium, and low-level controls. b. Record
QC results in the LIS.
2. Review QC results to ensure they fall within the defined
acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results are out of the acceptable range, halt patient
testing and troubleshoot the cause. Do not proceed until QC
results are acceptable.
4. Document all QC activities and corrective actions in the QC log.
E. Reviewing and Verifying Results
1. Upon completion of the test run, review all patient results for
any flags or error codes.
2. Validate the results against established reference intervals and
quality control parameters.
3. Repeat tests on flagged or suspicious results if necessary for
confirmation.
4. Compare current results with previous patient records for
consistency.
F. Reporting Results
1. Verify the patient results in the LIS and ensure accuracy before
reporting: a. Include any applicable comments regarding
sample integrity, test limitations, or unusual findings.
2. Electronic transmission of results: a. Confirm that results are
accurately and promptly transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). b. Ensure that results are available to
healthcare providers in a timely manner.
3. Critical results: a. Follow the protocol for reporting and
documenting critical results. b. Immediate communication with
the healthcare provider for results that fall within critical limits.
G. Handling Unacceptable or Discrepant Results
1. Any specimen that produces unacceptable or discrepant results
should be reanalyzed after troubleshooting.
2. Document the reason for reanalysis and the actions taken to
resolve the discrepancy.
3. If the discrepancy persists, consult with a supervisor before
final reporting.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to each test's specific
manufacturer’s instructions and internal protocols for limitations
related to reagent stability, instrument performance, and other factors
affecting the accuracy of results.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s User Manuals for all analytical instruments.
• Laboratory’s Quality Control Program Documents.
• Nationwide Children's Hospital Laboratory Policies and
Guidelines.
7. DOCUMENTATION Ensure all activities are thoroughly
documented, including calibration logs, QC records, test results,
maintenance logs, and any corrective actions taken:
• Maintain documentation for a minimum period as per CLIA
guidelines.
• Ensure records are easily accessible, complete, and accurate.
8. REVIEW AND REVISION This SOP should be reviewed annually
or as required if significant changes are made to equipment, testing
protocols, or regulatory requirements.
