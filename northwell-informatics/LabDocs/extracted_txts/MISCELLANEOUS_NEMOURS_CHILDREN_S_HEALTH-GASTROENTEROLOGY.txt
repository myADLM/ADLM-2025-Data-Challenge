Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Miscellaneous Tests at Nemours Children's Health-
Gastroenterology
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure consistent, accurate, and
timely analysis of miscellaneous tests conducted within Nemours
Children's Health-Gastroenterology Laboratory. This SOP describes
the guidelines and steps required to perform, document, and validate
tests, verify results, and maintain compliance with Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the tests,
documenting the procedures, and validating results per this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this protocol
and addressing any issues or deviations that may arise during the
testing process.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all miscellaneous tests carried out in the
Nemours Children's Health-Gastroenterology Laboratory, excluding
tests with their own designated SOP.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Verify that the specimen has been properly collected, received,
and accessioned.
2. Ensure that specimens meet the required criteria (volume, type,
transport conditions) for the specific test to be performed.
Reject any specimens that do not meet criteria and document
the rejection reason.
B. Analytical Procedures
1. Equipment and Materials
Use the appropriate laboratory equipment, reagents, and supplies as
specified in the testing requirements. Calibrate and maintain
equipment per manufacturer recommendations and internal
schedules to ensure reliable performance.
1. Test Performance
Refer to the specific test protocol (detailed test kit insert or internal
laboratory procedure) for each miscellaneous test to be performed.
Follow the outlined steps meticulously, which generally include:
a. Preparing reagents and controls as per manufacturer instructions.
b. Setting up the instrumentation and selecting the proper test
parameters. c. Running quality control samples to ensure the system
is functioning within acceptable limits. d. Performing the test on
patient specimens following specific procedural steps (e.g.,
incubation, mixing, and reading).
1. Quality Control
a. Include internal and external quality control materials with each
batch of patient specimens analyzed. b. Verify that QC results are
within acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient sample
analysis. c. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken
if controls are outside acceptable limits.
C. Data Analysis
1. Review and interpret test results according to established
laboratory reference ranges and clinical guidelines.
2. Document analytical findings in laboratory information systems
(LIS) ensuring accuracy and clarity in the reported data.
D. Result Validation and Reporting
1. Validation
a. Ensure results are compared against QC materials, reference
ranges, and any relevant patient history or previous test results. b.
Validate results using the appropriate LIS validation procedures
which may include manual or automated verification.
1. Reporting
a. Results should be entered into the LIS accurately and promptly. b.
Critical values or any significant abnormalities should be reported
directly to the requesting clinician/pediatric gastroenterologist as per
laboratory policy. c. Provide comprehensive and clearly formatted
result reports that include all necessary information for clinical
interpretation.
D. Post-Analytical Procedures
1. Record Keeping and Documentation
a. Retain documentation of test performance, including reagent and
control lot numbers, calibration records, instrument printouts, and
corrective actions for a minimum of 2 years or as specified by
regulatory guidelines. b. Archive patient results and test data with
appropriate identifiers in compliance with HIPAA regulations and
internal privacy policies.
1. Equipment Maintenance
a. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of instrumentation as
per scheduled intervals and manufacturer guidelines. b. Document
maintenance activities and any service or repair actions taken.
E. Troubleshooting
1. If test results are inconsistent, perform an initial review to
identify any procedural errors or issues with reagents,
equipment, or controls.
2. Initiate troubleshooting steps as defined in specific test
procedures or equipment manuals.
3. If issues persist, involve the supervisor to seek further
assistance or support from the equipment/reagent manufacturer
as needed.
4. REFERENCES
5. Test-specific instructions as provided by the test kit or
instrument manufacturers.
6. CLIA regulations and guidelines.
7. Internal quality assurance and control policies.
8. DEFINITIONS
Refer to Section “Definition” for detailed explanations of equipment,
controls, and procedural terms.
By adhering to this SOP, clinical laboratory staff at Nemours
Children's Health-Gastroenterology can ensure that test results are
reliable, timely, and in compliance with regulatory and institutional
standards. Regular SOP audits and reviews are necessary for
continuous improvement and adherence to best practices.
