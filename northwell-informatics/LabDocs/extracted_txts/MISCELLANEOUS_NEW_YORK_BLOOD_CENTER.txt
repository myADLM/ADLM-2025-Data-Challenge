Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Miscellaneous New York Blood Center
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for processing and
analyzing blood specimens sent to the laboratory from the New
York Blood Center for various analytical tests. The goal is to
ensure accurate and timely reporting of results.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for processing and analyzing blood specimens
received from the New York Blood Center.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP to ensure accurate test
results.
◦ Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP and address
any issues or deviations.
◦ Quality Control Personnel: Monitor quality control measures
and maintain logs.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Blood specimens should arrive in appropriate containers as
specified by the New York Blood Center.
◦ Specific collection tubes and anticoagulants required for
different tests should be used (e.g., EDTA for CBC, lithium
heparin for chemistry tests).
◦ Specimens must be properly labeled with patient details and
the collection date/time.
◦ Specimens must be transported to the laboratory under
conditions that maintain their stability and integrity.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ Centrifuges
◦ Analyzers (e.g., hematology analyzers, chemistry analyzers)
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Pipettes and calibrated pipettors
◦ Reagents and consumables specific to the tests being
performed
◦ Laboratory Information System (LIS)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Reception and Verification
◦ Verify that all specimens are correctly labeled and match the
accompanying requisition forms.
◦ Check for any signs of sample integrity issues (e.g.,
hemolysis, clotting).
◦ Log specimen details into the LIS to generate accession
numbers.
B) Preparation for Analysis
◦ Centrifuge specimens, if necessary, as per the test
requirements (e.g., separate plasma/serum).
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and quality control
checks are within acceptable ranges.
◦ Prepare reagents and consumables as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
C) Analyzing Specimens
◦ Follow the specific test procedures for each type of analysis
requested (e.g., CBC, chemistry panel).
◦ For automated analyzers, load specimens and initiate the
testing process according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ For manual tests, follow the step-by-step procedure
ensuring accuracy at each stage.
D) Quality Control
◦ Run appropriate quality control materials alongside patient
specimens.
◦ Document and review quality control results to ensure they
fall within the acceptable range.
◦ If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and rerun the controls before proceeding with
patient samples.
E) Reviewing Results
◦ Once the analysis is complete, review the results for
accuracy and consistency.
◦ Verify critical results and ensure they match expected
ranges.
◦ In case of discrepancies, perform repeat testing if
necessary.
F) Reporting Results
◦ Enter verified results into the LIS.
◦ Ensure results are transmitted to the New York Blood Center
in accordance with their reporting requirements.
◦ Document any critical values and notify the appropriate
personnel promptly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Conduct routine maintenance and calibration of all
analyzers as per the manufacturer's schedule.
◦ Perform regular internal and external quality assurance
checks.
◦ Maintain comprehensive records of all quality control
measures, instrument calibrations, and maintenance
activities.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If an analyzer malfunctions, follow the manufacturer’s
troubleshooting guide.
◦ In case of persistent issues, notify the supervisor and
arrange for service or repair.
◦ Document all troubleshooting efforts and any deviations
from standard procedures.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's manuals for all analyzers and equipment
used.
◦ New York Blood Center’s guidelines and protocols.
◦ CLIA regulations and best practices.
10. REVISION HISTORY
◦ Document any revisions made to this SOP, including dates
and nature of changes.
◦ Ensure all staff are informed of any updates to the SOP.
