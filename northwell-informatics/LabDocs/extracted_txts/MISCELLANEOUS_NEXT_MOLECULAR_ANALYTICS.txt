STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Miscellaneous
Next Molecular Analytics
Document Number: SOP-XX-YYYY
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed procedures for
analyzing, validating, and generating results for miscellaneous next
molecular analytics tests carried out in the laboratory. This SOP
ensures that all steps follow standardized methods to guarantee
accurate and reliable results.
2. Scope
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel responsible
for performing next molecular analytics tests and generating
analytical results.
3. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Technologists: Execute all analytical steps in
accordance with this SOP, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
test results.
• Quality Assurance (QA) Team: Validate and review the results
for quality control before they are reported.
• Supervisors: Ensure that procedures are properly followed,
validate corrective actions and address any anomalies promptly.
4. Definitions
• Next Molecular Analytics: Advanced molecular testing
techniques which might include PCR, NGS, qRT-PCR, Sanger
sequencing, etc.
5. Analytical Procedure
A) Preparation
1. Reagent and Equipment Verification:
◦ Verify that all required reagents are within their expiration
dates and stored under appropriate conditions.
◦ Ensure equipment has undergone maintenance and
calibration as per manufacturer guidelines and has
corresponding certification logs available.
◦ Confirm that instruments such as thermal cyclers,
sequencers, PCR machines, and other relevant equipment
are in proper working order.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure samples are correctly labeled and documented.
◦ If required, extract DNA/RNA following standard extraction
methods.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of nucleic acids using
spectrophotometry or similar techniques to ensure quality.
B) Analytical Process
1. PCR/Amplification:
◦ Prepare the reaction mixture according to specific test
requirements.
◦ Load samples into the PCR machine ensuring correct
volume and placement.
◦ Program the PCR machine using the specific cycling
conditions required for the test.
2. Sequencing/Detection:
◦ Set up the sequencing reaction, ensuring proper mix of
reagents.
◦ Load prepared samples into the sequencer.
◦ Initiate the run following manufacturer instructions and
predefined parameters.
3. Data Collection and Preliminary Analysis:
◦ Retrieve raw data from sequencing machines.
◦ Perform initial quality checks and trimming of sequences
using software tools.
◦ Align sequences and identify variants using bioinformatics
tools as required.
C) Results Interpretation and Validation
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Subject data to additional analytical checks.
◦ Use specific analytical software tools appropriate for the test
(e.g., BLAST, GATK, etc.) to interpret the data.
2. Quality Control and Validation:
◦ Run internal control samples alongside test samples to
ensure validity.
◦ Compare results against known reference standards.
◦ If anomalies are detected, repeat the test or perform
additional troubleshooting measures.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document all findings with supporting evidence.
◦ Sign off on the results after thorough validation.
D) Reporting Results
1. Report Generation:
◦ Prepare formal report detailing test results clearly and
accurately.
◦ Include necessary metadata such as sample ID, test
conditions, analytic parameters, and any relevant
observations.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Submit the report for review by the QA team.
◦ Ensure the QA team validates the accuracy and
completeness of the report.
3. Dissemination:
◦ Communicate the results to the appropriate stakeholders
through the LIS or electronic transmission.
4. Archival:
◦ Archive all raw data, analytic parameters, and final reports
in accordance with laboratory retention policies.
6. Corrective Actions
• If discrepancies are found, promptly notify the supervisor.
• The supervisor will assess the situation and determine if re-
testing, additional controls, or maintenance checks are needed.
• Any remedial action taken should be documented in the corrective
action log.
7. References
• Manufacturer’s user manuals and software guides for molecular
analytical equipment.
• Current best practices in molecular diagnostics from reputable
scientific journals.
• Laboratory internal protocols on DNA/RNA extraction and PCR
processes.
