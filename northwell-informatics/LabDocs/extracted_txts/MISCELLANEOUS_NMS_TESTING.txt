Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Miscellaneous
Non-Mandatory Screening (NMS) Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for conducting various miscellaneous non-
mandatory screening tests on laboratory specimens, ensuring the
generation of accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase, including pre-analytical
preparation, test execution, result validation, QC measures, and
documentation for miscellaneous NMS testing conducted in our
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
• NMS Testing: Non-mandatory screening tests that are processed
as per physician or clinician request.
• Designated staff: Technologists or lab personnel accredited and
trained to perform NMS testing.
• QC: Quality Control.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Conducting the testing, ensuring
quality control, documenting results, and validating data.
• Supervisors: Overseeing the integrity of test processes and
handling anomalies or deviations according to the SOP.
• All Staff: Reporting aberrations in testing protocol and equipment
functioning.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Analytical instruments specific to NMS testing, such
as spectrometers, ELISA readers, PCR machines, etc.
• Reagents: As specified in each test protocol; ensure correct
storage and handling.
• Supplies: Sample containers, pipettes, calibrated measurement
devices, gloves, lab coats, logbooks, and other test-specific
materials.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types: As specified on the test requisition form (e.g.,
blood, urine, saliva, etc.)
• Handling: Follow specific handling and storage instructions as
per test requirements to maintain specimen integrity.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Specimens not meeting the specific
test's collection, storage, or transport guidelines will be rejected.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Verify that specimens are correctly labeled and meet the
acceptance criteria.
2. Record the specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Prepare the specimen according to test requirements (e.g.,
aliquoting, centrifugation).
B) Test Execution:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure reagents and instruments are within their calibration
and expiration dates.
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions for reagent preparation
and instrumentation setup.
2. Assay Specific Steps: (Detail the steps for the specific NMS
tests the laboratory performs – this will vary widely depending
on the test and kit/method used. For example, enzyme assays,
nucleic acid amplification tests, immunohistochemistry, or mass
spectrometry could each have different steps.)
3. Instrument Operation:
◦ Load specimens and controls into the instrument exactly as
per the protocol.
◦ Record instrument settings and parameters relevant to the
test.
4. Monitoring:
◦ Observe and ensure the proper progression of the testing
process.
◦ Document any technical issues and corrective actions
taken.
C) Result Review and Validation:
1. Initial Review:
◦ Check raw data for coherence and completeness using
instrument software or manual calculation as needed.
2. QC Results:
◦ Analyze the quality control specimens first. If QC is within
the acceptable range, proceed to patient specimen analysis.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the error resolution
guideline specific to the test.
3. Cross Verification:
◦ If results are critical or unexpected, re-test or verify using an
alternative method if available.
◦ Compare results to any previous assays for consistency.
D) Documentation:
1. Result Recording:
◦ Enter only validated results into the LIS.
◦ Record relevant instrument parameters, conditions, and any
deviations in the logbook.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Ensure that results are accurately communicated to the
requesting clinician or included in the patient’s medical
record.
◦ Follow specific guidelines for reporting (e.g., electronic
transmission, printed reports).
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE MEASURES
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Employ internal controls to monitor assay accuracy. Perform
controls at the beginning and end of each testing batch.
2. Inter-Laboratory Comparisons:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs relevant to
miscellaneous NMS testing.
◦ Engage in inter-laboratory testing to ensure congruence with
external standards.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for specific test limitations.
• Document any known limitations impacting the interpretation of
results.
