MISCELLANEOUS OCULAR IMMUNOLOGY LABORATORY -
OHSU
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) #001
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results in the Miscellaneous Ocular Immunology Laboratory at
OHSU. This ensures the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of test
results involving ocular immunological assays and other
miscellaneous tests.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel performing various ocular
immunology tests, including but not limited to autoimmune disease
panels, cytokine assays, and immunofluorescence staining.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analyses, ensuring proper documentation, and adhering to the
specified procedures. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the compliance of the procedures, troubleshooting, and
ensuring corrective actions are implemented when necessary.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Autoimmune Disease Panels: Includes assays to detect
autoantibodies related to ocular conditions.
• Cytokine Assays: Measure levels of cytokines in ocular samples.
• Immunofluorescence Staining: Used to identify specific antigens
in tissues using fluorescently-labeled antibodies.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 GENERAL GUIDELINES
• Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and functioning correctly.
• Verify that the specimen meets the acceptance criteria before
proceeding with the analysis.
• Follow all safety and PPE guidelines as stipulated by the
laboratory’s safety protocols.
5.2 AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE PANELS
5.2.1 Materials and Equipment
• ELISA kits for specific autoantibodies
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagents and controls
5.2.2 Procedure
1. Prepare Reagents: Reconstitute and prepare all reagents as
specified in the kit instructions.
2. Sample Preparation: Dilute the ocular fluid or tissue sample as
necessary.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of samples, controls, and
standards into the wells.
◦ Incubate the plate as specified by the kit instructions.
4. Detection:
◦ Add detection antibodies and substrate solutions as
directed.
◦ Observe color development and stop the reaction at the
specified time.
5. Reading Results: Read the plate using a microplate reader at
the appropriate wavelength.
6. Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of autoantibodies using
standard curves.
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
5.3 CYTOKINE ASSAYS
5.3.1 Materials and Equipment
• Multiplex cytokine assay kit
• Luminex analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagents and controls
5.3.2 Procedure
1. Prepare Bead Mix: Vortex and prepare the bead mix as
specified.
2. Sample Preparation: Dilute the sample as per kit instructions.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Add the bead mix to each well, followed by samples,
controls, and standards.
◦ Incubate the plate on a shaker at the specified temperature
and duration.
4. Detection:
◦ Add detection antibodies and read the plate on the Luminex
analyzer.
5. Reading Results: Analyze the data using the Luminex
software.
6. Interpretation:
◦ Obtain cytokine concentrations from the standard curves.
◦ Document results in the LIS.
5.4 IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STAINING
5.4.1 Materials and Equipment
• Fluorescence microscope
• Slides and coverslips
• Fluorescent-labeled antibodies
• Mounting medium
• Wash buffers
5.4.2 Procedure
1. Fixation: Fix the ocular tissue sections on slides using an
appropriate fixative.
2. Blocking: Block non-specific binding sites with a blocking
solution.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation: Incubate the tissues with the
primary antibodies at the recommended dilution and
temperature.
4. Washing: Wash the slides to remove unbound antibodies.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation: Incubate with fluorescent-
labeled secondary antibodies.
6. Mounting: Mount the slides with an antifade mounting medium.
7. Microscopy:
◦ Observe the prepared slides under a fluorescence
microscope.
◦ Capture images as necessary.
8. Interpretation: Analyze the fluorescence patterns and
document findings in the LIS.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Record all QC data and monitor for any deviations from expected
results.
• Investigate and troubleshoot QC failures promptly.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a designated
technologist.
• Any abnormal or critical findings should be reported immediately
to the requesting physician.
• Ensure all results are accurately documented in the LIS and
flagged for any necessary follow-up.
8. REFERENCES
• Package inserts from ELISA and multiplex assay kits.
• Fluorescence microscope user manual.
• Laboratory safety and PPE guidelines.
