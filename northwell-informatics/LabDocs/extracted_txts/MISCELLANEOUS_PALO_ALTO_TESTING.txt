MISCELLANEOUS PALO ALTO TESTING PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide comprehensive guidance
for generating accurate and reliable test results for Miscellaneous
Palo Alto Testing in the laboratory. This protocol outlines the
procedures necessary to perform these tests, including equipment
and reagent preparation, test execution, and result verification.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure the quality and accuracy of test results for Miscellaneous Palo
Alto Testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types and Collection:
• Accepted specimens include blood, serum, plasma, urine, CSF,
and other body fluids.
• Ensure proper labeling of the specimen, including patient
identification, date, and time of collection.
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory under
appropriate conditions to maintain integrity.
Specimen Processing and Stability:
• Centrifuge blood specimens to separate serum or plasma within
one hour of collection.
• Store serum/plasma specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 24 hours; for longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
• Urine specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if analysis is
delayed beyond four hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with incorrect labeling.
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus unless
these conditions are expected in the clinical context.
• Specimens that have been stored beyond stability limits.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (calibrated and maintained)
• Analytical instruments specific to Palo Alto Testing (details in the
appropriate manufacturer's documentation)
• Refrigerators and freezers for specimen storage
Reagents:
• Only use reagents that are within the expiration date and stored
as recommended by the manufacturer.
• Prepare reagents as indicated by the manufacturer or laboratory
protocol.
Supplies:
• Appropriate specimen collection containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibration and QC materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify specimen identification and labeling.
2. Process specimens according to the type and storage stability
recommendations.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Follow specific testing instructions as provided by the
manufacturer of the Palo Alto Testing equipment.
2. Calibrate the equipment if required, using appropriate
standards and controls.
3. Perform routine quality control checks using the following
materials:
◦ Commercially available control samples for internal QC.
◦ Pre-assigned confidence intervals for QC materials.
Testing Procedure:
1. Verify that the equipment is properly set up and calibrated.
2. Allow reagents and controls to reach room temperature before
analysis, if applicable.
3. Pipette the appropriate volume of the specimen into the
designated testing vessel or cartridge.
4. Initiate the test process according to the instrument's
operational manual.
5. Record the start time and ensure the test runs uninterrupted.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Review generated test results for any discrepancies or flags
indicated by the analytical instrument.
2. Compare results to QC standards and rerun tests if QC criteria
are not met.
3. Verify and validate all results prior to reporting.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform assays with control samples to ensure accuracy.
• Run QC samples at the start of each shift and at designated
intervals throughout testing.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs for external QC
assessment.
• Document and review all QC data regularly.
1. RESULT REPORTING
Verification and Documentation:
• Technologists review results for completion before verification.
• Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Critical Values:
• Immediate communication of critical values to the appropriate
clinician as specified in the laboratory policy.
• Documentation of critical value notification.
Routine Reporting:
• Follow site-specific guidelines for entering and transmitting results
to the electronic health records (EHR).
• Ensure all result entries are accurate and complete before
finalization.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Regular Maintenance:
• Follow the manufacturer's guide for routine maintenance of the
testing equipment.
• Record all maintenance activities in the equipment logbook.
Troubleshooting:
• Refer to manufacturer manuals for troubleshooting steps.
• Notify a supervisor and contact technical support if issues persist
beyond basic troubleshooting.
