STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES: ANALYTICAL PHASE
FOR MISCELLANEOUS PREVENTION GENETICS LAB
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for processing, analyzing, and generating results for
miscellaneous prevention genetics testing within the laboratory.
This ensures consistent, accurate, and reproducible results in
compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kits
• Gel electrophoresis system
• Real-time PCR machine
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips (sterile)
• PCR tubes and plates
• Nucleic acid purification and quantification equipment
• Ethanol 70% (v/v)
• Agarose for gel electrophoresis
• DNA ladder
• Ethidium bromide or other DNA stain
• Sequence analysis software
1. PROCEDURE:
A. DNA Extraction:
i. Spin down and resuspend the sample to ensure proper mixing. ii.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the DNA extraction kit to
isolate genomic DNA. iii. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted
DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorimeter. iv. Dilute DNA to the
desired concentration appropriate for the downstream application
(e.g., PCR).
B. PCR Amplification:
i. Prepare the PCR master mix on ice, consisting of DNA template,
primers, nucleotides, buffer, and Taq polymerase/enzyme mix as
required. ii. Load the PCR tubes or plate with the master mix and
template DNA, ensuring each sample is properly labeled. iii. Run the
PCR under the appropriate cycling conditions specific to the target
genes. iv. Include positive and negative controls to validate each run.
C. Electrophoresis and Visualization:
i. Prepare an agarose gel by dissolving the appropriate amount of
agarose in TAE/TBE buffer and cast the gel. ii. Load the PCR
products alongside a DNA ladder into the wells of the agarose gel. iii.
Run the gel at a constant voltage until adequate separation of
fragments is achieved. iv. Stain the gel using ethidium bromide or an
alternative stain and visualize under UV light. v. Capture an image of
the gel and document bands corresponding to the expected product
sizes.
D. Real-Time PCR Analysis:
i. Prepare the reaction mix according to the protocol of the Real-time
PCR kit or manufacturer’s guidelines. ii. Set up the Real-time PCR
machine with the appropriate program for the target sequence. iii.
Load the reaction mix into the plate or tubes, ensuring correct sample
identification. iv. Add the positive, negative, and no-template controls.
v. Run the Real-time PCR, documenting the cycle threshold (Ct)
values and amplification curves.
E. Sequence Analysis (if applicable):
i. Prepare the sequencing reaction following the guidelines of the
sequencing kit. ii. Load the reaction products onto the sequencer and
initiate the run. iii. Analyze the sequencing data using the appropriate
software to identify genetic variants. iv. Confirm the sequence data by
comparing with reference sequences.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform all assays in duplicate to ensure the reliability of results.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all instruments according to the
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Utilize appropriate controls (positive, negative, no-template
controls) for each batch of samples processed.
• Perform proficiency testing and participate in external quality
assessment programs to maintain high standards of accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Analyze and interpret the data, documenting any findings and
noting any deviations from expected results.
• Enter final validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Review and verify results by a qualified technologist before
generating reports.
• Document any critical findings, and communicate these results
promptly to the ordering physician/requester.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure that the quantity and purity of DNA meet the requirements
for successful PCR amplification.
• False negative/positive results can occur due to sample
contamination or suboptimal assay conditions.
• Genetic variants not targeted by the assay will not be detected.
1. RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain a detailed log of all procedures, including sample
reception, DNA extraction, PCR assays, electrophoresis results,
and any troubleshooting undertaken.
• Ensure proper documentation in the temperature logs for storage
conditions of reagents and samples.
