Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase Protocol:
Miscellaneous Quest Diagnostics
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely generation of results for miscellaneous
Quest Diagnostics tests by following consistent and standardized
procedures during the analytical phase.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all miscellaneous Quest Diagnostics tests
processed in our CLIA-certified laboratory during the analytical
phase.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff and supervisors are responsible for
performing and documenting the analytical procedures accurately,
ensuring compliance with this SOP, and addressing any issues that
may arise.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling and Preparation
• Ensure that the specimen has been collected, received, and
accessioned according to the pre-analytical SOPs. • Verify specimen
integrity, including proper labeling (patient identification, collection
date and time) and appropriate storage conditions.
B. Reagents and Supplies
• Verify that all reagents, controls, and supplies are within their
expiration dates and have been stored according to the
manufacturer's instructions. • Prepare reagents according to the
specific test protocol provided by Quest Diagnostics.
C. Equipment Setup
• Ensure all analytical instruments are calibrated and maintained
according to the manufacturer's guidelines. • Verify temperature and
humidity requirements for the testing equipment and laboratory
environment as outlined in the general monitoring SOP.
D. Quality Control
• Run quality control checks as specified for each test to ensure
reliable results. • Document QC results and take necessary corrective
actions if QC fails.
E. Testing Procedure
• Follow the specific Quest Diagnostics test protocol for each
miscellaneous test. Ensure the procedure is provided in the package
insert or reference document by Quest Diagnostics. • Log
temperature, time, and initials of the technologist performing the test
on the Temperature Monitoring Log if required.
F. Result Review and Verification
• Review generated results for accuracy and consistency. Investigate
any discrepancies or issues. • Verify results according to the
designated Quest Diagnostics guidelines and document the
verification process.
G. Reporting Results
• Document the analytical results meticulously, including any
comments or observations. • Enter results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and verify the correct transmission to
patients' electronic health records (EHR). • Follow site-specific
reporting guidelines, ensuring prompt and accurate dissemination of
results.
5. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols, including the handling and
disposal of biohazardous materials. • Ensure compliance with
relevant regulations and standards set forth by CLIA, CAP, and other
accrediting bodies. • Document all procedural steps and any
deviations in case of an audit or review.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In the event of instrument malfunction or abnormal results:
• Follow the troubleshooting guidelines provided by the instrument
manufacturer.
• Notify the supervisor immediately and take corrective actions.
• Document the issue, steps taken, and resolution in the logbook.
