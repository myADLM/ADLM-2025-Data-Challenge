STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) ANALYTICAL
PHASE – MISCELLANEOUS QUEST/NICHOLS TESTING
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to provide a
standardized procedure for performing miscellaneous testing using
methods provided by Quest Diagnostics/Nichols Institute. This
procedure ensures that tests are executed accurately, results are
validated, and corrective actions are documented when necessary.
Responsibility: Laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out
tests according to this protocol, documenting all results, and reporting
any issues or discrepancies to supervisors.
2. SPECIMENS Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Serum
• Plasma
• Whole blood
• Urine
• CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid)
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Specimens should be collected using standard techniques.
• Incorrectly handled, degraded, or mislabeled specimens will be
rejected.
• Specimens that require refrigeration should be kept at 2-8°C
unless otherwise indicated.
• Specimens that need to be kept frozen should be stored at ≤
-20°C.
• Do not use specimens that have been exposed to extreme
temperatures.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Analytical platforms and instruments
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Test-specific reagents (Quest/Nichols specific)
• Controls as applicable
• Reference material for standardization
• Worksheets/logs
4. PROCEDURE General Guidelines:
1. Ensure all instruments required for testing are calibrated and
functioning.
2. All reagents used must be within their expiration date.
3. All samples should be thoroughly mixed prior to aliquot
procedures.
Specimen Handling:
1. Match specimens to requisitions and log all relevant patient
information.
2. Centrifuge blood specimens at the recommended speed and
time if applicable.
3. Transfer aliquots of serum/plasma appropriately into test tubes
for analysis.
4. Label all aliquots accurately with patient identifiers.
Testing Procedure:
1. Prepare all reagents as instructed by Quest Diagnostics/Nichols
testing kit insert.
2. Follow analytical procedures according to specific test
methodologies provided. a. Refer to individual package inserts
for correct test-specific procedures and incubation periods. b.
Perform all steps with precision to avoid contamination and
cross-reactivity.
3. Document all procedure steps in the designated log.
4. Process quality controls concurrently to validate the accuracy of
the test.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (positive and negative controls)
with each batch.
2. Record QC results in the designated log.
3. Address any control failures immediately by validating against
acceptable ranges and re-running QC if necessary.
4. Notify supervisor of persistent issues.
Result Validation:
1. Ensure all patient results and controls are reviewed for
accuracy.
2. Validate results against control ranges and reference intervals.
3. Utilize the proper documentation format to record results.
4. Any results that deviate from expected controls should be re-
run.
5. Prior to reporting, ensure results are reviewed by a qualified
technologist.
Reporting Results:
1. Confirm all results are entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review LIS entries for correct patient identification.
3. Ensure flagged results are appropriately documented.
4. Report critical findings immediately to attending clinician.
5. SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS:
• Proper waste disposal for biohazard materials.
• Follow all lab safety protocols including PPE usage.
• Ensure chemical reagents are stored and handled according to
their MSDS guidelines.
6. REFERENCES:
• Quest Diagnostics/Nichols product inserts and testing
methodology.
• Laboratory Information System manual.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and laboratory standards.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
• Complete logs for specimen receipt, quality control, assay
procedure, and result reporting.
• Maintain copies of all test run sheets and instrument printouts.
• Store all documentation securely per laboratory protocol for
retrieval audit trails.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Refer to Quest/Nichols manuals for troubleshooting specific test
anomalies.
• Ensure corrective actions are documented and reported.
• Seek supervisory guidance in uncertain situations.
This SOP ensures compliance with CLIA regulations while
maintaining high standards for test accuracy and patient safety.
Review This SOP will be reviewed annually, or more frequently as
required due to changes in equipment, test procedures, or regulatory
requirements.
