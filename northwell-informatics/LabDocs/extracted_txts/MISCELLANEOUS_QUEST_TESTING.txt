Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Miscellaneous Quest
Testing in the Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
miscellaneous quest testing in ensuring accurate and reliable
laboratory results for specimens that do not fall into conventional test
categories.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
miscellaneous quest testing during the analytical phase.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Serum, plasma, whole blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or
other body fluids as specified by test requirements.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens not matching the test specifics (e.g., wrong type of
anticoagulant, improper collection or storage).
Specimen Stability:
• Follow specific guidelines provided for each test. Where unclear,
refer to test-specific documentation or consult with a laboratory
supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
General Equipment:
• Centrifuges
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Analyzers as designated for each specific test
Reagents:
• Refer to test-specific documentation for details on required
reagents and their storage conditions.
Quality Control Material:
• Appropriate QC materials specified for the miscellaneous test
should be used, stored, and handled according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Verify specimen integrity upon receipt. Check for appropriate
labeling, required volume, and any signs of contamination or
hemolysis.
2. Centrifuge specimens according to the test-specific protocol if
serum or plasma is required.
B. Analytical Process
1. Instrument Set-Up:
◦ Perform daily instrument calibration checks as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Verify instrument functionality by running quality control
samples.
2. Running the Test:
◦ Load the specimen onto the analyzer or prepare manually
as per the test-specific protocol.
◦ Ensure that reagents are prepared and loaded according to
the instructions provided in the testing kit.
◦ Follow specified time intervals for incubation, mixing, and
other procedural steps.
3. Result Verification:
◦ Review the instrument printout or read manual test results
accurately.
◦ Compare QC results to established control limits to validate
the run. If QC results are out of control, troubleshoot and
rerun QC and patient specimens.
◦ Document all findings and corrective actions taken in case
of QC failure.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Interpret results based on reference intervals provided in
specific test documentation.
◦ Apply any necessary calculation formulas as instructed in
the test method.
5. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
accurately and legibly.
◦ Attach any relevant comments or codes as necessary for
results that fall outside expected ranges or encounter
technical issues.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by technologists.
C. Troubleshooting
1. If an instrument or procedural issue arises, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the instrument/manual.
2. Contact technical support if the issue is unresolved within the
laboratory.
3. Document all troubleshooting steps and outcomes in the
laboratory logbook.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Frequency: Perform quality control as specified in the procedural
protocol or at least daily if unspecified.
QC Material:
1. Use internal and external quality control samples.
2. Record and evaluate QC results before running patient
specimens.
Actions for QC Failures:
1. Halt testing immediately if QC results are out of range.
2. Take corrective actions (e.g., check reagent expiry, recalibrate).
3. Document and rerun QC samples before proceeding with
patient samples.
7. SAFETY
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses.
2. Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
3. Follow biosafety protocols as outlined by the laboratory safety
officer.
8. REFERENCES
Include any relevant documentation from reagent kits, instrument
manuals, and testing guidelines for specific miscellaneous quest
tests.
