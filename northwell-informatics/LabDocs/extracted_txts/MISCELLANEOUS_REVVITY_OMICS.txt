Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for MISCELLANEOUS
REVVITY OMICS
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures and protocols for the
analytical phase of generating results using MISCELLANEOUS
REVVITY OMICS equipment. This ensures reliable, accurate,
and consistent analytical performance and results reporting.
RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated analysts and laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and addressing any procedural inconsistencies or errors.
1. DEFINITIONS MISCELLANEOUS REVVITY OMICS:
Instrumental platform and associated techniques used for
comprehensive omics studies, including genomics, proteomics,
metabolomics, and lipidomics analysis.
2. PROCEDURE
3.1 Pre-Analysis Preparation
• Verify that all instruments are calibrated and their operational
status is satisfactory.
• Ensure that all necessary reagents and consumables are
available and have not expired.
• Confirm that samples have been appropriately collected, stored,
and labeled as instructed in prior documentation.
3.2 Instrument Set-Up
• Turn on the REVVITY OMICS instrument and allow it to undergo
a warm-up period as specified by the manufacturer.
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for system verification and
performance check.
• Ensure that all maintenance and calibration logs are updated and
stored.
3.3 Sample Preparation and Loading
• Process samples according to specific protocols related to the
omics analysis (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, or
lipidomics).
• For liquid samples, ensure the required volumes are accurately
pipetted and loaded into appropriate vials.
• For solid samples, carry out the necessary homogenization,
extraction, or digestion procedures as specified.
• Load samples into the system following the instrument protocol,
ensuring proper alignment and position.
3.4 Running the Analysis
• Select the appropriate method and analytical parameters from the
pre-programmed options in the REVVITY OMICS software.
• Start the analytical run, ensuring continuous monitoring of the
system performance.
• Document any deviations or error messages in the instrument log
and take corrective actions as necessary.
3.5 Data Acquisition and Processing
• Data will be concurrently acquired and saved automatically by the
instrument software.
• Upon completion of the run, use data processing algorithms
provided by the system to perform initial data analysis.
• Extract key metrics as specified for further interpretation.
3.6 Quality Control (QC)
• Perform QC checks using control samples with known responses.
• Compare the control sample results with defined QC ranges to
validate each run.
• Investigate and document any QC failures and repeat analysis if
necessary.
3.7 Data Review and Validation
• Review raw and processed data to identify any analytical
discrepancies or anomalies.
• Validate the analytical results ensuring they meet the defined
acceptance criteria.
• Confirm that both internal and external standards align with
expected values.
3.8 Reporting Results
• Export validated data to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Check and confirm that all associated metadata are correctly
reported.
• Review the final report, ensuring completeness and accuracy
before submission to the requesting party.
3.9 Documentation and Records
• Update all relevant logs, including instrument usage, calibration,
maintenance, and result logs.
• Securely store raw data files and analytical reports according to
laboratory data retention policies.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols including proper lab
attire, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and handling
of biohazards and chemicals.
• Comply with all relevant regulations and guidelines pertaining to
omics analysis.

• Manufacturer’s Instrument Manual and Software Guide for
REVVITY OMICS.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines for laboratory practices.
1. REVISIONS
• This SOP is subject to review and revisions every October to
ensure it aligns with current best practices and regulatory
requirements.
