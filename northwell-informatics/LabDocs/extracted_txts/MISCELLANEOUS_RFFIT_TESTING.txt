Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MISCELLANEOUS
RFFIT TESTING
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of results for
the Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT) used in the
laboratory for determining rabies virus neutralizing antibodies. It aims
to ensure accurate, consistent, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are
responsible for performing the RFFIT assay in the analytical phase.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory staff is responsible for performing,
documenting, and ensuring integrity during the execution of the
RFFIT assay. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
compliance with this SOP and addressing any deviations or issues
identified.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples collected in red-top Vacutainer tubes or serum
separator tubes (SST).
• Store at 2-8°C if not tested immediately; if testing is delayed for
more than 48 hours, store at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis.
• Specimens contaminated or collected in improper tubes.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
NOTE: All specimens must be adequately labeled with the patient's
identifier, date, and time of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Micropipettes and tips (appropriate volume ranges for the assay)
• CO2 incubator set at 37°C
• Fluorescence microscope or an automated imaging system
• 96-well tissue culture plates
• Rabies virus stock (appropriate strain)
• Fluorescently labeled anti-rabies antibodies
• Culture medium and supplements
• Control sera (positive and negative)
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other relevant PPE
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents and samples completely at room
temperature.
◦ Prepare the appropriate dilutions of control sera and test
sera in culture medium.
◦ Label the 96-well plates clearly and logically to avoid mix-
ups during analysis.
2. Virus and Sample Incubation:
◦ Dilute the rabies virus stock in culture medium to the
predetermined working concentration.
◦ In designated wells, mix equal volumes (e.g., 50 µL) of virus
suspension and diluted serum (test, positive control, and
negative control).
◦ Incubate the plates at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 1 hour to
allow antibody-virus binding.
3. Cell Culture:
◦ Add a pre-determined number of susceptible cells (e.g.,
BHK-21) to each well containing the virus-serum mixture
(e.g., 50 µL of cell suspension).
◦ Further incubate the plates under the same conditions for
20-24 hours.
4. Fixation and Staining:
◦ After incubation, fix the cells with an appropriate fixative
(e.g., acetone-methanol, or another recommended fixative)
following a defined protocol.
◦ Stain the cells with fluorescently labeled anti-rabies
antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Carefully wash the plates to remove excess and unbound
antibodies.
5. Microscopic Observation:
◦ After staining, observe the plates under a fluorescence
microscope or an automated imaging system.
◦ Determine the number of fluorescent foci in each well.
◦ Compare to controls to differentiate between positive and
negative results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document results of controls and ensure they fall within the
established acceptable ranges.
• If controls do not meet acceptance criteria, invalidate the run, and
repeat the assay, ensuring that all reagents and equipment are
functioning appropriately.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile results of test sera and calculate the virus neutralization
titer based on the reduction in fluorescent foci.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions for records.
• Enter the validated results into the laboratory information system
for verification and further clinical interpretation.
• Critical results must be reported immediately to the requesting
physician.
9. PROCEDURAL NOTES
• Handle all biological materials using biosafety level 2 (BSL-2)
practices.
• Ensure thorough training and competency assessment of all
personnel involved in performing the RFFIT assay.
10. REFERENCES
• Refer to the relevant guidelines provided by authoritative bodies
such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or
World Health Organization (WHO) for updated protocols and
recommendations.
• Product insert and manufacturer's instructions for fluorescently
labeled anti-rabies antibodies and other commercial reagents.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of assay runs, results of samples and
controls, instrument calibration records, reagent lot numbers, and
expiration dates.
• Record and investigate any deviations from the procedure, and
document corrective actions taken.
