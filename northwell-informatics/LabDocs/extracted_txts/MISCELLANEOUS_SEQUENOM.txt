Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MISCELLANEOUS
SEQUENOM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for miscellaneous
Sequenom tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible outcomes while maintaining compliance
with laboratory regulations.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all procedures related to Sequenom tests as outlined in
this SOP. Supervisors must ensure adherence to protocols and
address any issues that may arise during the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood or extracted DNA
• Collection Tubes: EDTA tube for whole blood, sterile tubes for
extracted DNA
• Volume: Minimum of 3 mL of whole blood or 50 ng/µL of extracted
DNA
• Storage Conditions: Whole blood stored at 2-8°C, extracted DNA
stored at -20°C
• Stability: Whole blood stable for up to 5 days at 2-8°C, extracted
DNA stable long-term at -20°C
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sequenom MassARRAY Analyzer
• Calibrated Pipettes (20 µL, 200 µL, 1000 µL)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Nuclease-free water
• Calibration and control reagents
• Sequenom iPLEX Gold reagents kit
• 384-well microplates
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
I. Preparation
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
• Verify the availability and condition of all required reagents and
supplies.
II. Specimen Preparation
• For whole blood, extract DNA using an approved extraction
protocol.
• For extracted DNA, quantify and ensure concentration meets
minimum requirements (50 ng/µL).
III. Plate Setup
• Label 384-well microplate with appropriate patient identifiers.
• Prepare master mix according to Sequenom iPLEX Gold kit
instructions.
• Aliquot master mix into the designated wells using calibrated
pipettes to ensure precision.
IV. PCR Amplification
• Perform PCR amplification as per kit instructions, ensuring all
steps are meticulously followed.
• Run PCR products on the Sequenom MassARRAY Analyzer.
V. Data Collection and Analysis
• Collect raw data from the MassARRAY Analyzer.
• Use Sequenom-provided software to analyze data and generate
genotype calls.
• Verify the validity of genotype calls using control samples and QC
procedures.
VI. Result Verification and Documentation
• Review all generated results for consistency and accuracy.
• Document results in the appropriate Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Perform additional validation steps if necessary, including
comparative analysis with past results.
VII. Troubleshooting
• If inconsistencies or errors arise, follow steps to re-examine PCR
setup, reagent preparation, and instrument calibration.
• Consult with supervisor or senior personnel for unresolved issues.
VIII. Reporting Results
• Ensure all results are accurately transcribed in LIS.
• For critical results, follow established protocols for notifying
responsible clinicians.
• Store all data securely and maintain proper documentation for
audit purposes.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control processes using known positive and
negative controls at regular intervals.
• Record all quality control results and any corrective actions taken.
• Compare analyte results from different assays to ensure
consistency.
• Maintain logs of reagent lot validations and instrument
calibrations.
1. REFERENCES
• Sequenom iPLEX Gold kit insert for detailed reagent preparation
and PCR protocols.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) guidelines for documentation
and result reporting.
• Internal quality control documents and tracker for ongoing QC
measures.
• CLIA regulations and compliance documents.
1. NOTES
Adherence to this SOP is mandatory for all personnel involved in
Sequenom testing. Any deviations or modifications to procedures
must be documented and approved by laboratory supervisors.
Regular training and competency assessments ensure continuous
compliance and proficiency.
This protocol ensures that miscellaneous Sequenom tests are
conducted efficiently, accurately, and in compliance with laboratory
standards.
