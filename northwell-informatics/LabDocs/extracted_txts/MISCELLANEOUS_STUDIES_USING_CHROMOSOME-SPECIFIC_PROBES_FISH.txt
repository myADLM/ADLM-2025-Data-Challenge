Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES USING CHROMOSOME-SPECIFIC
PROBES (FISH)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for performing
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis using
chromosome-specific probes for the detection of genetic
abnormalities.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing, analysis, and reporting of FISH results for miscellaneous
studies using chromosome-specific probes.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the FISH
assay, analyzing slides, documenting results, and reporting
findings.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the procedure,
ensuring quality control, validating results, and addressing any
issues that arise during the process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• FISH: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization, a technique used to
identify and locate specific DNA sequences on chromosomes.
• Chromosome-Specific Probes: DNA probes that bind to specific
chromosome regions to detect abnormalities.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Peripheral blood, bone marrow, or tissue
samples fixed in appropriate fixatives (e.g., Carnoy's fixative or
freshly prepared 3:1 methanol-acetic acid).
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens older than 48 hours,
improperly stored, hemolyzed, or inadequately fixed.
6. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Chromosome-specific FISH probes
• Hybridization buffer
• Fluorescence microscope
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Denaturation/hybridization system
• Dehydration solutions (ethanol series)
• Mounting medium containing DAPI
• Immersion oil for fluorescence microscopy
• Certified pipettes and tips
• Water bath at 72°C
• Laboratory timer
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparatory Steps:
1. Label slides with specimen identification.
2. Prepare cells on slides according to established cytogenetic
methods (dropping method).
B. Pretreatment of Slides:
1. Dehydrate slides in 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol for 2 minutes
each.
2. Air dry at room temperature.
C. Denaturation:
1. Apply the chromosome-specific FISH probe to the target area
on the slide (10 µL, specific volume may vary by manufacturer).
2. Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
3. Place the slide on the denaturation system at 72°C for 2
minutes to denature the DNA.
4. Immediately transfer the slide to a hybridization chamber set at
37°C to allow hybridization for 16-24 hours.
D. Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Remove coverslip carefully.
2. Wash slides in 0.4x SSC at 72°C for 2 minutes.
3. Follow with a wash in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature
for 1 minute.
4. Air dry in the dark.
E. Counterstaining:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI mounting medium to the hybridized area.
2. Cover with a new coverslip and seal edges with nail polish.
F. Microscopy Analysis:
1. Use a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate
filters for DAPI and fluorochromes.
2. Examine slides at 1000x magnification for signal enumeration.
3. Analyze 200 interphase cells or 20 metaphase cells for signals.
G. Documentation and Interpretation:
1. Document the number of signals corresponding to each probe.
2. Document any detected abnormalities or signal patterns.
3. Record observations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
H. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control slides with each batch.
2. Validate new probe lots according to established QC standards.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Weak Signals: Ensure proper denaturation, hybridization
conditions, and probe concentration.
2. Non-Specific Binding: Adjust post-hybridization wash
conditions and evaluate probe quality.
3. No Signal: Verify probe integrity, slide preparation quality, and
hybridization conditions.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into LIS.
2. Verify results by a second qualified technologist.
3. Report positive/negative findings in accordance with laboratory
guidelines.
