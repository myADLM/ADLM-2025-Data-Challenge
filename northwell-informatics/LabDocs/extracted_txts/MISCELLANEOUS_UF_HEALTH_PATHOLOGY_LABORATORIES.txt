Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Miscellaneous UF Health Pathology
Laboratories
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for miscellaneous UF Health Pathology
Laboratories. The purpose is to ensure that all tests are conducted
consistently and reliably, providing accurate and timely results for
clinical decision-making.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing
analyses, documenting results, and ensuring quality control
measures are in place.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the accuracy and
reliability of test results and addressing any issues that arise
during the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITION
Miscellaneous UF Health Pathology Laboratories refers to various
laboratory sections, including but not limited to, Clinical Chemistry,
Hematology, Microbiology, Immunology, and Anatomic Pathology.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Pre-Analytical Phase Checkup
• Verify that samples have been properly collected, labeled, and
accessioned.
• Ensure specimens are stored and handled according to laboratory
guidelines to maintain integrity.
• Review any special instructions for each test or analyte.
3.2 Analytical Phase
3.2.1 General Protocol
• Follow specific testing procedures and protocols as outlined for
the various laboratory sections.
• Record the date, time, and initials of the person performing the
test on the appropriate log or lab information system (LIS).
3.2.2 Specialized Equipment Usage
• Ensure that all laboratory instruments are operating within
calibration and maintenance standards.
• Perform any required instrument calibration or quality control
checks prior to running patient samples.
• Document any maintenance activities in the equipment logbook.
3.2.3 Quality Control
• Run quality control samples in parallel with patient tests to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
• Compare results of quality control samples with established
control limits.
• If quality control results are out of range, troubleshoot according
to the laboratory’s SOPs and do not proceed with patient testing
until resolved.
3.2.4 Analyte-Specific Procedures
• Utilize the respective SOP for each test performed, ensuring
consistent application of methods and adherence to guidelines.
• Record results accurately in the LIS in a timely manner.
• If automated systems flag results with unusual codes or errors,
investigate and resolve the issue according to the device’s
troubleshooting guide. Document all actions taken.
3.2.5 Result Verification
• Review all results to ensure they are within acceptable ranges
and free from noticeable errors.
• If results are suspected to be inaccurate, conduct necessary
repeat testing or additional verification steps.
• Report any critical results immediately to the requesting clinician
following hospital policy for critical result reporting.
• Mark results as reviewed and verified by the responsible
technologist prior to releasing results into the LIS.
3.3 Post-Analytical Phase
• Ensure all test results are corroborated within patient medical
records.
• Store physical or electronic documentation of test results in
compliance with the laboratory’s data retention policies.
• Safely dispose of used reagents and specimens in accordance
with biohazard guidelines.
• Reflect any sample issues, deviations, or corrective actions in the
case log for future reference.
3.4 Monitoring and Quality Assurance
• Conduct regular audits of random sample results to ensure
adherence to SOPs.
• Implement corrective action plans promptly if discrepancies or
recurring errors are identified.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• All temperature readings, quality control results, maintenance
logs, and testing records should be accurately documented and
kept for audit purposes.
• Maintain and regularly update calibration certificates and
equipment service records for all analytical instruments.
1. REFERENCES
• Utilize method-specific test kits and instrument manual inserts for
reference.
• Follow the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for laboratory testing procedures.
• Regularly consult UF Health Pathology Laboratories’ testing
manual for updated protocols.
1. REVISION LOG
• Keep a record of all revisions made to this SOP, including the date
of revision and a brief description of changes.
• Ensure that all laboratory staff are informed and trained on any
changes.
END OF SOP
This protocol aims to deliver high-quality, accurate, and validated
laboratory results across all miscellaneous testing performed at UF
Health Pathology Laboratories, following rigorous analytical
standards.
