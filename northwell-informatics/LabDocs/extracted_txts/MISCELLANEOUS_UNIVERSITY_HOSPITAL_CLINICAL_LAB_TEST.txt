Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
MISCELLANEOUS UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CLINICAL LAB TEST
(MUHCLT)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for conducting miscellaneous
clinical laboratory tests at Miscellaneous University Hospital Clinical
Lab and generating accurate, reliable results in compliance with CLIA
certifications and MUH standards.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists
and supervisors to perform, monitor, and document all steps of the
laboratory test process accurately and completely. Technologists are
responsible for adhering strictly to SOPs for each test and applying
corrective measures when necessary. Supervisors oversee the
overall testing process, addressing and resolving any issues that
arise and ensuring compliance with regulations.
1. DEFINITION
MUHCLT includes various assays not specified under routine tests.
These tests might include but are not limited to specific protein
assays, enzyme activities, electrolyte measurements, therapeutic
drug monitoring, and others as ordered by clinicians.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Collection and Preparation
• Ensure specimens are received and accessioned following the
specimen collection SOP.
• Verify that the specimen type and volume match the test
requirements.
• Inspect for any pre-analytical issues like incorrect labeling,
hemolysis, or improper storage conditions.
3.2 Instrument Setup and Calibration
• Prepare instruments according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform any daily calibration and QC checks as per equipment
guidelines.
• Document all completed calibration and QC on the appropriate
log sheets.
3.3 Reagent Handling
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date and stored
at proper temperatures.
• Allow any refrigerated or frozen reagents to reach room
temperature, as specified.
• Follow any specific reagent preparation steps provided by the
manufacturer.
3.4 Test Performance
• Based on the test order, set up the instrument with the correct
assay parameters.
• Label the test tubes, cups, or wells as needed.
• Add the patient specimen and required reagents to the test
system.
• Initiate the test run while ensuring to input necessary identifying
information in the instrument or record logs.
• Document the date, time, test performed, and initials in the
appropriate records.
3.5 Quality Control and Validation
• Always run QC samples with each batch of tests (if applicable).
• Compare results of QC samples to established target ranges
before validating any patient results.
• Take appropriate corrective action if QC results are outside of
acceptable limits. Document any issues and actions taken in the
QC log.
• Validate the patient results only if QC results have met specified
standards.
3.6 Result Analysis
• Review generated results for any technical errors, flags, or
deviating patterns.
• Verify results against established reference ranges.
• Consider repeating or confirming results if something seems
questionable or if the result is critical/abnormal.
• Document any anomalies and the steps taken to resolve them.
3.7 Result Reporting
• Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure timestamps and technologist initials are associated with
reported data.
• Review final reports to ensure correct patient demographic
information and test data.
• Notify appropriate healthcare providers directly for any critical or
significantly abnormal results based on lab policy.
3.8 Documentation and Record Keeping
• Keep detailed logs of equipment calibrations, reagent usage,
quality control data, and troubleshooting steps.
• Ensure completeness and accuracy of all records as they may be
subject to audit.
• Retain logs and records according to CLIA and MUH guidelines.
1. Reference Intervals and Method Limits
• Refer to specific assay guidelines and kit inserts for reference
ranges and limitations.
• Highlight and inform appropriate stakeholders of any deviations
from the reference ranges.
1. Quality Assurance and Troubleshooting
• The laboratory follows a systematic quality assurance program to
ensure consistent test performance.
• Any issues encountered during the testing phase need to be
addressed immediately, escalated to a supervisor if unresolved,
and documented fully in the troubleshooting log.
• Analyzers and reagents undergo regular maintenance and
validation in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines and
internal policies.
1. Reporting and Communication
• Communication with clinical staff is integral for patient
management and care continuity.
• Ensure timely delivery of test results to requesting units or
providers.
• Be prepared to provide clarification or additional documentation if
requested.
1. References
• Refer to equipment manuals, reagent inserts, and laboratory
guidelines for detailed information.
• Included references shall be maintained and updated accordingly
to reflect any procedural or technical changes.
This SOP will be reviewed periodically and updated as needed to
reflect new guidelines, technologies, or process improvements.
