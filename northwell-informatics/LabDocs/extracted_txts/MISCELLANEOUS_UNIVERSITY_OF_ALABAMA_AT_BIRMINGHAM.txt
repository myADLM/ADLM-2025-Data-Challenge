Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results – MISCELLANEOUS UNIVERSITY OF
ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for consistent and accurate analytical
processes resulting in reliable test results from various laboratory
tests conducted at the Miscellaneous University of Alabama at
Birmingham.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff performing analytical
testing within the Miscellaneous University of Alabama at Birmingham
laboratory. It applies to all tests and methodologies used within the
laboratory that are not explicitly covered by more specific SOPs.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
laboratory tests as per the established procedures and to ensure
the quality of the results.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
adherence to this SOP, aiding in troubleshooting when necessary,
and ensuring ongoing training and competence of staff.
3. PROCEDURES
A) General Analytical Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all necessary reagents, controls, and supplies are in
stock and within their expiration dates.
◦ Verify that the equipment to be used is operating within
acceptable limits, including checks for calibration and
maintenance as needed.
◦ Ensure all Quality Control (QC) measures are in place, with
control samples being prepared and available.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Ensure specimens are correctly labeled and meet the
criteria for acceptability based on the type of testing to be
performed.
◦ For tests requiring pre-analytical processing (e.g.,
centrifugation, aliquoting), follow standard procedures
specified.
3. Analytical Testing:
◦ Perform all tests strictly according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and in-house standard protocols.
◦ Document all procedures, including reagent lot numbers,
instrument identification, and any deviations from the
standard procedure.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Use control samples appropriate for each type of test being
conducted.
◦ Document results of control samples and take corrective
action if control results fall outside the established range.
B) Specific Equipment Procedures
1. Refrigerators and Freezers:
◦ Monitor and record temperatures twice per day.
◦ Immediate corrective action should be taken if any
temperature falls outside the acceptable range:
▪ Check and firmly close the door if ajar.
▪ Verify the position of the thermometer probe.
▪ Adjust temperature settings if necessary.
▪ Notify the supervisor if problems persist and transfer
contents to another unit if required.
2. Water Baths, Ovens, Heating Blocks, Incubators:
◦ Record temperature each time the equipment is used.
◦ Log the temperature, date, time, and initials of the individual
performing the check.
◦ Troubleshoot and notify the supervisor if temperatures fall
outside the acceptable range for the procedure.
3. Analyzers:
◦ Use internal monitoring systems and follow manufacturer’s
instructions for any alarms or out-of-range indicators.
◦ Perform QC checks as indicated and log all outcomes.
◦ Follow internal SOPs for specific analyzers on corrective
actions if QC fails.
C) Reporting Results:
• Verification:
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by a technologist
before being reported. Ensure they are consistent with QC
results.
◦ Any result that is questionable or outside expected ranges
should be rechecked or verified with a supervisor.
• Documentation:
◦ Record all pertinent information in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for traceability.
◦ For critical test results, follow protocols for immediate
communication to the requesting physician or department and
documentation of the communication.
• Sample Integrity:
◦ Check for indications of compromised sample integrity (e.g.,
hemolysis, clots) and follow protocol for documenting and
reporting such results.
D) Quality Assurance and Continuous Improvement:
1. Internal Audits:
◦ Conduct regular internal audits to ensure adherence to
SOPs and documentation requirements.
◦ Address any discrepancies or improvements identified in the
audits.
2. Training:
◦ Provide ongoing training for laboratory personnel to ensure
technical competence and awareness of updates or
changes to procedures.
3. Corrective Action:
◦ Implement corrective actions for any non-conformance
identified during routine operations, including retraining,
protocol adjustments, or process improvements.
4. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and package inserts for specific
analyzers and test kits.
• Quality control protocols as outlined in the laboratory’s quality
assurance manual.
• Internal SOPs for specific tests and equipment.
5. RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain logs for equipment temperatures, QC results, procedure
documentation, and communication of critical results. Retain
these records in compliance with relevant regulatory and
accreditation requirements.
6. REVIEW
• This SOP shall be reviewed biennially or as required due to
changes in procedures, equipment, or regulatory requirements.
By following this SOP, the Miscellaneous University of Alabama at
Birmingham Laboratory aims to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and
integrity of all analytical test results generated.
