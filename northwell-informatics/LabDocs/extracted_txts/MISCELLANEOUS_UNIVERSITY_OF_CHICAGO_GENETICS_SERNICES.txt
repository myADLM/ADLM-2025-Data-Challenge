Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for University of Chicago Genetics Services
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedures for generating,
analyzing, and reporting results for various genetic tests provided by
the University of Chicago Genetics Services. This SOP ensures
accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the analytical phase of
genetic testing.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of genetic testing at the University of Chicago Genetics
Services laboratory. This includes preparation, execution, and
documentation of all analytical procedures.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform analytical procedures, ensure
the accuracy of data, conduct quality control checks, and prepare
reports.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Verify and validate analytical results,
review quality control data, and ensure compliance with the SOP.
• Laboratory Director: Oversight of the entire analytical process,
resolution of any discrepancies, and final approval of the results.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR Thermocycler
• Next-Generation Sequencer (NGS) or Sanger Sequencer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and related consumables
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
• Reagents and master mixes specific to the genetic tests
• DNA isolation and purification kits
5. PROCEDURE
A. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Verify that all specimens received have been accessioned
properly and are accompanied by the necessary
documentation.
2. Extract DNA from the specimen using an appropriate DNA
isolation kit. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol to ensure high-
quality DNA yield.
◦ For blood samples, use the Qiagen Blood DNA Mini Kit.
◦ For saliva samples, use the Oragene DNA Kit.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Qubit fluorometer.
4. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
B. PCR AMPLIFICATION AND SEQUENCING
1. Prepare PCR reactions using specific primers targeted to the
gene(s) of interest.
2. Set up the thermocycler with the appropriate cycling conditions
for the gene(s) under study.
3. Run the PCR reactions in the thermocycler and verify
amplification success by running an aliquot on a 1-2% agarose
gel.
4. For NGS:
◦ Prepare libraries using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit.
◦ Quantify and pool libraries as per the sequencing platform’s
requirements.
◦ Load the pooled libraries onto the appropriate Illumina
sequencing platform (e.g., MiSeq, NextSeq).
5. For Sanger Sequencing:
◦ Purify PCR products using the ExoSAP-IT method.
◦ Set up sequencing reactions with BigDye Terminator v3.1
cycle sequencing kit.
◦ Run the sequencing reactions on an Applied Biosystems
Genetic Analyzer.
C. DATA ANALYSIS
1. For NGS:
◦ Use the Illumina BaseSpace platform or equivalent for initial
data processing.
◦ Align reads to the reference genome using BWA or a similar
aligner.
◦ Call variants using GATK or a similar variant caller.
◦ Annotate variants using ANNOVAR or another annotation
tool.
2. For Sanger Sequencing:
◦ Use Sequencing Analysis Software to process sequence
traces and align them to reference sequences.
◦ Examine chromatograms for any sequence variations and
confirm by manual inspection if necessary.
D. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests to
validate the process.
2. Perform repeat analysis if results do not meet the laboratory’s
quality criteria.
3. Document all quality control measures and any corrective
actions taken in the LIMS.
E. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify all analytical data and variant interpretations
with the Laboratory Supervisor.
2. Prepare a detailed report including patient information, test
methodology, results, and interpretation.
3. Submit the final report for approval by the Laboratory Director.
4. Once approved, upload the results into the LIMS and notify the
ordering clinician.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records of specimen processing, DNA extraction,
PCR setup, sequencing runs, data analysis, and quality control in
the laboratory’s LIMS.
• Ensure all records are accurate, complete, and easily retrievable
for audit purposes.
