MISCELLANEOUS UNIVERSITY OF IOWA DIAGNOSTIC
LABS
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedures required for the analytical phase of
generating results for various tests conducted at the University of
Iowa Diagnostic Labs, ensuring the accuracy, precision, and reliability
of patient results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
analytical phase for diagnostic tests within the University of Iowa
Diagnostic Labs.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this protocol
precisely. All supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
and for providing guidance and support to lab personnel.
4. DEFINITIONS
Analytical Phase: The stage in laboratory testing where actual
analysis and measurement of analytes take place, following
specimen collection and preceding result interpretation and reporting.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Analytical instruments (e.g., centrifuges, analyzers, incubators,
microscopes)
• Reagents and controls specific to the tests being performed
• Specimen containers and appropriate PPE (Personal Protective
Equipment)
• Temperature and humidity monitoring devices
• Standard operating procedures (SOP) and reference materials
6. PROCEDURE
A. Baseline Requirements
1. Preparations and Calibration:
◦ Ensure all equipment is powered on and has completed the
necessary warm-up period.
◦ Perform daily calibration using certified calibration standards
as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Document calibration activities in appropriate logs.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift
and whenever a new reagent lot is introduced.
◦ Maintain a record of all quality control activities, detailing
control lot numbers, results, and corrective actions for any
out-of-range findings.
B. General Analytical Procedures
1. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
◦ Verify patient information and ensure specimens match work
orders.
◦ Prepare specimens as required (e.g., centrifugation,
aliquoting, heating).
◦ Label all specimens correctly and ensure the integrity before
analysis.
2. Instrument Operations:
◦ Load specimens onto the appropriate analytical instruments
following the manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Ensure instruments are operating in the mode required for
specific tests.
3. Performing the Analysis:
◦ Follow specific SOPs for each test being performed (refer to
corresponding test instruction manuals).
◦ Ensure reagents and instruments meet the temperature and
pH requirements specific to each test.
◦ Monitor instruments during the analysis to detect any
discrepancies or malfunctions.
4. Recording Results:
◦ Capture all analytical data promptly.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
immediately after analysis.
◦ For results flagged by the system (e.g., potential errors, out-
of-range values), perform necessary verifications before
final reporting.
C. Post-Analysis Procedures
1. Data Review and Validation:
◦ Review all results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Validate final results using control standards and ensure
alignment with quality control measures.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Confirm the final results in the LIS for clinical interpretation.
◦ Ensure urgent or critical values are communicated promptly
to the appropriate healthcare provider as per clinical
communication protocols.
3. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store specimens as per the specific test requirements and
institutional policies (e.g., refrigeration, freezing).
◦ Ensure all specimens are properly labelled and retained for
the necessary hold time to accommodate potential re-tests
or queries.
D. Instrument and Equipment Maintenance
1. Daily Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance on all analytical equipment as
outlined by the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Document all maintenance activities and any issues
encountered in the appropriate logs.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ In case of instrument errors or malfunctions, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the equipment’s manual.
◦ Immediately notify the supervisor and document the issue
along with corrective actions taken.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons
periodically.
• Review and update SOPs annually or as needed, based on new
guidelines or instrument upgrades.
• Ensure continuous training for all lab personnel on the latest best
practices and procedural updates.

9. APPROVAL AND REVIEW
This protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Lab Director
and is subject to annual review.
Issued by: [Lab Director’s Name] Date: [Date of Implementation]
Review Cycle: Annual or as needed
Note: This protocol is intended to provide an example framework and
must be customized to match the specific conditions, equipment, and
practices of the University of Iowa Diagnostic Labs. All personnel
must be trained on this and related SOPs for effective
implementation.
