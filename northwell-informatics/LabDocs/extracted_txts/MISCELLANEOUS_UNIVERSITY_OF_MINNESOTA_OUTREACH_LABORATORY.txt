Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results at MISCELLANEOUS UNIVERSITY OF
MINNESOTA OUTREACH LABORATORY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized process for the analytical phase of
laboratory testing at Miscellaneous University of Minnesota Outreach
Laboratory, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and compliance with
regulatory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to the
procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying that staff are trained
properly and for overseeing the adherence to this protocol.
3. DEFINITION
This SOP covers the steps involved from the point of specimen
preparation for analysis to the reporting of results within the
laboratory information system (LIS).
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Laboratory-grade reagents, buffers, and control materials specific
to each test being performed.
• Appropriate consumables such as pipettes, tips, cuvettes,
reaction tubes, and glassware.
• Calibrators and traceable standard solutions certified by
appropriate regulatory bodies.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coats,
and safety glasses.
5. EQUIPMENT
• Analytical instruments including but not limited to chemistry
analyzers, immunoassay analyzers, hematology analyzers, and
any other specialized instruments based on testing requirements.
• Temperature-dependent equipment as outlined in Example SOP
1.
• Quality control and calibration monitoring equipment.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Instrument and Equipment Preparation
1. Daily Equipment Check
◦ Perform and document daily inspections and function
checks of laboratory equipment and instruments.
◦ Verify calibration status and perform necessary calibrations
as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Temperature Control
◦ Check and document the temperature of all temperature-
dependent equipment (refrigerators, freezers, incubators)
once per day as outlined in Example SOP 1.
◦ Perform necessary actions if temperature readings are
outside the acceptable range.
B) Specimen Preparation
1. Specimen Identification and Integrity
◦ Verify specimen identity against the lab request order.
◦ Inspect specimens for integrity (e.g., assess for hemolysis,
correct volume, proper labeling).
◦ Only accept specimens that meet the established criteria as
outlined in the specimen requirements section.
2. Sample Aliquots and Preparation
◦ Aliquot specimens as required using sterilized pipette tips
and ensure accurate labeling.
◦ For refrigerated or frozen specimens, ensure they have
reached appropriate handling temperature (between
20-26°C for room temperature).
C) Analytical Testing
1. Manual Urinalysis (If applicable)
◦ Follow the detailed manual urinalysis testing procedure
described in Example SOP 2.
◦ Perform microscopic examination only if specifically
indicated by the initial urinalysis results or physician request.
2. Automated and Manual Analysis
◦ Utilize validated methods and reagents to conduct tests on
specimens using respective instrumentation or manual
methods.
◦ Adhere strictly to manufacturer’s operating procedures,
quality control protocols, and reaction times.
D) Quality Control (QC)
1. Internal Quality Control
◦ Perform and document internal quality controls as per
established schedules.
◦ For any QC failures, follow corrective actions and
troubleshooting steps. Do not report patient results until QC
issues are resolved.
2. External Controls and Proficiency Testing
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs and
follow scheduled submissions.
E) Data Recording and Reporting
1. Data Collection
◦ Ensure all generated data is captured accurately in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Cross-check raw data with the predefined acceptable range
and manually verify any flags or critical results.
2. Result Review and Verification
◦ Technologists must review and verify results, addressing
flagged abnormalities.
◦ In the case of critical values, ensure they are communicated
to the relevant clinician promptly as per established
guidelines.
3. Result Reporting
◦ After verification, results are reported via the LIS to the
requestor.
◦ Maintain compliance with data privacy and security
regulations when handling and transmitting patient results.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Temperature Logs: Maintain logs for all temperature-dependent
equipment.
• Calibration Records: Document and maintain records of all
calibrations performed.
• QC Logs: Retain records of QC execution and troubleshooting
activities.
• Result Logs: Store copies of result reports and verification steps
for auditing and compliance purposes.
8. REFERENCES
• Equipment user manuals and manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards (e.g., CLSI, CAP,
CLIA).
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• Supervisory review at regular intervals, not exceeding six months.
• Approval by the laboratory director after each review or any
significant procedural change.
