Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Miscellaneous Endocrine Tests
1. PURPOSE: To ensure accurate and consistent results when
performing endocrinology tests in the Miscellaneous University of
Southern California Endocrine Laboratories.
2. SCOPE: This protocol applies to all personnel involved in
conducting endocrinological tests within the Miscellaneous University
of Southern California Endocrine Laboratories. It covers the
procedures for assay preparation, analysis, and verification of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Technologists perform the laboratory assays, follow SOPs, ensure
sample integrity, and document results.
• Supervisors verify adherence to protocols and validate results.
• Lab managers ensure compliance, maintain equipment, and
handle quality control.
4. DEFINITION: Endocrinological tests include assays for hormone
levels, enzyme activities, and receptor functions in various biological
specimens such as blood, serum, plasma, urine, and tissues.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated analyzers and assay kits, including ELISA and RIA.
• Calibrators, reagents, and standards.
• Centrifuges, water baths, incubators.
• Pipettes, sample tubes, and storage containers.
• Quality control materials.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Initial Preparations:
1. Sample Verification:
◦ Verify specimen suitability, ID, and collection timing.
◦ Ensure proper labeling and documentation.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Utilize only reagents within the expiration date and prepared
according to manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Document preparation dates, lot numbers, and expiration in
the reagent log.
B) Assay Performance:
1. Assay Setup:
◦ Follow specific assay kit instructions (e.g., incubation times
and temperatures).
◦ Include controls (negative, positive, and blank) with each
batch.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette samples, standards, and controls accurately into
designated wells or tubes.
◦ Ensure proper mixing and avoidance of air bubbles.
◦ Incubate and apply detection methods as per the specific
assay requirement.
C) Quality Control:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Run internal controls regularly (daily or per batch) to validate
assay performance.
◦ Compare internal controls with reference ranges to confirm
accuracy.
◦ Document results in the quality control log.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ Investigate and resolve issues if control results fall outside
acceptable ranges.
◦ Notify supervisor if necessary corrective actions do not
resolve the issue.
D) Result Validation:
1. Data Review:
◦ Review raw data and generated results for consistency and
accuracy.
◦ Apply necessary calculations or corrections per assay
guidelines.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Document and verify results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure proper documentation, including any discrepancies
and corrective measures.
◦ Supervisor reviews and countersigns all critical results.
E) Clean-Up and Documentation:
1. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Clean and maintain equipment as specified in equipment
manuals and SOPs.
◦ Log all maintenance activities in the equipment maintenance
log.
2. Documentation:
◦ Complete and archive all assay documentation, including
worksheets, control logs, result printouts, and electronic
records.
7. CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION:
• Regularly calibrate analyzers and equipment using reference
standards.
• Validate new batches and lots of reagents and kits against known
samples.
• Document all calibration and validation activities for traceability.
8. REFERENCE RANGES: Maintain up-to-date reference intervals
specific to each assay. Update when there are changes in population
demographics or assay methods.
9. REPORTING CRITICAL RESULTS:
• Follow established protocols for reporting critical values, including
immediate communication with responsible clinicians and proper
documentation.
• Use specific comments or codes for results that cannot be
reported due to sample quality or interference.
10. REFERENCES: Include all relevant references, such as
manufacturer guides, regulatory requirements, and internal lab
guidelines.
By following the above standard procedures, we ensure that all test
results are accurate, reliable, and timely, maintaining the highest level
of laboratory quality and compliance with regulatory standards.
