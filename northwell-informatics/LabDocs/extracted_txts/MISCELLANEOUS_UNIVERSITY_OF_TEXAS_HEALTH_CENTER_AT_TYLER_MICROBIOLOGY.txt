Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Miscellaneous Microbiology Tests
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely processing, testing, and reporting
of miscellaneous microbiology samples at Miscellaneous University
of Texas Health Center at Tyler. This protocol outlines the required
procedures and responsibilities for the analytical phase.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all microbiology staff involved in the analytical
phase of testing. It covers the procedures for handling, testing, data
recording, quality control, and reporting for all microbiological
specimens received in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All microbiology laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this SOP. Supervisors must ensure that all staff are adequately
trained and competent in these procedures.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Microbiology Specimens: Biological samples collected to
identify the presence of infectious agents, including bacteria,
fungi, parasites, and viruses.
• Analytical Phase: The phase during which the actual testing and
analysis of specimens take place to generate results.
• QC: Quality Control
5. PROCEDURE
A. Receipt and Preparation of Specimens
1. Verification:
◦ Confirm that all specimens have been correctly accessioned
and labeled.
◦ Verify that specimens meet the proper collection and
transport criteria.
2. Initial Inspection:
◦ Check specimens for any signs of leakage, contamination,
or improper storage conditions.
◦ Reject and document any unacceptable specimens
according to established protocols.
B. Testing Protocol
1. Appropriate Test Selection:
◦ Select appropriate tests based on specimen type and
clinical information provided.
◦ Consult the test menu and current guidelines for test
selection.
2. Test Setup:
◦ Follow the specific procedures for setting up each
microbiological test according to the test manual.
◦ Prepare all necessary media, reagents, controls, and
equipment.
3. Incubation:
◦ Inoculate specimens onto prepared media as per the test
protocol.
◦ Incubate under required conditions (e.g., temperature,
duration, atmosphere) as per the standard guidelines.
◦ Label all incubated materials with patient ID, date, and time.
C. Identification and Analysis
1. Observation and Preliminary Analysis:
◦ After incubation, examine cultures for microbial growth.
◦ Perform preliminary identification tests (e.g., Gram staining,
catalase, oxidase test) based on growth characteristics.
2. Definitive Identification:
◦ Utilize appropriate biochemical, immunological, or molecular
techniques for definitive identification of organisms.
◦ Document all tests and results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
D. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST)
1. Selection of Antibiotics:
◦ Choose antibiotics based on clinical relevance and
established guidelines.
2. Testing Protocol:
◦ Perform AST using disk diffusion, broth dilution, or
automated systems.
◦ Follow the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute) guidelines for interpretation of results.
3. Reporting:
◦ Document and review susceptibility patterns. Report
clinically significant results promptly.
E. Quality Control and Quality Assurance
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Perform QC for each test run using control strains and
reagents.
◦ Document and analyze QC results daily. Address any
deviations from expected results immediately.
2. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs as
mandated.
3. Instrument Calibration and Maintenance:
◦ Ensure all laboratory instruments are regularly calibrated
and maintained as per manufacturer instructions.
F. Data Recording and Verification
1. Recording Results:
◦ Enter all test results into the LIS ensuring accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Annotate any abnormal or critical results and take
necessary steps for verification.
2. Result Verification:
◦ Have another qualified technologist or supervisor verify
results before releasing them.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of verification steps in the
LIS.
G. Reporting Results
1. Result Reporting:
◦ Review and release verified results to the requesting
physician or clinical team via LIS.
◦ Document any follow-up actions taken for critical results.
2. Confidentiality:
◦ Ensure all reported results maintain patient confidentiality
and comply with HIPAA regulations.
H. Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution
1. Troubleshooting:
◦ Follow established protocols for troubleshooting any issues
encountered during testing.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all troubleshooting steps and resolutions in the
logbook.
3. Supervisor Notification:
◦ Inform supervisors of any significant issues or recurring
problems.
