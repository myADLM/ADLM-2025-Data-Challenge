Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results in the Clinical Immunology Laboratory at
Miscellaneous University of Washington Medical Center
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the proper process for analytical testing and the generation
of accurate results in the Clinical Immunology Laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of
testing within the Clinical Immunology Laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and supervisors are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure reliable and accurate results.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparing for Analysis
• Confirm that the specimen has been properly collected, received,
and accessioned.
• Review the test requisition form to ensure all necessary tests are
documented clearly.
• Check all equipment and reagents for functionality and ensure
they are within expiration dates.
• Ensure documentation of instrument calibration and quality
control has been performed.
4.2 Equipment Calibration and Maintenance
• Daily: Ensure that all instruments used in the testing process are
turned on and allowed to warm up as required.
• Weekly: Perform and document routine maintenance checks as
per manufacturer instructions.
• Monthly: Review the performance logs of all equipment to
observe any trends or recurrent issues that could impact reliability.
4.3 Quality Control
• Run appropriate quality control samples before patient specimen
analyses.
• Record the QC data and verify results against established
acceptance criteria:
◦ Establish target values and acceptable ranges for the QC
materials.
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, perform
troubleshooting procedures as outlined in the equipment
manual, re-run QC samples, and document corrective actions.
• Retain QC records for verifying test results.
4.4 Conducting Tests
• Perform each test as per the specific method outlined in individual
test SOPs:
◦ Follow standardized procedures for each assay as per the
respective package inserts and laboratory manual.
◦ Document all steps taken during the assay to ensure
traceability.
◦ If manual procedures are required as backup, refer to the
manual testing protocols.
4.5 Automated Analysis
• Load patient samples onto the analyzer ensuring minimal
handling and contamination risk.
• Verify initialization status and readiness of the analyzer.
• Document the instrument ID and system verification before
starting analysis.
4.6 Manual Analysis
• Ensure you have all the required reagents and supplies pre-
arranged in the designated work area.
• Follow the steps accurately as outlined in the manual procedure
ensuring each step is logged with accurate time-stamping and
initials of the operator.
4.7 Post-Analysis Review
• Verify that the results from the tests fall within expected clinical
ranges and are consistent with the QC results.
• For any results outside of reference ranges, ensure the results
are rechecked and verified for accuracy.
• Follow the specific critical results policy for handling and
communicating critical results.
4.8 Reporting Results
• Ensure all results are entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) accurately and verified by technologists.
• Cross-reference results against manual logs and QC results to
ensure no transcription errors have occurred.
• In case auto-transmitted results show discrepancies, manually
verify results before validation.
4.9 Documentation and Record-Keeping
• Maintain detailed records of:
◦ All QC results.
◦ Calibration and maintenance logs.
◦ Patient test raw data and finalized reports.
• Ensure records are stored securely for a minimum of five years.
5. REFERENCES
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) Manual.
• Equipment Operation and Service Manuals.
• Test Kit Package Inserts.
• QC Material Data Sheets.
6. DEFINITIONS
• QC (Quality Control): Processes used to monitor and maintain
quality in laboratory results.
