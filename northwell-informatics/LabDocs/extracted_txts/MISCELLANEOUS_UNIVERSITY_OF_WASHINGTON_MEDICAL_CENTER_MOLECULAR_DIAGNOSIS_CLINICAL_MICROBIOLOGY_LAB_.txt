Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results in the Molecular Diagnosis Clinical
Microbiology Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures to be
followed in the Molecular Diagnosis Clinical Microbiology Laboratory
at the University of Washington Medical Center for the analytical
phase in generating laboratory results from collected specimens.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to the
procedures and protocols outlined in this SOP during the analytical
phase of test processing. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure
the integrity and accuracy of test results by reporting any deviations
from the standard procedures to their supervisor.
2. DEFINITIONS
Molecular Diagnosis: A technique used to diagnose and monitor
diseases, detect risk, and decide which therapies will work best for
individual patients by analyzing genetic and molecular data.
Analytical Phase: The stage of testing in the laboratory where the
specimen is processed and analyzed to generate results.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Instrument Set-Up
1. Ensure all equipment and instruments are calibrated and
functioning correctly before beginning the analysis.
2. Document the equipment status in the logbook, noting the date,
time, and initials of the staff member verifying the equipment.
3. Verify that the room temperature (20-26°C) and relative
humidity (15-85%) are within acceptable limits.
4. Perform any necessary maintenance or calibration of
equipment according to manufacturers' guidelines.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Retrieve the accessioned specimens from the designated
storage areas.
2. Verify specimen identity and integrity, ensuring that they meet
the required conditions for analysis (e.g., proper labeling,
appropriate storage conditions).
3. If specimen conditions are not met, document the issue and
notify the supervisor.
4. Prepare reagents and supplies needed for analysis, following
the protocols specified by the manufacturer and laboratory
guidelines.
C. Molecular Analysis
1. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
◦ Perform nucleic acid extraction according to the
standardized method in the laboratory's protocol.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during
extraction in the logbook.
◦ Validate the quality and quantity of extracted nucleic acids
using quantification and purity assessment techniques.
2. PCR Preparation:
◦ Set up the PCR reactions, including controls, following the
guidelines specified in the laboratory's protocol.
◦ Ensure accurate pipetting and contamination control
practices are followed.
◦ Program the thermal cycler according to the established
PCR parameters.
3. Post-PCR Analysis:
◦ Analyze PCR products using gel electrophoresis, real-time
PCR, or other relevant techniques.
◦ Document the results and any observations related to the
analysis.
◦ Validate and interpret findings according to laboratory
guidelines.
D. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch to ensure
the accuracy of the results.
2. Document control results and any corrective actions taken if
controls fall outside acceptable ranges.
3. Verify instrument calibration with traceable standards and
record results.
E. Result Interpretation
1. Review and interpret the raw data from the molecular assays.
2. Cross-reference findings with clinical information and quality
control data.
3. Document the interpreted results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
F. Reporting
1. Ensure all results are properly reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
2. Report critical values immediately to the healthcare provider
following the established laboratory guidelines.
3. Record final results in the LIS and ensure proper
documentation according to laboratory SOPs.
