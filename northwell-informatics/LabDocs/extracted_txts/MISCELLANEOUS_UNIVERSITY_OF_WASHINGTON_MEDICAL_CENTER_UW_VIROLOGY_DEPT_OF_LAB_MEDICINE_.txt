SOP for Analytical Phase: Result Generation in Miscellaneous
University of Washington Medical Center (UW Virology Dept of Lab
Medicine)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase in generating
accurate, reliable, and timely results for virology diagnostic tests
performed at the University of Washington Medical Center's Virology
Department of Lab Medicine.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for conducting tests, analyzing data,
and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of results according to this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring adherence to quality standards.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Receiving Specimens and Preparing for Analysis
1. Verify that specimens received have been correctly
accessioned.
2. Ensure all specimens are correctly labeled with appropriate
patient information, date/time of collection, and specimen type.
3. Review requisition forms to ensure they match the specimen
information.
B. Calibration and Maintenance of Equipment
1. Calibrate analytical instruments daily or according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Document calibration results in the equipment maintenance log.
3. Perform routine maintenance checks on all equipment as per
the manufacturer's guidelines and document any issues or
corrective actions taken.
C. Test Procedures
General Guidelines:
1. Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for each specific test kit or
analytical instrument.
2. Ensure all reagents and test kits are within their expiry date and
stored according to manufacturer’s specifications.
3. Wear appropriate PPE and follow biosafety guidelines.
4. PCR Testing: a. Prepare the PCR workstation with necessary
reagents and disposables. b. Extract nucleic acids from
specimens using the designated extraction method. c. Set up
PCR reactions according to the assay protocol. d. Program the
thermal cycler as specified in the assay instructions. e. Analyze
PCR results using designated software; confirm positive results
and investigate discrepancies.
5. ELISA Testing: a. Prepare the ELISA plate and reagents
according to the kit instructions. b. Add specimen or control to
designated wells. c. Incubate, wash, and develop the plate
according to the assay protocol. d. Read the plate using the
ELISA reader. e. Analyze and interpret results based on the
optical density readings.
6. Virus Isolation: a. Inoculate specimen into appropriate cell
culture medium under sterile conditions. b. Incubate cultures
and monitor for cytopathic effects. c. Identify and confirm viral
presence through immunofluorescence or other confirmation
methods.
D. Quality Control
1. Run internal quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Include positive and negative controls, as applicable.
3. Review quality control results to ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before releasing patient results.
4. Document quality control outcomes and any actions taken if
controls fall outside acceptable limits.
E. Result Verification and Reporting
1. Review raw data from instruments for accuracy and
completeness.
2. Compare results with established reference ranges and
validation criteria.
3. Investigate any abnormal or out-of-range results and repeat
testing if necessary.
4. Validate results by ensuring all quality control data are within
acceptable limits.
5. Enter results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
6. Review and verify results to ensure consistency and accuracy.
7. Release verified results and provide relevant comments on any
limitations or considerations.
F. Critical Values and Reporting
1. Identify and promptly report any critical values as designated by
department guidelines.
2. Communicate critical results to the relevant healthcare provider
immediately.
3. Document the communication and actions taken in the patient’s
record.
G. Record Keeping
1. Maintain thorough documentation of all testing procedures,
calibration data, quality control results, and corrective actions
taken.
2. Archive patient testing records securely for the period
mandated by regulatory bodies.
H. Continuous Improvement
1. Conduct periodic reviews of analytical procedures to identify
areas for improvement.
2. Participate in proficiency testing and external quality
assessment programs.
3. Update SOPs based on new evidence, technology
advancements, and regulatory changes.
