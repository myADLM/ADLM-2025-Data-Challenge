Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
MISCELLANEOUS UNIV OF AL-METABOLIC DISEASE LAB
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results in the Miscellaneous University of Al-Metabolic
Disease Laboratory. This includes guidelines for sample handling,
analysis, quality control, and documentation to ensure accurate and
reliable test results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff performing laboratory analyses within the
Metabolic Disease Laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated staff are responsible for following this SOP to ensure
accurate, consistent, and reliable analytical results. It is the
responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that procedures are
followed correctly and to address any deficiencies.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Sample: Biological material submitted for analysis.
• QC: Quality control to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
results.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Handling
• Verify the sample identity and integrity. Ensure that samples are
properly labeled with the patient’s information and collection date/
time.
• If the sample is not processed promptly, store it according to the
specific temperature requirements. Bring refrigerated or frozen
samples to room temperature before analysis.
• Unacceptable samples (e.g., improperly labeled, hemolysis,
outside collection time) should be documented and the physician
should be notified of the rejection.
5.2 Equipment and Reagents
• Ensure all equipment is maintained and calibrated as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Use only reagents that are within their expiry date. Store reagents
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, and avoid
contamination.
5.3 Analytical Procedure
• Follow the specific instructions for each test as per the validated
standard methodology.
• Use appropriate controls for each batch of tests to validate the
results.
• For manual testing:
1. Prepare all reagents and calibrators.
2. Set up the equipment as per the test requirements.
3. Perform the test according to the standardized method.
4. Record results immediately after analysis, ensuring
accuracy and thorough documentation.
• For automated testing:
1. Ensure instruments are properly calibrated.
2. Load samples and controls into the instrument.
3. Initiate the test run according to the instrument instructions.
4. Document any alarms or instrument errors.
5.4 Quality Control
• Perform quality control checks as specified for each test.
• Use two levels of control materials when applicable and run
controls at the start and end of each batch.
• Document QC results and assess for any outliers or trends that
indicate a problem with the assay or instrument.
• Address any issues by following the troubleshooting guidelines,
notifying the supervisor, and repeating the QC checks if
necessary.
5.5 Reporting Results
• Review results for consistency and accuracy before reporting.
• Ensure all QC checks are within acceptable limits before
validating results.
• Verify and enter results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• For critical results:
1. Double-check the result.
2. Immediately notify the requesting physician.
3. Document the communication of critical results.
5.6 Documentation
• Use appropriate logbooks, forms, and electronic systems to
document all procedural steps, from sample reception to result
reporting.
• Ensure records are legible, accurate, and contemporaneously
maintained.
• Maintain records of maintenance, calibrations, and QC.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to specific troubleshooting guides provided in the
instrument/user manuals.
• Consult the supervisor for complex issues or if the troubleshooting
steps do not resolve the problem.
1. REFERENCE LIMITS AND RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Use laboratory-defined reference ranges to interpret the metabolic
test results.
• Document interpretation along with results summary
appropriately, noting any significant deviations from the reference
ranges.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for reagents and instruments.
• Laboratory-specific manuals and guidelines.
• Relevant clinical literature.
By following this SOP, staff can ensure the generation of accurate,
reliable, and timely results in the Metabolic Disease Laboratory.
