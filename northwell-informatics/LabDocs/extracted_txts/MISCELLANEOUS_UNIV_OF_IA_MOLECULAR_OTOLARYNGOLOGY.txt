Approved by: [Insert Name]
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the standardized procedure for generating
results for Molecular Otolaryngology tests, ensuring the accuracy,
reliability, and confidentiality of patient results. This SOP applies to
the Molecular Otolaryngology Lab at the University of Iowa.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel performing Molecular
Otolaryngology tests are responsible for following this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and providing the necessary training and resources.
1. DEFINITIONS
PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid RNA:
Ribonucleic Acid
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens can include tissue biopsies, swabs, and body fluids (e.g.
blood, saliva). They must be collected, labeled, documented, and
transported in compliance with pre-analytical phase SOPs.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Thermal Cycler
• Real-time PCR machine
• Gel Electrophoresis apparatus
• Pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR Master Mix and reagents
• DNA/RNA extraction kits
• Sterile tubes and vials
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA/RNA Extraction
1. Follow standard DNA/RNA extraction protocols suitable for the
type of specimen.
2. Verify the integrity and quantity of extracted nucleic acids.
B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
1. Prepare PCR master mix as per the validated protocol including
primers, nucleotides, buffer, polymerase, and template DNA/
RNA.
2. Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Load DNA/RNA samples into appropriate wells.
4. Set the thermal cycler with the required cycling parameters.
5. Initiate PCR and document cycles, reagents, and technician
name.
C. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable)
1. Prepare agarose gel and appropriate running buffer.
2. Load PCR product onto the gel alongside a suitable DNA
ladder.
3. Run the gel at recommended voltage until bands are clearly
visualized.
4. Stain the gel using a DNA stain and visualize under UV light.
D. Real-time PCR (if applicable)
1. Set up the Real-time PCR reaction in accordance with protocol,
including controls and a standard curve.
2. Load the plate into the real-time PCR machine and start the run
following manufacturer instructions.
3. Post-run, analyze amplification plots and evaluate the cycle
threshold (Ct) values.
E. Data Analysis
1. Interpret PCR results based on the presence or absence of
target bands (gel electrophoresis) or Ct values (real-time PCR).
2. Compare test results to positive and negative controls.
3. Employ software or manual calculation for quantitative
assessments.
F. Quality Control
1. Perform and document quality control checks for each run
including positive, negative, and no-template controls.
2. Verify results with duplicate analysis where required.
3. Address any QC failures by repeating the assay or
troubleshooting potential sources of error.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Document all findings clearly in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
6. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
7. Provide additional comments or recommendations if necessary.
8. Send finalized results to the requesting clinician ensuring
confidentiality.
9. REFERENCES
Applicable testing and equipment manuals, vendor guides, and
laboratory-specific protocols should be referenced for detailed
information (e.g., PCR master mix preparation, real-time PCR
operations).
1. REMARKS
Continue improving laboratory outcomes by keeping up with
advancements in molecular otolaryngology techniques and
integrating new validated protocols into the laboratory practice.
