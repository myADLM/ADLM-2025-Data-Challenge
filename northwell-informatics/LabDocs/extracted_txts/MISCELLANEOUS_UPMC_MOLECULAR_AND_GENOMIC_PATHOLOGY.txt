Miscellaneous UPMC Molecular and Genomic Pathology SOP
1. PURPOSE
The protocol outlines the standard procedures for analyzing and
generating results for various molecular and genomic pathology
assays within the UPMC laboratory. This covers routine workflows to
ensure consistency, quality, and accuracy of the results.
RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and designated staff are responsible for
carrying out the procedures as outlined, recording data, and ensuring
that all steps are performed correctly. It is also their responsibility to
report any anomalies or issues encountered during the process to the
supervising staff.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Molecular Pathology: Analysis of biologic markers in the genome
and proteome to diagnose and monitor disease.
• Genomic Pathology: Study and analysis involving whole or large-
scale genomic information to diagnose and treat diseases.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction.
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Pre-analytical Processing
• Confirm specimen identification with requisition forms.
• Verify acceptance criteria: Fresh, properly labeled, and not
exceeding designated time points.
• Prepare samples as required (e.g., DNA/RNA extraction).
• Quality control: Ensure nucleic acid concentration and purity meet
required standards.
• Store prepared samples at appropriate conditions until analysis.
B. PCR Protocol
Materials and Reagents:
• PCR master mix
• Primers specific to target
• Template DNA/RNA
• RNase/DNase-free water
• Positive and negative controls
Steps:
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix according to the protocol.
2. Add template DNA/RNA to the mixture.
3. Load samples into the PCR machine.
4. Run PCR cycles per the specified thermocycler conditions.
5. Visualize PCR products on agarose gel electrophoresis or other
detection systems.
6. Analyze results based on control measurements.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Protocol
Materials and Reagents:
• NGS library preparation kits
• Index adapters
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Bioanalyzer or other quality control apparatus
Steps:
1. Perform library preparation, including fragmentation, end repair,
and adapter ligation following kit instructions.
2. Amplify libraries with PCR and perform quality control using a
Bioanalyzer.
3. Quantify libraries to ensure adequate concentration for
sequencing.
4. Pool libraries at appropriate ratios.
5. Load prepared libraries onto the NGS machine.
6. Monitor sequencing run and quality metrics.
7. Analyze sequencing data using bioinformatics pipelines.
8. Assess data quality and coverage, ensuring that samples meet
quality thresholds.
D. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Analyzing Data:
◦ Utilize appropriate bioinformatics tools to process and
analyze data.
◦ Confirm variant calling, gene fusion identification, or other
relevant metrics.
2. Reporting:
◦ Review and confirm test results against controls and
standards.
◦ Interpretions should also consider clinical information and
relevant literature.
◦ Generate comprehensive reports including findings,
interpretations, and recommended next steps.
3. Data Validation:
◦ Cross-verify results by an independent technologist/
pathologist to rule out errors.
◦ Document review and validation of findings in the LIS.
E. Quality Control
• Run and review positive and negative controls with each batch of
assays.
• Document all completed QC checks and any corrective actions
taken.
• Conduct inter-laboratory comparisons periodically to ensure
consistency.
F. Equipment Maintenance and Calibration
• Regularly maintain, clean, and calibrate equipment as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities and any detected deviations
or errors.
• Validate equipment after servicing before usage.
G. Troubleshooting
• If anomalies in QC or test results are encountered, conduct root
cause analyses:
◦ Check reagents and equipment status.
◦ Review procedural steps.
◦ Consult with supervising staff if issues persist.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and resolutions.
H. Documentation and Record Keeping
• Record all relevant data and steps taken in the LIS or designated
logbooks: temperature logs, assay results, maintenance records.
• Maintain backup copies of digital data and store physical records
as required by regulations.
4. REFERENCES
Include manufacturer guides, scientific literature, and national or
international standards (e.g., CAP, CLIA, FDA guidelines).
This protocol ensures that all molecular and genomic pathology
assays are performed with integrity, leading to reliable and accurate
patient results within the UPMC Molecular and Genomic Pathology
Laboratory.
