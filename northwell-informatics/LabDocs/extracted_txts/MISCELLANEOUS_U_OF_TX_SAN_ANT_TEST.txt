1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the generation
of results for the U of TX SAN ANT (Miscellaneous Test) to ensure
accuracy, integrity, and completion of the laboratory analysis in
accordance with the guidelines and requirements of the CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out this
procedure and ensuring all steps are correctly followed. Supervisors
are tasked with ensuring compliance, addressing any issues that
arise during testing, and confirming that the results are suitably
documented and reviewed before reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred:
• 2-5 mL of venous blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
or lithium heparinized tube (PST).
• Specimens should be delivered to the lab within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens received more than 2 hours after collection without
prior arrangement or freezing.
• Specimens with insufficient volume for testing or improper
labeling.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Analytical balance (if applicable)
• Specimen tubes: SST or PST
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Appropriate assay reagents and controls according to test
manufacturer’s guidelines
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the blood specimens at 2000-3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the serum/plasma from the cells.
◦ Ensure the centrifuge is balanced and set according to lab
guidelines.
2. Serum/Plasma Transfer:
◦ Transfer the separated serum/plasma into a clean,
appropriately labeled secondary tube using pipettes. Avoid
transferring the cell layer.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare assay reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Ensure all reagents are within their expiry date
and stored as recommended.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform necessary calibrations on the analytical instruments
using calibration standards provided by the assay kit
manufacturer.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the analyzer as
per the instrument’s operating instructions.
◦ Ensure proper identification of samples and controls in the
LIS.
◦ Start the analysis run as per the assay protocol specified by
the manufacturer.
4. Control Testing:
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each
run to ensure the assay’s accuracy and precision.
◦ Verify that control results fall within the established range
before continuing with sample analysis.
5. Result Verification:
◦ Review the instrument output for each sample. Verify that
results meet expected quality control parameters.
◦ Investigate and resolve any flagged or out-of-range results
per laboratory protocol before finalizing the results.
6. Troubleshooting:
◦ If the assay fails or results are questionable, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the assay's manufacturer
guideline.
◦ Document any deviations or issues and the steps taken to
resolve them.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Review results for accuracy and correlation with controls
before releasing.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Notify the requesting physician immediately of any critical
values as per the lab’s critical value policy.
◦ Document the notification in the patient's record.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Quality Control Testing:
◦ Perform quality control testing at established intervals.
Record and review results.
2. Record Keeping:
◦ Maintain all records including sample and control run
details, calibration data, and troubleshooting logs.
3. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
validate the assay’s accuracy and reliability.
