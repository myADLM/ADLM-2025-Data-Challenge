Protocol: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for
MISCELLANEOUS VARIANTYX, INC.
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for MISCELLANEOUS
VARIANTYX, INC. This protocol ensures that the analytical tasks are
performed consistently and accurately to provide reliable and valid
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures and documenting all required steps as defined
in this protocol. It is the responsibility of the staff to report any
discrepancies or issues encountered during the analytical phase to
their immediate supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
MISCELLANEOUS VARIANTYX, INC.: A set of molecular procedures
designed to detect and analyze genetic variants using proprietary
technology.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Sequencing instruments calibrated and validated for use
• Proprietary VARIANTYX PCR reagents and kits
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR thermocyclers
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure DNA has been extracted and quantified from the
received specimen as per standard laboratory procedure.
2. Store DNA samples at -20°C or below until ready for analysis.
PCR Amplification:
1. Thaw all reagents, including DNA samples, on ice before use.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the VARIANTYX protocol,
ensuring to include the appropriate positive and negative
controls.
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes and add the DNA
samples, making sure to change tips between each sample to
avoid cross-contamination.
4. Load the PCR plates/tubes into the PCR thermocycler and run
the program as specified by the VARIANTYX protocol.
Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Prepare agarose gel for electrophoresis according to standard
laboratory procedures.
2. Load PCR products and controls into the gel wells and run
electrophoresis as per established protocol.
3. Visualize the gel under UV light and document the results.
Compare bands of samples against control to ensure
amplification is as expected.
Sequencing:
1. Prepare sequencing reactions using cleaned PCR products as
per VARIANTYX sequencing protocol.
2. Load sequencing plates into the sequencing instrument.
3. Run the sequencing program as defined by the VARIANTYX
procedure.
4. Upon completion, verify the quality and integrity of the
sequencing runs.
Data Analysis:
1. Transfer sequencing data to the analysis software.
2. Perform variant calling and annotation using VARIANTYX
proprietary software, ensuring all quality metrics are met.
3. Verify that all controls meet acceptance criteria before
validating sample results.
4. Review the generated variant report for each sample and
ensure that all detected variants are properly annotated with
clinical significance.
Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Perform quality control checks using positive and negative
controls. Maintain QC records diligently.
2. If controls fail, do not proceed with results analysis for patient
samples. Repeat the procedure and/or troubleshoot per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
3. Document any deviation, troubleshooting measures, and
corrective actions taken.
Reporting Results:
1. Compile validated variant reports for each sample.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and verify results before releasing them to the ordering
physician.
4. Ensure accurate recording and reporting according to the
compliant laboratory standards.
5. DOCUMENTATION:
All steps of the procedure, including reagent lot numbers, sample
IDs, control results, sequencing run IDs, and any deviations or
troubleshooting measures, must be documented in appropriate
laboratory logs or electronic records.
