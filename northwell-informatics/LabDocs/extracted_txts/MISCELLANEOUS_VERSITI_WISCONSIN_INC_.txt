Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results – Miscellaneous Tests
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed, step-by-step
procedure for generating accurate and reliable analytical phase
results for miscellaneous tests performed at Versiti Wisconsin, Inc.
This SOP ensures consistency and compliance with regulatory
standards by defining procedures for specimen handling, equipment
usage, quality control, analysis, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
tests according to this procedure.
• All personnel are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of test results, and for identifying and addressing any
deviations from standard procedures.
2. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Preferred Specimen Types:
• Various according to test (e.g., serum, plasma, whole blood, urine,
CSF).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that do not meet the specific requirements for the test
being performed (e.g., hemolyzed samples for certain tests).
• Specimens with incorrect or incomplete labeling.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Reference to specific instrumentation and reagents used for each
miscellaneous test.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and within validation
parameters.
• Use supplies such as pipettes, cuvettes, test tubes, and control
materials as per the test-specific requirements.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure patient specimens are properly accessioned, labeled, and
logged.
• Handle all specimens using standard biosafety precautions.
• Prepare specimens according to test-specific requirements (e.g.,
centrifugation, aliquotting).
B. Instrument Preparation:
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance checks on
relevant analytical instrumentation.
• Ensure that quality control materials specific to the test are run
according to the instrument manufacturer’s guidelines and in-
house validation procedures.
• Document preventive maintenance, calibrations, and any issues
in the instrument's log.
C. Test Procedure:
• Follow the test-specific procedure as described in the instrument
manual or test kit insert.
• Load specimens, controls, and necessary reagents onto the
instrument.
• Ensure proper temperature, timing, and other test conditions are
maintained.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls and calibrators specific to each miscellaneous test.
• Compare control results to acceptable ranges before releasing
patient results.
• Document any out-of-range control results and take corrective
action as per quality assurance protocols.
• Perform periodic cross-verification of results with an alternate
method or instrument, when applicable.
6. RESULT GENERATION
• Analyze specimens according to established protocols for each
test.
• Review raw data and ensure all controls are within acceptable
limits before validating results.
• Validate and verify results through Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring accuracy.
• Document any anomalies or issues noted during data review and
interpretation.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in accordance with predefined reference intervals
and specific reporting guidelines.
• For critical results, follow the immediate reporting policy to the
designated healthcare provider and document the notification.
• Use predefined templates for routine reports ensuring consistent
and clear communication of results.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to specific test kit inserts or equipment manuals for
limitations of each miscellaneous test.
• Document any interferences or limitations encountered during
testing and include in the patient report when necessary.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow instrument or kit-specific troubleshooting guidelines for any
errors or issues encountered.
• Record all troubleshooting steps taken and outcomes in the
instrument log and/or the Quality Assurance log.
• Notify the supervisor or designated technical personnel for
unresolved issues.
10. REFERENCES
• Include relevant references such as instrument manuals, test kit
inserts, and regulatory guidelines that were referred to in
developing this SOP.
