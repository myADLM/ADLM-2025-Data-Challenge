Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results at MISC Center for Human Genetics
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed, standardized
procedures for the analytical phase required to generate accurate
and reproducible genetic test results at the MISC Center for Human
Genetics. This phase involves DNA extraction, quantification,
amplification, sequencing, and data analysis to identify genetic
variations.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of genetic specimens at MISC Center for Human Genetics.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory staff conducting genetic analyses should follow this
SOP. Personnel must be trained and competent in the specific tasks
they perform and ensure compliance with quality control measures
and regulatory standards.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA Extraction Kits
• NanoDrop Spectrophotometer or Qubit Fluorometer
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA Sequencers (e.g., Illumina, ABI)
• Reagents for PCR and Sequencing (primers, dNTPs, enzymes,
buffers)
• LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System)
• Computer with bioinformatics software
• Pipettes and consumables (tips, tubes, plates)
5. PROCEDURE
a. DNA Extraction
i. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the DNA extraction kit being
used.
ii. Record the extraction date, sample ID, and operator initials in the
LIMS.
iii. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until needed for further processing.
b. DNA Quantification
i. Measure the concentration and purity of extracted DNA using
NanoDrop or Qubit, as specified in the specific assay requirements.
ii. Document the DNA concentration, A260/A280 (if using NanoDrop),
and any dilutions prepared in the LIMS.
c. PCR Amplification
i. Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the assay-specific
protocol, ensuring all reagents are properly thawed and mixed.
ii. Aliquot the reaction mix into PCR tubes or plates, and add the
sample DNA.
iii. Use a PCR thermocycler and select the appropriate program for
the analysis being conducted.
iv. Record PCR conditions, including cycling times and temperatures,
in the LIMS.
d. Sequencing
i. Prepare sequencing libraries from PCR products or genomic DNA
following the protocol for the specific sequencer being used.
ii. Quantify and normalize libraries to ensure appropriate loading onto
the sequencer.
iii. Load the prepared libraries into the sequencer according to the
manufacturer's instructions. iv. Document sequencing run parameters
and sample IDs in the LIMS.
e. Data Analysis
i. Once sequencing is complete, use bioinformatics tools to analyze
raw data, including quality control, alignment, variant calling, and
annotation. ii. Validate significant findings by a secondary analysis
method if required. iii. Upload the analysis results to the LIMS and
ensure that all findings are reviewed by a qualified geneticist.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
i. Perform routine maintenance and calibration on all instruments as
recommended by the manufacturers. ii. Include negative and positive
controls in each batch of DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing. iii.
Document all quality control measures in the LIMS and take
corrective actions for any deviations from expected results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
i. Review and verify all analytical results before reporting. ii. Compile
a final report with genetic findings, including relevant clinical
interpretations. iii. Ensure results are communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider securely and confidentially.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Define reference ranges for validated genetic variants and document
them in associated laboratory procedure guides.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Maintain records of all procedures, instrumentation, quality control
measures, and results in the LIMS for a minimum of 10 years, as per
regulatory requirements.
