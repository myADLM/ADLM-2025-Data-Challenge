Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
MISC - Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center
1. Purpose
To provide a systematic protocol for generating accurate and reliable
results for Miscellaneous (MISC) tests ordered by Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center. This procedure outlines the steps
for processing the specimens, preparing and performing the
analytical assays, and documenting and reporting the results.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimens accepted for MISC tests must adhere to the specific
collection and storage criteria defined for each test. Specific
requirements for acceptable specimens, their storage, and transport
conditions are outlined below:
• Specimen type: Based on test order (e.g., blood, urine, CSF, etc.).
• Collection Container: Appropriate containers based on the
specified test.
• Storage: As per test specifications (e.g., refrigeration at 2-8°C,
room temperature).
• Transport: Specimens must be delivered to the lab as per defined
timelines to maintain stability.
3. Procedure
3.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Verification: Verify the specimen details against the requisition
form. Ensure that the specimen meets acceptance criteria (e.g.,
correct container, collection time).
2. Labeling: Clearly label each specimen with a unique identifier,
including patient details, date and time of collection, and test
ordered.
3. Pre-Analytical Processing: If required, process the specimen
according to specific test guidelines (e.g., centrifugation,
aliquoting). Follow the instructions provided in the specific test
SOP for details.
3.2 Analytical Procedure
A. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare reagents as specified by the manufacturer or as
outlined in the specific test SOP.
2. Ensure that reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored appropriately.
3. Document preparation details.
B. Equipment Setup
1. Set up equipment necessary for the test as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure that equipment has been calibrated and is in proper
working condition.
3. Run quality control checks to verify equipment performance.
C. Performing the Assay
1. Follow the detailed steps provided in the specific test SOP for
performing the assay.
2. Carefully measure and add reagents, ensuring proper mixing
and reaction times.
3. Monitor instrument outputs.
D. Documentation of Results
1. Record the results generated by the assays in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Annotate any observations or deviations from expected results.
3. Ensure accuracy by reviewing results, checking for errors, and
validating against control runs.
3.3 Quality Control
1. Perform quality control evaluations as defined for each test
(e.g., daily, weekly, monthly checks with control materials).
2. Document all quality control measures and outcomes.
3. Address any deviations from acceptable quality control ranges,
including troubleshooting and corrective actions.
4. Reporting Results
A. Verification
1. Review and verify test results.
2. Confirm that all results fall within acceptable ranges or note
exceptions.
B. Documentation
1. Document results in the LIS, ensuring accurate and complete
recording.
2. Annotate any issues encountered during testing that may affect
result interpretation.
C. Reporting to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center
1. Transmit results electronically to the hospital’s medical records
system.
2. Ensure that results are reviewed and approved before
transmission.
3. Contact the hospital’s laboratory coordinator for any critical or
unexpected results as outlined in critical value reporting policy.
5. Sample Integrity and Handling
A. Hemolysis Check
1. For suspected hemolyzed samples, centrifuge an aliquot and
visually inspect.
2. Use best judgment on reporting hemolyzed results.
B. Critical Results
1. For critical values, ensure prompt reporting and follow repeat
critical values guidelines.
2. Document all critical value reporting communications.
C. Unacceptable Specimens
1. If the specimen does not meet acceptable criteria, do not
proceed with testing.
2. Notify the ordering physician or hospital's laboratory.
6. Method Limitations
Refer to the specific test SOP or manufacturer’s insert for limitations
affecting test results.
7. References
1. Manufacturer’s insert for the specific test assay.
2. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
3. Hospital policies and procedures for specimen handling and
reporting.
8. Review and Ownership
This SOP is maintained and updated by the designated laboratory
coordinator. Review is conducted annually or as necessary in
response to changes in test protocols or equipment.
