STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for MISC
ESOTERIX ENDOCRINOLOGY
Effective Date: [date]
Reviewed: [date]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE
The aim of this SOP is to outline the correct procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for miscellaneous Esoterix
endocrinology tests. This document ensures quality, accuracy, and
reliability of the patient's test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The responsibility for monitoring and performing the procedures
described in this SOP lies with designated laboratory personnel who
are trained in the analytical protocols of Esoterix endocrinology
testing. It is also the responsibility of the supervisors to ensure
adherence to this procedure and address any issues that may arise.
3. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Refrigerators and freezers for specimen storage
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Esoterix reagents and controls
• Calibrators and standards
• Appropriate analytical instruments (e.g., Mass spectrometer,
HPLC, ELISA reader, etc.)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) as required
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for data entry and result
verification
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure sample integrity. Confirm that specimens are correctly
labelled and accompanied by accurate documentation.
2. Store specimens at the appropriate temperature as soon as
they are received.
3. For endocrine assays, prepare specimens according to the test-
specific protocol (e.g., centrifuge and aliquot plasma for
hormone assays).
Instrument Setup:
1. Calibrate analytical instruments according to manufacturer
specifications.
2. Perform daily maintenance checks and document results.
3. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls as outlined in the
specific assay procedure.
Running the Analysis:
1. Prepare the sample according to the specific test protocol.
2. Load the samples onto the instrument ensuring the correct
position and test sequence.
3. Run the analysis according to the instrument/user manual
instructions.
◦ For Mass Spectrometry: Setup and load samples. Monitor
ion peaks and quantitate using instrument software.
◦ For HPLC: Prepare and load samples. Monitor
chromatographs and identify peaks.
◦ For ELISA: Perform washing and incubation steps as
specified. Read optical density and calculate concentrations.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples each
day of testing to ensure assay precision and accuracy.
2. Acceptable ranges for QC materials are determined and must
be met before results can be reported.
3. Any deviations must be addressed by re-running QC samples
and /or troubleshooting the instrument.
Data Analysis and Verification:
1. Analyze instrument-generated data and verify results using
software applications.
2. Review the results for each test including documented QC
performance, ensuring data clusters around expected ranges.
3. Validate results through comparison with historical patient data
for consistency.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter the validated results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Ensure results are correctly mapped and reviewed before
verification in LIS.
3. Flag any critical values and follow-up with clinical personnel if
necessary.
4. Maintain confidentiality and ensure results are securely
transmitted to clinicians requesting testing.
5. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Should any test result fall outside the expected range:
1. Check instrument calibration and quality control logs.
2. Re-run the sample if necessary, ensuring all steps and
procedures are correctly adhered to.
3. Consult with senior laboratory personnel or supervisors for
further troubleshooting.
4. Document corrective actions taken in accordance with
laboratory protocols.
6. DOCUMENTATION
All relevant details should be accurately documented, including:
• Instrument calibration logs
• Daily maintenance records
• Test-specific records (reagents, calibrators)
• Quality control logs
• Analytical result data
• Any corrective actions taken
7. REFERENCES
• Esoterix Endocrinology Protocol Inserts
• Analytical Instrumentation User Manuals
• Laboratory Policies and Procedures Manual
8. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated based on new
regulations, technological advancements, and procedural changes.
Approval will be ensured through signatures of the laboratory
supervisor and quality assurance officer.
