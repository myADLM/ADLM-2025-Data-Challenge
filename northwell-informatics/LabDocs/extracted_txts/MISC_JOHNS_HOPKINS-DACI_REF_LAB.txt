1. PURPOSE To outline the standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for miscellaneous (MISC)
tests sent to Johns Hopkins - DACI Reference Lab. This
protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and quality in the
analytical testing and reporting processes.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel conducting tests referred to
Johns Hopkins - DACI Reference Lab are responsible for following
this SOP.
1. DEFINITION This SOP covers the workflow and quality control
procedures for processing miscellaneous tests sent to Johns
Hopkins - DACI Reference Lab.
2. PROCEDURES 3.1 Sample Preparation 3.1.1 Verify that the
specimen has been collected, received, and accessioned as
per standard protocol. 3.1.2 Ensure the sample type, volume,
and labeling are correct, and that the sample meets the
acceptance criteria. 3.1.3 Store samples at the appropriate
temperature until ready for analysis.
3.2 Test Order Verification 3.2.1 Confirm the test order details and
ensure all necessary information is included (e.g., patient
identification, test requested, pertinent clinical information). 3.2.2
Resolve any discrepancies or missing information before proceeding.
3.3 Quality Control 3.3.1 Perform quality control checks prior to assay
initiation, using appropriate QC materials. 3.3.2 Record and monitor
QC results as per laboratory protocols. 3.3.3 Investigate any QC
failures and document corrective actions taken.
3.4 Analytical Testing 3.4.1 Prepare and calibrate instrumentation as
per the manufacturer's instructions. 3.4.2 Refer to specific assay
protocols provided by Johns Hopkins - DACI Reference Lab for
detailed testing procedures. 3.4.3 Process the samples according to
the established assay protocols. 3.4.4 Document each step in the
testing process, including any deviations and the reasons for them.
3.5 Result Review and Reporting 3.5.1 Review the generated results
for accuracy and completeness. 3.5.2 Verify results against QC
standards ensuring they fall within acceptable ranges. 3.5.3 Enter
and verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). 3.5.4
Generate results report and ensure it includes all relevant patient and
assay details. 3.5.5 Release the report to the ordering physician or
medical provider, adhering to confidentiality policies.
3.6 Data Management 3.6.1 Maintain detailed records of all activities,
QC results, and patient results. 3.6.2 Archive data following
laboratory retention policies and regulations. 3.6.3 Ensure all data is
backed up regularly and securely.
3.7 Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions 3.7.1 In case of
instrument failure or analytical issues, follow troubleshooting
protocols. 3.7.2 Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective
actions taken. 3.7.3 Communicate any significant issues or test
delays to the appropriate supervising personnel.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE Ensure all steps adhere to the
laboratory's quality assurance program, including regular
reviews and updates of this SOP to reflect current practices and
regulatory requirements.
