MISC MEDICAL NEUROGENETICS, LLC STANDARD OPERATING
PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized protocol
for generating results for Neurogenetic testing at MISC Medical
Neurogenetics, LLC, to ensure accurate and reliable output in
compliance with clinical guidelines and laboratory standards. This
SOP will cover steps from receiving accessioned specimens to final
result reporting.
Responsibility:
• All laboratory staff involved in analytical testing and result
generation.
• The laboratory director or designated qualified personnel will
approve the final results.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to adhere to this SOP and report
any deviations or issues to a supervisor immediately.
Definitions:
• Analytical Phase: The phase following the receipt and
accessioning of specimens, encompassing sample preparation,
analysis, and data interpretation.
• Neurogenetic Testing: Diagnostic testing focused on identifying
genetic mutations linked to neurological disorders.
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
A. DNA Extraction:
◦ Retrieve the correct specimens as per the accession log.
◦ Perform DNA extraction using the validated extraction kits
(e.g., Qiagen DNA Mini Kit) following the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Verify the quality and quantity of extracted DNA using
NanoDrop spectrophotometry.
◦ Document DNA concentrations and purity ratios on the DNA
Extraction Log.
B. Amplification (PCR):
◦ Prepare PCR reaction mix according to the validated
protocol for the target neurogenetic panel.
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each
PCR run.
◦ Perform PCR in a thermal cycler, following the validated
cycling conditions.
C. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
◦ Load aliquots of PCR products onto an agarose gel.
◦ Run the gel electrophoresis to confirm PCR product sizes.
◦ Document results and save images of the gels for records.
2. Genetic Analysis:
A. Sequencing Prep:
◦ Purify PCR products using a suitable cleanup kit (e.g.,
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit).
◦ Quantify the purified product and prepare for sequencing.
B. Sequencing:
◦ Perform sequencing reactions using validated sequencing
platforms (e.g., Sanger sequencing or Next-Generation
Sequencing).
◦ Follow run protocols specified by the sequencing equipment
manufacturer.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Import raw sequencing data into the bioinformatics analysis
software.
◦ Align sequences to a reference genome and identify
variants using validated analysis pipelines.
◦ Annotate variants based on clinical significance using
curated databases (e.g., ClinVar, OMIM).
4. Interpretation of Results:
◦ A geneticist or qualified personnel will interpret the
annotated variants.
◦ Evaluate known pathogenic variants, variants of uncertain
significance (VUS), and benign variants.
◦ Include clinical correlations where necessary.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Conduct intra-run and inter-run quality control checks.
◦ Utilize quality control materials (e.g., reference samples)
regularly to ensure analytical accuracy.
◦ Document all QC results in the Quality Control Log.
6. Result Reporting:
◦ Compile analyzed data into a report.
◦ Include the patient's genetic findings, clinical relevance, and
interpretation.
◦ The report should be reviewed and signed off by a qualified
geneticist.
◦ Results must be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and securely transmitted to the ordering
physician.
7. Documentation and Record-Keeping:
◦ Maintain all logs, including the DNA Extraction Log, PCR
Log, Sequencing Log, and Quality Control Log.
◦ Securely store paper and electronic copies of raw data,
analyzed data, reports, and quality control documents for
future reference.
◦ Comply with regulatory requirements for record retention.
Safety and Compliance:
- Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
- Dispose of biological waste according to institutional biohazard disposal guidelines.
- Adhere to CLIA, CAP, and other applicable regulatory requirements.
