Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for MISC Monogram Biosciences, Inc.
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for MISC Monogram Biosciences, Inc. It ensures
the quality, reliability, and integrity of laboratory results. The
procedure encompasses specimen preparation, equipment handling,
data analysis, quality control, and documentation.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
the procedures as described in this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
supervisory staff to ensure compliances with these protocols, oversee
corrective actions when necessary, and maintain records of the
same.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Types:
• Blood, serum, plasma, or other specified biological samples
collected as per Monogram Biosciences requirements.
Preparation:
• Ensure specimens are correctly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
• Inspect specimens for proper volume, container type, and
absence of hemolysis or clots.
• Prior to analysis, bring refrigerated specimens to room
temperature unless otherwise specified.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Incorrectly labeled or unlabeled specimens.
• Specimens with clots or significant hemolysis.
• Inappropriate container use or volume discrepancies.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Analytical instruments as specified by Monogram Biosciences
protocols.
• Temperature-controlled equipment: freezers, refrigerators, water
baths, incubators, heating blocks.
• Pipettes, centrifuges, PCR machines, and other necessary
laboratory equipment.
Reagents:
• Utilize only validated and certified reagents as per Monogram
Biosciences guidelines.
• Store reagents according to manufacturer's instructions and
Monogram Biosciences protocols.
• Document reagent lot numbers and expiry dates for traceability.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen against the requisition form for accuracy.
2. Centrifuge specimens that require separation (plasma, serum)
at the specified speed and time.
3. Aliquot samples where necessary, labeling aliquots as per
standard identification protocol.
4. For critical analyses or high-throughput testing, prioritize
specimen handling to minimize degradation.
B) Analytical Process:
1. Calibrate the analytical instruments before use every day or as
prescribed by the manufacturer.
2. Load prepared specimens into the appropriate analytical
equipment following the instrument’s operational manual.
3. Configure the instrument's settings according to recommended
protocols for each test type.
4. Initiate the analytical run; ensure continuous monitoring for any
equipment alarms or errors.
5. Upon completion of the analytical run, ensure the data is
correctly recorded, either digitally or manually, in a secure
format.
C) Quality Control:
1. Conduct quality control assessments with each batch or every
20 samples, whichever is sooner:
◦ Utilize both positive and negative controls.
◦ Document all quality control results.
2. Cross-reference control results against known standards. Any
deviations beyond accepted ranges must prompt re-analysis.
3. If any QC fails, re-run the samples and perform necessary
calibration or maintenance of the instruments.
D) Data Analysis and Documentation:
1. Review preliminary analytical results for consistency and
accuracy.
2. Validate the data against quality control standards and
expected biological ranges.
3. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS), ensuring all result entries are double-checked for
accuracy.
4. Report critical values to the appropriate clinical team
immediately as per Monogram Biosciences guidelines.
5. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
1. Identify and document any deviations or anomalies in the
analytical process.
2. Investigate causes for non-conformance, perform recalibration,
and re-analyze specimens if needed.
3. Notify supervisory staff and document corrective actions in the
laboratory records.
6. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
1. Perform routine maintenance of analytical instruments as per
manufacturer guidelines.
2. Document all maintenance activities, including calibrations and
service records.
3. Validate equipment performance post-maintenance using
standard controls.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Generate analytical results reports through the LIS.
2. Ensure reports include patient information, test results, quality
control data, and any relevant comments.
3. Securely transmit the final result reports to Monogram
Biosciences, Inc., following the established communication
protocol.
