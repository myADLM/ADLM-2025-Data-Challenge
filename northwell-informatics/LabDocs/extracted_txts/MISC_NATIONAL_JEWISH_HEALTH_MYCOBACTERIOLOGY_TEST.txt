Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for MISC NATIONAL
JEWISH HEALTH MYCOBACTERIOLOGY TEST
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for the National Jewish Health Mycobacteriology Test. This
protocol ensures accurate and reliable test results by following
specified procedures and guidelines.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
test according to the SOP and to document all observations, results,
and any deviations from the protocol. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that all procedures are adhered to and for addressing any
issues that may arise during testing.
2. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Biosafety cabinet (BSC) Level 2
• Centrifuge
• Incubator at 37°C
• Mycobacteriology culture media (e.g., Lowenstein-Jensen,
Middlebrook 7H10)
• Mycobacterial growth indicator tubes (MGIT)
• Ziehl-Neelsen staining reagents
• Automated system for identification and susceptibility testing (if
available)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Sterile tubes and containers
• Disposable protective apparel (gloves, lab coat, face shield)
• Disinfectants (e.g., 70% ethanol, bleach)
• Waste disposal containers for biohazardous materials
B. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
• The received specimen should be processed in a BSC to prevent
contamination and exposure to infectious agents.
• Ensure the specimen is appropriately labeled and match
specimen ID with the requisition form.
• If specimen concentration is required (e.g., sputum), perform
decontamination and concentration by standard methods using N-
acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium hydroxide.
C. Culturing the Specimen:
1. Solid Media:
◦ Inoculate a portion of the specimen onto Lowenstein-Jensen
or Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates.
◦ Incubate plates at 37°C with 5-10% CO2 for up to 8 weeks.
◦ Examine the plates weekly for growth. Record results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Liquid Media:
◦ Inoculate a portion of the specimen into MGIT tubes.
◦ Place MGIT tubes in the appropriate automated incubation
system (e.g., BACTEC MGIT 960) for mycobacterial growth
monitoring.
◦ Record growth indicators and remove positive tubes as
indicated by the automated system.
D. Identification of Mycobacterial Species:
1. Perform Ziehl-Neelsen staining on suspected colonies from
solid media or positive MGIT tubes to confirm the presence of
acid-fast bacilli (AFB).
2. For colony identification, use molecular methods (e.g., PCR,
DNA sequencing) or automated systems as available. Ensure
proper calibration and quality control of the equipment as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
E. Susceptibility Testing:
• Perform drug susceptibility testing on identified mycobacterial
isolates using the automated system or standard broth
microdilution methods.
• Ensure all controls (positive and negative) are included in each
run.
• Follow guidelines for interpretation of susceptibility results as per
CLSI standards.
F. Quality Control and Documentation:
• Ensure all equipment is regularly calibrated, and culture media
are tested for sterility before use.
• Document results, QC measures, and any deviations or corrective
actions in the LIS.
• Maintain records of all steps in the testing process, including
incubation times, media lot numbers, and control results.
G. Reporting Results:
• Verify all results against the QC data before reporting.
• Enter results into the LIS and generate the final report for review
by a qualified supervisor or pathologist.
• Follow up on any critical results as per laboratory policy.
H. Waste Disposal:
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste, including culture media and
contaminated consumables, in accordance with institutional safety
guidelines and local regulations.
• Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment after use with
appropriate disinfectants.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the specific insert provided by the reagent and equipment
manufacturers for limitations and possible sources of error. Ensure
the equipment is properly maintained, and reagents are stored and
handled according to manufacturer instructions.
