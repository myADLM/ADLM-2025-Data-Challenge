PURPOSE: To ensure accuracy and consistency in the analytical
phase of generating results for miscellaneous tests conducted by
Prometheus Laboratories. This protocol is intended for use by trained
laboratory personnel in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting.
RESPONSIBILITY: All laboratory personnel performing these tests
must adhere to the procedure as outlined in this SOP to ensure
proper analytical results are obtained and reported.
PROCEDURE:
1. Specimen Requirements and Handling:
◦ Verify the integrity of the specimen upon receipt.
◦ Ensure the specimen is labeled correctly with patient
information, collection date, and time.
◦ Store specimens as per test-specific storage requirements
outlined in the Prometheus Laboratories testing manual.
2. Equipment and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Use only reagents and consumables that are within their
expiration dates.
◦ Prepare reagents and controls as specified in the
Prometheus Laboratories test kit instructions.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples in parallel with patient samples
as stipulated by Prometheus Laboratories.
◦ Document all QC results and verify they are within
acceptable limits before reporting patient results.
◦ Implement corrective actions and re-run samples if QC
results fall outside the acceptable range.
4. Testing Procedure:
◦ Adhere to the specific test protocol as provided by
Prometheus Laboratories.
◦ Follow all steps meticulously to avoid cross-contamination
or procedural errors.
◦ Document any deviations from the standard procedure and
notify the supervisor immediately.
5. Result Analysis and Interpretation:
◦ Analyze test results using appropriate software or analytical
tools as recommended by Prometheus Laboratories.
◦ Compare results with established reference ranges provided
in the test kit.
◦ Validate results through internal and external quality
assurance activities.
6. Reporting Results:
◦ Review test results for accuracy and completeness before
reporting.
◦ Report results according to laboratory reporting guidelines,
ensuring all critical values are communicated promptly.
◦ Use the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result entry,
ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
◦ Notify the requesting physician or clinician of any
significantly abnormal or critical test results immediately.
7. Documentation:
◦ Maintain all documents related to the testing process,
including QC logs, reagent usage logs, and maintenance
records.
◦ Ensure all documentation meets regulatory and laboratory
accreditation requirements.
8. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
◦ Follow troubleshooting guidelines provided by Prometheus
Laboratories for any test anomalies.
◦ Document all troubleshooting activities and corrective
actions taken.
◦ Re-evaluate the affected specimens and re-run tests if
necessary.
9. Safety and Compliance:
◦ Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols, including the use
of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
◦ Ensure all procedures comply with CLIA regulations and any
other applicable regulatory requirements.
◦ Participate in ongoing training and competency
assessments to stay current with testing procedures and
safety protocols.
