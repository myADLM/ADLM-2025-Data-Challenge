Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MISC@Seattle Children's Hospital
Laboratories
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the analytical phase steps necessary to
generate results for miscellaneous (MISC) tests performed at Seattle
Children's Hospital laboratories.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technologists to
perform tests according to this procedure. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with these procedures and
handling any issues that arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received without proper labeling or source
identification.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric to the extent
that they interfere with test results.
• Specimens that do not meet the specific test requirements (e.g.,
wrong container type, improper storage conditions).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated analyzers specific to the test
• Calibrated pipettes
• Reagents specific to the test
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Miscellaneous testing supplies as required
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure that the specimens are properly labeled and meet the
requirements for testing.
2. Verify that the appropriate equipment and reagents are
available and functional.
3. Wear appropriate PPE as required by the laboratory safety
protocols.
4. Ensure the work area is clean and organized.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration on the analyzers as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the analytical process.
3. Document QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges prior to proceeding with patient specimens. Any QC
failures must be addressed before patient testing.
C) Analytical Testing:
1. Follow the specific test protocol for the MISC test being
performed, including:
◦ Volume of specimen required
◦ Specific reagents to be used
2. For automated tests:
◦ Load the specimens and reagents into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Input any necessary information into the analytical software.
◦ Start the analysis and monitor the process, noting any alerts
or errors.
3. For manual tests:
◦ Pipette the specimen and reagents as required by the test
protocol.
◦ Follow incubation times and other procedural steps as
directed.
◦ Use appropriate detection methods (e.g., color change,
turbidity) to determine results.
D) Result Generation and Verification:
1. Review the raw data generated by the analytical equipment/
software.
2. Calculate results if required, following the specific test formula.
3. Verify the results for consistency and accuracy by comparing
QC results and expected ranges.
4. Flag any results that are outside of normal range or have
discrepancies according to laboratory protocol.
E) Troubleshooting:
1. If any results are questionable or errors are detected:
◦ Recheck the specimen and reagents.
◦ Re-run the QC and patient sample if necessary.
◦ Document any deviation and corrective actions taken.
◦ Notify a supervisor if the issue cannot be resolved.
F) Documentation and Reporting:
1. Document all analytical processes, calibrations, QC results, and
any deviations.
2. Record the final test results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Verify and release the results for clinician review.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND RECORD KEEPING
1. Ensure quality control records and logs are maintained
accurately and securely.
2. Store calibration and QC records for the retention period as
specified by laboratory regulations.
7. CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
The laboratory will engage in ongoing review and audit of this
process to identify areas for improvement and ensure compliance
with regulatory requirements.
