STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results - MISC
University of Florida Testing
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for
generating test results for MISC University of Florida Testing.
The aim is to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the
testing process following the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) guidelines.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff
to perform the analytical procedures, record data accurately, and
ensure compliance with this SOP.
1. DEFINITION MISC testing includes various biochemical,
immunological, hematological, and microbiological analyses as
specified by the University of Florida.
2. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment and Reagents:
• Follow specific guidelines for equipment and reagent usage as
per manufacturer instructions.
• Include calibration, maintenance, and troubleshooting of analytical
instruments as defined in the respective equipment manuals.
• Store reagents and controls according to specific storage
conditions outlined on the package inserts.
B) Quality Control:
• Perform quality control procedures at the beginning of each shift
and with each new lot of reagents.
• Use two levels of quality control materials and record the results
using the appropriate documentation.
• Review and document any deviations from acceptable control
range and perform corrective actions as needed.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for QC validation and reporting.
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Receive and verify specimen:
◦ Ensure that specimens are appropriately labeled and
checked for integrity.
◦ Record any discrepancies and report to the supervisor for
resolution.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Follow the specific testing protocol as defined for each test.
◦ Process specimens (centrifugation, aliquoting, etc.)
according to the test's requirements.
3. Instrument Setup and Calibration:
◦ Calibrate instruments following the manufacturer's protocols.
◦ Document calibration runs in the instrument logs.
4. Running the Test:
◦ Load specimens and controls into the analyzer according to
test-specific instructions.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for interruptions or errors during the
run.
◦ Address any instrument errors or anomalies as they occur.
D) Data Handling:
1. Data Review:
◦ Review all generated data for completeness and accuracy.
◦ Ensure that control results are within acceptable ranges
before validating patient results.
2. Result Verification:
◦ Compare instrument-generated results with pre-determined
reference ranges.
◦ Verify any critical or out-of-range results by performing re-
tests or additional confirmatory tests as necessary.
◦ Document any discrepancies or repeats.
3. Reporting:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for verifying and reporting
results.
◦ Notify the requesting clinician of any critical values following
established critical result notification procedures.
E) Documentation and Record-Keeping:
• Maintain full records of all analytical runs, including QC results,
calibrations, patient specimen results, and any issues
encountered.
• Use site-specific log sheets or electronic systems for
documentation.
• Ensure all logs are signed off by the performing technologist and
reviewed by the supervisor as defined in the SOP.
F) Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
• Follow predefined troubleshooting steps detailed in instrument
manuals for any errors or issues.
• Document all corrective actions, adjustments, and recalibration
efforts in the instrument log.
• Escalate unresolved issues to the technical supervisor.
G) Post-Analytical Procedures:
• Dispose of specimens and reagents according to biohazard waste
disposal protocols.
• Clean and maintain laboratory instrumentation as per established
maintenance schedules.
• Ensure all documentation is complete and securely stored.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's guidelines and manuals for all laboratory
equipment.
• Site-specific protocols and guidelines provided by the University
of Florida.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines for laboratory testing and quality
control.
1. REVIEW AND UPDATES:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on
regulatory changes or procedural updates.
• Responsibility for the review lies with the Laboratory Supervisor.
