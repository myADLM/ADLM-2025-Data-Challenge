Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results in the Neuromuscular Clinical Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Neuromuscular Clinical
Laboratory at the Misc Washington University. Ensuring accurate and
precise analytical results in a timely manner is crucial for effective
diagnosis and management of neuromuscular disorders.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
procedures as outlined.
• All laboratory staff must ensure adherence to protocols, identify
and report any deviations, and verify the accuracy of results
generated.
• Supervisors are to ensure proper training and competency of staff
in executing these procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Types:
• Muscle biopsies
• Nerve biopsies
• Blood samples
• Skin biopsies
Handling Requirements:
• Sterile conditions must be maintained during specimen collection
and handling.
• Specimens must be immediately stored at appropriate
temperatures (biopsies on ice, blood samples at 4°C if not
analyzed immediately) to prevent degradation.
• Detailed documentation must accompany each specimen with
patient information, collection details, and any specific storage
instructions.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are mislabelled or unlabeled.
• Specimens that exceed the recommended time frame for analysis
without proper preservation.
• Specimens that are visibly degraded or contaminated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Cryostat
• Microtome
• Light microscope
• Electron microscope
• Spectrophotometer
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
Reagents:
• Fixative solutions (e.g., formalin, glutaraldehyde)
• Staining solutions (e.g., Hematoxylin, Eosin, Trichrome)
• Electrophoresis buffer solutions
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Cover slips
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
A. Muscle Biopsies:
1. Fixation and Cryo-sectioning:
◦ Immediately fix the biopsy in formalin for approximately 24
hours or snap freeze it in liquid nitrogen.
◦ Section frozen tissue on a cryostat at -20°C to appropriate
thickness (5-10 µm).
2. Staining:
◦ Perform Hematoxylin and Eosin staining for general
morphology.
◦ Additional stains (e.g., NADH, ATPase) may be performed
as required based on clinical indication.
3. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Examine stained sections under light microscope.
◦ Document abnormalities relating to muscle fiber size, shape,
inflammation, and other histopathologic features.
B. Nerve Biopsies:
1. Tissue Processing:
◦ Fix nerve biopsies in glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy.
◦ Embed tissues in resin for thin-sectioning.
2. Ultrastructural Examination:
◦ Section resin-embedded samples using a microtome.
◦ Obtain ultrathin sections for electron microscopy.
3. Electron Microscopy:
◦ Examine ultra-thin sections for detailed ultrastructural
features indicative of neuropathies.
◦ Document findings with appropriate electron micrographs.
C. Blood Samples:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Use automated systems or spin-column based methods for
extracting DNA.
◦ Quantify and qualify the DNA yield using spectrophotometry.
2. PCR and Electrophoresis:
◦ Perform PCR for relevant genetic markers associated with
neuromuscular diseases.
◦ Analyze amplified products by gel electrophoresis and
document results.
D. Skin Biopsies for Fibroblast Culture:
1. Tissue Culture:
◦ Sterilize the skin biopsy sample and place in culture
medium.
◦ Monitor fibroblast outgrowth and maintain cultures under
standard conditions.
2. Cellular Assays:
◦ Perform functional assays relevant to specific
neuromuscular disorders.
◦ Document cell morphology and response to assays.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
• Use known control samples alongside patient samples to verify
reliability of assays.
• Document and investigate any deviation from expected results.
B. Cross-checks and Instrument Calibration
• Periodically perform cross-checks between instruments and
validate using control standards.
• Calibrate equipment regularly as per manufacturer guidelines and
document calibration records.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results by senior laboratory personnel before
issuing the report.
• Record the final validated results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Critical results should be communicated promptly to the
requesting physician and properly documented as per laboratory
protocol.
• Ensure all reports are accurate, comprehensive, and delivered in
a timely manner.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals should be derived from established norms and
updated with the latest clinical and laboratory data. Reference
intervals must be clearly stated in each report.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Acknowledge and document any limitations inherent to the
methodologies used.
• Footnotes should be included in reports where interpretation may
be influenced by these limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Latest clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed publications on
neuromuscular disorders.
• Manufacturer inserts and instructions for proprietary reagents and
equipment used in procedures.
Approval and Review: This SOP must be reviewed and approved
by the laboratory director annually or as necessary to ensure
procedures are up to date with current practices and technological
advancements.
