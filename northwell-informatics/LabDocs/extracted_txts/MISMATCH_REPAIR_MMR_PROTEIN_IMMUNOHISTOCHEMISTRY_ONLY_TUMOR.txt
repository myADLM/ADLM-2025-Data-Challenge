Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mismatch Repair
(MMR) Protein Immunohistochemistry of Tumor Samples
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for performing and documenting Mismatch
Repair (MMR) protein immunohistochemistry on tumor samples, to
ensure accurate and reproducible results. This SOP is intended to
provide guidance on the analytical phase, from sample preparation to
result interpretation and documentation.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of MMR protein immunohistochemistry testing of tumor
samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
MMR protein immunohistochemistry according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for the overall quality
control and assurance of the immunohistochemical procedures
and results.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue blocks
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Glass slides
• Xylene and alcohol
• Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer,
pH 9.0)
• Primary antibodies for MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
PMS2)
• Secondary antibodies and detection reagents
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Positive and negative control tissue slides
• Humidified chamber
• Light microscope
• Slide scanner (optional)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Sample Preparation
1. Cut 4-5 µm sections from FFPE tumor tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Place sections on positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adherence.
5.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for three changes, 5 minutes
each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded alcohol series (100%, 95%,
70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.3. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval by placing slides in a suitable retrieval
buffer and heating in a water bath or microwave.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.4. Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS).
3. Apply blocking solution (e.g., normal serum) for 10 minutes to
reduce nonspecific binding.
4. Incubate slides with primary antibodies against MMR proteins
(MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) at optimal dilutions, as
determined by antibody titration, for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.
5. Rinse slides in PBS.
5.5. Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Incubate slides with an appropriate secondary antibody for 30
minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
3. Apply detection reagent according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (e.g., streptavidin-biotin complex).
4. Rinse slides in PBS.
5.6. Chromogen Development and Counterstaining
1. Develop chromogen (e.g., DAB) for 5-10 minutes, monitoring
under a light microscope to determine optimal staining.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
5. Dehydrate through graded alcohol series and clear in xylene.
5.7. Mounting and Visualization
1. Apply mounting medium and cover with coverslips.
2. Allow slides to dry.
5.8. Quality Control and Interpretation
1. Include positive and negative control tissues with each batch of
slides.
2. Examine stained slides under a light microscope to identify the
presence or absence of staining in tumor cells.
3. Record the staining patterns and intensities as per established
criteria (e.g., complete loss, partial loss, or intact expression of
MMR proteins).
4. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If staining is weak or absent in positive controls, repeat the
procedure with optimization of antigen retrieval, antibody
concentration, or incubation times.
• If nonspecific staining is observed, adjust blocking conditions or
antibody dilutions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a pathologist.
• Report the expression status of each MMR protein (MLH1, MSH2,
MSH6, PMS2) as either loss of expression or intact expression.
• Record any interpretive comments or observations in the patient’s
report.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all reagents and antibodies used.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature for the validation and
interpretation of MMR immunohistochemistry results.

10. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• This SOP is reviewed and updated on an annual basis or as
needed.
• The current version of this SOP is maintained in the laboratory’s
document control system.
