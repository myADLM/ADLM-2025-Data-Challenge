Standard Operating Procedure: MITF Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the technical component of performing
the MITF (Microphthalmia Transcription Factor) immunostain on
tissue specimens in the laboratory. This SOP ensures consistency
and accuracy in the staining process, providing high-quality slides for
pathologist review.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated histotechnologists to
perform the staining procedure following this SOP.
• Pathologists are responsible for interpreting the stained slides.
• Laboratory supervisors must ensure that all designated staff are
trained and adhere to this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Tissue sections mounted on positively charged microscope slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissue sections that are improperly fixed, inadequately processed,
or show signs of detachment.
• Specimens without proper identification or accompanying
documentation.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmers
• Automated or manual immunostainer
• Microscopes
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Peroxidase block
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Primary antibody: Anti-MITF
• Secondary antibody
• Detection reagent (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Microscope slides, positively charged
• Coverslips
• Forceps
• Slide racks
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut tissue sections approximately 3-4 microns thick from
FFPE blocks using a microtome.
◦ Float sections in a water bath and pick up on positively
charged slides.
◦ Air dry slides and bake at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure tissue
adherence.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 5 minutes in 3 separate changes.
◦ Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%,
70%) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a
pressure cooker or microwave according to manufacturer’s
recommendations.
◦ Allow slides to cool in solution for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS).
B. Immunostaining:
1. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
◦ Incubate slides in peroxidase block solution for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply anti-MITF primary antibody to cover the tissue
section.
◦ Incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
3. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply secondary antibody to cover the tissue section.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
4. Detection:
◦ Apply DAB substrate or other appropriate detection reagent.
◦ Incubate for 5-10 minutes or until desired stain intensity is
achieved.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in running tap water.
◦ Dip slides in 0.1% acid alcohol briefly, then rinse in tap
water.
6. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%,
100%) for 1 minute each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 2 minutes in 3 changes.
7. Mounting:
◦ Apply a drop of mounting medium and coverslip.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide with known MITF-positive tissue in
each staining batch.
• Ensure consistent staining intensity and negativity in negative
controls.
• Intermediate controls should be run periodically to ensure ongoing
accuracy.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Slides must be labeled correctly with patient information and
staining details.
• Completed slides should be submitted to pathologists for
interpretation.
• Results will be reviewed and verified in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for primary and secondary antibodies,
antigen retrieval solutions, and detection kits.
• Current literature and guidelines on immunohistochemistry
procedures.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inconsistent staining or weak signal: Verify antigen retrieval
conditions, antibody concentrations, and incubation times. Check
reagent expiry dates and storage conditions.
• Non-specific staining: Ensure proper blocking steps, double-check
antibody dilutions, and optimize washing steps.
• Detached sections: Ensure tissue sections are thin enough and
properly adhered to charged slides. Consider re-baking if sections
continually detach.
10. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow laboratory safety protocols and wear appropriate PPE
(Personal Protective Equipment).
• Handle all reagents, especially chemicals like xylene, with caution
according to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).
DOCUMENTATION
• Document all performed procedures in the immunostain logbook,
including date, technician’s initials, patient ID, control results, and
any noted deviations or issues encountered.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
quality control results accordingly.
