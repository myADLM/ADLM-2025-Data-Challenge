Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Mitochondrial
Antibodies (M2), Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides the methodology for the quantitative
determination of mitochondrial antibodies (M2) in serum using an
enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The presence of M2 indicates
autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary cholangitis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to ensure that all steps
are followed accurately and documented appropriately to assure the
quality and validity of the results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that staff are properly trained and competent in performing
this procedure.
3. SPECIMEN
ACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a standard clot activator tube (e.g.,
red-top or serum separator tube).
UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens with severe hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens received at room temperature more than 1 day post-
collection or refrigerated specimens beyond 7 days post-
collection.
COLLECTION AND HANDLING:
• Allow the blood to clot for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm to separate the
serum.
• Aliquot serum into a labeled, clean, and sterile tube.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if testing within 7 days, or freeze at
-20°C for longer storage.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Mitochondrial Antibodies (M2) ELISA Kit
• Microplate Reader capable of measurement at 450 nm
• Micropipettes and tips
• Deionized or distilled water
• Plate washer or manual washing setup
• Appropriate quality control materials (positive and negative
controls)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Timer
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
proper assay performance.
• Results from controls should fall within manufacturer's specified
ranges.
• Document control results in the QC log sheet provided.
• If controls do not meet acceptance criteria, review procedures,
reagents, and equipment followed by repeating the assay.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparing
reagents and buffers.
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before use.
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Securely place the required number of wells in the frame
based on the number of samples and controls.
3. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and patient samples into
the appropriate wells in duplicate.
4. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate and incubate it at 37°C for 60 minutes.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with 300 μL of diluted wash buffer for
each wash.
◦ Tap the plate gently on a clean paper towel to remove any
residual washing solution after the final wash.
6. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Second Wash Cycle:
◦ Repeat the wash procedure as described previously.
8. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature
(18-25°C) for 15 minutes.
9. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
10. Reading:
◦ Immediately read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate
reader.
8. CALCULATING AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculation:
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
values of each standard concentration versus respective
concentrations.
◦ Calculate the concentration of mitochondrial antibodies in
patient samples based on the derived standard curve using
appropriate software or standard linear regression analysis.
• Reporting Results:
◦ Results are reported in units per milliliter (U/mL) following
laboratory-specific reporting guidelines.
◦ Interpret the results based on the reference intervals provided
by the assay manufacturer.
▪ Reference Interval: Negative: <20 U/mL; Positive: ≥20 U/
mL
9. INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
• Negative Result: Represents the absence of detectable M2
antibodies. Consider screening for other autoantibodies if
autoimmune hepatitis is suspected.
• Positive Result: Represents the presence of M2 antibodies,
potentially indicating autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary
cholangitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Heterophilic antibodies or other interfering substances in patient
samples may cause falsely elevated or decreased results.
• Interpretation of results should be combined with clinical findings
and other diagnostic procedures.
