Standard Operating Procedure for
Mitochondrial Antibodies, Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the detection and quantification of
mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in serum using an enzyme
immunoassay (EIA). This SOP ensures reliable and accurate results
to aid in the diagnosis of autoimmune liver diseases, such as primary
biliary cholangitis (PBC).
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all clinical staff responsible for performing
mitochondrial antibody testing in the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the test as per the procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and for reviewing the results.
• All laboratory personnel must ensure that appropriate quality
control measures are in place and followed.
4. Specimen Requirements
4.1. Specimen Type
• Serum
4.2. Collection and Handling
• Preferred collection container: Serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum specimen volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Serum should be separated from the clot as soon as possible or
within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if not tested immediately. If
storage exceeds 48 hours, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
4.3. Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens that are not labeled correctly or have insufficient
volume.
• Specimens that have been stored at improper temperatures.
5. Equipment and Reagents
5.1. Equipment
• ELISA reader
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Incubator or water bath set at 37°C
• Plate washer or manual washing equipment
• Vortex mixer
5.2. Reagents
• AMA test kit (EIA)
• Controls and calibrators as provided by the kit manufacturer
• Deionized water
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
6. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay performance.
• Calibration should be performed as per the kit manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Results for controls should fall within the manufacturer's specified
range to validate the assay.
7. Procedure
7.1. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer and other reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
7.2. Assay Procedure
1. Add appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples to the designated wells of the microplate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended time as per the
kit’s package insert.
3. Wash the plate thoroughly with wash buffer to remove unbound
substances.
4. Add the appropriate volume of conjugate reagent to each well
and incubate at 37°C.
5. Wash the plate again thoroughly.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate it protected
from light at room temperature for the recommended time.
7. Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
7.3. Measurement
• Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader at the specified wavelength (usually 450 nm with a
correction at 620 nm).
7.4. Interpretation of Results
• Calculate the results using the provided calibration curve and
reference ranges.
• Compare patient results with the cut-off value provided by the kit
manufacturer.
• Report results as either negative, borderline, or positive based on
the pre-defined thresholds.
8. Reporting Results
Reference Ranges
• Negative: Below cut-off value
• Borderline: Close to cut-off value (requires clinical correlation and
possibly repeat testing)
• Positive: Above cut-off value
Transmitting Results
• Ensure results are reviewed by the laboratory supervisor before
reporting.
• Record and report results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
9. Troubleshooting
• Re-run the test if controls do not fall within the specified range.
• Check for common errors including pipetting errors, instrument
malfunction, and reagent expiry.
• Consult the kit’s troubleshooting guide or contact the
manufacturer if persistent issues occur.
10. Limitations
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other laboratory tests.
• False positives or negatives may occur due to technical errors or
interfering substances in the serum.
11. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package insert for the AMA test
kit.
• Current clinical guidelines for the interpretation of autoimmune
liver disease markers.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure
compliance with current best practices and regulatory requirements.
