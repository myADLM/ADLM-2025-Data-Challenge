Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing
Mitochondrial DNA Deletion Heteroplasmy using ddPCR
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the protocol for the analysis of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) deletion heteroplasmy using Droplet Digital Polymerase
Chain Reaction (ddPCR). The procedure includes preparation,
amplification, and quantification steps to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this protocol
accurately and maintaining the integrity of the samples. The
laboratory supervisor oversees the entire process and ensures
adherence to the protocol.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Heteroplasmy: The presence of more than one type of
mitochondrial DNA within a cell or individual.
• ddPCR: Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction, a highly
sensitive method for quantifying nucleic acids.
3. PROCEDURE
Equipment and Reagents:
• ddPCR System (e.g., Bio-Rad QX200)
• Droplet Generator & Droplet Reader
• ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP)
• Target-specific and reference primers and probes
• Thermal Cycler
• Qubit Fluorometer or other nucleic acid quantification tools
• Pipettes and filtered pipette tips
• 96-well PCR plates and sealing film
• Vortex and centrifuge
• DNA extraction kit (specific to the sample type)
• Nuclease-free water
Sample Preparation:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract mitochondrial DNA from the collected sample using
a suitable DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a Qubit Fluorometer or
equivalent method to ensure a concentration of 20-100 ng/
µL.
◦ Store the DNA at -20°C until further use.
ddPCR Reaction Setup:
1. Prepare the ddPCR Reaction Mix:
◦ In a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare the reaction
mix as follows:
▪ ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP): 10 µL
▪ Forward primer (10 µM): 1 µL
▪ Reverse primer (10 µM): 1 µL
▪ Probe (10 µM): 1 µL
▪ Template DNA: 1-5 µL (20-100 ng DNA)
▪ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 20 µL
2. Generate Droplets:
◦ Transfer 20 µL of the reaction mix into the appropriate wells
of a DG8 cartridge.
◦ Add 70 µL of droplet generation oil to each well.
◦ Load the cartridge into the droplet generator.
◦ Seal the droplets as per the droplet generator protocol.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Transfer the generated droplets to a 96-well PCR plate.
◦ Seal the plate with a foil seal or a plate sealer.
◦ Place the sealed plate on a thermal cycler and run the
following program:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 55°C for 1 minute
▪ Final Extension: 98°C for 10 minutes
▪ Hold: 4°C
Droplet Reading and Data Analysis:
1. Read Droplets:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the droplet reader and run the read
protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Analyze Data:
◦ Use the ddPCR software to analyze the results.
◦ Set appropriate thresholds for positive and negative
droplets.
◦ Calculate the percentage of heteroplasmy by comparing the
number of droplets containing the deletion to the total
number of positive droplets for the reference target.
Quality Control:
1. Quality Control Checks:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Ensure no-template controls (NTCs) are included to check
for contamination.
◦ Repeat any samples with unexpected results or dPCR
anomalies.
◦ Perform inter-run comparisons to verify the consistency of
the results.
Reporting Results:
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Verify and validate all results obtained from the ddPCR runs.
◦ Report the percentage of mtDNA deletion heteroplasmy
accurately in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Include the QC data and any relevant comments regarding
the integrity and validity of the results.
