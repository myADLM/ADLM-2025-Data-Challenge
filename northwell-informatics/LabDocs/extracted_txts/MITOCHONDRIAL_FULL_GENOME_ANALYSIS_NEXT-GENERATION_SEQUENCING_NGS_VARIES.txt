Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Mitochondrial Full
Genome Analysis, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of mitochondrial
full genome analysis using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
technology. This SOP ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of the results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing mitochondrial full
genome analysis using NGS in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated staff is responsible for carrying out mitochondrial full
genome analysis using NGS technology as per this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure that all procedures are followed
correctly and documented consistently.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher)
• Thermocycler
• Magnetic stand
• Microcentrifuge
• PCR tubes and plates
• Pipettes and pipette tips (sterile, filtered)
• Fluorometer or qPCR for library quantification
• DNA extraction kits
• Library preparation kits (e.g., Illumina TruSeq, NEBNext)
• Index adapters as per the sequencing platform
• NGS library cleaning beads
• Equilibrator for flow cells
• Cleaning reagents
• Ethanol, nuclease-free water, TE buffer, and other laboratory-
grade reagents
• Dry ice or cooler for specimen transportation
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction
• Extract mitochondrial DNA from the received specimens using the
recommended DNA extraction kit.
• Verify the quantity and quality of the extracted DNA using
fluorometry or spectrophotometry. The DNA concentration should
meet the specifications of the library preparation kit.
5.2 Library Preparation
• Prepare sequencing libraries from the extracted mitochondrial
DNA using a suitable library preparation kit.
• Fragment the DNA if necessary.
• Perform end-repair, dA-tailing, and adapter ligation steps.
• Amplify the library using PCR.
• Clean up the libraries using magnetic beads to remove any
leftover enzymes, adapters, and other contaminants.
5.3 Library Quantification and Quality Control
• Quantify the prepared libraries using a fluorometer or qPCR to
ensure they meet the required concentration for sequencing.
• Verify the size distribution and quality of the libraries using a
Bioanalyzer, TapeStation, or equivalent equipment.
• Ensure the presence of sharp and distinct peaks indicating the
correct size range for the platform being used.
5.4 Sequencing
• Dilute the libraries to the appropriate concentration for loading
onto the sequencer.
• Load the libraries onto the flow cell or chip following the
sequencer manufacturer's instructions.
• Set up the sequencing run parameters, including read length,
index cycles, and paired-end settings, as recommended for full
mitochondrial genome sequencing.
• Start the sequencing run and monitor its progress. Ensure
appropriate documentation and adherence to sequencer
calibration, maintenance, and performance checks.
5.5 Data Analysis
• Demultiplex the sequencing reads and remove adapter
sequences.
• Perform quality control on the raw sequencing data using
software such as FastQC.
• Align the clean reads to the reference mitochondrial genome
using alignment tools like BWA, Bowtie, or others.
• Call variants and annotate them using suitable bioinformatics
pipelines (e.g., GATK, VarScan).
• Generate a comprehensive variant report, including mutation
types, positions, predicted impacts, and relevant clinical
correlations.
5.6 Result Review and Verification
• Review the variant report for completeness and accuracy.
• Validate critical findings through secondary analysis or Sanger
sequencing as necessary.
• Document the validated results, including any quality checks,
anomalies, or deviations from expected outcomes.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Implement appropriate quality control measures at each step of
the procedure to ensure data integrity, reproducibility, and
accuracy.
• Document all quality control processes and results appropriately.
• Investigate and resolve any analytical discrepancies and consult
with supervisors if unexpected results are encountered.
• Ensure all deviations are documented and any corrective actions
are implemented promptly.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Generate a final report summarizing the mitochondrial genome
analysis findings.
• Peer-review the report for accuracy and completeness.
• Approve and release the final report to the relevant clinical or
research parties according to laboratory protocols.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all equipment and reagents used in
the process.
• Relevant literature and guidelines for mitochondrial genome
analysis and interpretation.
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• Document control and periodic review maintenance every 12
months.
• authorized by the Laboratory Director / Supervisor.
