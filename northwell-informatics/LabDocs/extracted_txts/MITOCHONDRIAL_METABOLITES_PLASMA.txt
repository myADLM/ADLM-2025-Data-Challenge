Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Mitochondrial Metabolites in Plasma
1. PURPOSE To establish the procedures for the accurate and
reliable measurement of mitochondrial metabolites in plasma
samples. This SOP ensures that the processing and analysis of
plasma specimens adhere to all necessary guidelines and
quality control measures to provide precise results.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures according to this SOP. Supervisors must
ensure that staff are adequately trained and that all procedures are
followed correctly.
1. DEFINITIONS Mitochondrial metabolites include but are not
limited to pyruvate, lactate, citric acid cycle intermediates (e.g.,
citrate, fumarate, malate), and amino acids related to
mitochondrial function (e.g., alanine).
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Plasma obtained from whole blood collected in
lithium heparin or EDTA tubes.
• Preferred Collection Method: Venipuncture into evacuated
blood collection tubes with the appropriate anticoagulant.
• Transport and Storage: Plasma should be separated from cells
within 30 minutes post-collection. Samples should be frozen at
-80°C until analysis. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens received in sodium citrate or sodium fluoride/oxalate
tubes.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or those that
have undergone multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Traceable thermometers for ensuring optimal temperature in
freezers and refrigerators.
• Analytical-grade reagents and solvents for the extraction and
analysis of metabolites.
1. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation:
2. Centrifuge whole blood at 1,500 x g to separate plasma (keep
centrifuge at 4°C).
3. Transfer supernatant (plasma) to a labelled cryovial.
4. Freeze plasma at -80°C until further processing.
B) Extraction of Metabolites:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Add an appropriate volume of extraction solvent (e.g., methanol
or acetonitrile) to each sample.
3. Vortex thoroughly followed by incubation on ice for 10 minutes.
4. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
5. Transfer the supernatant into new tubes and dry under a
nitrogen stream or vacuum concentrator.
C) Analysis:
• HPLC Method:
1. Reconstitute dried extract in a mobile phase solution.
2. Run the sample on an HPLC system with appropriate
column and detector settings.
3. Identify and quantify mitochondrial metabolites using
reference standards and calibration curves.
• GC-MS Method:
1. Derivatize metabolites using a suitable derivatization
reagent.
2. Inject the sample into a GC-MS system.
3. Analyze data using established methods for peak
identification and quantification.
D) Quality Control:
1. Include control plasma samples with known concentrations of
mitochondrial metabolites in each analytical batch.
2. Run blanks to check for contamination.
3. Ensure instrument calibration using reference standards.
4. Document all steps performed including the date, time, initials
of the staff member.
E) Troubleshooting:
1. If a metabolite concentration is outside the expected range,
reanalyze the sample.
2. If instrument malfunction is suspected, perform troubleshooting
according to manufacturer guidelines.
3. If quality control samples fail, halt analysis and verify equipment
functionality.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Review analytical data for accuracy.
6. Export results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. Verify and finalize results ensuring correct patient identification.
8. For critical results, follow laboratory protocol for immediate
reporting and documentation.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Maintain a document containing
the established reference intervals for each mitochondrial
metabolite measured in plasma.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to specific analytical method
inserts or relevant literature for limitations related to the
measurement of mitochondrial metabolites.
11. REFERENCE MATERIALS: Include referenced technical
literature and manufacturer inserts related to the analysis
methods for mitochondrial metabolites.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accuracy,
consistency, and reliability of mitochondrial metabolite measurements
in plasma samples.
