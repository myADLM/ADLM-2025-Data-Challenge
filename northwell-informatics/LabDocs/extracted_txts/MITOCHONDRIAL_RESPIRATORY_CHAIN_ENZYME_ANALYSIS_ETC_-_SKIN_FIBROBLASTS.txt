Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Mitochondrial
Respiratory Chain Enzyme Analysis (ETC) in Skin Fibroblasts
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps for the accurate
analysis and reporting of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme
activities in cultured skin fibroblasts. This includes enzyme extraction,
spectrophotometric assay procedures, data analysis, and quality
control measures.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme analysis according to this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
adherence to these procedures and to address any issues related to
the accuracy of test results.
1. SPECIMEN
• Sample Type: Cultured skin fibroblasts
• Specimen Collection: Skin biopsy, cultured to obtain sufficient
fibroblast cells.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge
◦ Spectrophotometer
◦ Water bath set to 37°C
◦ Liquid nitrogen or -80°C freezer
◦ Homogenizer
◦ Protein assay kit (e.g., BCA or Bradford assay)
◦ CO2 incubator (37°C)
◦ Laminar flow hood
• Reagents:
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Protease inhibitors cocktail
◦ Reagent solutions specific to enzyme activities (NADH,
succinate, CoQ1, ferricyanide, decylubiquinone, etc.)
◦ Protein standards
1. PROCEDURE
A) Cell Harvesting and Preparation:
1. Cell Culturing:
◦ Cultivate skin fibroblasts in the CO2 incubator at 37°C until
confluency is reached.
◦ Ensure cells are healthy and free from contamination.
2. Cell Harvesting:
◦ Wash cells with PBS.
◦ Detach cells using trypsin, followed by neutralization with
culture media containing serum.
◦ Centrifuge cells at 300g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Wash cell pellet with cold PBS. Repeat wash step twice.
◦ Resuspend pellet in PBS with protease inhibitors.
3. Homogenization:
◦ Homogenize cells in a suitable buffer containing protease
inhibitors.
◦ Maintain on ice to prevent enzyme degradation.
◦ Aliquot for enzymatic assays and protein concentration
determination.
◦ Store aliquots at -80°C if not used immediately.
B) Enzyme Activity Assays:
1. Protein Concentration Determination:
◦ Perform protein quantification using an appropriate protein
assay kit.
◦ Use protein standards to generate a calibration curve.
2. Enzyme Activity Assays:
◦ Measure activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain
enzymes (Complex I-IV) using spectrophotometric assays.
◦ Samples should be prepared and evaluated in triplicates to
ensure accuracy.
Enzyme Assay Protocols:
◦ Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase):
▪ Incubate sample and controls with NADH and coenzyme
Q1.
▪ Measure decrease in NADH at 340 nm.
◦ Complex II (Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase):
▪ Incubate sample with succinate and decylubiquinone.
▪ Measure reduction of DCIP at 600 nm.
◦ Complex III (Ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase):
▪ Incubate sample with reduced decylubiquinone and
cytochrome c.
▪ Measure reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm.
◦ Cytochrome c oxidase (COX, Complex IV):
▪ Measure oxidation of reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm.
◦ Adjust enzyme activities to protein concentration and
express results as nmol/min/mg protein.
C) Data Analysis:
1. Calculations:
◦ Normalize enzyme activities to protein concentration.
◦ Calculate mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of
variation (CV) for sample triplicates.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare results to reference ranges.
◦ Identify deviations and potential deficiencies in enzymatic
activities.
D) Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls for each assay.
• Run quality control samples with every batch of tests.
• Document and monitor equipment calibration and maintenance
logs.
• Ensure compliance with external proficiency testing programs.
E) Reporting Results:
• Review and verify results for accuracy.
• Report enzyme activities as values relative to control reference
ranges.
• Document critical findings and notify the ordering physician as per
laboratory policy.

• Detailed assay procedures and reagent preparation as per
manufacturer's kit inserts.
• Relevant literature and guidelines for mitochondrial respiratory
chain enzyme analysis in fibroblasts.
This SOP is subject to periodic review for updates and improvements
to ensure continuous compliance with best practices and regulatory
standards.
