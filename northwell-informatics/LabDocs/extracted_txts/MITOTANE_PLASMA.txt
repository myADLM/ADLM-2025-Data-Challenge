Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MITOTANE in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures and responsibilities for the
analytical phase of generating results for mitotane levels in plasma.
This is to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results, while
adhering to safety and quality control standards in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The responsibility for performing and documenting the analytical
phase of mitotane plasma testing falls on designated laboratory
personnel. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow this
SOP and report any anomalies or issues to supervisory staff.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected using EDTA as anticoagulant. Ideal sample
volume: 3-5 mL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples collected in heparin or citrate tubes.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have been subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
Store samples at -20°C prior to analysis for stability. Transport frozen
and avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS).
• Analytical columns suitable for mitotane detection.
• Mobile phases and solvents: Acetonitrile, Methanol, Water (HPLC
or LC-MS grade).
• Mitotane reference standard.
• Internal standards for quantification.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Analytical balance.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma sample at room temperature.
2. Vortex to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes to clear any particulate
matter.
4. Aliquot 1 mL of plasma into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
B. Extraction:
1. Add 0.5 mL of an internal standard solution (e.g., deuterated
mitotane) to the plasma aliquot.
2. Vortex for 1 minute.
3. Add 2 mL of extraction solvent (e.g., acetonitrile).
4. Vortex for 5 minutes to ensure thorough mixing.
5. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate phases.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a new clean microcentrifuge tube.
7. Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen gas or using a
vacuum concentrator.
C. Reconstitution:
1. Reconstitute the dry residue with 100 µL of mobile phase (e.g.,
50:50 Acetonitrile:Water).
2. Vortex for 1 minute.
3. Transfer to an HPLC/LC-MS/MS compatible vial.
D. HPLC/LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Load the sample vials into the autosampler.
3. Run a standard curve with known concentrations of mitotane
and internal standard.
4. Inject an appropriate volume (typically 10-50 µL) of sample and
standards.
5. Monitor for Mitotane and internal standard using the appropriate
detector settings (e.g., multiple reaction monitoring – MRM for
LC-MS/MS).
E. Data Analysis:
1. Calculate the concentration of mitotane in the plasma samples
using the internal standard method.
2. Ensure that quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) fall within acceptable ranges before accepting
results.
3. Repeat analysis or take corrective action if QC samples are out
of range.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples in each batch alongside patient
samples.
• Maintain and document calibration of instruments.
• Prepare and run standards with each batch to ensure the
accuracy of results.
• Implement corrective actions if any anomalies or deviations are
detected during the QC process.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Report results, ensuring that any anomalies (e.g., hemolyzed
samples) are annotated.
• Comply with site-specific reporting guidelines for critical values
and result confirmation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish reference intervals based on laboratory-validated
studies and published clinical guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are not hemolyzed or subjected to multiple
freeze-thaw cycles.
• Be aware of potential interferences from other drugs or
substances in plasma.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for HPLC/LC-MS/MS instruments.
• Relevant clinical and analytical chemistry literature for mitotane.
This procedure must be followed strictly to ensure reliable and
accurate measurement of mitotane levels in plasma. All deviations or
issues must be reported and documented according to laboratory
policy.
