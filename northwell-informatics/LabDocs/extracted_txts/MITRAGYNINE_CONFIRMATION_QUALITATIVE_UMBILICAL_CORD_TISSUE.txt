1. Purpose
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to outline
the method for qualitative confirmation of Mitragynine in umbilical
cord tissue samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This procedure ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for detecting Mitragynine presence
in the given tissue samples.
1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to adhere
strictly to this protocol, ensuring all steps are performed accurately
and documented accordingly. Supervisors must ensure all staff are
trained and competent in this procedure and any deviations are
appropriately managed and reported.
1. Specimen Requirements
3.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh umbilical cord tissue collected at birth.
• The tissue must be free from any visible contaminants.
3.2. Specimen Handling:
• Once collected, the umbilical cord tissue should be stored at
2-8°C and transported to the laboratory within 24 hours.
• If analysis is not immediate, the specimen should be frozen at
-20°C or lower until testing can be performed.

1. Procedure
5.1. Sample Preparation:
5.1.1. Weigh approximately 2 grams of homogenized umbilical cord
tissue using an analytical balance and add to a clean centrifuge tube.
5.1.2. Add 5 mL of methanol to the tissue sample and homogenize
thoroughly for 60 seconds.
5.1.3. Centrifuge the homogenized sample at 4,000 RPM for 10
minutes.
5.1.4. Collect the supernatant into a new centrifuge tube. Discard the
pellet.
5.1.5. Add 5 mL of Ethyl acetate to the collected supernatant and
vortex for 30 seconds.
5.1.6. Centrifuge again at 4,000 RPM for 10 minutes.
5.1.7. Transfer the clear upper ethyl acetate phase to a new
Eppendorf tube.
5.1.8. Evaporate the ethyl acetate under a nitrogen stream at room
temperature until dryness.
5.1.9. Reconstitute the dried extract with 1 mL of 0.1% formic acid in
water.
5.1.10. Filter the solution using a 0.22 µm filter and transfer to an
autosampler vial.
5.2. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
5.2.1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and ensure the system is calibrated and equilibrated.
5.2.2. Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample extract into the LC-MS/MS.
5.2.3. Use a suitable chromatographic column and set the mobile
phase conditions for optimal resolution of Mitragynine.
5.2.4. Employ the following gradient for chromatography: - Time
(min): 0.0 - 5.0: 95% A (0.1% FA in water)/5% B (0.1% FA in
methanol) - 5.0 - 10.0: gradient to 5% A/95% B - 10.0 - 15.0: 5% A/
95% B - 15.0 - 20.0: gradient back to 95% A/5% B
5.2.5. Monitor the transitions corresponding to Mitragynine in the MS
detector using the following settings: - Positive ion mode - Transition:
m/z 399.2 → 174.1 for Mitragynine
1. Quality Control
6.1. Include Mitragynine standard (positive control) and blank
(negative control) in every run for comparison and ensuring the
system's accuracy.
6.2. Analyze a Quality Control sample (prepared umbilical cord tissue
spiked with a known quantity of Mitragynine) with each batch to verify
the reproducibility and sensitivity of the detection method.
1. Reporting Results
7.1. Positive detection: The presence of Mitragynine is qualitatively
confirmed by comparing sample peaks with the standard’s retention
time and ion transitions.
7.2. Report results as: - Detected (Mitragynine present) - Not
Detected (No Mitragynine present)
7.3. Include remarks about any significant observations or deviations
noticed during the analysis.

• Instrument operation manual from manufacturer.
• Method validation documents and peer-reviewed publications
regarding Mitragynine detection in biological matrices.
1. Method Limitations
The detection is qualitative and will not provide quantitative
information about Mitragynine concentration in the sample. Ensure
specificity through method validation and regular system
maintenance.
This SOP must be reviewed annually and whenever modifications are
necessary to ensure compliance and accuracy.
