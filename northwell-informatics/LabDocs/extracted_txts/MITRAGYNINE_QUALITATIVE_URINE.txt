Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Qualitative Analysis of
Mitragynine in Urine
1. Purpose
This protocol outlines the procedure for the qualitative analysis
of Mitragynine in urine samples received in the laboratory. It
ensures accurate and reliable results while adhering to the
standard operating procedures required for a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
Responsibility:
◦ Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing
the qualitative analysis of Mitragynine in urine samples.
◦ All laboratory personnel must ensure the integrity of the
process and adherence to this SOP to guarantee reliable
results.
2. Specimen Requirements
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ 30 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a clean container
without preservatives.
◦ Sample should arrive at the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 2 hours after
collection.
◦ Specimens lacking proper labeling (missing collection date/
time, patient identification).
◦ Specimens in containers containing preservatives or
additives.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Urine containers
◦ Test tubes
◦ Pipettes
◦ Immunoassay kits (e.g., ELISA)
◦ Reagent strips (if applicable)
◦ Positive and Negative Controls
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Timer
◦ Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result
documentation
◦ Appropriate PPE for laboratory staff
4. Quality Control
Material:
◦ Use both positive and negative controls provided with the
immunoassay kits (or equivalent).
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions for the storage and
handling of all reagents and controls.
Procedure:
◦ Analyze positive and negative control samples daily with
each batch of patient samples.
◦ Record the control results in the designated logbook and
ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
◦ If control results fall outside of acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot using manufacturer's guidelines, and do not
proceed with patient sample analysis until resolved.
5. Procedure
1. Sample Preparation
▪ Once the urine sample is received, verify it against the
provided criteria.
▪ Centrifuge the sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate any particulate matter.
▪ Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube.
2. Assay Preparation
▪ Follow the immunoassay kit's instructions for preparing
reagents and setting up the assay.
▪ Immerse reagent strips in the prepared supernatant or
pipette urine sample into wells if using ELISA kits.
3. Testing
▪ Incubate the assay as per kit instructions, ensuring
accurate adherence to timing and temperature
conditions.
▪ Allow the reaction to complete, monitoring the
development of the test pads/colour changes.
4. Reading Results
▪ After the appropriate incubation period, read the
results using either a visual method (colour
comparison) or according to ELISA reader settings.
▪ Compare the test results to the provided control
results.
5. Documentation
▪ Log the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
▪ Include all relevant information: patient identification,
sample collection date/time, test date, and
technologist’s initials.
6. Reporting Results
◦ Positive Mitragynine detection: Report as "Positive for
Mitragynine" in the LIS.
◦ Negative Mitragynine detection: Report as "Negative for
Mitragynine" in the LIS.
◦ If results are inconclusive or interference is noted:
Document and report as "Indeterminate - Possible
interference."
7. Reference and Method Limitations
◦ Refer to the immunoassay kit insert for specific method
limitations.
◦ Outline potential interferences or specific conditions that
could affect the reliability of the results.
8. References
◦ Immunoassay kit manufacturer’s instructions
◦ Laboratory's Standard Guidelines for Urine Toxicology
Analysis
9. Safety and Compliance
◦ Adhere to all standard laboratory safety protocols, including
wearing PPE, proper disposal of biohazard materials, and
safe handling of reagents and samples.
◦ Ensure compliance with CLIA regulations and reporting
guidelines.
The procedure outlined in this SOP will assist laboratory personnel in
performing accurate and reliable qualitative analysis of Mitragynine in
urine samples, ensuring adherence to standardized guidelines for
laboratory practices.
