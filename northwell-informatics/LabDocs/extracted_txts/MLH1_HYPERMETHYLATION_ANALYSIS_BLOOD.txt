MLH1 Hypermethylation Analysis, Blood - Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To provide clear instructions for the laboratory analysis
of MLH1 hypermethylation from blood specimens, ensuring accurate
and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to perform, monitor, and document all steps of
the MLH1 hypermethylation analysis according to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that the procedure is
followed correctly and to manage any issues that arise during the
process.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen Type:
Whole blood Collection Container: EDTA tube (lavender-top) or
similar anticoagulant tube Specimen Volume: Minimum 5 mL
Transport: Specimens should be kept at room temperature and
transported to the laboratory within 24 hours of collection. Stability:
Specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at 4-8°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (validated for blood specimens)
• Bisulfite conversion kit
• MLH1 methylation-specific PCR (MSP) kit or equivalent
• Thermal cycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV transilluminator or gel documentation system
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Laboratory-grade reagents (e.g., ethanol, isopropanol)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE A) DNA Extraction:
1. Label the collection tubes.
2. Extract DNA from 5 mL of whole blood using the DNA
extraction kit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions
meticulously.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer.
The concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio) should be
evaluated.
4. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for bisulfite
conversion.
B) Bisulfite Conversion:
1. Set up the bisulfite conversion reaction using a bisulfite
conversion kit.
2. Denature the DNA and treat it with sodium bisulfite
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Desulfonate the converted DNA and purify the DNA.
4. Elute the bisulfite-converted DNA in a small volume of
elution buffer (typically 20-50 µL).
5. Store the bisulfite-converted DNA at -20°C until ready for
PCR.
C) Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP):
1. Set up the MSP reaction using primers specific for methylated
and unmethylated MLH1.
2. Prepare the reaction mix: Include DNA template, forward and
reverse primers, dNTPs, buffer, and Taq polymerase.
3. Run MSP in a thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions (example):
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 35 cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
4. Store PCR products at 4°C until ready for analysis.
D) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel in 1X TAE buffer.
2. Load the PCR products and a DNA ladder onto the gel.
3. Run the gel at 100V for approximately 30-45 minutes or until
adequate separation is achieved.
4. Visualize bands using a UV transilluminator or gel
documentation system.
5. Photograph the gel and document the results. Bands at
specific sizes will indicate the presence of methylated or
unmethylated MLH1.
E) Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the band sizes between sample and control
lanes.
2. Verify the presence or absence of methylation by the
presence of PCR products with methylation-specific primers.
3. Document the results and include relevant gel images in the
patient report.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE A) Include positive and
negative controls for each set of reactions to ensure reliable results.
B) Maintain all laboratory equipment according to standard
maintenance procedures to ensure accuracy. C) Perform routine
verification of analysis procedures to ensure the validity and reliability
of results. D) Document all steps, observations, and deviations in the
laboratory logbook. E) Review and verify results by a secondary
laboratory staff member or supervisor before reporting.
7. REPORTING RESULTS A) Results are documented in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). B) The verified results are
reviewed and signed by the laboratory supervisor. C) Results are
communicated to the ordering physician within the expected
turnaround time.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS A) False positives or negatives may occur
due to suboptimal DNA quality or PCR inhibitors. B) Confirmatory
testing or repeat analysis may be necessary in cases of ambiguous
results. C) The assay is optimized for blood specimens; use of other
specimen types may require validation.
9. REFERENCES Include references to any manufacturer's
documents, clinical guidelines, or previous literature that informed the
development of this SOP.
10. APPENDICES Include any relevant forms, charts, or additional
procedural documentation.
This protocol assumes familiarity with standard molecular biology
techniques and omits extensive step-by-step instructions for basic
procedures such as pipetting or gel preparation. Specific equipment
settings, reagent volumes, and temperatures would be detailed
further based on the laboratory's available resources and
manufacturer's instructions.
