SOP: MLH1 Hypermethylation Analysis, Tumor
1. PURPOSE:
To provide standardized procedures for the detection and
interpretation of MLH1 hypermethylation in tumor samples using
methylation-specific PCR (MSP) or equivalent methodology.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure is intended for use in a CLIA-certified laboratory
setting and applies to all tumor samples submitted for MLH1
hypermethylation analysis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
All qualified laboratory personnel trained in molecular diagnostics are
responsible for performing the procedure. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure the procedure is followed accurately
and that results are documented promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
◦ Tissue Type: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tumor tissue is acceptable. Fresh frozen tissue can also be
used.
◦ Quantity: At least two sections of 5-10 microns thick with a
surface area of 25-50 mm².
◦ Storage: It is preferable to store FFPE specimens at room
temperature. Fresh frozen specimens must be stored at
-80°C.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Equipment:
▪ Microtome
▪ Thermal Cycler
▪ PCR workstation
▪ Centrifuge
▪ Vortex mixer
▪ NanoDrop or equivalent spectrophotometer
◦ Reagents:
▪ DNA extraction kit
▪ Bisulfite conversion kit
▪ Methylation-specific PCR reagents
▪ Agarose gel electrophoresis reagents
◦ Supplies:
▪ PCR tubes
▪ Filtered pipette tips
▪ Ethanol
▪ Nuclease-free water
▪ Agarose gel (1-2%)
3. DEFINITIONS:
◦ MLH1: A gene involved in DNA mismatch repair.
◦ Hypermethylation: An increase in methylation of cytosine
residues in the promoter region of a gene, leading to
transcriptional silencing.
◦ MSP: Methylation-Specific PCR, a technique used to detect
DNA methylation.
4. PROCEDURE:
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Deparaffinization of FFPE sections:
◦ Place FFPE sections in a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add 1mL of xylene, vortex briefly.
◦ Centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes.
◦ Discard supernatant and repeat deparaffinization.
◦ Wash twice with 1mL of 100% ethanol, vortexing and
centrifuging between washes.
◦ Air-dry the pellet by leaving the tube open for 5-10 minutes.
2. DNA Isolation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the DNA extraction
kit.
◦ Quantitate extracted DNA using a NanoDrop or equivalent
spectrophotometer.
◦ Store DNA at -20°C until needed.
B) Bisulfite Conversion:
1. Bisulfite Treatment:
◦ Perform bisulfite conversion of 500ng-1µg of genomic DNA
using the bisulfite conversion kit, following the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Use the thermal cycler for the incubation steps as specified
in the kit protocol.
◦ Purify the converted DNA according to the bisulfite kit
instructions.
◦ Elute bisulfite-converted DNA in 20µL of elution buffer and
store at -20°C.
C) Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP):
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix by combining the following for
each reaction:
▪ 12.5µL of 2x PCR master mix
▪ 1µL of forward primer (10µM) for methylated MLH1
▪ 1µL of reverse primer (10µM) for methylated MLH1
▪ 1µL of bisulfite-converted DNA
▪ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25µL
◦ Prepare a separate mix for unmethylated MLH1-specific
primers.
◦ Include positive and negative controls.
2. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension at 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
3. Post-PCR Analysis:
◦ Analyze PCR products on a 2% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide or a DNA-binding dye.
◦ Visualize bands using a UV transilluminator.
◦ Interpret methylation status based on the presence/absence
of specific bands.
D) Result Interpretation:
1. Assessment:
◦ Methylated MLH1: Presence of a 100-200bp PCR product
with methylated primers.
◦ Unmethylated MLH1: Presence of a 100-200bp PCR
product with unmethylated primers.
◦ Control Assessment: Ensure controls show expected
results for the assay to be considered valid.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record gel images, results, and interpretations in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Technician and supervisor must review and sign off on
results.
E) Quality Control:
• Include appropriate controls (positive and negative for
methylation) in each batch of samples.
• Perform QC checks for all reagents and equipment used in the
procedure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
This assay does not have a reference interval as it is a
qualitative analysis.
2. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Results should be reported as either “MLH1 promoter
hypermethylation detected” or “MLH1 promoter
hypermethylation not detected.”
◦ Include a comment on the quality and integrity of the DNA
sample.
