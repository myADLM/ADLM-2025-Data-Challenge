Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for MLH1
HyperMethylation and BRAF Mutation Analysis, Tumor
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the Standard Operating
Procedures (SOP) for the analytical phase of generating results for
MLH1 Hypermethylation and BRAF Mutation Analysis in tumor
samples. This SOP is crucial for accurate identification of genetic and
epigenetic alterations which can guide clinical decision-making and
personalized treatment options.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The authorized laboratory personnel, including technologists,
supervisors, and laboratory directors, are responsible for ensuring
that the MLH1 methylation and BRAF mutation analysis is performed
and documented accurately according to this SOP. Additionally, it is
everyone's responsibility to identify and mitigate any issues that may
affect the quality and accuracy of test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Tissue Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or slides
(unstained sections) are acceptable.
• Sections should be 5-10 microns thick, with a minimum of 5
sections provided.
• Tumor cellularity must be higher than 20% to ensure adequate
DNA yield and quality.
3.2. Storage Requirements:
• Specimens should be stored at room temperature until DNA
extraction.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of DNA samples to maintain
integrity.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE samples.
• Sterile pipettes and tips.
• DNA extraction kit specific for FFPE tissue.
• Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) kit for MLH1 Methylation
analysis.
• Real-Time PCR system.
• BRAF mutation detection kit (RT-qPCR or sequencing-based).
• Ethanol, sterile water, and other routine laboratory reagents.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
5. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
5.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Microdissection:
◦ Review H&E stained slide with pathologist to demarcate
tumor area.
◦ Microdissect corresponding unstained sections to enrich for
tumor cells.
2. DNA Isolation:
◦ Use a commercial DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Evaluate DNA quantity and quality using a NanoDrop/
TapeStation/Qubit.
5.2 MLH1 Hypermethylation Analysis:
1. Bisulfite Conversion:
◦ Convert unmethylated cytosines to uracil using a bisulfite
conversion kit.
◦ Purify bisulfite-converted DNA.
2. Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP):
◦ Set up the MSP reaction using primers specific for
methylated and unmethylated MLH1 regions.
◦ Include appropriate controls (positive methylation control,
negative control).
◦ Amplify the target regions using a thermal cycler.
3. Detection and Analysis:
◦ Analyze PCR products by gel electrophoresis or use a Real-
Time PCR system.
◦ Interpret the presence or absence of bands/signals to
determine MLH1 methylation status.
5.3 BRAF Mutation Analysis:
1. PCR Amplification:
◦ Amplify the region of interest (e.g., BRAF exon 15) using
specific primers.
◦ Include positive and negative controls.
2. Mutation Detection:
◦ Perform Sanger sequencing, real-time PCR-based
detection, or another validated mutation detection method.
◦ Analyze mutation status (e.g., presence of BRAF V600E
mutation).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Control Samples:
• Use known positive and negative controls for both MLH1
methylation and BRAF mutation analyses.
• Ensure all controls are within the expected ranges before
accepting results.
6.2 Internal Standards:
• Include internal standards specific to the DNA extraction, bisulfite
conversion, and amplification steps.
6.3 Review and Documentation:
• Document all control and sample results in a laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Analyze quality control data for consistent performance and
troubleshoot any issues.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Data Review:
• Review and validate all results by a qualified technologist and a
laboratory director or supervisor.
• Annotate any issues with sample integrity or assay performance.
7.2 Interpretation:
• Report MLH1 methylation status as methylated or unmethylated.
• Report BRAF mutation status (e.g., wild-type or mutated, with
specific mutation identified if present).
7.3 Documentation:
• Ensure all results, including raw data, QC data, and final reports,
are stored in the laboratory’s LIS.
• Maintain confidentiality and secure access to all patient-related
data.
