Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): MLH1
Immunostain - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedures for
performing the technical component of MLH1 immunostain in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. The immunostain is used to detect the expression
of MLH1 protein in tissue specimens. This procedure ensures
adherence to quality standards, reproducibility, and accurate
generation of technical results.
Responsibility:
All histology technologists are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP for the preparation, staining, and
documentation of results for MLH1 immunostain. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the implementation of procedures,
addressing any deviations from protocol, and ensuring proper
maintenance of equipment.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or slides.
• Unstained sections on positively charged slides.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are not properly fixed.
• Tissue sections that are improperly processed or damaged.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Automated IHC stainer (e.g., BenchMark Ultra, Ventana Medical
Systems)
• MLH1 primary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., UltraView Universal DAB Detection Kit)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Xylene, ethanol, and other routine histology reagents
• Forceps, microscope slides, coverslips
• Traceable thermometer/hygrometer
4. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Ensure FFPE tissue blocks are properly stored and are in good
condition.
2. Cut 4-5 micron sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome and affix them onto positively charged slides.
3. Dry sections overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
Staining Process:
1. Load dried slides into the automated IHC stainer.
2. Select the appropriate MLH1 immunostain protocol on the
stainer and ensure the MLH1 primary antibody is in place.
3. Automate the staining process involving deparaffinization,
antigen retrieval, application of MLH1 primary antibody, and
detection using the UltraView Universal DAB Detection Kit.
4. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin.
Post-Staining:
1. Remove slides from the stainer and rinse in distilled water.
2. Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
3. Mount slides with coverslips using an appropriate mounting
medium.
Quality Control:
1. Include known positive and negative control tissues in each
staining run to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
staining.
2. Verify equipment calibration according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and document any adjustments.
Troubleshooting:
1. If staining deviation is observed (e.g., non-specific binding,
weak staining, or no staining), perform the following actions: i.
Verify antigen retrieval procedure. ii. Check antibody dilution
and expiration date. iii. Inspect detection system components
and hematoxylin counterstain. iv. Re-run the process using
fresh reagents and control tissues if errors persist.
2. Document all corrective measures taken.
5. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all specimen information, including patient ID, date of
receipt, and block number.
• Maintain a detailed log reflecting slide preparation, staining start
and end times, equipment settings, reagent batches, and
technologist’s initials.
• Review and date-stamp all quality control data for each
immunostain batch.
6. RESULT REVIEW AND REPORTING:
• Visualize the stained slides under a microscope to ensure target
staining pattern and intensity.
• Technical component only: Provide unstained sections to
pathologist for interpretation.
• Report any technical issues encountered during staining to the
supervisor and document them appropriately.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer product inserts for MLH1 antibodies and detection
kit.
• Internal Quality Control manuals specific to the automated IHC
stainer used.
• CLIA guidelines and site-specific protocols for histology and
immunohistochemistry.
NOTE:
Regular review of this SOP should be performed to ensure
compliance with updated guidelines and procedures. Any revisions
must be documented and disseminated to all relevant personnel.
