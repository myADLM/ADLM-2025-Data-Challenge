Standard Operating Procedure
MOC-31 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the technical component of
generating results for MOC-31 immunostain.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel who are
trained and certified in immunohistochemistry techniques and who
handle the technical component of the MOC-31 immunostain
procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document the analytical phase of the MOC-31 immunostain
procedure as outlined below. Supervisory staff must ensure
compliance with the SOP and address any issues that may arise
during the analytical process.
4. DEFINITIONS:
MOC-31: A monoclonal antibody used in immunohistochemistry to
detect the presence of epithelial cells in tissues.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Slide warmer
◦ Immunostainer (e.g., Ventana, Leica Bond)
◦ Light microscope
◦ Timer
• Reagents:
◦ MOC-31 antibody solution
◦ Appropriate diluent (as specified by manufacturer)
◦ Blocking buffer
◦ Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated or another suitable
substrate)
◦ DAB or another chromogen substrate
◦ Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
◦ Mounting media
• Supplies:
◦ Slides
◦ Coverslips
◦ Adhesives for slide preparation
◦ Deionized water
◦ Buffer solutions (PBS or equivalent)
◦ Positive and negative control tissues
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Using a microtome, cut paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into
4-5µm sections.
◦ Place tissue sections onto positively charged slides to
ensure proper adhesion.
2. Drying:
◦ Air dry slides at room temperature for approximately 20-30
minutes.
◦ Place slides on a slide warmer set to 37°C for an additional
30 minutes to ensure proper adherence of the tissue to the
slide.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Heat slides at 60°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Immerse slides sequentially in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes
each) to remove paraffin.
2. Rehydration:
◦ Hydrate slides through decreasing alcohol concentrations:
▪ 100% ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each)
▪ 95% ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each)
▪ 70% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes)
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Preheat retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0) in a water
bath or microwave oven.
◦ Immerse slides in retrieval buffer and heat for 20 minutes at
95°C.
2. Cool Down:
◦ Allow slides to cool in the buffer to room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or another suitable buffer for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking:
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking buffer (e.g., 10% normal serum in PBS) to
slides to prevent non-specific binding.
◦ Incubate for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Tap off excess blocking buffer.
E. Primary Antibody Application:
1. MOC-31 Antibody:
◦ Apply MOC-31 antibody diluted in appropriate diluent (as
recommended by the manufacturer) to tissue sections.
◦ Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 60
minutes or overnight at 4°C.
F. Secondary Antibody Application:
1. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody solution to
slides.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes (3 changes).
G. Detection:
1. Chromogen Application:
◦ Apply DAB or another chromogen substrate to slides.
◦ Incubate until desired color intensity is achieved (usually
5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water to stop the reaction.
H. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin solution for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water.
◦ Dip in bluing reagent to enhance staining.
2. Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through increasing concentrations of alcohol and
xylene.
◦ Apply mounting media and coverslip.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Control Tissues:
◦ Include positive and negative control tissues within each
batch of staining.
◦ Ensure controls are treated in the same manner as patient
specimens.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all staining procedures, including reagent lot
numbers, incubation times, and control results, in a
dedicated logbook.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review slides under a light microscope.
• Document the presence and intensity of staining.
• Report technical findings to the pathologist responsible for
diagnostic interpretation.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Negative Staining:
◦ Ensure antibody specificity and revalidate the antigen retrieval
procedure.
• Non-specific Staining:
◦ Optimize blocking buffer concentration and incubation times.
