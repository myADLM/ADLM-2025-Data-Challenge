Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for MOLD BLOOD CULTURE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable analytical results for mold blood
culture processing in the laboratory following the established
procedures to identify any mold infection in the bloodstream.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated and trained laboratory personnel are responsible for the
implementation of this protocol, including the preparation, processing,
incubation, and result generation of mold blood cultures. Personnel
must adhere to the documentation and reporting guidelines outlined
in this procedure.
3. DEFINITIONS
Mold Blood Culture: Blood cultures designed to detect the presence
of mold organisms in a blood sample.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Biological safety cabinet (BSC)
• Incubators (30-35°C)
• Blood culture bottles
• Media: Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, BHI Agar with Blood, and
Mycobiotic Agar
• Microscope and slides
• Sterile gauze and alcohol wipes
• Incubation monitoring system (e.g., Bactec, BacT/ALERT)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
• Obtain and label all blood culture bottles upon receipt according
to laboratory accessioning procedures.
• Ensure that blood samples have been appropriately collected,
mixed with blood culture media, and are free from any
contamination.
B. Media Inoculation
• Under a BSC, inoculate the blood sample into appropriate culture
bottles/media.
• Split the sample across multiple media types if necessary
(aerobic, anaerobic, and specific mold media).
C. Incubation
• Place inoculated culture bottles into the secure incubator
designated for mold cultures.
• Set incubator at 30-35°C, optimal temperature for the growth of
molds.
• Incubate culture bottles and plates for a minimum of 14 days.
D. Inspection and Monitoring
• Visually inspect culture bottles and plates daily (using appropriate
PPE and procedures) for signs of growth such as turbidity, gas
production, or fungal structures.
• Utilize an automated incubation monitoring system to track and
record growth activity.
E. Sub-culturing for Identification
• If growth is observed, perform a sterile setup in a BSC:
1. Subculture the growth onto Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, BHI
Agar with Blood, or other relevant media.
2. Incubate the subcultures at 25-30°C for an additional 7
days.
• Examine subcultures under the microscope at regular intervals.
F. Identification
• Use aseptic techniques to prepare slides and observe under
microscopy.
• Assess morphological characteristics of mold such as hyphae,
conidia, and sporangia.
• Further identify using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other
molecular methods if available.
G. Documentation and Reporting
• Document all observations, including date, time, and initials of the
personnel performing each step.
• Record results in Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify identified mold species against clinical correlations and any
necessary patient information.
• Report results to the attending physician or relevant healthcare
provider as per laboratory reporting guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use quality control strains of known mold species bi-annually to
ensure all equipment and media are functioning correctly.
• Internal control subcultures must demonstrate growth whenever
patient specimens show growth.
• Record and analyze any deviations or failures in growth control
batches according to the laboratory quality assurance policies.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all standard lab safety protocols and use appropriate PPE.
• All aerosol-generating procedures (processing of positive
cultures) must be performed in a BSC.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to local regulations.
