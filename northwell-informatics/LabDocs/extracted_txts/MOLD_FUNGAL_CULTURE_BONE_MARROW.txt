Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MOLD (FUNGAL)
CULTURE, BONE MARROW
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the isolation,
identification, and reporting of mold (fungal) cultures from bone
marrow specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY The laboratory personnel are responsible for
the proper handling, processing, and reporting of mold cultures. The
designated microbiology staff will perform the culture, identification,
and sensitivity tests as needed.
3. SCOPE This procedure applies to all bone marrow specimens
received for fungal culture in the laboratory.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Laminar flow hood (optional)
• Incubator
• Sterile Petri dishes
• Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) with antibiotics
• Sabouraud Dextrose Agar without antibiotics
• Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) Agar
• Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)
• Sterile forceps, scissors, and scalpel
• Sterile saline
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Lactophenol cotton blue stain
• Fungal identification kits (if available)
• Antifungal susceptibility testing kits (if needed)
• Microscope and slides
• Centrifuge
• Culture tubes
• Sterile containers for handling bone marrow specimens
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected bone marrow specimen submitted in a sterile,
leak-proof container. Ideally transported within 30 minutes to the
laboratory.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens not collected in sterile containers.
• Specimens leaking or contaminated.
• Specimens that have not been stored or transported under
appropriate conditions.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling and Processing:
1. Upon receipt of the bone marrow specimen, ensure proper
labelling with the patient's information, collection date, and time.
2. Perform a visual inspection for any signs of contamination or
leakage. Reject and request a repeat sample if unacceptable.
3. In a biosafety cabinet, aliquot the specimen into appropriate
sterile containers for culture.
B. Inoculation:
1. Solid Media: a. Using a sterile pipette, transfer a small amount
(0.5 – 1 mL) of the specimen onto the surface of the SDA (with
and without antibiotics), BHI agar, and PDA. b. Gently spread
the inoculum over the surface of the media using a sterile loop
or swab. c. Label Petri dishes accurately with patient
information, date, and type of media used.
2. Liquid Media: a. For liquid cultures, inoculate tubes containing
BHI broth with a small volume (0.5 – 1 mL) of the bone marrow
specimen using a sterile pipette. b. Label the tubes accurately
with patient information, date, and type of media used.
C. Incubation:
1. Place inoculated media in an incubator set to 25-30°C for mold
cultures.
2. Cultures will be monitored daily for up to 4 weeks, as some
fungi may be slow-growing.
3. Inspect plates daily for fungal growth, contamination, and the
appearance of characteristic colonies.
D. Identification:
1. Perform macroscopic examination of fungal colonies,
documenting colony morphology (color, texture, topography,
and growth rate).
2. For microscopic examination, prepare a slide with a lactophenol
cotton blue stain from a representative colony.
3. Observe under the microscope to identify characteristic fungal
structures (e.g., hyphae, conidia).
4. If necessary, use commercial identification systems or
molecular methods to confirm the fungal species.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Record all observations and findings including the type of
fungus detected, growth characteristics, and time to detection.
2. If antifungal susceptibility testing is performed, include the
results in the report.
3. Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
and notify the designated healthcare provider, especially if
clinically significant fungi are detected.
4. Provide interpretive comments if applicable, including potential
implications for therapy and infection control procedures.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Use positive and negative controls for culture media to ensure
proper growth and sterility.
2. Perform periodic reviews of procedures and environmental
monitoring to ensure compliance with biosafety and infection
control policies.
3. Maintain all quality control records and calibration logs for
review during audits.
8. SAFETY:
1. All personnel must wear appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coats, and face shields
when handling bone marrow specimens and cultures.
2. Follow biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) protocols for handling potential
pathogenic fungi.
3. Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to institutional
policies.

used.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION:
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required by changes in
protocols or regulations. Any revisions will be documented and
implemented following approval by the laboratory supervisor.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent, accurate,
and efficient processing and reporting of mold (fungal) cultures from
bone marrow specimens.
