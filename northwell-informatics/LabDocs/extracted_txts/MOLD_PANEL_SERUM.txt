Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MOLD PANEL, SERUM
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To ensure consistent and reliable analysis of serum samples for the
presence and quantity of mold-specific antibodies in a CLIA-certified
laboratory setting.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel responsible for the analytical phase
of MOLD PANEL, SERUM testing using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or any machinery designated for the
test in our laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory scientists and technicians are responsible
for adhering to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff
are trained and comply with this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
• MLDXXXX: Catalog number for Mold Panel kit
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours or at -20°C or lower for
long-term storage
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples;
samples that have been subject to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA reader and washer
• Pipettes and tips (various volumes)
• Incubator (set to 37°C)
• Mold Panel kit (MLDXXXX), including:
◦ Coated microtiter wells
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Negative, positive, and calibrator controls
• Reagent-grade water
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation a. Bring all reagents and samples to room
temperature before starting the assay. b. Label necessary
microtiter plate wells according to the plate layout: blanks,
controls, calibrators, and serum samples.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition a. Add 100 μL of controls,
calibrators, and serum samples to the designated wells. b.
Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing a. Wash the microtiter wells 5 times with 300 μL of the
provided wash buffer per well. b. Let the plate rest on absorbent
paper to remove excess buffer.
4. Conjugate Addition a. Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to
each well. b. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Second Washing a. Wash the microtiter wells 5 times with 300
μL of the provided wash buffer per well. b. Let the plate rest on
absorbent paper to remove excess buffer.
6. Substrate Addition a. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each
well. b. Incubate for 15-30 minutes at room temperature or until
the approximate optical density (OD) of the positive control
reaches 1.0.
7. Stopping the Reaction a. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each
well. b. Gently tap the plate to ensure adequate mixing.
8. Reading the Plate a. Read the plate at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution. b. Record
the OD values for each well.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Each assay must include negative, positive, and calibrator
controls.
• If controls are out of their acceptable range, recalibrate the
instrument and repeat the assay.
• Record and review QC results in accordance with laboratory
policy.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Generate a standard curve from the calibrator results using
appropriate software.
• Calculate the concentration of mold-specific antibodies in the
serum samples based on the standard curve.
• Verify results according to laboratory standards and ensure all QC
parameters are met.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). If any
critical values are identified, notify the attending physician
immediately per laboratory protocol.
10. MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on the ELISA reader and washer as
per manufacturer instructions.
• Document all maintenance and any troubleshooting activities in
the instrument logbook.
