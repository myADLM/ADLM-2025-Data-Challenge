Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Molecular
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for molecular
interpretation, ensuring the accurate and reliable analysis of
molecular test results in accordance with established guidelines and
industry standards. The goal is to provide consistent and competent
molecular diagnostic services that support patient care.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
molecular interpretation of test results after receiving a specimen that
has been collected, received, and accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of designated molecular analysts and
pathologists to perform molecular interpretation.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for reviewing and
validating the accuracy of final reported results.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Sequencers (e.g. Sanger Sequencer, Next-Generation
Sequencers (NGS))
• PCR instruments
• Gel electrophoresis systems
• Bioinformatics software
• Reagents, including primers, probes, and buffers suitable for the
analysis being performed
• Standard laboratory supplies
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimens must be labeled correctly and meet the acceptance
criteria for molecular testing. Ensure that the sample integrity is
not compromised during transport and handling.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Check
• Verify the specimen identity matches the accompanying
documentation using at least two patient identifiers.
• Confirm that the sample type and quantity meet specific molecular
test requirements.
• Ensure the specimens are stored and processed under required
conditions to prevent degradation.
B. Assay Setup and Execution
• Prepare reagents and controls according to the protocol
associated with the specific molecular test being performed.
• Follow standard molecular protocols for DNA/RNA extraction,
amplification (e.g. PCR), and purification if applicable.
• Perform sequencing or other molecular analyses according to the
detailed assay protocol.
C. Data Analysis and Validation
• Upload raw data files into the bioinformatics software for initial
interpretation.
• Apply quality control (QC) measures to ensure data integrity;
evaluate QC indicators such as signal strength, peak shape, and
noise levels.
• Annotate sequences and compare findings against reference
databases and known variant databases (e.g. ClinVar, COSMIC).
D. Molecular Interpretation
• Assess the analytical validity of detected variants with a focus on
sensitivity, specificity, precision, and reproducibility.
• Use standardized nomenclature for variant reporting (e.g., Human
Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature).
• Determine the clinical significance of identified variants (e.g.,
pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, likely benign, or VUS -
variant of uncertain significance). Consider additional factors such
as population frequency, literature evidence, and relevant
functional data.
• Correlate findings with patient clinical data if available to predict
potential phenotypic implications.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Document all steps taken from sample preparation to final
analysis.
• Run negative and positive controls alongside patient samples to
ensure procedure accuracy.
• Participate in external quality assessments (EQA) and proficiency
testing.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile findings into a comprehensive report including patient ID,
test performed, detected variants, interpretative comments, and
clinical recommendations if applicable.
• Review and validate the final report by a senior molecular
pathologist or designated expert.
• Ensure that the final report is electronically or physically signed
and dated before release.
• Report critical findings according to institutional protocol and
ensure timely communication with the healthcare provider.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference intervals will depend on the specific test and
population studied.
• Molecular analyses have inherent limitations such as potential
contaminants or PCR dropout. Annotation of any limitations
should be included in the final report.
10. SAFETY AND REFERENCING
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow
biosafety protocols.
• Reference relevant literature, guidelines, and inserts used (e.g.,
ACMG guidelines for variant interpretation).
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain detailed logs of sample receipt, test execution, data
analysis, and report generation.
• Store all records, including raw data, analysis results, reports, and
QC logs in a secure, organized, and retrievable format in
compliance with CLIA regulations and institutional policies.
