Standard Operating Procedure: Molybdenum, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to describe the process for the
quantitative analysis of molybdenum in serum to ensure accurate and
reliable test results. This SOP will cover the instrumentation setup,
calibration, quality control, and result reporting.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to operate
the ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) or AA
(Atomic Absorption) instrument for the detection of molybdenum in
serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing molybdenum analysis must
adhere to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this procedure. All deviations must be properly
documented and reported to the laboratory director.
1. PRINCIPLE
The determination of molybdenum in serum is performed using ICP-
MS or AA, with serum specimens prepared and analyzed according
to the standardized protocol to maintain accuracy and precision.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection: Blood should be drawn into a trace element-free
Royal Blue-top tube. Serum is separated by centrifugation within
2 hours of collection.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic
samples are unacceptable. Also, specimens collected in non-trace
element-free tubes.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Calibration standards (traceable to NIST)
• Quality control materials (commercially available serum controls)
• Nitric acid (ultrapure)
• Deionized water (resistivity ≥18.2 MΩ·cm)
• Calibration blanks
• ICP-MS or AA instrument-specific consumables
1. EQUIPMENT SETUP AND MAINTENANCE
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for ICP-MS or AA setup and
daily maintenance.
• Perform a routine system check and calibration of the instrument
as per manufacturer instructions.
• Ensure that all consumables (e.g., cones, nebulizers, sample
introduction systems) are clean and functional.
1. CALIBRATION
• Internal Standards: Use an internal standard such as Rh or In
(as appropriate) to correct for matrix effects and instrument drift.
• Calibration Curve: Prepare a multi-point calibration curve (at
least 5 standards covering the range expected in patient
samples). Run calibration standards at the beginning of each
batch.
• Quality Control: Run quality control materials at the beginning
and end of each run and after every 10 patient samples or as per
regulatory requirements.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen specimens and mix thoroughly.
• Pipette 0.5 mL of serum into a clean, labeled digestion tube.
• Add 2 mL of ultrapure nitric acid to the serum sample.
• Heat the mixture in a digestion block at 95°C for 1 hour or until the
sample is fully digested.
• Cool the digested sample and dilute to 10 mL with deionized
water.
• Filter the prepared sample to remove any particulate matter.
Instrumental Analysis:
• Load standards, quality controls, and prepared patient samples
into autosampler.
• Initiate the analytical run, following the instrument-specific
protocol for molybdenum measurement.
• Verify that the internal standard recovery is within acceptable
limits (typically 80-120%).
• Ensure calibration curve correlation coefficient (r) is ≥0.995.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
• QC Material: Analyze two levels of control materials with each
batch. Results must be within the established acceptable ranges.
• Acceptance Criteria: If QC results are outside the acceptable
range, do not report patient results until the issue is resolved. Re-
calibrate and repeat the analysis if necessary.
• Proficiency Testing: Participate in external PT programs for
trace elements if available.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Range: 0.3 – 1.0 ng/mL (or as determined by
laboratory validation).
• Critical Values: Any results significantly above the reference
range should be verified, and the responsible physician should be
notified immediately.
• Documentation: Record all QC, calibration, and patient results in
the LIS (Laboratory Information System). Any anomalies or
deviations from the SOP should be documented.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If calibration fails, prepare new standards and confirm the integrity
of the reagents.
• Verify system performance using a diagnostic test if the
instrument exhibits abnormal behavior.
• Follow the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide and, if
necessary, seek technical support.
