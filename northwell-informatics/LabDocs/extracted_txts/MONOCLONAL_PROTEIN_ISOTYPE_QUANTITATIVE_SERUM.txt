Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase
MONOCLONAL PROTEIN ISOTYPE, QUANTITATIVE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the accurate and precise
quantification of monoclonal protein isotypes (M-proteins) in serum
samples, ensuring the reliability of results and compliance with all
relevant regulations.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and to document all steps and results
appropriately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a gold-top (SST) or red-top tube.
• Minimum volume of 2 mL.
• Serum samples should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Samples are stable for 5 days at 2-8°C and for 24 hours at room
temperature. For long-term storage, samples must be frozen at
-20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have been stored at inappropriate temperatures or
for an inappropriate duration.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) or Capillary zone
electrophoresis (CZE) system.
• Electrophoresis gel or capillary cartridges, reagents, and running
buffers.
• Calibration standards and quality control materials.
• Pipettes and pipette tips, calibrated and maintained.
• Centrifuge.
• Incubator.
• Documentation logbooks or LIS with appropriate access.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Initial Handling:
1. Ensure the serum samples are at room temperature before
processing.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
residual cells.
3. Aliquot the required volume (e.g., 50 µL) for testing into
appropriately labeled tubes.
B) Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE) or Capillary Zone
Electrophoresis (CZE):
1. Set up the electrophoresis system as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Load the sample and apply it to the gel or capillary cartridge.
3. Select and run the appropriate program for M-protein isotyping/
quantification.
4. After the run, remove the gel and process with specific
antibodies for the detection of the M-protein isotype: IgG, IgA,
IgM, kappa (κ), and lambda (λ).
5. Develop the immunofixation or capillary electrophoresis profiles
per the manufacturer guidance to visualize the protein bands.
C) Quantification:
1. Scan and analyze the profiles using the dedicated software.
2. Compare the peak areas to a standard calibration curve
established with known concentrations of monoclonal proteins.
3. Document the results, ensuring all calculations follow the
manufacturer’s specified guidelines within the analytical range.
D) Quality Control and Validation:
1. Run appropriate quality control samples (low, medium, high)
with each batch of patient samples.
2. Document QC results in a QC logbook or LIS.
3. Accept or reject patient results based on QC outcome
according to predefined criteria.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. All results are entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review by the laboratory technologist.
2. Ensure that critical values are reviewed, verified, and
communicated to the ordering clinician promptly.
3. Document any discrepancies and corrective actions taken.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for monoclonal proteins are method-
dependent and should be established in-line with the
manufacturer’s recommendations and confirmed with a significant
sample size representative of the normal population.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results may be affected by hemolysis, lipemia, or presence of
other paraproteins.
• Samples must be free from contamination and processed within
the recommended stability period.
8. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Follow all biosafety guidelines and use personal protective
equipment (PPE) appropriately.
• Dispose of all waste according to biohazard disposal guidelines.

Note: Ensure all laboratory staff are trained on this protocol and
demonstrate proficiency before processing patient samples
independently. Document training and competency assessments as
required by regulatory standards.
