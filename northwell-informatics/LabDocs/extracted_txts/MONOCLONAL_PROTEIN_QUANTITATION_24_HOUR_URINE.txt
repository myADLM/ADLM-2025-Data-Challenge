Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Monoclonal Protein
Quantitation, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To define the analytical procedure for quantifying monoclonal proteins
in 24-hour urine samples to ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff responsible for the analysis of 24-
hour urine samples for the quantitation of monoclonal proteins within
the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following
this procedure accurately.
• Supervisory staff are responsible for overseeing the process,
providing training, and ensuring adherence to the procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type of Specimen: 24-hour urine collection in a clean, leak-proof
container.
• Volume: Ideally, the total collected volume should be noted.
• Storage: Refrigerate specimens during and after collection; store
at 2-8°C until analysis.
• Labeling: Ensure the sample is properly labeled with patient
information, date, and time of collection start and end.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Equipment:
◦ Electrophoresis system
◦ Densitometer
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Measuring cylinders
◦ Pipettes
◦ Analytical balance
• Reagents:
◦ Buffer solutions for electrophoresis
◦ Protein staining solutions
◦ Destaining solutions
◦ Tris-Boric-EDTA (TBE) or equivalent buffer
◦ Polyacrylamide gel or cellulose acetate membrane
• Materials:
◦ Electrophoresis plates or membranes
◦ Calibration standards for quantitation
◦ Control materials
◦ Laboratory logbooks
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Validate that the urine specimen meets the collection and
storage criteria.
2. Record the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection.
3. Mix the sample thoroughly prior to analysis using gentle
inversion.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Aliquot an appropriate volume (e.g., 1-2 mL) of the urine
sample.
2. Dilute the aliquot if necessary using distilled water or buffer as
detailed in specific assay instructions.
3. Load the sample onto the electrophoresis medium alongside
calibration standards.
C. Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare the electrophoresis apparatus by following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the samples, calibration standards, and controls onto the
gel or membrane.
3. Apply the voltage as per the standard method until protein
bands are satisfactorily separated (typically 1-2 hours).
4. Stain the gel or membrane to visualize the proteins.
5. Destain if necessary to enhance the clarity of the protein bands.
D. Densitometry:
1. After staining and destaining, scan the gel or membrane using
a densitometer.
2. Ensure the instrument is calibrated with the appropriate
standards.
3. Quantify the monoclonal protein by integrating the area under
the relevant peaks on the densitogram.
E. Calculation:
1. Compare the densitometry readings of the patient sample with
those of the calibration standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of monoclonal proteins in the
patient sample using the standard curve generated from the
calibration standards.
3. Adjust for the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection to get
the final result.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run controls with each batch of patient samples to ensure
assay validity.
2. Verify that control results fall within the established range.
3. Document all control results in the laboratory logbook.
4. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot the procedure and
repeat analysis.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the calculated concentration of monoclonal proteins in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a technologist
before being sent to the clinician.
3. Follow site-specific guidelines for the identification and
verification of critical results.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
2. Recognize that improper sample collection or storage may
affect the accuracy of results.
3. Avoid using degraded or improperly preserved samples.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Follow all standard laboratory safety protocols including the use
of personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Handle biological specimens as per the guidelines for
potentially infectious material.
11. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer’s instructions for electrophoresis and
densitometry equipment.
2. Relevant clinical laboratory standard guidelines for protein
electrophoresis analysis (e.g., CLSI).
12. DOCUMENT CONTROL
1. Document all steps of the procedure and deviations.
2. Store records as per the regulatory requirements.
