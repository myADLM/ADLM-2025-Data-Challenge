Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Monoclonal Protein
Quantitation, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a clear and concise protocol for the quantitative analysis
of monoclonal protein in random urine specimens, ensuring accurate
and reproducible results in compliance with Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to
adhere to this procedure and provide accurate and reliable results.
Supervisors are responsible for training new staff and ensuring strict
adherence to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/acceptable:
• A minimum of 50 mL of a random urine sample collected in a
clean, dry container.
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if not tested immediately and
must be analyzed within 72 hours of collection to ensure stability.
Unacceptable:
• Samples received in dirty or contaminated containers.
• Specimens with visible debris or particulate matter.
• Urine samples that have been stored at room temperature for
more than 2 hours.
• Urine samples collected in preservatives that could interfere with
the analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Spectrophotometer or electrophoresis analyzer
• Urine protein assay kit/reagents
• Test tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Calibration standards
• Control samples
• Gloves, lab coat, and other appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents and equipment are calibrated and
validated before use.
2. Remove the urine specimen from refrigeration and bring it to
room temperature.
3. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by inverting or vortexing.
B) Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Pipette an aliquot of the supernatant into a clean test tube.
C) Calibration and Quality Control (QC):
1. Prepare calibration standards and control samples according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run calibration standards to create a calibration curve for
quantitation.
3. Analyze quality control samples to ensure assay accuracy and
precision. Results should fall within the specified control ranges
before proceeding with patient samples.
D) Analysis:
1. Follow the urine protein assay kit instructions to determine the
concentration of monoclonal proteins in the urine sample. This
may involve electrophoresis for separation followed by
densitometry/spectrophotometry: a) Load urine samples,
calibration standards, and control samples onto the
electrophoresis apparatus for separation. b) Run the
electrophoresis according to the manufacturer’s protocol. c)
Stain and destain the gel as required. d) Analyze the gel using
a densitometer or similar equipment to quantify the monoclonal
protein bands.
2. Record the concentration results obtained from the analysis.
3. RESULTS REPORTING:
4. Verify the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
according to site-specific guidelines.
5. Ensure that all quality control results are within acceptable
limits before reporting patient results.
6. Report results in the LIS, and ensure all necessary
documentation, including data from QC samples and
calibrators, is complete.
7. Include any relevant comments concerning the integrity of the
sample, the method used, or any interferences noted.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
(Reference intervals depend on equipment, assay, and patient
population and must be validated)
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
Regularly run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
monitor assay performance. Maintain a log of all calibration and QC
results to track the consistency and reliability of the assay over time.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
Routine Maintenance:
• Perform regular maintenance on the spectrophotometer or
electrophoresis analyzer according to manufacturer guidelines.
Troubleshooting:
• If calibration or QC results are out of range, recalibrate the
instrument and re-run samples.
• Check for clots or particulate matter in samples if results are
inconsistent.
• Record all troubleshooting actions and any deviations from the
normal procedure.

kit, calibration standards, and quality control materials. Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocols and guidelines for
urine protein analysis.
1. NOTES:
• Follow all safety protocols for handling biological specimens and
use appropriate PPE.
• Ensure proper disposal of all biohazardous materials.
By following this protocol, accurate and reliable quantitation of
monoclonal proteins in random urine specimens will be achieved,
enhancing the quality and consistency of laboratory test results.
