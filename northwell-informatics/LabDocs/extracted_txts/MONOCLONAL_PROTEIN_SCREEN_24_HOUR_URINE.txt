Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Monoclonal Protein Screen,
24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing and
generating results for Monoclonal Protein Screen using a 24-hour
urine sample. This will ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability in
testing.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for conducting the analysis,
documenting results, and performing any necessary maintenance or
calibration of the equipment. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this SOP and addressing any issue that
may arise during the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen: - 24-hour urine collection - Each collected
urine sample should be labeled with the patient’s information,
collection start and end time, and date.
Unacceptable Specimen: - Samples without complete patient
identification. - Samples not collected over a full 24-hour period. -
Contaminated samples.
Specimen Stability: - Refrigerate the collected urine during the
collection period. - Maintain refrigerated during transport to the
laboratory. - Upon receipt, samples should be processed within 24
hours or stored at 2-8 °C for up to 72 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Electrophoresis system
• Graduated cylinders
• Disposable pipettes
• Protein assay reagents (e.g., Bradford reagent, BCA reagent)
• Agarose gel
• Buffer systems (e.g., Tris, borate, EDTA)
• Staining solutions
• Destaining solutions
• Safety equipment (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify that the urine collection is correctly labelled and meets
the acceptance criteria.
2. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
3. Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
collection using a graduated cylinder.
4. Aliquot 10-15 mL of the well-mixed urine into a disposable
specimen cup for analysis.
Protein Assay:
1. Perform a total protein assay on the 24-hour urine sample: a.
Pipette 100 µL of urine sample into test tubes in duplicate. b.
Add the appropriate volume of protein assay reagent according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. c. Incubate the mixture for
the specified time as per the reagent manufacturer. d. Measure
the absorbance using a spectrophotometer set to the
appropriate wavelength. e. Use a standard curve to determine
the protein concentration in the urine sample.
Electrophoresis:
1. Dilute the urine sample to an appropriate concentration suitable
for electrophoresis: a. Typically, a dilution of 1:5 to 1:10 is
acceptable.
2. Load a predetermined volume of diluted urine sample into wells
of the agarose gel.
3. Prepare and load protein standards and controls into adjacent
wells.
4. Run electrophoresis at the recommended voltage and time
settings.
5. Once electrophoresis is complete, remove the gel and proceed
to staining.
Staining and Destaining:
1. Stain the gel using an appropriate staining solution (e.g.,
Coomassie Blue or Silver Stain).
2. Incubate the gel for the required time as per staining protocol.
3. Wash the gel with destaining solution until the background is
clear and bands are visible.
4. Document the results by scanning or photographing the stained
gel.
Interpretation:
1. Compare the patient's electrophoresis gel results to normal
reference patterns to identify any abnormal monoclonal protein
bands.
2. Quantify the identified protein bands using densitometry and
calculate the protein concentration.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control samples in each
electrophoresis run.
• Run quality control materials with known concentrations of protein
standards.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing and validation according to
laboratory protocols.
Instrument Maintenance:
• Maintain and calibrate electrophoresis equipment regularly.
• Document all maintenance and calibration activities in the
appropriate logbooks.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Document the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection.
3. Report the presence or absence of monoclonal proteins, along
with the concentration.
4. Reference intervals for 24-hour urine protein excretion should
be included in the report.
5. Review and verify all results before releasing them.
6. Critical values or abnormal findings should be promptly
reported to the requesting physician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper mixing and dilution of the sample to avoid
inconsistencies in results.
• Contamination and improper storage of the sample can impact
the accuracy of the results.
• Electrophoresis sensitivity might be limited for detecting low
concentrations of monoclonal proteins.
