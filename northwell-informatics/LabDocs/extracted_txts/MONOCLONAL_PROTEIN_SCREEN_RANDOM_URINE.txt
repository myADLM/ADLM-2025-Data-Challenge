STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
MONOCLONAL PROTEIN SCREEN, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for performing a monoclonal
protein screen (Bence Jones Protein Test) on a random urine
specimen.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
Monoclonal Protein Screen, Random, Urine according to this SOP.
Supervisors should ensure compliance with the procedure, resolve
any issues that arise during testing, and validate the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Random urine specimen collected in a sterile container.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure the specimen is free of contaminants and avoid prolonged
contact with the atmosphere to prevent evaporation and
contamination.
• Store specimen at 2-8°C if testing is delayed; ensure it is at room
temperature before testing.
Note: Specimens should be tested within 72 hours of collection. If
delayed beyond this, consultation with a supervisor is required.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Urine centrifuge
• Electrophoresis chamber
• Densitometer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C storage)
Reagents:
• Electrophoresis reagents (Agarose gels, Stains, Buffer solutions)
• Immunofixation reagents (Antisera)
• Distilled water
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips
• Sterile urine collection containers
• Test tubes
• Timer
• Gloves
• Lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
Urine Preparation:
1. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1000 – 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a new test tube,
avoiding the sediment.
Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare the agarose gel according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Load the urine supernatant and apply control specimens to the
gel.
3. Run the electrophoresis chamber under the prescribed voltage
and duration.
4. Stain the gel with the protein stain and de-stain as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
5. Visualize the gel under appropriate lighting to identify the
presence of distinct protein bands.
Immunofixation:
1. Apply the antisera to the designated sections of the gel to
expose different immunoglobulin classes (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgM, κ,
λ).
2. Follow the standard immunofixation process as per
manufacturer's recommendation.
3. Wash and stain the gel to visualize protein bands specific to
antibodies.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Examine the stained gel and identify the monoclonal protein
bands.
• Use the densitometer to check discrepancies in bands indicating
monoclonal sources.
• Compare with control (positive and negative) to ensure accuracy.
• If unclear, repeat procedures as necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use controls (known positive and known negative samples) with
each test run.
• Record controls and patient results in the designated log.
• Any discrepancies in controls should be noted and resolved
before patient results are released.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Results interpreted as positive or negative based on clear visibility
of monoclonal protein band.
• If positive, follow-up testing may be required.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure accurate sample preparation to avoid cell lysis, which can
contaminate results.
• Degraded samples can lead to false negatives.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Value: No detectable monoclonal protein bands
• Positive Indication: Presence of distinct monoclonal protein bands
indicates a positive result and requires further investigation.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the use of electrophoresis and
immunofixation materials.
• Clinical guidelines on monoclonal protein screening.
By adhering to this procedure, laboratory staff will ensure accurate
and reliable testing for the presence of monoclonal proteins in urine
specimens.
