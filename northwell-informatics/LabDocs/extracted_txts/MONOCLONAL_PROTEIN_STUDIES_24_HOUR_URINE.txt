Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase -
Monoclonal Protein Studies, 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis of 24-hour urine
samples for monoclonal protein studies, ensuring consistent,
accurate, and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
protocol precisely. It is also the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
adherence to the procedure and to address any deviations or issues
that arise during analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Specimen Type: - 24-hour urine collection.
B. Specimen Handling: - Refrigerate the urine specimen during and
after the collection period to prevent degradation. - Ensure that the
specimen is clearly labeled with the patient’s full name, date of birth
or unique identifier, and the date and time collection began and
ended.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- Centrifuge
- Volumetric Flask
- Urine containers
- Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Measuring cylinders
- Spectrophotometer or Capillary/Cellulose Acetate Electrophoresis Equipment
- Protein assay kits and reagents
5. REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS
- Acetic acid or TCA (trichloroacetic acid) for precipitation
- Dye-binding agents or commercial protein assay reagents
- Buffer solutions
- Distilled water
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Receiving and Accessioning:
◦ Confirm that the 24-hour urine container is labeled correctly
and that the collection was completed as required.
◦ Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
specimen.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Mix the urine collection thoroughly to ensure uniformity.
◦ Transfer a 10-20 mL aliquot of the well-mixed 24-hour urine
into a clean, labeled container for analysis.
B. Pre-Analytical Processing:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine aliquot at 1500-2000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
2. Precipitation of Total Protein:
◦ Add 1 volume of 3% acetic acid or TCA to 4 volumes of the
supernatant and mix thoroughly.
◦ Allow to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to
precipitate proteins.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 1500-2000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the
pellet.
C. Protein Quantification:
1. Rehydrate the Protein Pellet:
◦ Add an appropriate volume of distilled water to the pellet
and mix gently to dissolve the precipitated protein.
2. Quantitative Assay:
◦ Perform the protein assay using a spectrophotometer or kit-
based method.
◦ Prepare a standard curve using known concentrations of a
protein standard (e.g., bovine serum albumin).
3. Measurement:
◦ Measure the absorbance of the unknown sample and
protein standards at the specified wavelength.
◦ Calculate the protein concentration using the standard
curve.
D. Detection of Monoclonal Proteins:
1. Electrophoresis:
◦ Subject the rehydrated protein sample to capillary or
cellulose acetate electrophoresis as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Stain the gel with an appropriate protein stain and de-stain
until background is clear.
◦ Visualize and document the protein bands using
densitometry or scanner.
2. Immunofixation (if required):
◦ Apply the electrophoresed sample to an immunofixation
plate.
◦ Incubate with specific antisera against immunoglobulin
heavy and light chains.
◦ Wash and stain to visualize the immunoglobulin pattern.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Include known control samples with each batch of patient
specimens to ensure assay accuracy and precision.
◦ Review and document control results. If controls are out of
acceptable range, investigate and resolve before
proceeding with patient samples.
2. Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Verify the calibration and maintenance status of the
spectrophotometer or electrophoresis equipment.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Enter all test results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) with appropriate units and reference intervals.
◦ Include any relevant comments or interpretations.
2. Final Review:
◦ Review results for any unusual findings or discrepancies.
◦ Results must be verified and authorized by a senior
technologist or supervisor before release.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific method insert for any limitations inherent to the
protein assay kit or electrophoresis equipment used.
10. REFERENCES
Provide reference to manufacturer instructions, published guidelines,
and procedural manuals used for the described methods.
11. VERSION CONTROL AND REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed,
ensuring compliance with current best practices and regulatory
standards.
