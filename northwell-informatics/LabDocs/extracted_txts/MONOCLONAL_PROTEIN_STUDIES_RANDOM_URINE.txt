Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Monoclonal
Protein Studies, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear and detailed instructions for the analysis of
monoclonal proteins in random urine specimens to ensure accuracy,
reliability, and consistency of results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of generating results for
monoclonal protein studies on random urine samples in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory staff performing monoclonal protein studies on urine
samples are responsible for following this SOP to ensure compliance
with the laboratory's quality standards. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for overseeing the implementation and adherence to this
protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 50-100 mL of random urine in a sterile
container.
• Storage: Store urine specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed.
Specimens must be analyzed within 72 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with significant hematuria.
◦ Specimens older than 72 hours.
◦ Specimens without proper labeling or patient identification.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) system
• Urine protein electrophoresis (UPE) system
• Calibrated pipettes
• Polyacrylamide or agarose gels
• Staining and destaining solutions
• Buffers and reagents for protein detection
• Quality control materials
• Appropriate laboratory logbooks and documentation forms
6. PROCEDURE
A. Urine Protein Preparation
1. Specimen Verification:
◦ Verify that the urine specimen is properly labeled with the
patient's information and complies with the specimen
requirements.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine specimen at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
3. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute the supernatant with an appropriate buffer if
necessary, based on the concentration of proteins.
B. Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPE)
1. Gel Preparation:
◦ Prepare the polyacrylamide or agarose gel according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Application:
◦ Apply the urine sample onto the designated wells on the gel.
Use the same volume for all samples to ensure consistency.
3. Electrophoresis:
◦ Perform protein electrophoresis under standardized
conditions (voltage, time, buffer systems).
4. Staining:
◦ Stain the gel with a protein-specific stain according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
5. Destaining:
◦ Destain the gel to visualize the protein bands clearly.
C. Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE)
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Prepare the urine specimen as described in section A.
2. Gel Preparation:
◦ Prepare an immunofixation gel according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Sample Application:
◦ Apply the sample onto designated wells alongside specific
antisera (IgG, IgA, IgM, kappa, and lambda).
4. Electrophoresis:
◦ Perform electrophoresis under standardized conditions
(voltage, time, buffer systems).
5. Immunofixation:
◦ Apply antisera to corresponding wells on the gel post-
electrophoresis.
6. Staining and Destaining:
◦ Stain and destain the gel to visualize immunofixation
patterns.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Review:
◦ Examine the electrophoretic gels and immunofixation results
for distinct monoclonal protein bands or patterns.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings, including the presence, type, and
concentration of monoclonal proteins, in the patient’s
logbook and laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that control samples are run and reviewed to verify
assay performance.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
tests.
• Document control sample results in the quality control logbook.
• Review control results to validate test runs and initiate corrective
measures if controls fall outside acceptable ranges.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment following
manufacturer guidelines and laboratory protocols.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and release results to the LIS.
• If discrepancies or unusual patterns are observed, repeat the
analysis or consult with a supervisor.
• Ensure proper documentation of all steps, results, and any
troubleshooting performed.
