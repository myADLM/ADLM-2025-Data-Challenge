Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Monoclonal Protein Study, Quantitative,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
monoclonal proteins (MP) in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring proper training,
adherence to this SOP, and addressing any deviations or issues.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST), centrifuged
within 2 hours of collection.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
or heparin).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) system
• Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE) system (if required for
confirmation)
• Spectrophotometer
• Reagents: Agarose gel, antisera to monoclonal proteins (IgG, IgA,
IgM, κ, λ), buffer solutions, staining and destaining solutions.
• Supplies: Applicator, pipettes, gel electrophoresis chamber, drying
apparatus, scanner or camera for gel imaging, standard
calibration materials.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare buffers and reagents for electrophoresis and
staining according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Ensure antisera are correctly stored and thawed to room
temperature before use if frozen.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge SST tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and
carefully collect the serum.
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C until analysis, for no more than 7
days. If delayed beyond 7 days, freeze at -20°C.
B) Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPE)
1. Gel Preparation:
◦ Place an agarose gel on the electrophoresis chamber plate.
◦ Apply 2 µL of each serum sample and control to the
designated wells on the gel using an applicator.
2. Electrophoresis:
◦ Conduct electrophoresis at the appropriate voltage
(60-100V) until the dye front reaches the desired distance
(typically 5-8 cm).
3. Staining:
◦ Remove the gel from the chamber and immerse in staining
solution for the recommended time.
◦ De-stain the gel to visualize protein bands clearly.
4. Scanning and Interpretation:
◦ Dry the gel and scan or photograph it using the designated
imaging system.
◦ Analyze the pattern of serum proteins to identify any
monoclonal bands.
C) Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE) - if indicated
1. Application of Antisera:
◦ Apply specific antisera to separate lanes to identify the type
of monoclonal protein.
◦ Follow the same electrophoresis steps as in SPE but with
the addition of antisera.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Examine the gel for immunoprecipitation bands
corresponding to specific monoclonal proteins.
D) Quantification
1. Densitometry:
◦ Use densitometry to quantify the monoclonal protein bands
in comparison to a calibration curve.
◦ Record the concentration of the monoclonal protein in the
serum.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control using normal, abnormal, and high-level
controls with each batch of samples.
• Include calibration standards to ensure the accuracy of
quantitation.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review
and verification.
• Document results, any abnormalities, and quality control data.
• Immediate notification of critical values or significant findings to
the requesting healthcare provider.
8. REFERENCES
• Refer to manufacturer instructions for all reagents and equipment
used.
• Laboratory established reference ranges and guidelines for serum
protein electrophoresis and immunofixation.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain accurate records of all steps, including sample details,
reagent lot numbers, control results, and any deviations.
• Ensure all logs, charts, and electronic records are kept up to date
and stored securely.
By following these steps, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
reliable quantification of monoclonal proteins in serum samples.
