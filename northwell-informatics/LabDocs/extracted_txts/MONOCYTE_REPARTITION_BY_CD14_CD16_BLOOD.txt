Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Monocyte Repartition
by CD14/CD16, Blood
1. Purpose
This SOP describes the procedure for the analysis of monocyte
repartition in blood by CD14/CD16 dual staining using flow cytometry.
This will ensure consistency, reliability, and accuracy in the analysis
of monocyte subpopulations.
2. Scope
This procedure is applicable to the analytical phase of monocyte
repartition testing performed in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory.
3. Definitions
• Monocyte Repartition: Differentiation of monocytes into
classical, intermediate, and non-classical subpopulations using
CD14 and CD16 markers.
• CD14: Cluster of Differentiation 14, a marker for classical
monocytes.
• CD16: Cluster of Differentiation 16, a marker for intermediate and
non-classical monocytes.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA
anticoagulant tubes.
• Specimen Volume: A minimum of 3 mL is required.
• Stability: Blood samples must be processed within 24 hours of
collection.
5. Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies
• Anti-CD14 FITC Conjugated Antibody
• Anti-CD16 PE Conjugated Antibody
• Lysing Solution
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Flow Cytometry Tubes
• Flow Cytometer
• Fluorescence Compensation Beads for Calibration
• Pipettes and Tips
• Vortex Mixer
6. Quality Control
• Use fluorescence compensation beads to calibrate the flow
cytometer before starting the analysis.
• Analyze control samples with known monocyte repartition to
ensure assay accuracy.
• Perform internal quality control with each batch of patient
samples.
7. Procedure
Specimen Preparation
1. Sample Labeling: Properly label all flow cytometry tubes with
the patient identifier and date of analysis.
2. Aliquoting: Aliquot 100 μL of well-mixed, fresh peripheral blood
into each labeled flow cytometry tube.
Staining Procedure
1. Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 5 μL of anti-CD14 FITC conjugated antibody.
◦ Add 5 μL of anti-CD16 PE conjugated antibody.
2. Mixing: Vortex the tubes gently to mix the blood and
antibodies.
3. Incubation: Incubate the tubes in the dark at room temperature
(20-25°C) for 15 minutes.
Erythrocyte Lysis
1. Lysis: Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube and vortex
gently.
2. Incubation: Incubate for an additional 10 minutes in the dark at
room temperature.
Washing Procedure
1. Washing: Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes at room
temperature. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without
disturbing the cell pellet.
2. Resuspension: Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL PBS and
centrifuge again at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
3. Final Resuspension: Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend
the final pellet in 300 μL PBS.
Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Flow Cytometer Setup: Adjust the flow cytometer settings and
compensation using fluorescence compensation beads.
2. Sample Acquisition: Acquire at least 10,000 monocyte events
per sample using the flow cytometer.
3. Gating Strategy:
• Create a forward scatter (FSC)/side scatter (SSC) gate to isolate
the monocyte population.
• Use a dot plot of CD14 vs. CD16 to differentiate and gate the
monocyte subpopulations:
◦ Classical Monocytes: CD14++/CD16-
◦ Intermediate Monocytes: CD14++/CD16+
◦ Non-Classical Monocytes: CD14+/CD16++
8. Reporting Results
1. Data Analysis: Analyze the data using flow cytometry analysis
software to determine the percentage of each monocyte
subpopulation.
2. Result Verification: Review and verify the results. Ensure that
control samples fall within established target ranges before
accepting patient sample results.
3. Documentation: Document the results and quality control data
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
4. Reporting: Report the monocyte repartition results in
percentage to the ordering physician.
9. Reference Intervals
• Classical Monocytes: 80-95%
• Intermediate Monocytes: 2-8%
• Non-Classical Monocytes: 2-11%
10. Method Limitations
• Ensure that samples are processed within the specified time
frame to avoid degradation.
• Proper handling of antibodies and reagents is essential to prevent
non-specific binding.
• Interference may occur due to high levels of debris or artifacts in
the sample.
