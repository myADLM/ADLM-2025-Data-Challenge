Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Morphine Confirmation, Serum
1. Purpose: This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of a
serum sample to confirm the presence of morphine. The
protocol ensures the accuracy, precision, and reliability of the
test results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform and document all steps of the procedure
accurately and to ensure the chain of custody for the samples is
maintained.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Serum sample collection tubes
• Morphine standards and calibrators
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated morphine)
• Sample preparation materials (centrifuge, pipettes, solvent
system, extraction columns or solid phase extraction (SPE)
cartridges)
• Clean glassware or polypropylene tubes
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for data recording and
reporting
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred Specimen: 4 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube
without any anticoagulants.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours refrigerated
at 2-8°C. For long-term storage beyond 48 hours, specimens
must be frozen at ≤ -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
as they can interfere with the analysis.
1. Procedure:
A. Preparation for Analysis:
1. Verify that all necessary equipment is properly calibrated, and
the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system is in good working condition.
2. Prepare the standard and calibrator solutions as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare the quality control materials (positive and negative
controls).
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature if applicable.
2. Vortex the samples to ensure homogeneity.
3. Add a known volume of internal standard (e.g., deuterated
morphine) to each sample, calibrator, and control.
4. Perform protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, or solid-
phase extraction (SPE) using appropriate solvents and SPE
cartridges.
5. Dry the extracted sample under a stream of nitrogen and
reconstitute in an appropriate solvent for injection into the GC-
MS or LC-MS/MS system.
C. Instrumental Analysis:
1. Inject the reconstituted samples, calibrators, and controls into
the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system.
2. Follow the instrument’s operation manual for setting parameters
such as column temperature, flow rate, and ion source settings.
3. Include a blank injection (solvent only) to ensure no carryover
between samples.
4. Monitor the retention time and specific ion transitions for
morphine and internal standard.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Acquire and process the chromatographic data using the
appropriate software.
2. Compare the sample data to the calibration curve to quantify
the concentration of morphine in the sample.
3. Validate the data by ensuring the quality control samples fall
within the acceptable range.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Record the quantified morphine concentrations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify all results, ensuring compliance with
established acceptance criteria (e.g., LLOQ and ULOQ).
3. Report confirmed positive results as “Morphine detected, X ng/
mL” and negative results as “Morphine not detected.”
F. Quality Control:
• Analyze positive and negative quality control materials with each
batch of samples.
• Document any deviations or issues during the analysis and notify
the supervisor or quality assurance officer.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of all analytical
instruments as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
1. Troubleshooting:
• If there is no signal or abnormal results, check instrument
calibration, sample preparation steps, and cleanliness of the
equipment.
• Reanalyze quality control samples to ensure that the system is
functioning correctly.
• Consult the instrument manual or technical support if persistent
issues occur.

control materials

This standard operating procedure ensures the reliable and accurate
confirmation of morphine in serum samples, contributing to effective
patient diagnosis and management.
