Title: Protocol for Analytical Phase of Morphologic Examination,
Blood
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the morphologic
examination of peripheral blood smears to ensure accurate
assessment of hematologic disorders and the integrity of test results.
Responsibility:
All qualified laboratory personnel, including medical laboratory
scientists and hematopathologists, are responsible for performing
and documenting the morphologic examination of blood smears
according to this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Morphologic examination: The process of analyzing the physical and
structural characteristics of blood cells under a microscope to
diagnose hematologic conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope equipped with oil immersion lens (100x)
• Glass slides
• Wright-Giemsa stain or other appropriate staining reagents
• Immersion oil
• Laboratory requisition forms
• Labeling materials (pens, markers)
• Slide racks or holder
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Blood Smears
1. Label a glass slide with the patient identification information
using a labeling pen.
2. Place a small drop of well-mixed anticoagulated blood
(preferably EDTA) approximately 1 cm from the end of the slide.
3. Using a spreader slide, hold it at a 30 to 45-degree angle and
draw it back to contact the drop of blood, allowing the blood to
spread along its edge.
4. Quickly and smoothly push the spreader slide forward to create
a thin smear. The smear should cover about two-thirds to three-
quarters of the slide.
5. Allow the smear to air dry completely.
B. Staining Blood Smears
1. Place the air-dried smear on a slide rack.
2. Flood the slide with Wright-Giemsa stain for a suitable duration
(typically 1-3 minutes).
3. Add an equal volume of buffer or distilled water to the stain on
the slide and mix gently by swirling.
4. Allow the mixture to remain on the slide for an additional 3-5
minutes.
5. Rinse the slide gently with buffered water or distilled water to
remove excess stain.
6. Stand the slide on its edge to air dry.
C. Microscopic Examination
1. Place a drop of immersion oil on the stained smear.
2. Focus the slide under low-power objective lens (10x) to locate
the optimal examination area, the feathered edge, and the
monolayer region.
3. Switch to high-power objective lens (40x) for initial scanning.
4. Perform a detailed examination under oil immersion (100x)
objective by systematically scanning at least 10 fields in the
monolayer region.
D. Morphologic Assessment
1. Evaluate the following parameters: a. Red Blood Cells (RBCs):
Assess size, shape, color, central pallor, and inclusions. b.
White Blood Cells (WBCs): Assess differential count, nuclear
shape, cytoplasmic characteristics, granulation, and
abnormalities. c. Platelets: Assess number, size, granularity,
and clumping.
2. Document all abnormal findings, such as poikilocytosis,
anisocytosis, polychromasia, presence of nucleated RBCs,
abnormal WBC morphology, and platelet irregularities.
3. Record results on the laboratory requisition form or directly in
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
E. Quality Control
1. Ensure all slides are labeled accurately and legibly.
2. Evaluate control specimens alongside patient specimens to
validate staining quality and microscopic evaluation
consistency.
3. Perform routine calibration and maintenance of microscopy
equipment according to manufacturer instructions.
F. Reporting Results
1. Enter the morphologic findings and differential count into the
LIS.
2. Review and verify all results before releasing.
3. If critical abnormalities are noted, immediately notify the
designated healthcare provider according to laboratory
protocol.
G. Documentation
1. Maintain all records and documentation related to the
preparation, staining, and evaluation of blood smears.
2. Ensure all quality control measures, including control results
and instrument maintenance, are documented.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to established normal reference intervals for RBCs, WBCs, and
Platelets.

morphologic examinations of blood smears in a clinical laboratory
setting. All laboratory personnel must be trained and competent in
these procedures to maintain the highest quality of patient care.
