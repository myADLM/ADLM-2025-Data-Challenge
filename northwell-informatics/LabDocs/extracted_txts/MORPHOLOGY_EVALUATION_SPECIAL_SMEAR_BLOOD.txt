Standard Operating Procedure for Morphology Evaluation (Special
Smear). Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process and guidelines for the preparation, staining,
and microscopic evaluation of special blood smears for morphology
analysis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to ensure that all
steps are performed accurately and efficiently, and that the results
are reported promptly and accurately. All laboratory personnel must
comply with established procedures and safety guidelines during the
process.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the evaluation of blood smears for
morphology analysis, including preparation, staining, examination,
and reporting of findings.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Peripheral blood Anticoagulant: EDTA (lavender-top)
tube Volume: Minimum 1 mL Specimen Stability: Smears should be
prepared and stained within 2 hours of collection. If a delay is
anticipated, specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and smears should
be prepared as soon as possible.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Capillary tubes
• Diff-Quik Stain Kit or equivalent Giemsa stain
• Applicator sticks
• Microscope
• Immersion oil
• Wright–Giemsa stain or equivalent staining solution
• Timer
• Pipettes
• Laboratory coat, gloves, and other PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Blood Smear
1. Label the microscope slide with patient identification
information.
2. Mix the blood specimen gently to ensure even distribution of
cells.
3. Using a capillary tube or pipette, place a small drop of blood
(approximately 2-3 mm in diameter) at one end of the slide.
4. Use another clean slide held at a 30-45-degree angle to spread
the drop of blood. Allow the spreader slide to touch the drop
and as soon as the drop spreads along the edge of the
spreader slide, push the spreader slide forward to create a thin,
even smear.
5. Allow the smear to air dry completely.
B. Staining of Blood Smear
1. Prepare the stain solution according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Dip the air-dried slide into the fixative solution for the specified
time.
3. Rinse the slide gently with distilled water.
4. Dip the slide into the staining solution for the specified time.
5. Rinse the slide gently with distilled water.
6. Dip the slide into the buffer solution for the specified time.
7. Rinse the slide gently with distilled water.
8. Allow the slide to air dry completely in an upright position.
C. Microscopic Evaluation
1. Place a small drop of immersion oil on the stained smear.
2. Examine the slide under a microscope using the 100x oil
immersion objective.
3. Evaluate the overall quality of the smear (distribution of cells,
staining quality).
4. Perform a systematic examination of the smear, assessing the
morphology of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
5. Note and record any abnormalities, including:
◦ Anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, polychromasia in red blood
cells.
◦ Atypical or immature white blood cells.
◦ Platelet clumping or abnormalities.
6. Correlate findings with patient demographics and clinical
history.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
8. Validate stains with known positive and negative controls on
each new batch prepared or received.
9. Document all quality control checks and maintain records.
10. If quality control results are outside of acceptable limits,
troubleshoot, and repeat the evaluation procedures as
necessary. Notify the supervisor if issues persist.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
12. Record all observations in the laboratory information system
(LIS) or appropriate reporting form.
13. Ensure that all findings are documented clearly and concisely.
14. Include interpretative comments if necessary.
15. Review and validate results by a qualified laboratory
technologist or pathologist.
16. Report any critical findings to the appropriate clinical personnel
immediately following established laboratory protocols.

21. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
22. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
23. Handle all specimens, chemicals, reagents, and stains as
potentially infectious and hazardous.
24. Dispose of waste according to laboratory safety guidelines.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff ensures reliable morphology
evaluation of special blood smears, enabling accurate diagnostics
and timely patient management.
