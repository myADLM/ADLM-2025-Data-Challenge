Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Determination of Mosquito
Species-specific IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE This procedure describes the analysis of mosquito
species-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples using a
standardized immunoassay platform. This test aids in the diagnosis
of mosquito allergy and helps guide clinical management of allergic
patients.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel who are trained on the
specific immunoassay and are familiar with the protocol are
responsible for the analysis, recording, and verification of results.
2. DEFINITION Mosquito species-specific IgE: Immunoglobulin E
antibodies that are specific to proteins found in the saliva of various
mosquito species.
3. PROCEDURE Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL of serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Plasma specimens, hemolyzed samples, or
samples received in sodium citrate, EDTA, or sodium fluoride/
oxalate tubes.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Calibrators
• Controls
• Mosquito species-specific IgE reagent kit
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator
• Washing buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Microplates or cartridges designed for the specific immunoassay
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum tubes to clot at room temperature for at least
30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Aliquot the serum and store at 2-8°C until testing. If not used
within 48 hours, store at -20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Prepare the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Pipette serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
designated wells on the microplate or cartridges.
◦ Add the mosquito species-specific IgE reagents to each well
and incubate at the specified temperature for the time
interval as per the kit instructions.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells to remove unbound components using the
washing buffer. Repeat washing as indicated in the kit
instructions.
4. Detection:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time interval.
◦ Add the stop solution to halt the reaction.
5. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Insert the microplate or cartridges into the analyzer to read
the optical density (OD) or fluorescence units.
◦ Compare the sample results to the calibrators and controls.
Calculate the IgE concentrations using the analyzer
software.
◦ Verify the results through automated system checks and
manual review.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal controls with known IgE levels with each batch
of samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
◦ Record control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
limits before reporting patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
Results should be reported in IU/mL (International Units per milliliter).
Abnormal or critical findings should be flagged according to the
laboratory’s protocol.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative (<0.10 IU/mL)
• Borderline (0.10 - 0.34 IU/mL)
• Positive (>0.35 IU/mL)
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the immunoassay reagent kit
insert for specific method limitations, including possible cross-
reactivity and interference.
