Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for MOTH, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for the tests: MOTH, IGE, SERUM. The purpose is
to ensure accuracy and consistency in results derived from patient
serum samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing tests according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all
staff to report any issues affecting test results to the supervisor
immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader (photometer)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Wash solutions
• Microplates
• Incubator
• Positive and Negative controls
• Quality Control materials
• Specific kits for MOTH, IGE, and SERUM analysis
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Serum Specimen: - Preferred: Freshly collected, non-hemolyzed
serum. - Storage: If not analyzed immediately, serum samples can be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at
-20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples. -
Specimens collected in wrong anticoagulants.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation: 1. Centrifuge blood samples at 1500-2000 x
g for 10-15 minutes to separate serum. 2. Aliquot the clear serum into
appropriately labeled tubes. 3. Store the serum at recommended
conditions until analysis.
B. Assay Procedure for MOTH, IGE, and SERUM: 1. Ensure all
reagents are at room temperature before use. 2. Label microplate
wells for controls, standards, and patient samples. 3. Pipette
specified volumes of standards, controls, and patient samples into
the designated wells following kit manufacturer's instructions. 4. Add
assay-specific reagents to the wells according to the kit protocol. 5.
Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration as per
the manufacturer's recommendation (e.g., 37°C for 60 minutes in a
humidified chamber). 6. Wash the wells using the appropriate wash
solution, and repeat the wash steps as specified. 7. Add substrate
solution and incubate for the time recommended. 8. Stop the reaction
by adding stop solution, if applicable. 9. Measure the absorbance at
the appropriate wavelength using the microplate reader.
C. Interpretation of Results: 1. Analyze the data from the microplate
reader. 2. Compare sample absorbance to standards to calculate
concentrations using the software or manual method recommended
by the kit manufacturer. 3. Verify the results against control values to
ensure assay performance is acceptable.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay to
validate the results.
◦ Follow manufacturer's guidelines for the acceptable range
for controls.
◦ Document Quality Control results in the QC log.
◦ If controls fall outside the acceptable range, identify and
rectify the issue before reporting patient results.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Carefully review the calculated results for each patient.
◦ Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for reporting.
◦ Ensure that all critical values are reported immediately to
the clinician as per laboratory protocol.
3. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
◦ Maintain and calibrate all instruments (e.g., centrifuge,
microplate reader) regularly as per manufacturer guidelines
and document in the maintenance log.
◦ Ensure all pipettes used for testing are calibrated quarterly
or as per lab policy.
4. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for MOTH, IGE, and SERUM
test kits.
◦ CLIA guidelines and standards for laboratory testing.
5. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all findings, including controls and patient results,
documenting any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
◦ This SOP must be reviewed biannually, or whenever
significant procedure revisions occur.

This protocol ensures that the samples are processed efficiently,
accurately, and within the standards required to provide reliable
patient results. Staff compliance with these procedures helps
maintain high-quality laboratory outcomes.
