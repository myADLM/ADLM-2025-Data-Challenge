Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MOTOR NEUROPATHY
PANEL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for the Motor Neuropathy Panel. This panel
includes assays for detecting antibodies and other markers that are
associated with various forms of motor neuropathy, including but not
limited to anti-GM1, anti-GD1a, anti-GD1b, and anti-GQ1b
antibodies.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel (e.g., medical technologists,
scientific officers) are responsible for performing the assays,
interpreting the data, and documenting the results. The laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol and addressing any issues that arise during the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Serum or plasma samples
◦ Minimum volume of 2 mL
◦ Samples should be centrifuged and separated within 2
hours of collection to ensure stability.
Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for
more than 2 hours
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA reader and associated software
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
◦ ELISA kits specific to GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GQ1b
antibodies (e.g., from validated manufacturers)
◦ Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution
◦ Positive and negative controls
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
• Calibrate the ELISA reader and washer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Label all microplates clearly with the identifier and well positions
for each sample, control, and calibrator.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation and Addition:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of each standard, control, and sample into
the designated wells.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate as specified in the kit
instructions (typically 1 hour at room temperature).
2. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate according to the kit's recommended
method (usually 3-5 cycles with wash buffer).
3. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate as specified (typically 1 hour at
room temperature).
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Wash the plate according to the kit's instructions.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for the recommended time
(typically 15-30 minutes).
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Read the optical density (OD) using an ELISA reader at the
wavelength specified by the kit (commonly 450 nm).
C) Data Analysis:
• Generate a standard curve from the calibrator results.
• Calculate the concentrations of antibodies in the samples based
on the standard curve.
• Ensure all results fall within the assay's linear range. Any outliers
should be re-tested if necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with every batch of
assays to ensure valid results.
◦ Participate in external quality assurance programs as
available.
◦ Any deviations from expected results should be documented
and investigated.
2. REPORTING RESULTS:
Results should be recorded in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and reviewed by a qualified technologist. Record the following
details:
• Concentration of each antibody detected
• Interpretation of results (e.g., positive, negative, indeterminate)
• Any anomalies or deviations encountered during the assay
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ The reference ranges for each antibody type should be
determined based on validated clinical data. Ensure these
reference intervals are updated regularly.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit inserts for limitations specific to each antibody
assay. General limitations may include:
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies
• Potential for false positives or negatives due to sample handling
or storage conditions
