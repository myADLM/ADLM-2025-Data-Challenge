Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MOUNTAIN CEDAR, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and timely
analysis of MOUNTAIN CEDAR, IGE, SERUM, ensuring consistency,
reliability, and traceability of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP for generating results for MOUNTAIN CEDAR, IGE, SERUM.
Supervisors must ensure compliance and provide guidance when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Collection: Blood collected in SST (Serum
Separator Tube) or plain red-top tube. Volume: Minimum required
volume is 1.0 mL of serum. Transport and Storage: Serum must be
separated from cells within 2 hours of collection. Stored at 2–8°C if
analyzed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions: - Hemolyzed samples - Lipemic
samples - Clotted samples - Improperly labeled specimens
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment: - Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia, ImmunoCAP) -
Centrifuge - Pipettes and Tips - Vortex Mixer - Refrigerator (2-8°C)
and Freezer (-20°C or lower) - Computer with Laboratory Information
System (LIS)
Reagents: - Allergen-specific IgE reagent kit for Mountain Cedar -
Calibrators - Control materials - Wash buffer - Substrate solution -
Stop solution
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are at the proper operating
conditions according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer using
provided calibrators.
3. Perform quality control checks using control materials to ensure
the instrument and reagents are functioning properly.
4.2 Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to ensure clarity
and remove any particulate matter.
3. Pipette the required volume of serum into sample wells or
tubes.
4.3 Sample Analysis
1. Load the prepared sample wells or tubes into the immunoassay
analyzer.
2. Follow the specific instrument’s operational manual to begin the
analysis:
◦ Select assay parameters specific for Mountain Cedar, IGE.
◦ Enter sample identifiers as per LIS requirements.
◦ Start the run according to instrument protocol.
3. Once the assay run is complete, review the raw data output for
any flags or errors.
4.4 Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Quality Control: Ensure that QC materials fall within the
acceptable range. If they do not, troubleshoot before
proceeding.
2. Review the results:
◦ Observe the specific IgE levels for Mountain Cedar.
◦ Compare results against established reference intervals.
◦ Validate results ensuring they are consistent with run
controls and calibrators.
3. Enter results into the LIS for review.
4. Verified results should be authorized and released through the
LIS.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Quality control samples must be run with each batch of patient
samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
7. Document all QC results and maintain records for traceability.
8. If QC results do not meet acceptable criteria, identify and
correct the issue before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific allergen-specific IgE reagent kit insert for
detailed information on assay limitations, cross-reactivity, and other
analytical considerations.
