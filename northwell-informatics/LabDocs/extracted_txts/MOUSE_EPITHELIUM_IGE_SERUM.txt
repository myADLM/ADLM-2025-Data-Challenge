Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MOUSE EPITHELIUM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of testing mouse epithelium IgE levels in serum samples,
ensuring accurate, reproducible, and reliable test results in
compliance with regulatory requirements and laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis adhering to the prescribed procedure. It is the responsibility
of all staff to report any inconsistencies or deviations from the
procedure to the supervisory personnel.
2. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 100 µL of serum per test
• Handling: Upon receipt, ensure that the serum samples are
properly labeled and stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Specimen Stability:
• At 2-8°C: Stable for up to 48 hours
• At -20°C or lower: Stable for up to 6 months
Rejection Criteria:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes
• Samples with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination
• Insufficient sample volume
• Mislabeling or unlabeled specimens
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Microtiter plate reader (capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Mouse Epithelium IgE ELISA kit (store all reagents as per
manufacturer’s instruction)
• Deionized water
• Calibrated digital timer
• Protective laboratory equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Calibration and Quality Control:
4.1.1. Perform all necessary calibrations for the microtiter plate
reader and micropipettes following the manufacturer and laboratory
guidelines.
4.1.2. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high controls)
with each assay batch to ensure test accuracy and precision.
Document QC results and take corrective actions if controls do not
meet expected ranges.
4.2. Assay Procedure:
4.2.1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature and mix well using
a vortex mixer before analysis.
4.2.2. Set up the ELISA assay according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. This typically includes:
• Coating a microtiter plate with mouse epithelium antigen.
• Blocking any nonspecific binding sites with a blocking buffer.
• Adding standard solutions and serum samples to the wells.
• Adding enzyme-conjugated antibodies specific to mouse IgE.
• Washing thoroughly to remove unbound substances.
• Adding substrate solution to develop color.
• Adding stop solution to terminate the reaction.
4.2.3. Incubate the plates at the temperature specified in the assay
kit instructions, ensuring timing and environmental conditions are
strictly followed.
4.2.4. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microtiter plate reader within the time frame specified.
4.3. Data Analysis:
4.3.1. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance values of the
known standards included in the assay kit.
4.3.2. Calculate the mouse epithelium IgE concentrations in the
serum samples using the standard curve.
4.3.3. Ensure that the calculated concentrations fall within the linear
range of the standard curve. If not, dilute the sample and re-analyze.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
5.1. Result Validation:
• Cross-check calculated concentrations with both quality controls
and peer results.
• Validate data for aberrancies or technical errors in the analysis
before reporting.
• Any results outside the expected range should prompt repeat
testing or re-evaluation of sample integrity.
5.2. Reporting:
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure proper notation and review by a designated supervisor.
• Record any critical values that necessitate immediate attention in
the patient’s medical record and notify the requesting clinician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Ensure all QC steps are taken according to the lab's quality policy.
Any deviations from expected outcomes must be documented,
addressed, and communicated to appropriate supervisory staff.
Perform corrective actions, re-runs, or further inspections as needed.
