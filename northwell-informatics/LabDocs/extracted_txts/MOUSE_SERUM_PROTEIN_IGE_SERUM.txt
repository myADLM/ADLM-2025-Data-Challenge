Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generating
Results for Mouse Serum Protein, IgE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase involved in
generating results for mouse serum protein and IgE in the laboratory.
It ensures accurate, consistent, and reliable results through proper
handling, processing, and analysis of specimens.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
follow this SOP in performing assays and reporting results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
these procedures and addressing any issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Mouse serum
Collection:
• Blood should be collected from mice via appropriate techniques
(e.g., retro-orbital, tail vein, cardiac puncture) using serum-
separating tubes (SST) or other suitable containers.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature (20-25°C) for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the samples at 2000-3000 g for 10-15 minutes to
separate serum.
• Aliquot the serum into labeled, sterile microcentrifuge tubes.
Storage:
• Specimens should be stored at -20°C or colder until analysis.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to maintain specimen integrity.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolytic, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens not properly labeled, including missing or incomplete
collection date/time information.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Instrumentation:
• ELISA reader compliant with CLIA standards
• Microscope (if microscopic analysis is required)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
Reagents:
• Commercially available ELISA kits for mouse serum protein and
IgE (e.g., manufacturer's kit-specific reagents)
• Calibration and quality control materials designated by the
manufacturer
Supplies:
• SST or microcentrifuge tubes
• Storage containers (e.g., cryovials)
• Sterilized collection devices (needles, syringes)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, calibration, and quality control materials to
room temperature before use.
• Verify the expiration date of all reagents and kits used.
B) Assay Execution: Mouse Serum Protein:
1. Prepare standards and samples according to the ELISA kit
instructions.
2. Add appropriate volume of standards, controls, and serum
samples to the wells of the ELISA plate.
3. Incubate plates as per kit instructions, ensuring proper
conditions (e.g., temperature, duration).
4. Wash plates following indicated washing steps in the kit
instructions.
5. Add detection antibodies or reagents, incubate, and perform
final washing according to kit instructions.
6. Read absorbance using the ELISA reader, following
manufacturer's specifications.
Mouse Serum IgE:
1. Repeat steps 1-6 for mouse serum IgE using the specific ELISA
kit designated for IgE analysis.
C) Quality Control:
• Run appropriate control samples (positive and negative) to ensure
ELISA kits and reagents are functioning correctly.
• Verify quality control results fall within accepted ranges before
proceeding with sample analysis.
D) Result Calculation and Reporting:
• Calculate the concentration of mouse serum protein and IgE
using the standard curve generated from the ELISA plate
readings.
• Ensure accuracy by validating calculations and cross-checking
against control sample values.
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
• Verify results in the LIS prior to reporting.
• Report unusual or critical findings to the supervising technologist
immediately for intervention and confirmation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Mouse Serum Protein:
• Normal: Refer to specific ELISA kit instructions for expected
reference ranges.
Mouse Serum IgE:
• Normal: Refer to specific ELISA kit instructions for expected
reference ranges.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• All reagents must be stored according to manufacturer's
specifications.
• QC with each new batch of ELISA plates and record results
following site-specific guidelines.
• Perform regular instrument calibration checks and maintain
calibration and performance logs.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to specific ELISA kit inserts for individual reagent and
procedural limitations.
• Ensure specimen integrity by minimizing freeze-thaw cycles.
1. REFERENCES
• Product insert for the specific ELISA kit used.
• Laboratory internal quality control and standard operating
guidelines.
This protocol must be reviewed periodically for updates in
methodology, equipment, or reagents used in mouse serum protein
and IgE analysis. Compliance ensures the reliability and accuracy of
generated results. Users must be thoroughly trained in this SOP and
updated about new electronic or procedural changes.
