Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase -
Measurement of Mouse Urine Protein, IgE, and Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the accurate and precise
measurement of mouse urine protein, IgE, and serum levels. This
includes methods for sample preparation, reagent handling, data
generation, quality control, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
without deviation.
• It is the responsibility of designated staff to ensure all equipment
is maintained according to relevant SOPs and to monitor the
quality control processes.
• It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure adherence to this
procedure and to address any deficiencies that may arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Urine Protein: Total protein content in the mouse urine sample.
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
reactions.
• Serum: Liquid component of blood without cells and clotting
factors, utilized for various biochemical assays.
1. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
• Microplate reader (suitable for spectrophotometric
measurements)
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerator (-20°C and 4°C)
• Protein Urine Assay Kit
• IgE ELISA Kit (specific for mouse)
• Serum Biochemistry Analyzer
• Reagent grade water and appropriate buffers
• Calibration standards and quality control samples
• Centrifuge tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Collect mouse urine and serum samples in pre-labeled tubes.
• Centrifuge urine samples at 1000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
debris. Transfer supernatant to a new tube.
• Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum. Store serum at -20°C until analysis.
Urine Protein Measurement:
• Thaw urine samples at room temperature.
• Prepare protein standards and quality controls as per the kit
instructions.
• Load standards, controls, and samples into appropriate wells of
the assay plate.
• Add reagent according to the Protein Urine Assay Kit instructions.
• Incubate the plate as recommended by the kit protocol.
• Read the plate using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
• Calculate the protein concentration from the standard curve
generated.
IgE Measurement:
• Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
• Set up the ELISA plate by adding standards, controls, and
samples in duplicate or triplicates as per IgE ELISA Kit protocol.
• Add the provided detection antibody and enzyme substrate
sequentially as instructed by the kit protocol.
• Incubate the plate appropriately and wash as required.
• Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
• Calculate the IgE concentration by generating a standard curve.
Serum Biochemistry Analysis:
• Select assays to be measured on the Serum Biochemistry
Analyzer.
• Thaw serum samples at room temperature and mix gently.
• Place serum samples, along with calibration standards and
controls, in the analyzer.
• Run the assays following the analyzer's operation manual.
• Verify results against quality control standards.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative controls in each run to
validate accuracy.
• Perform routine calibration of instruments as specified by the
manufacturer.
• Document all sample data, control data, and observations in a lab
notebook or analytical software.
• If quality control samples deviate from expected ranges,
investigate and resolve issues before reporting results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review generated data for consistency and accuracy. Outliers
should be re-evaluated or re-run if necessary.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Any critical values should be flagged and promptly communicated
to the relevant personnel overseeing the study or experiment.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for mouse urine protein, IgE, and serum
depend on the protocol and strain of mice, to be established
based on pilot studies and literature references.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Assay specificity and sensitivity depend on the kits and calibrators
used. Refer to the kit insert for limitations.
• Ensure that samples are stored and handled properly to avoid
degradation of analytes.
1. REFERENCES
• Reference manuals and product inserts provided with assay kits
for detailed instructions.
• Manufacturer’s manuals for operational and maintenance
guidelines for microplate readers and biochemistry analyzers.
• Relevant scientific literature on normative mouse urine and serum
biochemistry.
