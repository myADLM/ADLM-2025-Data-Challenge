Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Movement Disorder, Autoimmune/
Paraneoplastic Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis of serum
samples for Movement Disorder, Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic
evaluation.
2. SCOPE This procedure is applicable to the clinical laboratory
performing this specific test. This includes the preparation,
analysis, and validation of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• The laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring adherence
to this SOP and taking appropriate corrective actions if deviations
occur.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator
tube (SST) and allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Centrifugation: Centrifuge the specimen at 1500xg for 10
minutes. Ensure clear separation of serum from cells.
◦ Storage: If not analyzed immediately, store serum at 2-8° C
for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, keep frozen at -20°C
or lower.
◦ Rejection Criteria: Hemolyzed or lipemic samples,
insufficient volume, or samples not meeting the collection
and storage requirements.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated analyzer specific for autoimmune/paraneoplastic
markers
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Calibrators
◦ Assay-specific reagent kits
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Sample tubes
3. PROCEDURE A) Calibration and Quality Control i. Run
calibrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ii.
Perform quality control at the start of the testing session, after
any maintenance, and as required by the laboratory's QC plan.
iii. Document QC results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable limits before proceeding with patient samples.
B) Sample Preparation i. Prepare samples by aliquoting into
appropriate volume and labeling them clearly with patient
identifiers. ii. Allow frozen samples to thaw completely and mix
gently.
C) Analysis i. Load the patient samples and controls onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. ii. Follow
the analyzer’s protocol for running the specific assays. iii.
Monitor the analyzer for any errors or alerts during the run.
D) Result Interpretation i. Review the results obtained from the
analyzer. ii. Compare the quality control results to the
established acceptable ranges to validate the run. iii. Repeat
the analysis if the quality control fails.
E) Reporting Results i. Enter the validated results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). ii. Include interpretive
comments as per laboratory policy and specific test
requirements. iii. Notify the ordering physician of critical or
significant results immediately according to the laboratory's
critical value policy.
4. LIMITATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS
◦ Ensure proper labeling and handling of specimens to avoid
mix-ups.
◦ Verify that quality control measures are in place and that
results are reviewed and acceptable before reporting patient
results.
◦ Be aware of potential interferences listed in the assay kit
inserts that could affect results.
◦ Always follow biosafety guidelines when handling human
specimens.
5. RECORD KEEPING
◦ Maintain all records of specimen processing, QC,
calibration, and result reporting according to the laboratory's
record retention policy.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for calibrators, quality control
materials, and assay kits.
◦ Laboratory’s quality control and critical value policies.
7. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
◦ This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed when new
methods, instruments, or regulations are introduced.
