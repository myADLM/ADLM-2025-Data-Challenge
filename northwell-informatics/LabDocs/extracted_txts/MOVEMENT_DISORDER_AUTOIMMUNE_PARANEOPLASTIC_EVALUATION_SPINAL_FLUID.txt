Title: Protocol for Generating Results for Movement Disorder,
Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of testing spinal fluid (CSF) for movement disorders
and autoimmune/paraneoplastic evaluation in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This protocol aims to ensure the accurate and reliable
generation of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• CSF collected via lumbar puncture in sterile containers.
• Minimum volume of 1-3 mL is required for comprehensive testing.
• The specimen should be transported to the laboratory
immediately and maintained at 2-8°C.
• If delay is anticipated, store the specimen refrigerated and
complete testing within 48 hours of collection. Do not freeze.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with evident contamination or hemolysis.
• Insufficient volume for required tests.
• Specimens received beyond 48 hours of collection unless
otherwise validated for specific tests.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzers (e.g., ELISA readers,
multiplex autoantibody assays).
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C).
• Calibrated pipettes and microtiter plates.
• Quality control materials and standards.
• Relevant reagents for specific assays (e.g., anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-
Ri antibodies).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Verify that the specimen has been properly collected, labeled,
and logged.
2. Perform initial visual inspection of the CSF; note any turbidity or
discoloration.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 15 minutes if
necessary to remove any cellular debris.
B) Analytical Steps:
1. Make appropriate dilutions of CSF specimen if required by
specific assays.
2. Load the specimen, controls, and calibrators onto the assay
platform following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Ensure proper reagent addition, mixing, and incubation times
as per assay protocols.
4. Run the assay and read the results on the immunoassay
analyzer.
5. Apply any necessary corrections or conversions (e.g.,
concentration units).
C) Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality control (QC) samples with each assay
batch.
2. Ensure that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
accepting patient results.
3. Document any out-of-range QC results and take appropriate
corrective actions, including assay repetition if needed.
4. Perform instrument calibration and maintenance as per the
manufacturer’s recommendation.
D) Interpretation and Verification:
1. Compare the patient results against established reference
ranges and clinical cutoffs.
2. Validate the results by verifying assay control data and
checking for consistency.
3. Review abnormal or unexpected results with a clinician or
supervisor.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results clearly and concisely, including the date and
time of analysis.
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
reporting.
• Report critical or significantly abnormal findings immediately to
the clinician as per laboratory policy.
• Use proper interpretation notes, indicating any limitations or
potential interferences in the diagnosis.

This protocol ensures systematic and reliable results for the
evaluation of movement disorders, autoimmune diseases, and
paraneoplastic syndromes using CSF samples. It aligns with
established laboratory standards and regulatory requirements.
