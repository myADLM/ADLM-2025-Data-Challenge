Standard Operating Procedure for MPL EXON 10 MUTATION
DETECTION, REFLEX, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of mutations within Exon 10
of the MPL gene using reflex testing. This procedure ensures
accurate and timely results for the diagnosis and monitoring of
hematologic disorders, such as essential thrombocythemia (ET) and
primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top) tubes
• Bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA (lavender-top) tubes
• Extracted genomic DNA from a qualified clinical laboratory
(volume and concentration requirements to be specified)
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Serum or plasma
• Specimens with heparin anticoagulant
• Samples that are clotted, hemolyzed, or collected in inappropriate
containers
Specimen Handling:
• Store whole blood and bone marrow aspirates at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately
• Ensure specimens are processed within 72 hours for optimal DNA
quality
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• MPL Exon 10 PCR Kit (including primers, probes, and necessary
enzymes)
• DNA extraction kit (validated for use with blood and bone marrow
specimens)
• Reagent-grade water
• 10X PCR Buffer
• dNTP mix
• MgCl2 solution (if not included in PCR buffer)
• PCR-grade Matrigel or similar reagents
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
4. EQUIPMENT
• Thermal cycler
• Real-time PCR machine
• Spectrophotometer or NanoDrop for DNA quantification
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometer for DNA quantification
5. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from blood or bone marrow samples
using the specified DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
NanoDrop.
3. Aliquot the extracted DNA and store at -20°C until ready for
PCR.
B) PCR Setup
1. Thaw all reagents on ice and keep them cool throughout the
process.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows:
◦ 10X PCR Buffer: xxx µL
◦ MgCl2 solution: xxx µL
◦ dNTP mix: xxx µL
◦ MPL Exon 10 primers: xxx µL
◦ MPL Exon 10 probes: xxx µL
◦ Taq DNA polymerase: xxx µL
◦ DNase/RNase-free water: To adjust final volume
◦ Genomic DNA template (50-100 ng): xxx µL (Note: Volumes
are dependent on the kit and manufacturer’s specifications)
3. Mix the master mix thoroughly and aliquot into PCR tubes.
4. Add the genomic DNA template to each PCR tube.
5. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run for
validation.
C) Thermal Cycling Conditions
1. Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
2. Amplification Cycles (35 cycles):
◦ Denature: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Anneal: 60°C for 60 seconds
◦ Extend: 72°C for 30 seconds
3. Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
4. Hold: 4°C
D) Detection and Analysis
1. Load the PCR products onto the real-time PCR machine.
2. Program the instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions for MPL Exon 10 mutation detection.
3. Analyze the results using the specified software for the
detection system.
4. Validate the run using control samples:
◦ Positive controls must show amplification within the
expected range.
◦ Negative controls must show no amplification.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
patient samples.
2. If controls do not perform as expected, repeat the PCR run.
B) External Quality Control:
1. Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparison programs as available.
2. Document and review all quality control activities periodically.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reviewed by the technologist for accuracy and
consistency with control samples.
2. Interpret results based on the presence or absence of
mutations as per the established criteria.
3. Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and verified by the laboratory physician.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for limitations intrinsic to the
PCR assay, including sensitivity and specificity constraints.
