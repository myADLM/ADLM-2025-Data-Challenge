Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MPL Exon 10 Mutation
Detection
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required for the analysis of the MPL
(Myeloproliferative Leukemia Virus Oncogene) Exon 10 mutation
detection. This protocol details the process from sample preparation
to result generation, including quality control and result reporting.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all certified personnel performing MPL Exon 10
mutation testing within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for performing MPL Exon 10
mutation detection according to this procedure. It is the responsibility
of all personnel to follow this SOP and report any deficiencies or
deviations to the supervisor immediately.
4. DEFINITIONS
• MPL Exon 10: A region in the MPL gene frequently mutated in
certain myeloproliferative disorders.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
DNA.
• QC: Quality Control.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Peripheral blood (4-6 mL) collected in
EDTA tubes or bone marrow aspirates.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Clotted samples, hemolyzed
samples, samples not properly labeled, or samples received
beyond the stability period.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocycler (PCR machine)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit
• PCR Master Mix
• Primers specific for MPL Exon 10
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• Ethidium bromide or an appropriate DNA dye
• UV transilluminator
• Sterile, nuclease-free centrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Laboratory timer
• Appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Preparation
◦ Prepare the work area by cleaning it with a DNA
decontaminant.
◦ Label all necessary tubes with sample IDs.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Extraction Protocol
◦ Use the Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure all centrifugation steps are performed at the
specified speed and time.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR Reaction Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice and keep them chilled throughout
the process.
◦ In a sterile, nuclease-free tube, prepare the following
reaction mix per sample:
▪ PCR Master Mix (as specified by the manufacturer)
▪ Forward Primer (specific to MPL Exon 10)
▪ Reverse Primer (specific to MPL Exon 10)
▪ Template DNA (from extracted sample)
▪ Nuclease-free water to the final reaction volume.
2. Thermocycler Setup:
◦ Program the thermocycler with the following conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
3. Load the samples into the thermocycler and start the run.
C. Post-PCR Analysis
1. Gel Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare an agarose gel (2% for small amplicons).
◦ Mix PCR products with loading dye.
◦ Load the samples into the wells of the agarose gel.
◦ Run the gel at 100V for 30-40 minutes.
2. Visualization:
◦ Stain the gel with ethidium bromide or another suitable DNA
dye.
◦ Visualize the stained gel under a UV transilluminator.
◦ Document the results using a gel documentation system.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive control, negative control, and a non-template control
(NTC) with each batch of samples to ensure the PCR reagents
and the thermocycler are working correctly.
• Document and analyze the results of controls before analyzing
patient samples.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Compare the amplified products to a DNA ladder to determine the
presence or absence of mutations in MPL Exon 10.
• Positive results should show PCR amplicons of the expected size
alongside the positive control.
• Negative results should show no PCR products in the patient
sample lanes but products in the positive control lanes.
• Report results according to laboratory reporting guidelines and
include all controls in the final assessment.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives/negatives may occur due to contamination or
procedural deviations.
• Strict adherence to the protocol is essential to ensure accuracy.

12. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Review and update the SOP as required, or at least annually.
• Documentation of any changes and deviations should be
recorded.
