◦ 10x PCR buffer
◦ MgCl2 (25 mM)
◦ dNTP mix (10 mM each)
◦ Forward primer (specific to MPL Exon 10)
◦ Reverse primer (specific to MPL Exon 10)
◦ Taq DNA Polymerase
◦ DNA template (quantified from extraction step)
2. Thermocycler conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 58°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
3. Run 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension steps.
5.3 PCR Product Verification
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or another
DNA dye.
2. Load PCR products and appropriate DNA ladder onto the gel.
3. Run the gel at 100V for approximately 1 hour.
4. Visualize the PCR products using a UV transilluminator. The
expected product size should be approximately 300-400 base
pairs.
5. Document the gel image.
5.4 DNA Sequencing
1. Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the purified PCR product.
3. Prepare the sequencing reaction mixture using:
◦ Purified PCR product
◦ Sequencing primers (forward and reverse)
◦ Sequencing buffer and reagents
4. Load the sequencing reaction onto the DNA sequencer as per
the manufacturer's protocol.
5. Run the sequencing reaction and acquire data.
5.5 Data Analysis
1. Analyze sequencing data using software compatible with the
sequencing instrument.
2. Align sequencing reads to the reference MPL Exon 10
sequence.
3. Identify any mutations present and annotate these accurately.
4. Document all findings meticulously.
5.6 Reporting Results
1. Compile the sequencing results, including identified mutations,
along with interpretations.
2. Submit the results for review by the Laboratory Supervisor.
3. The Laboratory Supervisor reviews and validates the results.
4. Document the final validated report in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
5. Ensure that the validated report is communicated to the
referring clinician or diagnostic team promptly.
