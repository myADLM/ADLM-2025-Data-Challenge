SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for MPOX Virus
DNA, Qualitative PCR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis and reporting of
MPOX (Monkeypox) Virus DNA, Qualitative PCR to ensure high-
quality and consistent results.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the designated staff to perform the analysis
of MPOX Virus DNA utilizing the qualitative PCR method. All
personnel conducting this testing must be adequately trained and
adhere to the procedures outlined in this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
MPOX Virus DNA, Qualitative PCR: A molecular test performed to
detect the presence of Monkeypox virus DNA in a given specimen.
Ct (Cycle threshold): The number of cycles required for the
fluorescent signal to cross the threshold (i.e., exceed the background
level).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Skin swab from vesicles, pustules, or crusts.
◦ Lesion fluid or lesion crust.
• Transport and Stability:
◦ Specimens should be transported in viral transport media
(VTM) and kept at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
◦ If delayed more than 72 hours, store at -70°C.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are not appropriately labeled.
◦ Specimens that have leaked or been visibly contaminated.
◦ Specimens that haven't been appropriately stored or
transported.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument
• MPOX virus-specific primers and probes
• Nucleic acid extraction kit
• PCR reaction mix (commercially available)
• Positive and negative control materials
• Pipettes and Pipette tips (preferably filtered)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Use a standardized nucleic acid extraction kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Extract nucleic acids from 200µl of the specimen.
3. Record extraction date, time, and initials of performing staff on
the specimen log.
B) PCR Preparation:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring that primers and probes specific for the
MPOX virus are present.
2. Add 5µl of extracted nucleic acid to each reaction tube/well of
the PCR plate.
3. Include positive controls (known MPOX virus DNA) and
negative controls (nuclease-free water) in each run.
4. Seal the PCR plate and centrifuge briefly to ensure all reagents
are at the bottom of the wells.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. Load the PCR plate into the Real-time PCR instrument.
2. Set up the thermal cycling program as recommended by the
reagent manufacturer.
3. Start the PCR run.
D) Result Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the PCR, analyze the data using the
instrument's software.
2. Determine the presence of MPOX virus DNA based on the Ct
values. Positive samples will generate Ct values within the
range defined by the manufacturer's instructions.
Interpretation of Results:
• Positive: Ct value ≤ defined cut-off (as per reagent protocol) -
MPOX virus DNA detected.
• Negative: No Ct value or Ct value > defined cut-off - MPOX virus
DNA not detected.
• Indeterminate: Results that do not clearly fall into the positive or
negative range should be repeated. If still indeterminate, consult a
supervisor for further action.
1. Report the results as either "MPOX Virus DNA detected" or
"MPOX Virus DNA not detected" based on the Ct value
interpretation. If indeterminate, report as "Indeterminate."
2. QUALITY CONTROL
3. Run Positive and Negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure the reliability of the PCR results.
4. Document control results in the Quality Control log.
5. If controls do not perform as expected, do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Results are automatically transferred to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
8. Technologists review the results for accuracy and verify them.
9. In the case of positive results, notify the appropriate public
health authorities as per the reporting guidelines.

This protocol aligns with standard laboratory practices for PCR
testing. I avoided specific brand names or techniques unless stated
in the examples, assuming you have access to standard materials
and resources. If you need details specific to certain reagents or
equipment, don't hesitate to ask.
