Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MPOX VIRUS DNA,
Qualitative Real-Time PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the qualitative detection of MPOX virus
DNA using Real-Time PCR in clinical specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel involved in the testing process
are responsible for adhering to this SOP in order to ensure consistent
and accurate results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Fresh lesion swabs, vesicular fluid, scabs, or exudate from
suspected MPOX virus-infected patients.
Collection and Transport:
• Collect specimen using a sterile swab, avoiding contamination.
• Place swab in viral transport medium (VTM).
• Transport at 2-8°C within 24 hours of collection if local, and within
72 hours if from a remote site.
• Ship on dry ice if long-duration transport is required.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no date or time of collection.
• Specimens that have visibly clotted or unsealed.
• Specimens in non-approved transport media.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-Time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Roche LightCycler)
• MPOX Virus DNA extraction kit
• MPOX Virus Real-Time PCR assay kit
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Benchtop microcentrifuge
• PCR tubes or plates
• Nuclease-free water
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
i) Sample Preprocessing:
• Once specimens are received, ensure they are labeled correctly
with patient ID and collection details.
• Vortex the specimen vials briefly to homogenize.
ii) DNA Extraction:
• Follow the instructions provided with the MPOX Virus DNA
extraction kit.
• Transfer the specimen into the extraction tube.
• Carry out steps involving lysis, binding, washing, and elution as
per the manufacturer's protocol.
• Store extracted DNA at 2-8°C briefly or at -20°C for long-term
storage.
B. PCR Setup
i) Reaction Mix Preparation:
• Thaw all reagents and samples on ice.
• Prepare the PCR master mix as per the MPOX Virus Real-Time
PCR assay kit protocol:
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ PCR buffer with MgCl2
◦ dNTP mix
◦ MPOX virus-specific forward primer
◦ MPOX virus-specific reverse primer
◦ Taq DNA polymerase
◦ MPOX virus-specific probe
• Aliquot 20 µL of PCR master mix into each PCR tube or plate
well.
ii) Adding Sample DNA:
• Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each tube/well containing the
master mix.
iii) Controls:
• Include positive control with known MPOX virus DNA, negative
control with nuclease-free water, and no-template controls.
C. PCR Instrument Conditions
i) Program the Real-Time PCR Instrument:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
• Amplification cycles (40 cycles):
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal control samples with known quantities of MPOX virus
DNA to ensure accuracy.
• Any deviation from expected control results should trigger
troubleshooting protocols as per the manufacturer's manual.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate threshold cycle (Ct) values for each sample.
• Positive result: Presence of Ct value within the validated range.
Signal detected indicating MPOX virus DNA.
• Negative result: Absence of Ct value or Ct value above the
threshold range. No signal detected indicating no MPOX virus
DNA presence.
• Invalid result: If controls do not perform as expected or anomalies
in signal detection. Repeat the extraction and PCR.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report as "MPOX Virus DNA: Detected" or "MPOX Virus DNA:
Not Detected" with appropriate reference to quality controls.
• For invalid results, indicate as "Unkown - Repeat Assay".
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure reagent expiry dates are reviewed prior to use.
• Subject the extracted DNA to Real-time PCR immediately to avoid
degradation.
• Refer to manufacturers' inserts for additional limitations pertaining
to the PCR kit.

11. RECORD KEEPING
• Store all raw data, including worksheets and printed instrument
results securely.
• Document corrective actions taken for any deviations.
12. TRAINING
• All personnel must complete training and competency
assessment on the Real-Time PCR procedure, data
interpretation, and reporting guidelines.
