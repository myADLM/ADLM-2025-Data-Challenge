Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
TITLE: Protocol for Generating Results for MSH2 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures and responsibilities involved in the
technical component only (TC) preparation and staining of specimens
for MSH2 immunostain in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
preparation, staining, and initial microscopic assessment of
specimens for MSH2 immunostain. The specimen has already been
received, accessioned, and prepared for slide staining.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Trained laboratory personnel (histotechnologists and lab
assistants) are responsible for carrying out the MSH2
immunostain procedure.
• The technical supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
procedure, ensuring adherence to SOPs, and troubleshooting any
issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Prepared tissue slides, appropriately labeled with patient
information and barcode for tracking.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Microtome
• MSH2 primary antibody
• Detection kit compatible with MSH2 antibody (e.g., Dako
EnVision+ System)
• Immunostaining reagents, including:
1. Deparaffinizing solutions (xylene or alternative)
2. Rehydration solutions (graded alcohols)
3. Antigen retrieval solutions (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
4. Primary antibody diluent
5. Secondary antibody (HRP-linked)
6. Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
7. Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
8. Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
• Water bath
• Humidified chamber
• Immunostainer (if available) or manual staining setup
• Coverslips and cover glass mounting materials
6. DEFINITION:
MSH2: MutS Homolog 2 is a protein involved in DNA mismatch
repair, frequently used as a biomarker in cancer
immunohistochemistry (IHC).
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Tissue Section Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Carefully section FFPE tissue blocks at 4 µm thickness
using a calibrated microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged microscope slides.
2. Baking Slides:
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for a minimum of 1 hour to ensure
proper adhesion of sections to slides.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene or xylene alternative for 3 minutes,
repeat twice (total 3x3 minutes).
2. Rehydration:
◦ Gradually rehydrate slides by dipping in 100%, 95%, and
70% ethanol for 2 minutes each, followed by rinsing in
deionized water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a retrieval solution (citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
◦ Heat in a water bath or microwave according to
manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., 20 minutes at 95-100°C).
◦ Allow sections to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water and then in wash buffer
(e.g., PBS or TBS).
D. Immunostaining:
1. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
◦ Apply primary MSH2 antibody diluted in appropriate diluent.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer.
◦ Apply secondary antibody from the detection kit, and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer.
◦ Apply the chromogen (DAB) and incubate according to kit
instructions (typically 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water.
3. Counterstaining and Mounting:
◦ Counterstain slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water.
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
◦ Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
E. Quality Control:
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include one known positive control and one negative control
slide in each batch of staining to validate the procedure.
◦ Evaluate staining quality and consistency using control
slides.
F. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all steps, including incubation times and
temperatures, in the laboratory information system or batch
log.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
staining process and report to the supervisor.
2. Slide Review:
◦ Examine control slides to verify staining efficacy.
◦ Ensure technical component only (TC); slides are sent to
the pathologist without interpretation.
◦ Ensure controls meet established criteria before releasing
patient slides.
3. Reporting:
◦ The slides, along with any relevant documentation, are
forwarded to the pathologist for evaluation and final
interpretation.
8. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Regularly clean and maintain all equipment according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Perform routine validation and maintenance on immunostainer if
used.
• Troubleshoot any technical issues with staining under the
guidance of the technical supervisor.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for MSH2 antibody and detection kit.
• Laboratory quality guidelines and reagent preparation SOPs.
• Appropriate control standards and logs.
10. REVIEW:
• This SOP must be reviewed and approved annually by the
laboratory director or designee and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and laboratory
policies.
