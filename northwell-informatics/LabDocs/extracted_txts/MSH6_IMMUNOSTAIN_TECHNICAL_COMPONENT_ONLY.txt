SOP for MSH6 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the technical component of performing an
immunohistochemical (IHC) stain for MSH6. The goal is to ensure
consistent and accurate staining to facilitate pathologist
interpretation. This SOP does not cover result interpretation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the MSH6 immunostain according to these procedures. It
is the responsibility of staff and supervisors to ensure the procedure
is followed correctly and documented adequately.
1. DEFINITION MSH6 is a protein involved in DNA mismatch
repair and can be used as a marker for certain types of
carcinoma, including colorectal cancer.
1. PROCEDURE
Materials Required:
1. Pre-processed tissue slides
2. MSH6 primary antibody
3. Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
4. Detection system (DAB chromogen)
5. Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
6. Mounting medium
7. Appropriate controls
8. Necessary buffer solutions (e.g., PBS, blocking buffer, etc.)
9. Staining equipment (automated stainer or manual staining
setup)
10. Microscope and slides
Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure
all reagents are within their expiry dates and properly stored.
Slide Preparation:
1. Verify the identity of the tissue sample and label slides
appropriately.
2. Ensure slides are free from debris and fingerprints.
Staining Procedure:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5
minutes each.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using the recommended buffer and
method (e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval in Citrate Buffer,
pH 6.0).
◦ Allow cooling and rinse in distilled water followed by PBS.
3. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking buffer to prevent non-specific binding,
incubate for 10-20 minutes.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply MSH6 antibody to the tissue sections. Incubate for the
recommended time (usually 1-2 hours at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C).
5. Washing:
◦ Rinse the slides in PBS to remove excess antibody.
6. Secondary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, incubate
according to protocol specifications (usually 30 minutes).
7. Visualizing:
◦ Develop the color using DAB chromogen substrate. Monitor
the reaction until desired stain intensity is reached (usually
5-10 minutes).
8. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute. Rinse in tap
water.
9. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%).
◦ Clear in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
10. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and cover with a coverslip.
Quality Control:
• Include a negative and positive control with each batch of staining
to ensure antibody specificity and staining accuracy.
• Record all deviations, corrective actions, and observations during
staining.
Documentation:
• Complete the IHC Staining Log with details on reagents used,
incubation times, temperatures, quality control results, initial, date,
and any observations or deviations from the standard protocol.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Deliver slides to the pathologist for result interpretation.
• echnician/technologist ensures slides are properly labeled and
logged before delivery.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Pathologists will determine the staining intensity and pattern,
referencing established thresholds for MSH6.
METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are kept up to date and in
good working condition. Specific limitations are referenced in
manufacturer product inserts.
REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s protocol for MSH6 antibody.
• General lab guidelines for IHC staining procedures.
• Peer-reviewed articles on MSH6 immunostaining efficacy and
validation.
This protocol ensures consistency in the technical preparation of
MSH6 stains, supporting accurate diagnostic decisions by
pathologists.
