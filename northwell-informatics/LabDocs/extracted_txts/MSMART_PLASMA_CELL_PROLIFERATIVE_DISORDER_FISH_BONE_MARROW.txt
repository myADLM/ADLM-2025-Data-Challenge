Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MSMART, Plasma Cell Proliferative
Disorder, FISH, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps required to generate
results for the detection of Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorders using
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on bone marrow specimens.
This protocol ensures that the results are accurate, reproducible, and
reliable.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
FISH analysis following this SOP.
• Supervisors and quality control personnel are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this SOP and addressing any deviations
that may affect the quality of results.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope
• Incubators (37°C)
• Water baths
• Hybridization oven
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• FISH probes specific for plasma cell proliferative disorders
• Fixative solution (methanol/acetic acid)
• Wash buffers
• Denaturation and hybridization buffers
• DAPI counterstain
Supplies:
• Bone marrow slides
• Coverslips
• Pap pen
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coats
• Pipettes and tips
3. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Hybridization Preparation:
1. Preparation of Bone Marrow Slides:
◦ Ensure bone marrow specimens are received and
accessioned according to standard laboratory protocols.
◦ Prepare bone marrow smears on slides and allow them to
air dry.
◦ Fix the slides in a fixative solution (methanol/acetic acid) for
10 minutes.
2. Pre-Treatment of Slides:
◦ Dehydrate the fixed slides through a series of ethanol
washes (70%, 85%, and 100%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Air dry the slides completely.
B. Denaturation and Hybridization:
1. Denaturation:
◦ Apply the FISH probe mixture to the target area on the slide
using a pipette.
◦ Cover the applied probe area with a coverslip and seal with
rubber cement or a pap pen.
◦ Denature the probe and target DNA simultaneously by
incubating the slides at 75°C for 5 minutes on a hot plate.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Transfer the slides to a humidified hybridization chamber
and incubate overnight at 37°C.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes and Counterstaining:
1. Post-Hybridization Washes:
◦ Remove coverslips carefully and immerse the slides in wash
buffer 1 (0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40) at 73°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Transfer slides to wash buffer 2 (2x SSC/0.1% NP-40) at
room temperature for 1 minute.
◦ Air dry the slides in the dark.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply DAPI counterstain to the slides and cover with a
coverslip.
D. Analysis of Results:
1. Microscopy:
◦ Use a fluorescence microscope to examine the slides.
◦ Confirm the presence of FISH signals and identify any
chromosomal abnormalities indicative of plasma cell
proliferative disorders.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Record the number of cells with normal and abnormal FISH
signals.
◦ Analyze the data to determine the proportion of cells
exhibiting specific genetic abnormalities.
E. Quality Control:
• Ensure the fluorescence microscope is calibrated regularly as per
manufacturer's instructions.
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of slides to
validate the hybridization process.
• Document all quality control measures, including any corrective
actions taken if abnormalities are found.
F. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Ensure accurate documentation of patient information,
specimen details, and test results.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Generate a report summarizing the FISH analysis and
interpret the findings in the context of plasma cell
proliferative disorders.
◦ Verify and review the report before releasing the results to
the patient's electronic health record (EHR).
4. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents and samples according to material safety
data sheet (MSDS) guidelines.
• Dispose of waste materials in compliance with local regulations.
5. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for FISH probes and
reagents.
• Standard laboratory protocols for bone marrow processing and
analysis.
This SOP provides thorough instructions to ensure the consistent and
accurate analysis of plasma cell proliferative disorders using FISH on
bone marrow specimens. Compliance with these guidelines is
essential for maintaining the quality and reliability of test results.
