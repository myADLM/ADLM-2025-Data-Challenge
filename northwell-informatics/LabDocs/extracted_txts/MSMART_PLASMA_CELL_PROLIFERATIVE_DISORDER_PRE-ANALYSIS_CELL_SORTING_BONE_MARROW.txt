Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MSMART
Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder, Pre-Analysis Cell
Sorting, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for performing
pre-analysis cell sorting for bone marrow samples of patients
being assessed for MSMART Plasma Cell Proliferative
Disorder.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the pre-
analytical preparation, cell sorting, and quality control of bone
marrow samples in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to
follow this protocol precisely to ensure the validity and
reliability of results.
◦ Supervisors must ensure appropriate training and
adherence to this protocol and address any issues that may
arise during this process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
▪ Bone marrow aspirate collected in an EDTA tube.
▪ Minimum volume of 2 mL.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen:
▪ Clotted specimens.
▪ Specimens containing insufficient volume for testing.
▪ Specimens with visible contamination or improper
labeling.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Flow Cytometer with cell sorting capability
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Sterile polystyrene tubes
◦ Micro-pipettes and tips
◦ Fluorescent antibodies for plasma cell markers (e.g., CD38,
CD138)
◦ Cell sorting buffer (PBS with 2% FBS)
◦ Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Verify the patient's identification and specimen labeling
against the work order before processing the bone
marrow aspirate.
2. Gently mix the bone marrow sample by inversion 8-10
times to ensure homogeneity.
3. Transfer the bone marrow sample into a sterile
polystyrene tube.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 500 x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
5. Carefully remove the supernatant, leaving the pellet
undisturbed.
6. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of cell sorting buffer.
B. Cell Staining:
1. Aliquot 100 µL of the resuspended cells into a new sterile
polystyrene tube.
2. Add the appropriate volume of fluorescent antibodies
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Incubate the mixture at 4°C for 30 minutes in the dark.
4. Wash the cells with 2 mL of cell sorting buffer.
5. Centrifuge the tube at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
6. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in
500 µL of cell sorting buffer for analysis.
C. Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting:
1. Ensure the flow cytometer is calibrated according to the
manufacturer's instructions before use.
2. Load the stained cell suspension into the flow cytometer.
3. Set up the flow cytometer to detect the fluorescent
markers for plasma cells.
4. Run the samples through the flow cytometer, ensuring
proper sorting gates are set.
5. Sort the plasma cells into a sterile collection tube.
6. Collect the sorted plasma cells for further analysis.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls during
staining and sorting steps.
◦ Validate flow cytometer settings and performance daily with
calibration beads and standards.
◦ Document all steps and any deviations from the protocol,
along with corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Ensure sorted plasma cells are appropriately labeled and
sent for downstream analysis.
◦ Complete the laboratory worksheet with all relevant details
including specimen ID, sorting date, and operator initials.
◦ Record any issues encountered during processing and
sorting in the laboratory logbook.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Not applicable for this pre-analysis sorting protocol.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure antibodies are stored and used according to
manufacturer recommendations to maintain their
effectiveness.
◦ Accurate gating and sorting on the flow cytometer depend
on proper calibration and operator expertise.
11. REFERENCES
◦ Refer to the flow cytometer user manual and antibody
product inserts for detailed technical information and
troubleshooting.
12. DOCUMENTATION AND REVISION
◦ This protocol is to be reviewed annually or as needed based
on advancements in technology or procedural changes.
◦ Version updates and revisions should be documented and
approved by the laboratory supervisor.
