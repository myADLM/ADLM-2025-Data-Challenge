Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MUCIN 2, IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to specify the process for the
immunostaining of MUCIN 2 in tissue samples, covering from the
receipt of the specimen to the generation of technical results. This
SOP aims to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reproducibility in the
results of MUCIN 2 immunostaining.
Responsibility:
The responsibility for carrying out this procedure lies with trained
laboratory technologists and histotechnologists.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples
• Fresh tissue samples properly fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin for 6-24 hours before embedding
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissues not fixed in formalin or fixed for less than 6 hours
• Over-fixed samples (fixed for more than 24 hours)
• Samples with improper labeling or insufficient clinical information
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Immunostaining instruments (e.g., automated stainer)
• Microscope
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%)
• Distilled water
• 10% neutral-buffered formalin
• MUCIN 2 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for counterstaining
• Mounting medium
4. SAFETY
• Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and eye protection when handling biological specimens and
hazardous chemicals.
• Dispose of waste materials according to the laboratory’s biosafety
and chemical safety protocols.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sectioning and Pre-treatment:
1. Prepare 4-5 µm tissue sections using a microtome.
2. Place sections on positively charged slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour or overnight at 37°C.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each)
◦ 95% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes)
◦ 70% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes)
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or alternative recommended buffer.
◦ Heat in microwave or pressure cooker according to antigen
retrieval protocol.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the buffer.
D) Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections in
3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse in distilled water and then in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS).
3. Apply protein block (e.g., 10% normal serum) for 20 minutes to
reduce nonspecific binding.
4. Incubate slides with primary MUCIN 2 antibody diluted in
antibody diluent for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at
4°C.
5. Rinse slides in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
6. Apply secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) for 30 minutes.
7. Rinse slides in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
8. Incubate with DAB substrate until desired color intensity
develops (usually 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse thoroughly in distilled water.
10. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
11. Rinse in tap water until clear.
12. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series:
• 70% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes)
• 95% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes)
• 100% ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each)
1. Clear in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
E) Mounting:
1. Mount slides with a permanent mounting medium.
2. Allow slides to dry thoroughly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each staining run to
ensure the accuracy of the immunostaining process.
• Review control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
limits before interpreting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Technical Component Only:
• Interpret completed slides under a microscope.
• Ensure quality and consistency of staining.
• Forward stained slides to the pathologist for diagnostic
interpretation with appropriate documentation.
8. PROCEDURE LIMITATIONS
• Variability in antigen retrieval and staining could affect results;
always follow standardized protocols.
• Weak or absent staining may be due to poor fixation, inadequate
antigen retrieval, or incorrect primary antibody concentration.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the specific reagents and
antibodies used (MUCIN 2 antibody datasheets). Follow appropriate
histopathology technical manuals.
