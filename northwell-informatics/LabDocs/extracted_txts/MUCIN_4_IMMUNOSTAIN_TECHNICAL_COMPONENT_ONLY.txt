Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MUCIN 4 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the method for performing the technical steps
involved in the MUCIN 4 immunostain procedure on tissue samples.
This includes equipment setup, sample preparation, and the
execution of the staining procedure to ensure consistent and
accurate test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel trained in immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining techniques are responsible for performing and
documenting the MUCIN 4 immunostain procedure according to this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff members are
trained and the SOP is followed.
2. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Tissue sections should be cut at 3-4 microns thick and placed on
positively charged slides.
• Ensure all specimens are properly labeled with unique identifiers.
Specimen Storage:
• Tissue blocks should be stored at room temperature.
• Cut slides should be used immediately or stored at 4°C for no
more than 24 hours.
3. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled Water
• Citrate Buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval
• Hydrogen Peroxide (3%)
• Universal Blocking Reagent
• MUCIN 4 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB (diaminobenzidine) Substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
Supplies:
• Positively charged slides
• Slide racks
• Humidity chamber
Equipment:
• Automated or manual slide stainer
• Water bath (set to 95-100°C for antigen retrieval)
• Timer
• Microscope
4. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Incubate slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
• Transfer slides through a series of ethanols: 100% (2 x 3
minutes), 95% (3 minutes), and 70% (3 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
• Place slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
• Heat in water bath at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
• Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
• Incubate slides in universal blocking reagent for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
• Tap off excess reagent but do not rinse.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply MUCIN 4 primary antibody to slides.
• Incubate in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
F. Washing:
• Rinse slides in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) for 3 x 5 minutes.
G. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to slides.
• Incubate in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
H. Washing:
• Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
I. Substrate Chromogen Reaction:
• Apply DAB substrate to slides.
• Incubate for 5-10 minutes at room temperature (observe under
microscope for optimal color development).
J. Counterstaining:
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in tap water.
• Blue slides in 0.3% ammonia water or tap water for 1 minute.
K. Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate through graded ethanols: 70%, 95%, and 100% (3
minutes each).
• Clear in xylene (2 x 5 minutes).
• Mount with a coverslip using a compatible mounting medium.
L. Quality Control:
• Include positive control tissue known to express MUCIN 4 and a
negative control slide where primary antibody is omitted.
• Document all control and patient sample results.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Technical Component Only:
• The slides will be delivered to the pathologist for interpretation.
• Record the completion of the technical component in the
laboratory information system (LIS) and ensure all documentation
is accurate.

• MUCIN 4 Antibody Product Insert.
• General IHC Staining Protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Quality Control:
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
• Verify proper function of all equipment before use.
• Validate all batches of staining with control slides to ensure
staining quality and reproducibility.
Troubleshooting:
• Weak or no staining: Check antibody expiration, ensure proper
antigen retrieval.
• Non-specific staining: Increase blocking time, optimize antibody
dilution.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures adherence to
consistent techniques while performing MUCIN 4 immunostaining,
thereby maintaining high accuracy and reliability of the test results.
