Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MUCIN 5AC, IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of performing MUCIN 5AC (MUC5AC) immunostain on tissue
samples, ensuring accurate and reproducible results. This procedure
will cover the preparation, staining, analysis, and documentation of
results for the technical component only.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and validating the immunostain procedure according to
this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues that
may affect the quality of the results and address them promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Specimens:
▪ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
▪ Fresh frozen tissue sections.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Specimens not properly fixed or embedded.
▪ Sections that are too thick or too thin (optimally 4-5
microns).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Positive charged microscope slides
◦ Hot plate or slide warmer
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
◦ Distilled water
◦ Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) solution (Citrate
buffer, pH 6.0)
◦ MUC5AC primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody Polymer-HRP kit
◦ DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Coverslips and mounting medium
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning and Slide Preparation:
1. Cut paraffin-embedded tissue sections at 4-5 microns using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C to flatten, then
collect on positively charged slides.
3. Allow slides to dry overnight at room temperature or on a hot
plate at 37-40°C for 1-2 hours.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
and 70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Heat-induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
1. Place slides in a staining rack and immerse in citrate buffer (pH
6.0).
2. Heat the buffer with slides in a microwave or water bath to
95-100°C for 20 minutes.
3. Allow to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse in distilled water and then in PBS for 5 minutes.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply MUC5AC primary antibody diluted according to
manufacturer's instruction and incubate at room temperature for
60 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply secondary antibody polymer-HRP and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Apply DAB substrate and incubate until a brown color develops
(1-3 minutes).
4. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
G. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene.
4. Mount coverslips using a synthetic mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative control slides with
each staining run.
◦ Document all control results and any deviations observed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Technical findings should be documented and submitted for
pathologist review.
◦ Report the staining intensity and pattern as observed in
control and patient slides.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date and
stored according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Verify the integrity of tissue sections and their proper
adherence to slides.
◦ Repeat the staining process if there are signs of non-
specific staining, weak staining, or background staining.
