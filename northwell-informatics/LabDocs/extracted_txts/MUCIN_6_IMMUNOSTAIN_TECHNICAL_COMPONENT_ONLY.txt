SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for MUCIN 6
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and consistent preparation,
staining, and analysis of tissues for MUCIN 6 immunostaining. This
protocol covers the technical component only and specifies the steps
to be taken for processing, staining, and analyzing prepared tissue
specimens to generate reliable immunohistochemical results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all histopathology laboratory
staff conducting MUCIN 6 immunostaining in the analytical phase.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory technicians are responsible for accurately following
the staining protocol and maintaining proper documentation.
• Pathologists will interpret the stained slides and provide the
diagnostic report.
• Supervisors must ensure all staff are trained and competency-
verified on this procedure.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Staining racks and trays
• Slide warmer
• MUCIN 6 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (appropriate for primary antibody species)
• Immunostaining detection system (e.g., DAB, HRP-conjugated
polymer)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
• Deparaffinization agents (e.g., xylene, ethanol)
• Retrieving agents (e.g., Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer,
pH 9.0)
• PBS buffer
• Coverslips
• Microscope
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
• Cut tissue sections at 4 microns thick.
• Place sections on positively charged slides.
• Dry slides overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Heat the slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour to melt the
paraffin.
2. Deparaffinize the slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes
each.
3. Rehydrate through descending concentrations of ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70%), 5 minutes each.
4. Rinse in running distilled water for 5 minutes.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a retrieval container filled with the appropriate
antigen retrieval buffer.
2. Heat in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., 95-100°C for 20-30
minutes).
3. Allow the slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
4. Rinse in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
C. Blocking
1. Apply a blocking serum or buffer to each slide to block
nonspecific binding. Incubate for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Tap off excess blocking reagent without rinsing.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply MUCIN 6 primary antibody to each slide, ensuring
complete coverage of the tissue section.
2. Incubate the slides for the period and at the temperature
recommended by the antibody supplier, typically 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.
3. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes, three changes.
E. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the secondary antibody to each slide according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Incubate for the time recommended by the product insert,
usually 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes, three changes.
F. Detection
1. Apply the detection system (e.g., DAB) to the slides and
monitor under a microscope for the development of a brown
color. Usually, this takes 5-10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running distilled water when the desired intensity
of staining is achieved.
G. Counterstaining (Optional)
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to visualize
nuclei.
2. Rinse in distilled water and dip briefly in weak ammonium
hydroxide or blueing solution.
3. Rinse in running distilled water for 5 minutes.
H. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate through ascending concentrations of ethanol (70%,
95%, 100%), 5 minutes each.
2. Clear in xylene, three changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Mount coverslips with permanent mounting media.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Use positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining to ensure the staining quality.
2. Document any deviation from the protocol and notify the
supervisor immediately.
3. Review the stained slides under a microscope to verify uniform
staining and absence of background.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Upon completion of the staining process, slides should be
reviewed by a qualified pathologist for interpretation.
2. Document and report findings consistent with laboratory
protocols for immunohistochemistry results.
