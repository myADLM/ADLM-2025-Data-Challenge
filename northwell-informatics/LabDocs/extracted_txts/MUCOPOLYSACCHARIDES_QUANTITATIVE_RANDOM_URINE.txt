Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Mucopolysaccharides Quantitative,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps required for the analytical phase of generating
results for Mucopolysaccharides Quantitative, Random, Urine testing.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all Mucopolysaccharides Quantitative,
Random, Urine tests conducted within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in urine mucopolysaccharides
quantification are responsible for this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to this
SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10-20 mL random urine specimen collected in a sterile container.
• Specimen must be delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection.
• If transportation will be delayed, the specimen should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C and delivered within 24 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens exceeding 2 hours at room temperature or 24 hours
refrigerated.
• Specimens with preservatives other than those recommended.
• Containers that are not sterile or are improperly labeled.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Urine centrifuge
• Microplate reader capable of analyzing absorbance
• Mucopolysaccharides Quantitative Diagnostic Kit
• Deionized water and various buffers as per kit instructions
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microwell plates and covers
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Phase
1. Receiving Specimen:
◦ Verify specimen integrity by checking the temperature and
physical appearance (e.g., no visible contamination or
hemolysis).
2. Storage:
◦ If analysis is not immediate, store specimens at 2-8°C and
ensure testing is performed within 24 hours.
B. Analytical Phase
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for calibrating the
microplate reader using standard solutions provided in the
kit.
◦ Perform quality control (QC) using known control materials.
Document all QC results and ensure they are within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare reagents, buffers, and standards according to the
kit’s instructions. Bring all reagents and specimens to room
temperature before the assay.
3. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge urine specimens at 1000-2000g for 10 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube for analysis.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the
mucopolysaccharide assay, typically involving the following
steps: a. Pipette a specified volume of the urine sample,
calibrators, and controls into assigned wells of the microwell
plate. b. Add reagents sequentially as per the protocol
ensuring thorough mixing where specified. c. Incubate the
plate at the times and temperatures specified in the assay
protocol. d. Measure absorbance at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
5. Calculation:
◦ Use the calibration curve generated from the standard
solutions to determine the concentration of
mucopolysaccharides in patient specimens.
◦ Ensure all calculations are verified for accuracy and within
assay linearity limits.
C. Post-Analytical Phase
1. Result Reporting:
◦ Review calculated results for all samples and QC data.
◦ Report results via the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Critical results or outliers should be rechecked and flagged
for supervisor review.
2. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all observations, calibration data, QC results, and
calculations are documented in the appropriate logs.
◦ Maintain records in accordance with laboratory policies and
CLIA guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in regular proficiency testing as mandated by
regulatory bodies.
• Maintain up-to-date QC logs and ensure timely review by the
supervisor.
• Ensure all staff are trained and competent in performing the assay
and adhere strictly to SOPs.
