Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDES QUANTITATIVE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate quantification of
mucopolysaccharides in serum samples. This analysis helps
diagnose and monitor disorders related to mucopolysaccharide
metabolism, such as mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis of serum mucopolysaccharides, adhering
to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff
compliance with the SOP and addressing any deviations from the
procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Mucopolysaccharides (MPS): Also known as glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs), these are long chains of sugar molecules that are found in
the body’s connective tissues.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL of serum, collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples; samples
not labeled or without collection date/time.
2. Handling and Storage:
• Upon receipt, centrifuge the sample at 1,300 – 1,800 x g for 10–
15 minutes.
• Transfer the serum to a labeled polypropylene tube.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within
24 hours. For long-term storage (>24 hours), freeze at -20°C or
lower.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Standards and Controls:
• Prepare a series of mucopolysaccharide standards of known
concentrations.
• Prepare quality control materials with low, medium, and high
concentrations of mucopolysaccharides.
• Store reagents as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
2. Buffer and Reagent Solutions:
• Prepare all buffers and reagents necessary for the
mucopolysaccharide quantification assay as per kit instructions or
validated in-house protocol.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Enzyme Digestion (if applicable):
• Treat serum samples with enzyme (e.g., chondroitinase) as
instructed to degrade specific mucopolysaccharides.
• Incubate the mixture at the recommended temperature (e.g.,
37°C) for the specified time to ensure complete digestion.
2. Quantification Assay:
• Follow the specific protocol for the mucopolysaccharide
quantification kit being used (colorimetric, fluorometric, etc.).
◦ Typically involves adding detection reagents to enzymatically
treated samples.
◦ Incubate under specified conditions.
◦ Measure absorbance or fluorescence using a microplate
reader or appropriate instrument.
3. Calibration and Controls:
• Run standards and controls alongside the serum samples.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting absorbance/fluorescence
against known concentrations of mucopolysaccharides.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
mucopolysaccharides in the serum samples.
D. Quality Control:
• Analyze quality control samples in each assay run.
• Acceptable ranges for controls should be established based on
historical data or manufacturer’s guidelines.
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, investigate and
resolve before reporting sample results.
E. Reporting Results:
• Calculate the concentration of mucopolysaccharides in serum
samples using the standard curve.
• Compare results to reference intervals (if available) and interpret
findings in the clinical context.
• Report results in mg/dL or appropriate units.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and repeat analyses
as necessary.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Performance characteristics may vary with assay kits and
reagents. Refer to the specific kit’s insert for limitations.
◦ Interference may occur with hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
