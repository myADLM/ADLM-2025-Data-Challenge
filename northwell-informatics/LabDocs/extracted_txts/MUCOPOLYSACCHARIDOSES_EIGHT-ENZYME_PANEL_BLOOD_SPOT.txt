Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Mucopolysaccharidoses, Eight-Enzyme Panel, Blood Spot
1. Purpose
To define the procedures for the analysis of Mucopolysaccharidoses
(MPS) enzymes using dried blood spot (DBS) samples and ensuring
accurate and reliable results.
1. Scope
This procedure applies to the analysis of DBS samples for the MPS
eight-enzyme panel, which includes the following enzymes:
• α-L-iduronidase
• Iduronate-2-sulfatase
• Heparan N-sulfatase
• N-Acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase
• β-Glucuronidase
• α-N-Acetylglucosaminidase
• β-Galactosidase
• β-Hexosaminidase
1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to ensure that
this protocol is followed diligently. It includes processing DBS
samples, performing quality control, and validating and reporting
results.
4. Definition/Background
Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited lysosomal storage
disorders caused by deficiency in specific lysosomal enzymes
needed to degrade glycosaminoglycans. Analyzing enzyme activity in
blood spots is a feasible alternative to traditional methods, providing
a less invasive and more convenient means to obtain samples.
5. Materials
• DBS sample cards
• Specific substrates and inhibitors for each enzyme
• Assay reagents
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubators or water baths
• Plate readers capable of fluorescence detection
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Quality control materials
• Calibration curves if applicable
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify sample integrity and ensure proper information is
provided with each DBS card.
2. Using a punch, collect a 3mm diameter disc from the DBS card
and transfer to a microplate or tube suitable for enzyme assay.
3. Include quality control spots as per the laboratory guidelines.
Enzyme Assay:
1. For each enzyme to be tested, prepare specific substrates and
buffers as recommended in product insert or validated protocol.
2. Add appropriate amounts of substrate buffer and other
necessary reagents to the wells containing the blood spots and
quality control materials.
3. Incubate the reaction mixture under optimal conditions, specific
to each enzyme (e.g., temperature, pH, time) as indicated in the
validated enzyme assay protocol.
4. Stop the reaction by adding stopping solution or by transferring
to cold storage if applicable.
Measurement:
1. Measure fluorescence intensity or absorbance using a plate
reader. Ensure that the plate reader settings are optimized for
the assays and recorded accordingly.
2. Calibrate the instrument as necessary and document calibration
in the equipment log.
Quality Control:
1. Run controls in each assay batch, including both positive and
negative controls.
2. Ensure results from the controls are within the acceptable
range before validating patient results.
3. Implement troubleshooting procedures if controls fall outside
the acceptable range and repeat the assay if necessary.
Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Analyze the data generated from the plate reader using
validated software.
2. Calculate the enzyme activity for each sample by comparing
the sample readings to calibration standards.
3. Validate the results by cross-checking controls and verifying
calculations.
4. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. Results should be reviewed and signed off by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
Maintenance of Records:
1. Store all DBS samples, any derived materials, and data
securely for future reference and audits according to the
laboratory protocol.
2. Maintain an accurate record of all assays performed, including
QC results and any deviations or corrective actions taken.
7. Reference Intervals: Specific reference intervals for each
enzyme's activity should be used as guides, which should be
reviewed periodically based on the most up-to-date clinical
guidelines.
8. Critical Results: Report critical results directly to the requesting
physician following laboratory guidelines on critical result notification.
9. References:
• Laboratory-developed validation studies
• Product inserts for each enzyme assay used
• Relevant publications and clinical guidelines on MPS enzyme
analysis
10. Attachments:
• Quality control data log
• Sample tracking logs
• Enzyme assay protocols and troubleshooting guides
• Contact information for key laboratory personnel.
By adhering to this protocol, the analytical phase for the MPS Eight-
Enzyme Panel will yield reliable and accurate results, contributing
significantly to patient care.
