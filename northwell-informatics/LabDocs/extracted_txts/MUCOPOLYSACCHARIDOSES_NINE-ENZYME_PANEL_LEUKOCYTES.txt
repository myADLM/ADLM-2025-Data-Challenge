Nine-Enzyme Panel, Leukocytes
Document Number: SOP-MPS-01
Date of Implementation: [Date]
Revision Number: 1.0
Reviewed By: [Lab Supervisor's Name]
Approved By: [Lab Director's Name]
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase for testing
mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) via the nine-enzyme panel in
leukocytes. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who will analyze patient
samples for MPS using the nine-enzyme panel in leukocytes.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of the designated testing personnel to carry
out the procedures as defined in this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors must ensure tests are performed under
appropriate conditions and that corrective actions are taken as
necessary.
• Quality assurance personnel must review and validate the results.
4. DEFINITIONS
Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS): A group of inherited lysosomal
storage diseases caused by the absence or malfunctioning of specific
enzymes needed to break down glycosaminoglycans.
5. SPECIMEN INFORMATION
Specimen Type:
• Leukocytes isolated from whole blood.
Specimen Collection:
• Ensure specimens are collected, received, and accessioned
according to the laboratory protocol.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Store leukocyte pellets at -20°C or colder until testing.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microcentrifuge
• Incubator with a range of 37°C ± 1°C
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Fluorometer/plate reader
Reagents:
• Buffer solutions specific to each enzyme assay.
• Substrates for each of the nine enzymes.
• Standard enzyme preparations.
• Stop solutions for reaction termination.
Supplies:
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• 96-well plates
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PPE
• Calibration standards for the fluorometer/plate reader
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare buffer solutions and substrates according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Thaw leukocyte pellets on ice just before use.
2. Standard Curve Preparation:
◦ Prepare a series of dilutions for each enzyme's standard to
generate a standard curve for quantification.
B. Enzyme Assay
1. Leukocyte Lysis:
◦ Resuspend the leukocyte pellet in the appropriate lysis
buffer.
◦ Vortex to ensure complete lysis.
◦ Centrifuge at 13,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube for analysis.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Pipette the leukocyte lysate into a 96-well plate.
◦ Add the specific substrate for the enzyme being tested to
each well.
◦ Include the appropriate controls (positive, negative, blank).
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the required length of time
specified in the assay protocol (typically 1-4 hours).
4. Reaction Termination:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
5. Fluorescence Measurement:
◦ Measure the fluorescence or absorbance using the
fluorometer/plate reader.
◦ Record the readings, ensuring consistent calibration of the
instrument.
C. Data Analysis
1. Standard Curve Generation:
◦ Use the standard dilutions to generate a standard curve.
◦ Calculate the enzyme activity in the leukocyte lysates by
comparing the fluorescence to the standard curve.
2. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the enzyme activity for each sample. The result is
usually expressed as nmol/hr/mg protein.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples with known enzyme activities to
validate the assay.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer data to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review all results for accuracy.
• Flag any results that fall outside of the established normal or
critical ranges.
• Validate and verify results before final reporting.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform enzyme activity assays on quality control samples in
each assay batch.
• Document and review QC results; take corrective actions if QC
samples fall outside acceptable ranges.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs when available.

• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Manufacturer instructions for enzyme substrates and buffers.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on MPS enzyme assays.

Date of Revision: N/A
Next Review Date: [Date]
Documentation of any protocol deviation must be recorded and
approved by lab supervisory staff, and any updates or changes to this
SOP must be reviewed and approved before implementation.
This SOP is to be strictly followed to ensure accurate and reliable
enzyme analysis for MPS in leukocytes. Should there be any
concerns or queries, please consult the laboratory supervisor.
