Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), Blood
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for analyzing blood specimens for
mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) to ensure reliable, accurate, and
timely results.
2. Specimen Requirements
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Minimum volume: 2–3 mL.
• The specimen should be mixed thoroughly by gentle inversion
immediately after collection to avoid clotting.
• Transport to the laboratory at 4°C as soon as possible, preferably
within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identification.
• Specimens received at the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection.
• Hemolyzed specimens.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Laboratory vortex
• Lyophilization unit
• Protein precipitation reagents
• Enzyme activity assay kits specific for MPS subtypes (e.g., Hunter
Syndrome, Hurler Syndrome)
• Microplate reader capable of measuring fluorescence or
absorbance (depending on assay type)
• Calibration standards and quality control material
• Data recording software or Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. Analytical Procedure
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen label information against the
requisition form.
2. Update the LIS with the specimen's arrival and processing
status.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500–2000x g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma.
4. Carefully aliquot the plasma into labeled microcentrifuge tubes
and store at -20°C if not immediately processed.
B. Enzyme Activity Assay (General Procedure):
1. Thaw plasma specimens and quality control materials on ice.
2. Prepare standards and calibration curve as per the
manufacturer’s instruction for the specific enzyme assay kit
used.
3. Pipette appropriate volumes of plasma sample, standards, and
controls into a 96-well microplate according to the assay layout.
4. Add substrate and other reagents as required by the kit
protocol.
5. Incubate the reaction mixture at the specified temperature for
the recommended time.
6. Measure the enzymatic activity using a microplate reader set to
the specified wavelength for absorbance or fluorescence.
C. Calculations and Interpretation:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance/
fluorescence of the standards against their concentrations.
2. Determine the enzyme activity of the specimens by
interpolation from the standard curve.
3. Compare patient results against established reference intervals
for the specific type of MPS.
4. Calculate and document the quality control metrics to ensure
the integrity of the assay.
5. Quality Control
• Run at least two levels of quality control material (low and high)
with each set of patient samples.
• Verify that quality control results are within the established
acceptable ranges.
• Document any deviations and take corrective action if necessary.
6. Reporting Results
• Review the calculated enzyme activity values.
• Report results as enzyme activity units per volume of plasma
(e.g., nmol/hour/mL).
• Include in the report:
◦ Patient identification and specimen details.
◦ Enzyme activity levels.
◦ Interpretation of results based on reference ranges.
◦ Any observed issues with specimen integrity or assay
performance.
• Verify all results in the LIS before releasing the report.
7. Method Limitations
Refer to manufacturer’s insert for each specific assay for details on:
• Sensitivity and specificity of the test.
• Potential interferences.
• Assay limitations and sources of error.
8. References
• Manufacturer’s assay manual for enzyme activity kits.
• Laboratory policies and guidelines.
• Recent relevant literature and clinical guidelines from accredited
sources.
This protocol ensures standardization, reliability, and high quality in
the generation of results for Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) testing,
ultimately aiding in accurate diagnosis and patient care.
