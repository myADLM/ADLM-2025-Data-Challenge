Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) using blood spot specimens. The aim
is to ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency in testing, thereby
aiding in the diagnosis of MPS.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
and reporting of MPS from blood spot specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Trained laboratory personnel shall follow this SOP for MPS
testing.
• Supervisors or designated staff shall ensure adherence to this
SOP and address any deviations.
• Quality control personnel shall ensure that all QC procedures are
followed and documented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
4.1. Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Dried blood spot (DBS) collected on specialized filter paper (e.g.,
Whatman 903) from a heel-prick or finger-prick.
• Specimens should be completely dried, labeled, and stored at
room temperature.
4.2. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Blood spots that are not fully soaked through the filter paper.
• Specimens with incomplete or missing labeling.
• Blood spots that appear contaminated or improperly stored.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Mass Spectrometer or equivalent analytical instrument.
• Extraction buffer.
• Calibration standards and controls for MPS enzymes.
• Multichannel Pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Appropriate consumables (e.g., microcentrifuge tubes, reagent
reservoirs, etc.).
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation of Standards and Controls:
• Prepare calibration standards and quality controls according to
manufacturer guidelines. Ensure that all solutions are properly
labeled and stored.
6.2. Sample Preparation:
• Punch out a 3.2 mm (1/8 inch) disk from the dried blood spot
specimen and place it into a microcentrifuge tube.
• Add the specified volume of extraction buffer to the tube.
• Vortex the tube for 1-2 minutes to ensure complete wetting of the
blood spot.
• Incubate the tube at 37°C for 1-2 hours to allow for enzyme
elution.
6.3. Analysis:
• Load the prepared extracts, calibration standards, and quality
control samples onto the mass spectrometer, following the
manufacturer’s instructions for sample introduction and analysis.
• Run the analysis sequence, ensuring that calibration and control
samples are included at the beginning, middle, and end of the
batch.
6.4. Data Collection:
• Collect raw data for each sample and control. The peak areas or
signals corresponding to specific MPS enzymes should be
obtained and recorded.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze at least two levels of quality control samples with each
batch of patient specimens.
• Ensure control results are within acceptable limits before reporting
patient results. If controls are out of range, re-calibrate the
instrument, re-run controls and samples, and document any
corrective actions taken.
7.2. External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing for MPS regularly,
recording and addressing any discrepancies.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1. Data Interpretation:
• Calculate enzyme activities for each patient sample using the
standard curve generated from the calibration standards.
• Compare the enzyme activity levels to established reference
ranges for MPS.
8.2. Reporting:
• Document final results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify the results before releasing the report.
Document any notable findings or comments about the sample
integrity.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
9.1. Detection Limits:
• Be aware of the sensitivity and specificity of the chosen analytical
technique for MPS enzymes.
9.2. Interferences:
• Note any substances that may interfere with the analysis and
interpret the results cautiously if such interferences are
suspected.
1. REFERENCES
• MPS Assay Kit manufacturer’s insert and guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature on blood spot analysis for MPS.
• Laboratory quality control and proficiency testing program
documentation.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect any
changes in procedures, equipment, or regulations.
