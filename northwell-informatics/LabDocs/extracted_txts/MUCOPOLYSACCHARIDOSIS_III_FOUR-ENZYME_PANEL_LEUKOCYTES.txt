Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Mucopolysaccharidosis III, Four-
Enzyme Panel, Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed
analytical procedures to generate accurate results for the
Mucopolysaccharidosis III, Four-Enzyme Panel in leukocytes. This
includes enzyme preparation, assay execution, quality control, and
result reporting to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the
diagnostic test.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to perform and document all procedures for the
Mucopolysaccharidosis III, Four-Enzyme Panel. The laboratory
supervisor must review and validate these results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to the analysis of leukocyte samples for
detection of Mucopolysaccharidosis III (MPS III) by measuring the
activity of four specific enzymes:
1. Heparan N-sulfatase (Sulfamidase)
2. N-Acetylglucosaminidase (Alpha-NAGLU)
3. N-Acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase (G6S)
4. N-Acetyltransferase (NAT)
3. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• MPS III: Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III
• Leukocytes: White blood cells isolated from collected blood
samples
• QC: Quality Control
• LIS: Laboratory Information System
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes
• Volume: Minimum of 5 mL blood
• Storage: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and processed
within 24 hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Lysis buffer
• Heparan N-sulfatase, NAGLU, G6S, and NAT enzyme-specific
substrates
• Fluorescent detection kit (e.g., 4-methylumbelliferone-based)
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Microplate reader with fluorescence detection
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
A) Leukocyte Isolation:
1. Centrifuge collected blood at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
2. Carefully remove the plasma, leaving the buffy coat layer
containing leukocytes.
3. Transfer the buffy coat to a new tube and add 5 mL of cold lysis
buffer.
4. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for another 10 minutes at 4°C.
5. Discard the supernatant and resuspend pelleted leukocytes in
an appropriate volume of cold lysis buffer.
B) Enzyme Assay Preparation:
1. Aliquot equal volumes of leukocyte suspension into four
separate tubes for each enzyme assay.
2. Prepare enzyme-specific substrates according to manufacturer
instructions.
3. Add an equal volume of substrate to each leukocyte aliquot and
mix thoroughly.
C) Enzyme Activity Measurement:
1. Incubate the reaction mixtures at 37°C for 2 hours.
2. Stop the reaction by placing tubes on ice and adding stop
solution according to kit instructions.
3. Transfer the reaction mixture to a microplate for fluorescence
detection.
4. Measure fluorescence using a microplate reader with
appropriate excitation and emission settings for 4-
methylumbelliferone.
D) Calculation of Enzyme Activity:
1. Calculate enzyme activity for each sample based on
fluorescence readings and a standard curve prepared with
known concentrations of product.
2. Normalize enzyme activity to protein concentration, determined
using a protein assay (e.g., BCA assay).
E) Quality Control:
1. Include QC samples with known enzyme activities in each
batch of tests.
2. Ensure QC results fall within the specified range before
accepting patient results.
3. Document all QC results in the laboratory QC log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. All enzyme activity results are reviewed and validated by the
laboratory supervisor.
2. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Report enzyme activities along with reference ranges. MPS III
diagnosis is based on decreased activities of all four enzymes.
