Standard Operating Procedure
Mucopolysaccharidosis III, Three-Enzyme Panel, Blood Spot
Analysis
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of
Mucopolysaccharidosis III (MPS III), including three-enzyme panel
testing, using blood spot specimens. This procedure is intended to
ensure accurate and reliable result generation.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document the analytical procedures as described. Any deviations
or issues should be reported to a supervisor immediately.
1. Materials and Equipment
• Blood spot filter paper cards
• Punch tool (for obtaining blood spot samples)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Buffered enzyme assay reagents
• Standard controls and calibrators
• Incubator
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Protective personal equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory bench and workspace
1. Sample Preparation
2. Specimen Requirements
◦ Preferred: Freshly collected blood spot on filter paper card,
dried completely.
◦ Acceptable: Dried blood spot within allowable stability
conditions (refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines).
3. Unacceptable Specimens
◦ Blood spots that are improperly dried.
◦ Specimens with insufficient sample volume.
◦ Damaged or contaminated filter paper cards.
◦ Specimens beyond acceptable stability period.
4. Handling Procedure
◦ Observe universal precautions and wear PPE.
◦ Handle filter paper cards gently and avoid touching the
blood spots directly.
5. Procedure
6. Calibration and Quality Control
◦ Prepare calibration standards and quality control materials
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run calibrators and quality control samples with each batch
of patient samples.
◦ Document and review results to ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
7. Enzyme Assay Setup
◦ Punch out a blood spot from the filter paper card using a
clean punch tool and place it into a labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of buffered enzyme assay
reagent to the tube.
◦ Incubate the tubes at the specified temperature and time as
recommended by the reagent’s manufacturer (typically 37°C
for 2-4 hours).
◦ Follow specific instructions for each enzyme reaction within
the panel: shearing enzyme substrate, incubation time, and
temperature.
8. Reading the Results
◦ After incubation, transfer the reaction mixtures to a
microplate.
◦ Load the microplate into the microplate reader.
◦ Determine the enzyme activity by measuring optical density
(OD) at the specified wavelength.
◦ Compare the OD readings to the calibration curve to
quantify enzyme activity.
9. Data Interpretation
◦ Verify the control sample results to ensure assay validity.
◦ Calculate the enzyme activities for patient samples using
the calibration curve.
◦ Compare the values against established reference ranges to
determine if the enzyme activity is normal or indicative of
MPS III.
10. Reporting Results
◦ Document the patient results in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a senior
technologist or a supervisor before releasing.
◦ Results are transmitted electronically to the referring
physician or healthcare provider.
11. Quality Control and Troubleshooting
◦ Perform internal quality control as per provided schedules.
◦ If quality control samples fail, do not proceed with sample
reporting. Troubleshoot the issue by checking for pipetting
errors, reagent issues, or instrument malfunction.
◦ If troubleshooting fails to resolve the issue, consult with the
laboratory supervisor and follow remedial action based on
laboratory guidelines.
12. Safety and Precautions
◦ Follow all safety protocols for handling biological specimens.
◦ Dispose of biohazard waste according to institutional
policies.
◦ Calibrate and maintain equipment regularly to ensure
accurate and safe operation.
13. Documentation and Record Keeping
◦ Record all calibration, quality control, and patient results in
the provided logs.
◦ Retain all records in compliance with institutional and
regulatory requirements.
◦ Ensure traceability of samples, calibration standards, and
control materials.
