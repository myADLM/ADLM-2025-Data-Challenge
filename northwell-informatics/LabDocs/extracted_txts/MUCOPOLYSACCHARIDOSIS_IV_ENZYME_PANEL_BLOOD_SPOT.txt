Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Mucopolysaccharidosis IV Enzyme Panel Testing Using Blood
Spots
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
Mucopolysaccharidosis IV (MPS IV) enzyme activity in dried blood
spot specimens. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable results that
aid in the diagnosis of MPS IV.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing the MPS IV enzyme panel analysis in blood spots.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel responsible for conducting the MPS IV enzyme
panel testing must follow this protocol strictly. The laboratory
supervisor ensures that staff are adequately trained and the
equipment is properly maintained and calibrated.
4. DEFINITIONS
• MPS IV: A group of genetic disorders characterized by the
deficiency of enzymes needed to break down
glycosaminoglycans.
• Enzyme Panel: A set of assays designed to measure the activity
of specific enzymes implicated in MPS IV.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Blood spot cards
• Puncher for blood spots
• 96-well microtiter plate
• Incubator
• Shaker
• Centrifuge
• Multi-channel pipette
• Reagent kits (specific for MPS IV enzyme assay)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Laboratory timer
• Gloves and PPE
• Calibration and control materials
• Laboratory notebook or electronic system for documentation
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Minimum required volume: One fully saturated blood spot on the
filter paper card.
• Specimens older than two weeks from collection should not be
used.
• Specimens visibly contaminated or improperly dried should be
rejected.
• Store blood spot cards at room temperature until analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation of Blood Spot Samples
1. Using a puncher, excise a 3.2 mm diameter punch from the
center of each dried blood spot.
2. Place the punched discs into the wells of a 96-well microtiter
plate.
7.2. Enzyme Extraction
1. Add 100 µL of the enzyme extraction buffer (as provided in the
reagent kit) to each well containing a blood spot punch.
2. Seal the microtiter plate with an appropriate cover to prevent
evaporation.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C with gentle shaking (approximately
600 rpm) for 2 hours to facilitate enzyme extraction.
7.3. Enzyme Assay
1. Following incubation, transfer the supernatant from each well
into a new microtiter plate.
2. Add 100 µL of the assay substrate solution to each well
containing the extracted enzyme solution.
3. Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for an optimal reaction time
as specified by the reagent kit (generally between 1 to 2 hours).
4. At the end of the incubation, add 100 µL of stop buffer to each
well to terminate the reactions.
7.4. Measurement
1. Transfer the plate to a microplate reader.
2. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence (depending on the
endpoint measurement required by the reagent kit).
3. Record the readings for each well.
8. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all equipment (especially the microplate reader) is
regularly calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
specifications.
• Include at least one positive control, one negative control, and two
levels of enzyme activity standards in each assay run.
• Document all QC results. If QC fails, identify the source of error
before proceeding with specimen analysis.
9. DATA ANALYSIS
1. Calculate the enzyme activity for each sample using the
standard curve generated from the enzyme activity standards.
2. Validate the results by ensuring all controls are within the
acceptable range.
3. Compare patient results with established reference ranges for
MPS IV enzyme activity.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by the technologist.
2. Document any sample and assay-specific issues affecting
result interpretation.
3. Communicate critical results promptly to the requesting
physician or healthcare provider following the laboratory’s
reporting policy.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper drying of blood spots. Inadequately dried samples
may lead to inaccurate results.
• Sample age: Specimens older than two weeks may show
degraded enzyme activity.
• Hemolysis or contamination may interfere with results.
