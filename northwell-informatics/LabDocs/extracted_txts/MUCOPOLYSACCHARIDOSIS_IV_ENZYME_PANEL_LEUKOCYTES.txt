Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Mucopolysaccharidosis IV (Morquio
Syndrome) Enzyme Panel, Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of the
Mucopolysaccharidosis IV (Morquio Syndrome) Enzyme Panel in
leukocytes. This panel evaluates the activity of enzymes associated
with Morquio Syndrome, specifically N-acetylgalactosamine-6-
sulfatase (GALNS) and beta-galactosidase (GLB1), to aid in the
diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis IV A and IV B.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
the Mucopolysaccharidosis IV Enzyme Panel on leukocyte samples
in the Biochemistry or Genetic Testing Laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the enzyme assays according
to this protocol.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure that laboratory technologists are
trained and proficient in the procedures.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor assay performance and
ensure that all QC parameters are met.
1. SPECIMEN
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood leukocytes
• Collection: Blood samples should be collected in EDTA tubes
and processed to isolate leukocytes within 24 hours of collection.
• Storage: Isolated leukocytes should be stored at -80°C until the
enzyme assays are performed.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Spectrophotometer or Fluorometer
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagent kits for GALNS and GLB1 enzyme activity assays
(commercially available or prepared in-house)
• Leukocyte lysis buffer
• Assay buffer
• Quality Control materials (Positive and Negative controls)
• Timer
• Ice bucket
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Isolation of Leukocytes: a. Process whole blood collected in
EDTA tubes using a density gradient centrifugation method to
isolate leukocytes. b. Wash leukocytes twice with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and resuspend in leukocyte lysis buffer. c.
Lyse cells by vortexing briefly and incubate on ice for 10
minutes. d. Centrifuge the lysate at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes
at 4°C to remove cell debris. e. Collect the supernatant
containing the enzyme extract and store on ice until assay.
2. Preparation of Reagents: a. Ensure all assay reagents and
buffers are prepared according to the manufacturer's
instructions or in-house protocols. b. Equilibrate samples,
controls, and reagents to room temperature before starting the
assay.
B. Enzyme Activity Assays
1. GALNS Enzyme Activity Assay: a. Pipette appropriate
amounts of leukocyte extract, assay buffer, and substrate
solution into assay tubes or microplate wells according to the
assay protocol. b. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for a
specified time (typically 1-2 hours). c. Stop the reaction by
adding the stop solution provided in the assay kit. d. Measure
the absorbance or fluorescence with a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer at the appropriate wavelength.
2. GLB1 Enzyme Activity Assay: a. Follow the steps as
described for GALNS, using the specific substrate and
conditions for GLB1. b. Record the absorbance or fluorescence
readings.
C. Quality Control
1. Perform the assays with Positive and Negative controls
alongside patient samples.
2. Run quality control samples with every batch of tests to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of the results.
3. Evaluate the quality control results and take corrective actions if
any control value falls outside the acceptable range.
D. Reporting Results
1. Calculate enzyme activities (e.g., nmol/hr/mg protein) based on
standard curves and sample absorbance/fluorescence
readings.
2. Compare results to established reference ranges for GALNS
and GLB1 enzyme activities.
3. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Review and verify all results before releasing them to the
ordering physician.
5. REFERENCE RANGES
• GALNS Activity: [provide specific reference range]
• GLB1 Activity: [provide specific reference range]
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality controls must be analyzed with each batch of samples.
• Document all quality control results and actions taken if controls
are out of range.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If enzyme activities are below the detection limit or significantly
deviated, confirm the integrity of reagents and repeat the assay.
• Ensure proper handling and storage of specimens and reagents
throughout the procedure to avoid any potential errors.
