Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
MUCOR, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedure for accurately and efficiently
generating results for MUCOR (fungal infection diagnosis),
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and serum-based tests.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory clinicians and technologists are responsible for
performing these tests according to this SOP and ensuring the
accuracy and reliability of results.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure quality
control procedures are rigorously followed.
1. DEFINITIONS
• MUCOR: Refers to a group of molds found in soil and decaying
organic matter. Mucor testing involves fungal cultures and
molecular detection.
• IgE (Immunoglobulin E): A class of antibodies produced by the
immune system, commonly measured to investigate allergies.
• Serum: The liquid part of blood after clotting has occurred, used
for various diagnostic tests.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• MUCOR: Tissue biopsies or swabs, preferably from the site of
infection.
• IgE: Serum or plasma. Collect blood in serum separator tubes
(SST).
• General Serum Tests: Serum collected from clotted blood in SST
tubes.
1. PROCEDURE
A. MUCOR Testing
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Immediately transport tissue biopsy or swabs in sterile
containers to the microbiology lab.
◦ Label specimens clearly with the patient's identification and
the date of collection.
2. Fungal Culture:
◦ Inoculate specimens on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) or
appropriate fungal culture media.
◦ Incubate at 25-30°C for up to 7 days, inspecting daily for
fungal growth.
◦ Perform microscopic examination using KOH preparation
and lactophenol cotton blue staining.
3. Molecular Detection:
◦ Extract DNA from tissue or swab samples following the DNA
extraction kit's protocol.
◦ Perform PCR using specific primers for Mucorales species.
◦ Analyze PCR products through gel electrophoresis or
quantitative PCR for confirmation.
B. IgE Testing
1. Specimen and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Use serum or plasma collected in SST tubes. Allow blood to
clot and centrifuge at 1500 g for 10 minutes.
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if testing within 24 hours. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C.
2. Testing Method:
◦ Use a commercially available ELISA kit or automated
analyzer specific for total IgE.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for sample and
reagent preparation, incubation times, and reading results.
3. Interpretation:
◦ Compare patient results to reference ranges provided by the
kit or analyzer.
◦ Report results in IU/mL.
C. General Serum Testing
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Collect blood in SST tubes, allow to clot for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500 g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is within 24 hours or freeze
at -20°C for long-term storage.
2. Testing Methods:
◦ Use appropriate assays (e.g., chemistry analyzers,
immunoassays) for the specific serum tests ordered.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for each specific
assay kit including sample preparation, reagent handling,
and instrument settings.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at multiple levels (e.g., low,
normal, high) with each batch.
◦ Ensure QC results are within acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results.
4. RESULT REPORTING
• Review and verify all test results before reporting.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical values must be promptly communicated to the requesting
physician or healthcare provider according to the laboratory's
critical value policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Ensure daily, weekly, and monthly quality control procedures are
conducted according to the laboratory's QC plan.
• Calibrate all instruments as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Maintain records of all QC and calibration activities.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to established laboratory reference intervals for Mucor culture,
IgE levels, and other serum-based tests. Update these intervals
periodically based on clinical validation and peer-reviewed literature.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit inserts and user manuals.
• Standard microbiology and immunology textbooks.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. CONTACT INFORMATION
For any queries or troubleshooting, contact the laboratory supervisor
or the on-call pathologist.
