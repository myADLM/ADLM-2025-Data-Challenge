Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MUGWORT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the process for the analytical phase of
generating results for Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples. The purpose is to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results in compliance with
regulatory requirements and laboratory best practices.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of Mugwort-specific IgE in serum samples using the
specified immunoassay techniques.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory technologists and technicians are responsible for
performing the analysis as per this SOP. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring personnel are adequately trained, and for reviewing and
validating results.
1. DEFINITIONS
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
responses. Mugwort: Artemisia vulgaris, an allergen commonly
associated with pollen allergies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP system, Siemens
Immulite, or another appropriate system)
• Mugwort-specific IgE assay kit/reagents (compatible with the
chosen analyzer)
• Calibrators and controls (supplied with the assay kit)
• Sample tubes: Red-top or serum-separator tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (if required by the assay protocol)
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum, collected using red-top or serum-
separator tubes (SST)
• Minimum volume: 1-2 mL serum
• Stability: Store serum specimens at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
• Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and functioning correctly.
• Verify the expiry dates of reagents, calibrators, and controls. Do
not use expired materials.
• Allow reagents, controls, and specimens to come to room
temperature before use.
• Mix the samples gently using a vortex mixer.
7.2 Sample and Control Preparation
• Centrifuge serum samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
obtain clear, unhemolyzed serum.
• Aliquot suitable volumes of serum, calibrators, and controls into
appropriate assay tubes or wells as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
7.3 Assay Setup
• Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the immunoassay
analyzer.
• Select the Mugwort-specific IgE assay protocol on the analyzer.
• Follow the analyzer’s instructions to perform the assay, including
any required incubations, washes, and readings.
7.4 Running the Assay
• Ensure that all steps are performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions, including the addition of reagents,
incubation times, washing steps, and reading the results.
• Perform the assay in duplicate for each sample to ensure
accuracy.
7.5 Quality Control
• Run quality control materials at low, medium, and high levels with
each batch of patient samples.
• Verify that control results are within the manufacturer’s specified
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Document and review any quality control failures and take
corrective actions as necessary.
1. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION
• Automatically review results transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for accuracy.
• Manually verify any flagged or atypical results according to
laboratory procedures.
• Report results in accordance with laboratory reporting protocols.
• Reference range for Mugwort-specific IgE: <0.35 kU/L (negative),
0.35-0.70 kU/L (borderline), >0.70 kU/L (positive).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all relevant data (sample ID, operator initials, date, and
time) in the appropriate logs.
• Maintain records of quality control results and any corrective
actions taken.
• Store all records in compliance with laboratory and regulatory
requirements.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific Mugwort-specific IgE
assay kit used.
• CLSI guidelines for immunoassay processing and quality control.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all revisions made to this SOP and ensure appropriate
approval and training are completed before implementing any
changes.
