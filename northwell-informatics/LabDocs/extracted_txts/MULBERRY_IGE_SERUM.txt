Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Determination of
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in Serum using MULBERRY Analyzer
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for the quantitative determination of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum
samples using the MULBERRY analyzer.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all clinical laboratory personnel trained in
the use of the MULBERRY analyzer for the determination of IgE
levels in serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
IgE testing in accordance with this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors must ensure that staff are adequately
trained and that quality control measures are adhered to.
4. SPECIMENS
4.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 3 mL of venous blood is collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• After collection, the sample should be allowed to clot for 30
minutes, followed by centrifugation at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
• The serum should be aliquoted into a sterile tube and can be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or at -20°C for longer periods.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with assay
results and should be rejected.
• Specimens received in the laboratory more than 7 days after
collection if stored at 2-8°C or improperly stored.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• MULBERRY Analyzer
• IgE Reagent Kit for MULBERRY (including calibrators and
controls)
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated laboratory refrigerator and freezer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
1. Perform a daily startup check on the MULBERRY analyzer as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure the calibrators and controls are prepared and at the
correct temperature before initiating testing.
6.2 Calibration:
1. Perform calibration using the IgE Calibrator provided in the kit.
2. Follow the instructions in the device manual to ensure accurate
calibration.
6.3 Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each testing
day, after every calibration, and when a new lot of reagents is
used.
2. Use two levels of quality control material (normal and high).
3. Document and review control results to ensure they fall within
the acceptable range.
6.4 Sample Analysis:
1. Load the prepared serum specimens, calibrators, and controls
into the MULBERRY analyzer.
2. Enter the sample identification details into the analyzer.
3. Follow the prompts on the analyzer to begin the run.
4. Upon completion, review the results for each sample, ensuring
they meet quality control standards.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify and document the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Report critical values according to the laboratory's critical value
policy. Critical IgE values should be confirmed by repeat
analysis.
3. If a specimen's IgE concentration is outside the reportable
range, dilute the specimen and reanalyze.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal IgE Levels (Reference Range): Typically, < 150 IU/mL for
adults. (Consult specific references or clinical guidelines for
pediatric and age-specific ranges).
9. QUALITY CONTROL/ASSURANCE
• Ensure all equipment is regularly maintained and calibrated.
• Monitor quality control results and maintain control charts.
• Troubleshoot any discrepancies or errors promptly and document
corrective actions.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences in the assay can occur from hemolyzed or lipemic
samples.
• Ensure sample integrity by proper collection, storage, and
handling.

12. DOCUMENTATION
• All records of specimen receipt, testing, calibrations, quality
control, and maintenance logs must be accurately maintained and
stored as per laboratory policy.
Note: This SOP must be reviewed annually and whenever there are
changes to the equipment, reagents, or institutional policies.
