Standard Operating Procedure
MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA TYPE 2 SYNDROME, RET,
FULL GENE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN 2) Syndrome through
RET full gene analysis to ensure accurate and reliable identification
of mutations associated with the syndrome.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the molecular diagnostics laboratory performing
RET gene analysis for patients suspected of having MEN 2.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Molecular Technologists: Carry out RET gene analysis following
this procedure and document all steps accordingly.
• Supervisors: Ensure that the procedure is followed and that any
deviations are investigated and documented.
• Quality Assurance Personnel: Monitor compliance with the SOP
and review the results and documentation for accuracy.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Sample Type: Whole blood or buccal swabs.
Volume: Minimum 1 mL of whole blood in an EDTA tube; buccal
swabs per standard collection protocol.
Storage and Handling:
• Store at 2–8°C if not processed immediately.
• Ensure specimens are transported to the laboratory within 48
hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocycler
• Electrophoresis apparatus
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen)
• Primer sets specific for RET gene exons
• PCR reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers, buffers)
• DNA sequencing reagents (BigDye Terminator v.3.1, sequencing
buffer)
• Capillary electrophoresis system (e.g., ABI 3500 Genetic
Analyzer)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Whole Blood:
◦ Use an appropriate DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic
DNA from whole blood.
◦ Verify DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (A260/A280 ratio should be
approximately 1.8).
2. Buccal Swabs:
◦ Follow the buccal swab DNA extraction kit protocol.
◦ Verify DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
1. Primer Design and Selection:
◦ Use validated primers specific for each exon of the RET
gene.
2. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix including Taq polymerase,
dNTPs, primers, and buffer.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes and add the DNA
template.
◦ Schedule PCR cycling conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 min
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 sec
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 sec (depends on primer
Tm)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 min
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 5 min
3. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
◦ Confirm amplicon size by agarose gel electrophoresis.
C. DNA Sequencing
1. Setup Sequencing Reactions:
◦ Set up sequencing reactions using BigDye Terminator v.3.1
cycle sequencing kit per manufacturer instructions.
◦ Clean up sequencing reactions using a suitable purification
protocol (e.g., ethanol precipitation).
2. Capillary Electrophoresis:
◦ Load purified sequencing products onto the ABI 3500
Genetic Analyzer.
◦ Run capillary electrophoresis following the instrument
protocol.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze sequence data using appropriate software (e.g.,
SeqScape or Mutation Surveyor).
◦ Compare sequences to the reference RET gene sequence
(NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_020975).
◦ Identify and classify any mutations or polymorphisms.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Identify pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, and likely
benign variants.
◦ Use international guidelines (e.g., ACMG guidelines) for the
classification of variants.
2. Preparation of Report:
◦ Include patient identification, specimen type, date of
analysis, and results.
◦ Provide an interpretation of results including the clinical
significance of identified variants.
◦ Note any limitations of the analysis.
3. Review:
◦ Have the report reviewed and signed by a qualified
pathologist or geneticist.
4. Distribution:
◦ Send the final report to the requesting physician or genetic
counselor.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Maintain records of all controls and calibrations.
• Regularly validate reagents and calibrate instruments.
• Perform proficiency testing and participate in external quality
assessment programs.
