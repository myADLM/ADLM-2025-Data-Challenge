Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MULTIPLE MYELOMA
MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE BY FLOW CYTOMETRY, BONE
MARROW
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Multiple Myeloma Minimal Residual Disease
(MRD) by flow cytometry in bone marrow samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologists to
perform MRD testing according to the procedures outlined in this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the accuracy and
completeness of the procedure, ensuring all corrective actions are
documented and taken when necessary.
3. DEFINITIONS
MRD: Minimal Residual Disease BM: Bone Marrow FCM: Flow
Cytometry
4. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Bone marrow aspirate
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL
• Collection: Collected in heparinized vacutainers or similar
containers
• Stability: Best when processed immediately; if delayed, store at
4-8°C and process within 24 hours
Equipment and Reagents
• Flow Cytometer
• Specific monoclonal antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes
(Panels specific for MM MRD detection)
• Red blood cell lysis solution (e.g., ammonium chloride lysis buffer)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Sample tubes and appropriate labeling materials
• Flow cytometry software for data acquisition and analysis
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Verify the sample integrity and volume. b.
Transfer the bone marrow aspirate to a labeled sample tube. c. Add
appropriate volume of red blood cell lysis solution and incubate as
per manufacturer's instructions. d. Centrifuge the sample at 300-500g
for 5 minutes. e. Discard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in
PBS. f. Repeat lysis if necessary.
2. Antibody Staining: a. Aliquot cells to several tubes according to
the panel being used. b. Add predetermined volumes of fluorescently
conjugated antibodies to each tube. c. Incubate tubes at room
temperature in the dark for 15-30 minutes.
3. Washing: a. Add PBS to the tubes and centrifuge at 300-500g for
5 minutes. b. Discard supernatant and repeat wash. c. Resuspend
cells in PBS for analysis on the flow cytometer.
4. Data Acquisition: a. Ensure flow cytometer setup and calibration
are performed correctly. b. Using flow cytometry software, acquire
data from each stained tube. c. Record results and save data files for
analysis.
5. Data Analysis: a. Utilize flow cytometry software to analyze
acquired data. b. Identify and quantify MRD by comparing abnormal
plasma cells to normal bone marrow cell populations. c. Apply gating
strategies to correctly identify MRD populations. d. Interpret the data
according to established clinical guidelines.
6. Quality Control: a. Run appropriate quality control samples with
each batch of test samples. b. Validate new batches of reagents
before use. c. Document all quality control procedures and results.
7. Reporting Results: a. Ensure reviewed and validated results are
entered into Laboratory Information System (LIS). b. Ensure that the
results are verified by a qualified technologist before release. c.
Report critical values immediately following laboratory protocol.
Documentation: - Maintain records of specimen reception,
processing, staining, and analysis. - Document any deviations,
corrective actions, and quality control outcomes. - Ensure the records
are complete, accurate, and stored securely for future reference.

6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific monoclonal antibody inserts for sensitivity,
specificity, and potential interference factors.
7. SAFETY
Follow all laboratory safety protocols when handling biological
specimens and reagents. Use appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) and dispose of waste according to biohazard
regulations.
