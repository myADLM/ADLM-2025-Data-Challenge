1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Multiple Myeloma Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by Flow
Cytometry in bone marrow samples. This protocol ensures accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in testing, focusing on detecting minimal
residual disease post-treatment.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory staff are responsible for following this protocol
meticulously to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the results.
Supervisors must verify that procedures are adhered to and
corrective actions are documented.
1. DEFINITION
MRD in Multiple Myeloma involves the detection of remaining cancer
cells post-treatment using highly sensitive techniques. Flow
cytometry is utilized to identify and enumerate plasma cells
expressing specific surface markers.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-run Setup:
1. Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Flow cytometer
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Monoclonal antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes specific
for plasma cell markers (e.g., CD38, CD138, CD45, CD19,
and other relevant markers)
◦ Lysis buffer
◦ Staining buffer
◦ Washing buffer
◦ Quality control material for flow cytometry
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare and label all necessary reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date and
properly stored.
3. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Power on the flow cytometer and allow it to warm up.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Run quality control material to confirm instrument
performance.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Bone Marrow Sample:
◦ Verify the sample labeling and documentation.
◦ Note: Ensure that samples are processed promptly to
preserve cell viability.
2. Cell Processing:
◦ Aliquot an appropriate volume of bone marrow sample into
labeled test tubes.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of lysis buffer to lyse red blood
cells (if applicable). Incubate as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 300g for 10 minutes at 4ºC.
◦ Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in
staining buffer.
3. Staining:
◦ Aliquot the cell suspension into separate labelled tubes for
each antibody panel.
◦ Add the predetermined volume of monoclonal antibodies to
each tube.
◦ Incubate the mixture for the recommended time (e.g., 20
minutes) at 4ºC in the dark.
4. Washing:
◦ Add washing buffer to each tube, followed by centrifugation
at 300g for 5 minutes.
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in sheath fluid or staining buffer.
C. Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Instrument Settings:
◦ Set the cytometer parameters (e.g., voltage settings,
compensation) for multi-color analysis.
◦ Ensure proper gating strategy to identify plasma cells based
on combination of markers.
2. Running Samples:
◦ Start by running a single-stained control sample for each
fluorochrome for compensation setup.
◦ Run unstained control for background fluorescence.
◦ Analyze the prepared patient samples one at a time. Record
at least 500,000 to 1,000,000 events where feasible for
sufficient sensitivity.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Gating Strategy:
◦ Utilize software to set up gating based on various markers
(e.g., CD38+, CD138+, CD19-, CD45-).
◦ Identify and enumerate MRD plasma cells based on their
phenotypic profile.
2. MRD Calculation:
◦ Calculate the percentage of MRD plasma cells among the
total nucleated cells.
3. Interpretation:
◦ Classify MRD status by assessing if minimal residual
plasma cells are detectable within the sensitivity threshold.
4. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Record the experiment details, flow cytometry settings, and
results.
◦ Generate a report summarizing the presence/absence of
MRD, including quantitative data.
◦ Supervisors must review and verify the finalized reports
before release.
E. Quality Control:
1. Daily Quality Control:
◦ Perform routine quality checks with each run using
appropriate control material.
◦ Document all quality control results.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's procedure for calibration
verification.
3. Corrective Actions:
◦ Troubleshoot and document any deviations or instrument
errors.
◦ Re-calibrate/re-test if quality control does not meet
acceptable criteria.
