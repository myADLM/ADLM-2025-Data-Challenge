Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Cascade - Serum and Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standardized procedures
for the analytical phase of generating results for Multiple Sclerosis
(MS) Cascade using serum and spinal fluid specimens. The goal is to
ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to the examination of MS cascade in
serum and spinal fluid in the clinical laboratory setting. It includes the
handling, processing, and analysis of the specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the analysis of MS cascade according to this
protocol. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing adherence to
the protocol and for addressing any issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Serum:
• Collection: SST (Serum Separator Tube), allow the specimen to
clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge: 10 minutes at 1500 x g to separate serum.
• Storage: Aliquoted serum can be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 72 hours. For long-term storage, store at -20°C or colder.
Spinal Fluid (CSF):
• Collection: Collected using aseptic technique.
• Centrifuge: If visibly turbid, centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
• Storage: Aliquoted CSF can be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
72 hours. For long-term storage, store at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader, nephelometer)
• Assay kits specific for MS biomarkers (e.g., oligoclonal bands,
IgG, albumin)
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes,
etc.)
• Calibration and quality control materials as specified by the assay
manufacturer.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Serum and CSF Preparation:
1. Verify specimen identification and integrity.
2. Centrifuge samples if needed as per specimen requirements.
3. Label aliquots with patient ID and date.
B) Analysis:
1. Oligoclonal Bands (OCBs) Detection by Isoelectric
Focusing (IEF) and Immunoblotting:
◦ Dilute serum and CSF according to kit instructions.
◦ Load samples and controls onto the gel.
◦ Perform isoelectric focusing.
◦ Transfer to membrane and perform immunoblotting with
anti-IgG antibodies.
◦ Visualize bands using appropriate detection method.
◦ Bands in CSF but not in serum indicate Oligoclonal bands.
2. IgG Index Calculation:
◦ Quantify IgG and albumin in both serum and CSF using
immunoassay techniques.
◦ Calculate the IgG Index: [ \text{IgG Index} = \frac{\text{CSF
IgG / Serum IgG}}{\text{CSF Albumin / Serum Albumin}} ]
▪ Normal range: < 0.7-0.9; elevated IgG Index implies
intrathecal IgG production.
3. Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) Assay (if available):
◦ Perform assay as per manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Quantitative measurement of NfL can be done using ELISA
or other immunoassay platforms.
C) Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples in parallel with patient specimens for
each batch.
• Analyze QC results to ensure they fall within the established
range.
• Document and resolve any quality control failures before reporting
patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results for accuracy and consistency.
• Record concentrations of IgG, albumin, and other biomarkers.
• Report the presence/absence of OCBs, IgG index value, and any
other relevant findings.
• Enter results into LIS (Laboratory Information System) and review
for final sign-off by a qualified pathologist.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Incomplete separation of cell-free supernatant in CSF may
interfere with results.
• Hemolyzed or contaminated samples may produce inaccurate
results.
• Prolonged storage or inappropriate storage conditions may
degrade analytes.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for relevant assay kits.
• Standard laboratory texts and established guidelines for MS
biomarker analysis.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all specimen processing, quality control
results, and analytical findings.
• Ensure documentation is complete, accurate, and available for
review as per laboratory policy.
This protocol shall be reviewed and updated regularly, or as needed,
to remain aligned with current best practices and technological
advancements.
