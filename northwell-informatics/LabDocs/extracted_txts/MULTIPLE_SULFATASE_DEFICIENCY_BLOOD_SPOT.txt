Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD) Using Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD) using blood spot
samples in the CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected on filter paper
◦ Collection: Via a heel prick for infants or finger prick for older
children and adults.
◦ Volume: Minimum of three fully saturated circles on the filter
paper.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• DBS samples with insufficient blood volume (i.e., not fully
saturated).
• DBS samples that are hemolyzed, clotted, or contaminated.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or without collection date/
time indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Puncher for DBS (3mm to 6mm punch size)
• Microplate reader (relevant wavelength according to substrate)
• Incubator (set to the appropriate temperature specific for enzyme
reactions)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
Reagents and Supplies:
• Appropriate enzyme substrates for detecting sulfatase activities.
• Reaction buffers and reagents (including salts, cofactors, and
detergents required for specific assays).
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls).
• Extraction solvent.
• Microplates.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Wear gloves and other PPE before handling blood spot
specimens.
2. Punch out a 3-6mm disc from each blood spot using a sterile
puncher.
3. Place the punched disc into a microplate well.
4. Add the appropriate volume of extraction buffer to each well.
5. Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and time
for adequate extraction (e.g., overnight at 37°C with shaking).
B. Enzyme Reaction:
1. Add the enzyme substrate to each well containing the extracted
blood spot samples.
◦ Ensure substrate is freshly prepared or thawed from
properly stored aliquots.
2. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature conducive for
enzyme activity (e.g., 37°C for 1-4 hours).
3. Stop the enzyme reaction by adding stop solution (if
applicable).
C. Measurement and Data Acquisition:
1. Measure the fluorescence or absorbance of each well using the
appropriate microplate reader settings:
◦ Set the wavelength filter for the specific enzyme substrate
(e.g., 405nm for p-nitrocatechol sulfate hydrolysis).
2. Record the readings for each well.
3. Ensure that readings for quality controls (positive and negative)
fall within the acceptable ranges before proceeding with data
analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate enzyme activity by comparing sample readings
against a standard curve or using a known conversion
factor.
◦ Ensure calculations account for blank corrections and
dilution factors where applicable.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Evaluate QC results to ensure the assay has performed
within the defined parameters.
◦ If QC fails, investigate the source of error, repeat the assay
if necessary, and document corrective actions taken.
7. Result Validation:
◦ Validate results by cross-verifying with known reference
ranges.
◦ Any result falling outside the reference range needs further
scrutiny and potentially re-testing.
8. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Include detailed notes on any sample issues, QC results,
and corrective actions.
9. Communication of Results:
◦ Generate reports on the validated results.
◦ Report critical or unexpected findings immediately to the
attending physician or relevant healthcare provider
according to the laboratory's critical value reporting policy.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Sulfatase enzyme activity reference intervals as determined by
the laboratory’s established ranges using the specific assay.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to assay-specific limitations as detailed in the reagent kit
inserts or assay SOPs. Potential limitations could include: -
Interference by hemoglobin or bilirubin. - Inaccurate readings due to
insufficient sample volume. - Variations in enzyme activity related to
sample storage and handling.
