Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Multiple
Sulfatase Deficiency, Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
To provide and detail the standard operating procedures for the
analysis of Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD) in leukocytes using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This
procedure ensures the accurate and reliable identification of
sulfatase enzyme deficiencies in leukocytes derived from patient
blood samples.
Responsibility: Designated clinical laboratory scientists are
responsible for performing the procedures and ensuring all quality
controls are met. Supervisors are accountable for overseeing the
procedure and addressing any issues that arise.
1. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all samples received for MSD analysis
in leukocytes within the CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION
Specimen:
• Preferred: 3-5 mL whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender
top) or ACD (yellow top) tube.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately.
• Stability: Samples must be processed within 48 hours of collection
to ensure integrity and reliability.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in heparin tubes.
• Samples that are clotted, hemolyzed, mislabeled, or exceed the
48 hour processing window.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
◦ Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Leukocyte isolation kit
◦ Calibration standards and internal controls specific for
sulfatase enzymes
◦ Reagents: Methanol, water, acetonitrile, formic acid (all
HPLC grade)
◦ Solvent-resistant vials
2. PROCEDURE
A. Leukocyte Isolation from Whole Blood
• Centrifuge whole blood at 2000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Carefully extract the buffy coat layer and transfer it to a new tube.
• Use the leukocyte isolation kit as per manufacturer instructions to
isolate leukocytes.
• Wash with PBS, centrifuge at 500 g for 5 minutes, and resuspend
in appropriate lysis buffer.
B. Enzyme Extraction and Preparation
• Lyse leukocytes in lysis buffer and incubate to ensure complete
cell lysis.
• Centrifuge at high speed (12000 g) for 10 minutes to remove cell
debris.
• Collect the supernatant containing the enzyme extract for
analysis.
C. Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls
• Prepare calibration standards by diluting stock solutions in
appropriate solvent.
• Include internal standards at a fixed concentration in each
sample, standard, and control.
• Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations to validate each run.
D. Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
Analysis
• Inject processed enzyme extracts into the HPLC system.
• Use gradient elution program with methanol and water containing
0.1% formic acid.
• Transfer eluent into the mass spectrometer.
• Monitor specified mass transitions for enzyme-specific
metabolites.
• Quantify analyte concentration based on peak areas relative to
the internal standard.
E. Data Analysis and Result Interpretation
• Analyze obtained data using dedicated LC-MS/MS quantification
software.
• Compare patient enzyme activities with established reference
intervals.
• Interpret results in the context of clinical and genetic information
available for the patient.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
◦ Run calibration standards at the beginning and end of each
batch.
◦ Analyze quality control samples with each analytical batch
and confirm results are within acceptance criteria.
◦ Perform instrument performance verification regularly as per
manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Document all quality control procedures, standard
preparation, and instrument maintenance activities in the
appropriate log book.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report enzymatic activity levels of sulfatase enzymes in
leukocytes.
◦ Include all pertinent quality control data validating the
results.
◦ Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
clinical laboratory scientist before reporting to the physician.
◦ Critical or abnormal results must be communicated directly
to the ordering physician.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to technical documentation provided with the LC-MS/
MS system.
◦ Acknowledge any potential interferences specific to the
reagents and instrumentation used.
◦ Verify that enzyme activity results are corroborated with
clinical manifestations for accurate diagnosis.
4. REFERENCES
◦ Reference manuals for the HPLC system and mass
spectrometer.
◦ Manufacturer instructions for leukocyte isolation kit.
◦ Peer-reviewed publications on the demonstration of MSD
enzyme analysis techniques.
5. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
• Maintain all raw data, calibration curves, and quality control logs.
• Ensure compliance with laboratory information management
systems (LIMS) for data storage and retrieval.
• Archive patient reports and relevant communications for
traceability according to the institution's data retention policy.
By adhering to this SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency in leukocytes, the laboratory
ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable diagnostic outcomes while
meeting regulatory standards.
