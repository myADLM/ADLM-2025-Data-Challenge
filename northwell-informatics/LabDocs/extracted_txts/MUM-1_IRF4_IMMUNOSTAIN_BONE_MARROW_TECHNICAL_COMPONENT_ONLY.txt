Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MUM-1/IRF4
Immunostain, Bone Marrow, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for
performing MUM-1/IRF4 immunostaining on bone marrow specimens
to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable staining results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated histotechnologist(s) to
perform and document the staining procedure as outlined in this
SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance with
this procedure and for addressing any issues arising from the
staining process.
1. PRINCIPLE AND APPLICATION
The MUM-1 (Multiple Myeloma Oncogene 1)/IRF4 (Interferon
Regulatory Factor 4) immunostain is used for identifying MUM-1/IRF4
protein expression in bone marrow samples. This marker is
commonly utilized for the diagnosis and classification of
hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimen Type:
• Bone marrow biopsy samples fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not fixed or not appropriately fixed in formalin.
• Specimens with inadequate cellularity.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunostaining system (e.g., Ventana Benchmark,
Leica Bond)
• Microscope
Reagents:
• MUM-1/IRF4 Primary Antibody
• Detection Kit (e.g., DAB detection system)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Xylene
• Alcohol (ethanol)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Obtain formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bone marrow
biopsy sample.
2. Using a microtome, cut 4-5 μm thickness sections from the
FFPE block and place them on positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour or overnight at 37°C to
ensure proper adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by incubating slides in xylene for 3
minutes (change solution twice).
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each, followed by a rinse in distilled
water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA
buffer (pH 8.0) as appropriate, using a pressure cooker,
microwave, or water bath for 20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Load slides onto the automated immunostainer.
2. Select the MUM-1/IRF4 antibody protocol and initiate the
staining run. a. Application of primary antibody. b. Incubation
with appropriate secondary antibody and detection system. c.
Application of DAB chromogen/substrate. d. Counterstain with
hematoxylin.
3. Follow the instrument-specific instructions for each washing
and incubating step.
E. Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides in graded alcohol (95%, 100%) and clear in
xylene.
2. Apply coverslips using mounting medium.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides in each run to ensure
staining accuracy.
• Positive control: Tissue known to express MUM-1/IRF4.
• Negative control: Omission of primary antibody on a separate
section of the same tissue.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND DOCUMENTATION
• Evaluate the stained slides under a microscope.
• Positive staining: Nuclear and/or cytoplasmic brown coloration in
cells expressing MUM-1/IRF4.
• Negative staining: Absence of brown coloration in non-expressing
cells.
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report any unexpected staining patterns or artifacts to the
supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Record the interpretation of the immunostain, including the
pattern and intensity of staining.
• Report findings according to site-specific guidelines and
protocols.
1. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents and specimens with care, following
appropriate biosafety and chemical safety procedures.
