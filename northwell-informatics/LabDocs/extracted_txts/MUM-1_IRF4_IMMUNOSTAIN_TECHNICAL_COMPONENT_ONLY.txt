Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MUM-1/IRF4
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for performing MUM-1/IRF4
Immunostain in the laboratory. The goal is to ensure accurate and
consistent staining for diagnostic purposes. This SOP does not cover
the interpretation of results.
Responsibility:
• The preparation and staining stages are to be carried out by
trained histotechnologists.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
procedure is followed and documented accurately and
consistently.
1. DEFINITION
MUM-1 (Multiple Myeloma Oncogene-1)/IRF4 (Interferon Regulatory
Factor 4) are markers used in immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify
various lymphomas and myelomas.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples.
• Optimal tissue section thickness: 4-5 micrometers.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Primary Antibody: Anti-MUM-1/IRF4
• Secondary Antibody: Suitable secondary antibody for detection
• Detection System: HRP/DAB detection system
• Positive Control Slide: Known MUM-1/IRF4-positive tissue
• Negative Control Slide: Tissue with primary antibody omitted
• Staining reagents: Xylene, Ethanol, DAB, Hematoxylin
• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water Bath
◦ Oven
◦ Autostainer (if available) or manual staining setup
◦ Light Microscope
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Slides
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 micrometers using a
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and mount on
positively charged slides.
◦ Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for at least one hour.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
80%, and 70%), 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to remove ethanol.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) is recommended:
◦ Place slides in a retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
and heat in a microwave or pressure cooker.
◦ At the end of the heating period, allow the slides to cool in
the buffer to room temperature.
C. Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, then rinse in
distilled water.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with primary anti-MUM-1/IRF4 antibody
diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically
for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply an appropriate secondary antibody for 30 minutes.
◦ Rinse in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
4. Detection:
◦ Develop with DAB solution: Incubate for 5-10 minutes or
until appropriate staining intensity is achieved.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water.
6. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate through a graded ethanol series (70%, 80%,
95%, 100%), 3 minutes each.
◦ Clear slides in xylene, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
7. Mounting:
◦ Mount slides with a permanent mounting medium and
coverslip.
D. Controls:
• Include a positive control slide with known MUM-1/IRF4-positive
tissue.
• Include a negative control by omitting the primary antibody.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all reagents and antibodies are within their expiration
dates.
• Record lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents and
antibodies used.
• Document any deviations from the procedure and any
troubleshooting steps taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Stained slides are handed over to the pathologist or designated
personnel for interpretation.
• Document and record the date and initials of the technologist who
performed the stain.
