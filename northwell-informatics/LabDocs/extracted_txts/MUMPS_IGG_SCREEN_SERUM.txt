Analytical Phase Protocol for
Generating Results for MUMPS,
IGG, SCREEN, SERUM
1. Purpose
To ensure the accurate and timely analysis and reporting of Mumps
IgG screening in serum specimens using appropriate laboratory
techniques and quality control measures.
2. Specimen
Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL serum obtained from a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens collected in incorrect tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate).
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
3. Reagents and Equipment
• Mumps IgG ELISA kit.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Serum separator tubes (SST).
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Plate reader capable of reading at 450 nm.
• ELISA washing buffer.
• Distilled water.
• Calibrated timers.
4. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the serum specimen, verify that the sample
meets the acceptance criteria mentioned above.
2. Allow the specimen to come to room temperature if it has been
refrigerated.
3. Centrifuge the SST at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to ensure
complete serum separation.
4. Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled microtubes for
testing.
ELISA Testing:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents as outlined in the Mumps IgG ELISA kit
insert.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples
according to the ELISA kit insert.
◦ Use duplicate wells for each standard, control, and patient
sample.
3. Sample Addition:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples
into the assigned wells.
◦ Use a fresh pipette tip for each sample to avoid cross-
contamination.
4. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with the provided cover and incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate according to the kit instructions using the
ELISA washing buffer.
◦ Ensure all wells are washed thoroughly to remove unbound
reagents.
6. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for the time specified in the kit
insert.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 15
minutes.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Tap the plate gently to mix the contents.
9. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the plate
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
Calculating Results:
1. Plot the absorbance values of the standards to generate a
standard curve.
2. Determine the concentration of Mumps IgG in patient samples
using the standard curve.
3. Verify that the results for controls are within the acceptable
range specified by the ELISA kit instructions.
5. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure assay performance.
• Any control result that falls outside the expected range invalidates
the run and all samples must be retested.
• Record all quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
6. Reporting Results
• Report results in IU/mL.
• Use the following interpretation guide:
◦ Negative: Less than 16 IU/mL.
◦ Equivocal: 16-22 IU/mL.
◦ Positive: Greater than 22 IU/mL.
• Verify and document all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Critical or significantly abnormal results must be communicated
promptly to the requesting physician or healthcare provider.

and systematic analysis of Mumps IgG antibodies in serum
specimens, ensuring quality and reliability in laboratory procedures.
