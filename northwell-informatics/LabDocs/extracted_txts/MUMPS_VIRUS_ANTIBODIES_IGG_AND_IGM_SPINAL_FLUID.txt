STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analysis of Mumps Virus Antibodies, IgG and IgM, in Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to provide
guidelines for detecting Mumps Virus antibodies, specifically
IgG and IgM, in spinal fluid using enzyme immunoassay (EIA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory staff are responsible
for following this procedure to ensure accurate and timely
results. This includes performing the analysis, documenting the
results, and informing a supervisor in case of any issues.
3. DEFINITIONS Mumps Virus Antibodies: These are antibodies
produced by the immune system in response to infection by the
mumps virus. There are two main types:
• IgG: Indicates past exposure or immunity
• IgM: Indicates recent infection
1. PROCEDURE A) Reagent and Equipment Preparation
i. Equipment:
• Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) analyzer
• Micropipettes
• 96-well EIA plates
• Plate washer
• Plate reader
• Incubator
• Refrigerator
ii. Reagents:
• Mumps Virus IgG and IgM EIA kits (including calibration and
control materials)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
B) Specimen Requirements and Handling: i. Acceptable Specimen: -
Spinal fluid collected in a sterile container
ii. Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimens received in containers that
are not sterile - Specimens with evidence of contamination or
improper handling
iii. Specimen Storage: - Store specimens in a refrigerator at 2-8°C if
not analyzed immediately - Specimens must be analyzed within 48
hours of collection. If testing is delayed, specimens can be frozen at
-20°C or colder for longer storage
C) Assay Procedure:
i. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen specimens to room temperature and mix thoroughly
• Prepare calibrators and control samples according to the
manufacturer’s instructions
ii. Plate Preparation:
• Add 100µL of controls, calibrators, and specimens into designated
wells of the 96-well EIA plate
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes
iii. Washing:
• Wash the plate 3 times with the provided wash buffer using the
plate washer
iv. Conjugate Addition:
• Add 100µL of enzyme conjugate to all wells
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes
v. Substrate Addition:
• Add 100µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate at room
temperature for 15 minutes (protect from light)
vi. Stopping:
• Add 100µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction
vii. Reading:
• Read the plate at 450nm using the plate reader within 30 minutes
of adding stop solution
D) Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
specimens
• The assay is valid if the controls fall within the specified ranges
provided by the manufacturer
E) Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
• Calculate the specimen absorbance and determine the antibody
index using the provided calibration curve
• Interpret the results according to the manufacturer’s guidelines:
◦ Positive for IgG: Indication of past infection or immunity to
mumps virus
◦ Positive for IgM: Indication of a current or recent infection with
mumps virus
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results must be reviewed and verified by laboratory technologists
• Report findings to the appropriate healthcare provider
• Document all results, including control and calibrator data, per
laboratory policy
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Mumps Virus IgG: Negative or Positive
• Mumps Virus IgM: Negative or Positive
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for specific limitations
regarding the IgG and IgM assay
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s kit insert for Mumps Virus IgG/IgM EIA
• CLIA guidelines
