Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Mumps Virus Antibody, IGG, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized, reliable, and efficient
procedure for the analytical determination of Mumps Virus
Antibody, IgG in serum samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff will carry out the testing
and documentation procedures. All laboratory personnel are
responsible for identifying and resolving any issues that could affect
test quality.
1. DEFINITION The Mumps Virus Antibody, IgG assay is a
serological test used to determine the presence of IgG
antibodies to the mumps virus in serum, indicating previous
infection or vaccination.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred/
acceptable specimen:
• Serum: A minimum of 1 mL serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Specimen stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately tested, and are stable for up to 7 days under these
conditions. For long-term storage, serum specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples
• Specimens in tubes other than SST
• Samples without proper labeling (missing date/time of collection,
patient identifier)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit for Mumps Virus Antibody, IgG (validated for lab use;
refer to manufacturer's guidelines)
• Microtiter plate reader and washer
• Pipettes and tips (single/multichannel)
• Laboratory timer
• Calibrated centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
2. Verify and document the proper storage and stability of the
serum sample.
3. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before testing.
4. Prepare reagents and calibrators as per the ELISA kit
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Label the ELISA plate wells appropriately for each serum
sample, calibrator, and control.
2. Pipette specified volumes of calibrators, controls, and serum
samples into the designated wells.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for adding reagents,
incubation steps, and washing procedures.
C. Reading and Documentation:
1. Use the microtiter plate reader to measure optical densities
(OD) at the specified wavelength.
2. Record OD values along with sample identifiers, calibrator, and
control values.
3. Calculate results using software or the formula provided by the
ELISA kit manufacturer.
4. Validate assay performance by examining control values to
ensure they fall within the specified range.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING If controls are out of range:
• Verify proper reagent preparation and incubation times.
• Ensure equipment calibration and maintenance.
• Repeat the assay using freshly prepared reagents if necessary.
• Document any troubleshooting actions in the QC log.
1. QUALITY CONTROL Internal quality control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
tested.
• Validate new lot numbers by comparing results with previous lots.
External quality control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to validate assay
consistency and accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Input data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) following
validation.
• For any results falling outside expected ranges, discuss results
with the supervisor before verification.
• Communicate critical results according to established laboratory
protocols.
