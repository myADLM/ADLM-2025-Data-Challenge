STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE MUMPS VIRUS
ANTIBODY, IGM AND IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process for the identification and quantification of
Mumps virus antibodies (IgM and IgG) in patient serum samples
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for ensuring that all steps of
the procedure are properly executed and documented. Supervisors
must oversee all activities to ensure compliance with protocols and
quality standards.
3. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow the
blood to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge to separate
serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within 48
hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
Acceptable Specimen:
• Clearly labeled serum sample with a minimum volume of 1 mL.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens received without proper labeling or not following
collection time or date.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader set to 450 nm.
• Microplate washer.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
Reagents and Supplies:
• ELISA kits for Mumps IgM and IgG antibodies (store and handle
according to the manufacturer’s instructions).
• Pipettes and micro-test tubes.
• Distilled water.
• Disposable gloves and lab coats.
• Absorbent paper.
5. PROCEDURE
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
beginning the assay.
2. Prepare the reagents, samples, and standards as instructed in
the ELISA kit insert.
3. Pipette appropriate volumes of serum, standards, and controls
into the wells of the microtiter plate.
4. Add enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the duration specified in the kit
insert.
6. Wash the plate thoroughly with the microplate washer using the
wash buffer provided in the kit.
7. Add the substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature, protected from light, for
the time specified in the kit insert.
9. Add the stop solution to each well.
10. Read the optical density of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay integrity.
• Examine the assay’s standard curve to ensure acceptable
performance.
• Re-calibrate the ELISA reader according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference ranges and interpretation should follow the specifics
outlined in the ELISA kit insert.
• Report results qualitatively (positive or negative) and
quantitatively where applicable, based on established cut-off
values.
• Log all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure data integrity before releasing patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Assure results are not released until they have been reviewed
and verified by the technologist and/or supervisor.
• Critical values or unexpected results must be confirmed and
repeated if necessary, and the physician promptly notified.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations regarding
cross-reactivity, interference, and the linearity of the assay.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical
presentation.
• Avoid using expired kits or reagents, and always follow
manufacturer’s guidelines for storage and handling.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for ELISA kit for Mumps IgM and IgG.
11. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Ensure documentation of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates,
and calibration records.
• All corrective actions taken in response to out-of-range
temperatures, equipment malfunctions, or quality control failures
must be documented.
Ensure that all technologists are appropriately trained on this protocol
and regularly update training as required by CLIA standards and
laboratory policies.
