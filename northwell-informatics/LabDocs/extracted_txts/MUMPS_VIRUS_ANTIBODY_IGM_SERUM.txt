Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mumps Virus Antibody
(IgM), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized
methodology for the detection of Mumps Virus Antibody (IgM) in
serum. This test is essential for diagnosing acute mumps infections
or recent vaccination responses.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis, ensure the integrity of results, and take appropriate
corrective actions according to this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring quality control, competency assessment,
and adherence to this SOP.
3. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
The detection of Mumps Virus IgM antibodies in serum is performed
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The
presence of IgM antibodies indicates recent infection or vaccination.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Preferred specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
- Stability: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 5 days; if longer storage is needed, freeze samples at -20°C or colder.
- Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- ELISA plate reader
- ELISA washer
- Micropipettes and tips
- Incubator set at 37°C
- Timer
- Vortex mixer
6. REAGENTS
- Mumps Virus IgM ELISA Kit (includes: microplate strips coated with Mumps antigen, IgM Enzyme Conjugate, substrate solution, stop solution, wash buffer, specimen diluent, and controls)
- Distilled or deionized water
- Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
7. PROCEDURE
**7.1 Preparation:**
- Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
- Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and functioning.
**7.2 Specimen Processing:**
- Centrifuge blood collection tubes to separate serum.
- Transfer serum to appropriately labeled tubes for analysis.
**7.3 ELISA Assay:**
1. Prepare the wash buffer and dilute according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Pipette 100 µL of specimen diluent into the appropriate wells for each control, standard, and patient samples.
3. Add 10 µL of controls and samples to the corresponding wells. Mix thoroughly by gentle tapping or using a vortex mixer.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Wash the wells thoroughly 5 times with the wash buffer using the ELISA washer.
6. Add 100 µL of IgM Enzyme Conjugate to each well.
7. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
8. Wash the wells again thoroughly with the wash buffer.
9. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes, away from light.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The color will change from blue to yellow.
11. Read the absorbance on an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm within 30 minutes.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
- Include positive and negative controls with each assay run.
- Run two levels of commercial quality control materials for each batch of tests.
- Verify that control values fall within the established ranges before patient results are validated and reported.
- Document all quality control activities and any corrective actions taken.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
- Calculate the net absorbance values (optical density) by subtracting the blank well's absorbance.
- Compare patient sample absorbance to cut-off values to determine results:
- Positive: Absorbance greater than or equal to the cut-off value.
- Negative: Absorbance less than the cut-off value.
- Record and report results as positive, negative, or equivocal based on the manufacturer’s criteria.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
- Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
- Urgent findings and critical values, if applicable, should be communicated directly to the requesting physician or healthcare provider according to laboratory policy.
11. LIMITATIONS
- Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay performance.
- Serological testing for IgM antibodies may produce false positives in patients with other viral infections or in individuals who have been recently vaccinated.
- Cross-reactivity with other paramyxoviruses may occur.
