Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Mumps Virus, Molecular
Detection, PCR, Buccal
1. Purpose
To detect the presence of Mumps virus RNA in buccal specimens
using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and report the
results.
1. Scope
This procedure applies to the molecular diagnostic laboratory
responsible for testing buccal specimens for Mumps virus RNA.
1. Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technical staff to
perform the molecular detection of Mumps virus RNA through RT-
PCR and ensure the accuracy and timeliness of results.
1. Definitions
• RT-PCR: Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, a laboratory
technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and
amplification of specific DNA targets using PCR.
• Buccal Specimen: A sample collected from the inside of the
cheek.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/acceptable: Buccal swab collected in Viral Transport
Medium (VTM). The specimen should be stored at 2-8°C and
tested within 72 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable: Specimen received more than 72 hours post-
collection or improperly labeled samples.
1. Reagents and Supplies
• Viral Transport Medium (VTM)
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit
• RT-PCR Master Mix
• Mumps virus-specific primers and probes
• Positive and negative controls
• PCR tubes/plates
• Micropipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and face shield
1. Equipment
• Real-time PCR machine
• Microcentrifuge
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Vortex mixer
• Thermal cycler (if required for RT step)
1. Procedure
A) Sample Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE and work in a biosafety cabinet.
2. Label the tubes with the patient's identification number and
date.
3. Vortex the buccal swab specimen in VTM for 5-10 seconds.
4. Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet any
debris.
B) Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Follow the protocol provided with the Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit
to extract RNA from the sample.
2. Use a volume of VTM specified by the kit.
3. Elute the RNA in the appropriate volume recommended by the
kit instructions.
C) RT-PCR Set-Up
1. Prepare the RT-PCR Master Mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, including the RT-PCR buffer,
enzyme mix, primers, and probes specific for Mumps virus.
2. Add the extracted RNA template to the corresponding PCR
tubes or plates.
D) RT-PCR Amplification
1. Place the PCR tubes/plates into the Real-time PCR machine.
2. Run the PCR program according to the following thermal
cycling conditions:
◦ Reverse transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Amplification cycling: 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds
(denaturation), 55°C for 30 seconds (annealing/extension),
and fluorescence data collection.
E) Post-Analytical Check and Result Interpretation
1. Analyze the RT-PCR data using the real-time PCR machine
software. Positive results will show amplification plots crossing
the threshold line within specified cycle thresholds (Ct values).
2. Refer to the Positive and Negative Controls to validate each
assay run:
◦ Positive control should amplify within the expected Ct range.
◦ Negative control should show no amplification.
3. Validate the results based on the above controls.
4. Reporting Results
• Positive for Mumps Virus: Report "Detected (Positive) for
Mumps Virus RNA" with the corresponding Ct value.
• Negative for Mumps Virus: Report "Not Detected (Negative) for
Mumps Virus RNA."
• Invalid/Rejected: Report "Invalid Result" if positive and negative
controls fail. Reextract and retest the sample.
1. Quality Control and Assurance
2. Perform Positive and Negative Controls with each batch of
samples.
3. Include an internal control in each reaction to monitor for RNA
extraction efficiency and PCR inhibition.
4. Document and investigate any deviations from the expected
results or inconsistencies in quality control.
5. Limitations
• Results may be affected by improper specimen collection,
handling, or transport.
• Cross-contamination of specimens may lead to false-positive
results.
• The test may not detect low levels of the virus or mutations not
recognized by the primers/probes used.
