MUMPS VIRUS, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, RANDOM,
URINE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the molecular
detection of the Mumps virus in random urine specimens using
PCR methodology within the laboratory. This protocol ensures
reliable, accurate, and timely results crucial for diagnosing
mumps infections.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for conducting the molecular detection of the
Mumps virus in urine specimens. All laboratory personnel must
comply with these procedures to ensure test accuracy, quality
control, and valid reporting of results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE
• Specimen Type: Random urine.
• Collection: Collect urine in a sterile container. A minimum volume
of 10 mL is preferred. Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory promptly post-collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens in non-sterile containers.
◦ Specimens with visible contamination.
◦ Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported
(e.g., not at required conditions).
◦ Frozen specimens or those that have exceeded the
recommended stability period (48 hours at 2-8°C).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstation
• Thermocycler for PCR
• Urine Sample Collection Containers
• PCR Grade Water
• Mumps Virus Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit
• PCR Master Mix (with buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2, primers, and Taq
polymerase)
• Mumps virus-specific primers and probes
• Positive and Negative Controls
1. PROCEDURE
A) Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Safety and Preliminary Checks:
◦ Don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Scan and verify the specimen information with the
accession log.
◦ Ensure workspace cleanliness and decontaminate surfaces.
2. Extraction:
◦ Pipette 1 mL of urine into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Follow the Mumps Virus Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit protocol
to extract viral RNA.
◦ Elute the RNA in 50 µL of elution buffer.
◦ Store extracted RNA at -20°C if it cannot be immediately
processed.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents and RNA samples on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR mix in a sterile PCR-compatible tube by
combining:
▪ PCR Master Mix: X µL
▪ Mumps virus primers (forward and reverse): Y µL (each)
▪ Probe: Z µL
▪ Nuclease-free water: sufficient to bring the reaction
volume to 20 µL
▪ Extracted RNA: 5 µL
◦ Mix delicately, avoiding bubble formation.
2. PCR Setup:
◦ Pipette 20 µL of the prepared PCR mix into each well of a
PCR plate.
◦ Include appropriate controls (negative control, positive
mumps virus RNA control, and internal controls).
3. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Set up the thermocycler with the following conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 55°C for 60 seconds
▪ Repeat the denaturation and annealing/extension steps
for 45 cycles.
C) Detection and Analysis:
1. Post-PCR Analysis:
◦ Evaluate the PCR amplification plots.
◦ Ensure that the positive control exhibits expected
amplification curves.
◦ The negative control should be void of any amplification.
◦ The threshold cycle (Ct) values of test specimens should be
calculated for quantitative interpretation.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Positive Result: Ct value ≤ 38 indicates the presence of
Mumps viral RNA.
◦ Negative Result: No detectable Ct value or values > 38
indicate an undetectable level of viral RNA.
◦ Inconclusive or control failures will necessitate a re-test with
new specimens or controls.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE a. Perform internal and
external quality control procedures to verify the assay's accuracy. b.
Analyze each batch of specimens alongside positive and negative
controls. c. Document control runs and any deviations or issues
encountered during the process. d. Cross-reference with historical
QC data for consistency verification.
7. REPORTING RESULTS Report Ct values and interpretations to
the laboratory information system (LIS). Ensure results are reviewed
and verified by a qualified technologist before final reporting:
• Positive results will be reported as “Mumps virus RNA detected.”
• Negative results will be reported as “Mumps virus RNA not
detected.”
• Inconclusive results will warrant recollection and retesting as per
laboratory policy.
