Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Murine Typhus Antibodies, IgG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of testing and generation of results for Murine Typhus
antibodies, IgG. Ensuring accurate and reliable results is critical to
the diagnosis and monitoring of Murine Typhus infections.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for executing and
documenting the analytical procedures for Murine Typhus IgG testing.
All laboratory staff are responsible for identifying any irregularities
that may affect test results and reporting them to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in Serum Separator Tubes (SST).
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood specimen using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (approx. 30 minutes).
• Centrifuge the specimen within 1 hour of collection at 3,500 rpm
for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the serum into a properly labeled, screw-cap plastic vial.
Specimen Stability:
• Stored at 2-8°C: Stable up to 7 days.
• Frozen at -20°C or lower: Stable up to 6 months. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes.
• Specimens without proper labeling or missing collection
information.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for Murine
Typhus IgG antibodies.
• Calibrators and controls provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
• Microplate reader suitable for ELISA.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Automated or manual microplate washer.
• Reagent reservoirs.
• Timer.
• Vortex mixer.
• Disposable gloves.
• Laboratory coat and safety eyewear.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure the ELISA kit reagents are at room temperature before
beginning the assay.
• Prepare required calibrators and controls as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Arrange and label microplates accordingly.
Assay Steps:
1. Add calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples to
designated wells on the ELISA microplate.
◦ Use fresh pipette tips for each sample.
2. Add the assay buffer or sample diluent to each well as specified
in the ELISA kit protocol.
3. Incubate the microplate at the recommended temperature for
the specified duration.
◦ Typical incubation: 37°C for 30-60 minutes.
4. After incubation, wash the wells using the automated or manual
microplate washer, following the kit's washing protocol (usually
3-5 washes).
5. Add conjugate reagent (enzyme-linked secondary antibody) to
each well.
6. Incubate the plate at the recommended temperature for the
specified duration.
7. Wash the wells again according to the specified washing
protocol.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate to allow
color development.
◦ Strictly follow incubation times for optimal results (usually
10-15 minutes).
9. Stop the reaction using the stop solution provided in the kit.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at the specified wavelength
using the microplate reader.
• Typical read wavelength: 450 nm.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls included in the ELISA kit.
• Acceptable control values must fall within the ranges established
by the manufacturer.
• Record all control results, and investigate any out-of-range
controls.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for Murine
Typhus IgG antibodies.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the absorbance values of the calibrators and prepare a
standard curve.
• Compare patient sample absorbance values to the standard curve
to derive concentrations.
• Interpret results according to manufacturer’s guidelines:
◦ Positive: Indicates presence of Murine Typhus IgG antibodies.
◦ Negative: Indicates absence of detectable Murine Typhus IgG
antibodies.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate patient results before releasing.
• Flag and report any critical values or significant findings according
to laboratory protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations, potential
interferences, and the performance characteristics of the assay.
