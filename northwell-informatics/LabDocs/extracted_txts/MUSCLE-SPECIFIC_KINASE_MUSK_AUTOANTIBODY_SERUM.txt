Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MUSCLE-SPECIFIC KINASE (MUSK)
AUTOANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for the analysis and validation
of Muscle-Specific Kinase (MuSK) Autoantibody levels in serum
samples to ensure reliable, accurate, and timely results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are required to follow this SOP to
ensure the accuracy and consistency of results. Supervisors must
ensure that all personnel are adequately trained and adhere to the
protocol.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred specimen type: Serum
• Collection: 5 mL of blood is preferred. Collect blood in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Processing: Allow blood to clot at room temperature (15 to 30
minutes), then centrifuge the SST at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
• Storage: The separated serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours. For longer storage, serum should be aliquoted and stored
at -20°C or colder.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader or
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer.
• MuSK Autoantibody ELISA kit or equivalent CLIA reagents.
• Calibrators and Controls, provided with the kit.
• Precision pipettes and tips.
• Plate washer or manual washing supplies.
• Incubator set to the appropriate temperature for the assay.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Prepare the ELISA/CLIA reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Bring all reagents and samples to
room temperature before beginning the assay.
2. Calibrate the ELISA reader/CLIA analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines. Ensure that the device is functioning
properly.
B) Assay Setup
1. Sample Dilution (if required): Dilute patient serum samples as
specified by the assay kit. Typically, a 1:100 dilution with the
provided sample diluent is appropriate.
2. Control and Calibrator Preparation: Prepare controls and
calibrators as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
C) Assay Procedure
1. ELISA Assay:
1. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and diluted patient
samples to the appropriate wells in duplicate.
2. Incubate the plate as specified (typically 30-60 minutes) at
the recommended temperature.
3. Wash the wells thoroughly 4-5 times with the provided
wash buffer.
4. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate as
specified.
5. Wash the wells again as described.
6. Add substrate solution (e.g., TMB substrate) to each well
and incubate in the dark.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as indicated.
8. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength
(typically 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm)
using the ELISA reader.
2. CLIA Assay:
1. Follow the specific protocol steps outlined by the CLIA
analyzer and kit. Generally, this involves automated
dispensing of samples, reagents, incubation, washing,
and detection steps.
2. Ensure proper placement of reagents, calibrators,
controls, and patient samples into the CLIA analyzer as
specified.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that each assay run includes the manufacturer-provided
positive and negative controls.
• Verify that all controls are within the acceptable range. If any
control fails, do not report patient results and repeat the assay.
• Record all control results in the Quality Control log.
7. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Construct a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of MuSK autoantibodies in patient
samples using the standard curve.
• Refer to the kit’s reference values to interpret patient results:
◦ Negative: Below the set cut-off value.
◦ Borderline: Within a defined equivocal range.
◦ Positive: Above the cut-off value.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results to ensure that all quality control criteria are met.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring to include appropriate comments if the results are
deemed equivocal or if repeats are necessary.
• Include critical values in the report and notify the physician
immediately as per laboratory policy.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic tests.
