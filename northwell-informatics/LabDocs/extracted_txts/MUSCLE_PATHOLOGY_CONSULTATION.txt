Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Muscle Pathology Consultation
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized method for the analysis and reporting of
results for muscle pathology consultations within the laboratory. This
SOP highlights the responsibilities, sample requirements, analytical
procedures, quality control measures, and reporting guidelines to
ensure accurate and timely results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and documenting the results as per this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technician to follow the
procedures outlined and bring any anomalies or unexpected
results to the attention of the pathologist.
• The supervising pathologist is responsible for reviewing and
validating the final report.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimens:
• Muscle tissue biopsies received fresh or appropriately fixed (e.g.,
in formalin or glutaraldehyde), embedded in an appropriate
medium like paraffin or frozen sections (OCT).
Acceptable specimens:
• Transport medium: Michel’s medium or ambient PCR buffer
suitable for maintaining tissue integrity without rapid degradation.
• Specimen Labeling: Each specimen must have a unique identifier;
include collection date, time, and patient's clinical history.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Degraded or improperly fixed specimens.
• Specimens without proper labeling and documentation.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopes (brightfield, polarized light, and electron
microscopes)
• Microtomes and cryostats for sectioning tissue
• Staining solutions: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Modified
Gomori Trichrome, NADH-TR, ATPase (various pH), Alkaline
Phosphatase, Acid Phosphatase, Immunohistochemical stains
• Specialized reagents for enzyme histochemistry and
immunohistochemistry
• Objective slides, cover slips, mounting media
• Disinfection supplies and PPE
5. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Preparation:
1. Fresh Specimens:
◦ For frozen sections: Embed muscle tissue in OCT
compound, freeze rapidly using a cryostat.
◦ For paraffin-embedded specimens: Fix tissue in formalin,
process through increasing alcohol series, clear in xylene,
and embed in paraffin.
2. Sectioning:
◦ Perform serial sectioning of tissues at appropriate thickness
(4-15 microns for routine stains, thinner for specialized
stains).
◦ Mount the sections onto clean, labeled slides.
B) Staining:
1. Routine Stains:
◦ Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E): Follow standard staining
protocol.
◦ Gomori Trichrome: Prepare slides according to set
histochemical procedures.
2. Enzyme Histochemistry and specialized stains:
◦ Common stains include NADH-TR, SDH, ATPase (pH 9.4,
4.3, 4.6), COX, ALP, ACP.
◦ Execute each stain under optimized conditions and
document incubation times, temperatures, and any
deviations.
C) Immunohistochemistry (IHC): - Process tissue for IHC according
to antibody specifications. Include positive and negative control
tissues to validate staining.
D) Microscopic Evaluation and Interpretation:
1. Examine slides under appropriate magnification and light
settings.
2. Document and describe histopathologic findings, focusing on:
◦ Muscle fiber morphologies (size variations, internal nuclei,
splitting)
◦ Inflammatory infiltrates, fibrosis, necrosis or regeneration
◦ Abnormal staining patterns.
3. Correlate histological findings with clinical history and any
additional tests.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Batch controls: Perform QC stains with each batch, ensuring
quality and consistency.
• Equipment maintenance: Maintain and calibrate equipment as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Reagent validation: Verify lot numbers and expiry dates before
use.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) with
reference to specific staining protocols used.
• The supervising pathologist reviews and validates the microscopic
interpretation and overall findings.
• Generate a comprehensive report including:
◦ Patient identifiers
◦ Clinical history
◦ Gross description of the biopsy
◦ Detailed microscopic findings
◦ Conclusion and any diagnostic comments
• Ensure timely communication of the final report to the referring
physician, adhering to laboratory guidelines.
8. REFERENCES
Include reference materials from:
• Standard histotechnology and muscle pathology texts.
• Manufacturer’s inserts for specific reagents and procedures.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and research articles.
This protocol ensures that muscle pathology consultations are
handled consistently and accurately, providing reliable diagnostic
information for patient management.
