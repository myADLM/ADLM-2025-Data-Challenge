Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for MUSCLE
RELAXANTS, UMBILICAL CORD TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the analytical procedure for testing umbilical
cord tissue for muscle relaxants. The method includes tissue
preparation, analytical instrumentation, data generation, quality
control, and reporting results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel (technologists and supervisors) are
responsible for performing and documenting the analytical testing of
umbilical cord tissue for muscle relaxants.
1. DEFINITIONS
Muscle Relaxants: Pharmaceutical agents used to reduce tension in
muscles. Umbilical Cord Tissue: Biological material collected from the
umbilical cord post-delivery.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen:
Preferred/acceptable:
- Umbilical cord tissue sample (at least 1 gram) collected and stored at -20°C or lower as soon as possible after delivery.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens collected 24 hours or more after delivery unless stored at -20°C or lower immediately after collection.
- Specimens without proper collection date and time indicated on requisition.
Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen umbilical cord tissue at room temperature.
2. Homogenize a portion of the tissue (500 milligrams) using a homogenizer or equivalent instrument until smooth.
3. Transfer homogenized tissue to a sterile container for further processing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Analytical balance Tissue homogenizer Centrifuge Vortex mixer
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Internal
standards (e.g., deuterated muscle relaxants) Methanol, acetonitrile,
formic acid Sample extraction columns (e.g., SPE) Laboratory-grade
deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Processing and Extraction:
1. Weigh 200 milligrams of homogenized tissue into a centrifuge tube.
2. Add 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of acetonitrile to the sample.
3. Vortex mix for 1 minute to ensure thorough mixing.
4. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
5. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean tube without disturbing the pellet.
6. Repeat the extraction with an additional 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of acetonitrile.
7. Combine supernatants and evaporate to dryness under a stream of nitrogen or in a vacuum concentrator.
8. Reconstitute the dried residue in 500 μL of mobile phase (water:acetonitrile:formic acid, 90:10:0.1, v/v/v)
B) Analytical Instrumentation (LC-MS/MS)
1. Prepare LC-MS/MS according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Inject 10 microliters of reconstituted sample into the LC-MS/MS instrument.
3. Use a suitable gradient program with a reverse-phase LC column.
4. Detect muscle relaxants using appropriate mass transitions tailored for each analyte.
5. Include internal standards to account for matrix effects and variability.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal/External Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control (QC) samples in each batch, including negative control, low positive control, and high positive control samples.
2. Ensure calibration curve includes standards at concentrations bracketing sample expectations.
3. QC results must fall within acceptable ranges, initially defined by validated assays, to consider batch valid.
Instrument Maintenance and Calibration:
1. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for daily start-up, calibration, and shut-down procedures.
2. Perform regular maintenance as specified in the instrument manual.
3. Document calibration and maintenance activities in instrument logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review generated data for integrity and accuracy.
2. Calculate analyte concentrations using calibration curve
parameters and ensure appropriate controls.
3. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
with a detailed documentation of analytical method and
results validation.
4. If critical results are observed, notify the requesting
healthcare provider immediately following the
documented critical values policy.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Recognize that matrix complexity may affect analyte recovery
and signal suppression. Muscle relaxants may have
metabolites or isomers that could complicate detection. Adapt
protocol as needed or validate alternative methods.
