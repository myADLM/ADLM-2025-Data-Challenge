Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for Generating Results for Mushroom, IgE,
Serum
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of Mushroom-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples to
ensure accurate and reliable test results.
1. Scope:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
Mushroom IgE analysis in serum samples within the laboratory.
1. Responsibilities:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined in this SOP and ensuring that all data is
accurately recorded and reported. It is also the responsibility of the
staff to identify and report any deviations or issues to the supervisor.
1. Specimen Requirements:
a. Acceptable Specimen: Serum sample collected in a red-top
or serum gel barrier tube. b. Unacceptable Specimen:
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum; samples that are not
properly labeled; and any sample that does not meet the
specified volume requirements.
2. Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies:
a. Reagents: i. Calibration reagents ii. Quality control materials
iii. Allergen-specific IgE reagent kits (Mushroom)
b. Equipment: i. Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP) ii.
Centrifuge iii. Properly calibrated pipettes
c. Supplies: i. Microfuge tubes ii. Sample tubes iii. Reagent
container/packaging
3. Procedure:
a. Specimen Preparation:
i. Centrifuge the collected serum sample at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes. ii. Carefully transfer the serum into a clean, properly
labeled microfuge tube. iii. Store the serum samples at 2-8°C if
analysis is to be performed within 48 hours or freeze at -20°C
or lower if storage will be longer.
b. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
i. Prepare the calibration reagents and quality control materials
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ii. Ensure all
reagents and controls are brought to room temperature before
use.
c. Immunoassay Analysis:
i. Set up the immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions. ii. Load calibration standards, quality control
samples, and patient serum samples onto the analyzer. iii.
Ensure the proper identification and positioning of all samples.
iv. Perform the assay following the specific protocol detailed in
the Allergen-specific IgE reagent kit's insert.
d. Recording and Analyzing Data:
i. After the run is complete, ensure that the calibration curve is
valid and all control samples are within acceptable ranges. ii.
Record and verify patient results using the laboratory
information management system (LIS). iii. If any result is
flagged as critical or questionable, follow laboratory protocols
for reanalysis and reporting.
4. Quality Control:
a. Internal Quality Control: i. Run internal quality control
samples with each batch of patient samples to ensure assay
accuracy. ii. Document and review quality control results daily.
Investigate and resolve any QC issues before reporting patient
results.
b. External Quality Control: i. Participate in regular external
proficiency testing programs, and document and review results.
5. Reporting Results:
a. Review all analytical data for accuracy and consistency
before reporting. b. Report results to the LIS and ensure that
results are communicated appropriately to the referring
clinician. c. Maintain all patient records following the
laboratory’s data retention policy.
6. Reference Intervals:
a. Maintain a record of reference intervals for Mushroom-
specific IgE provided by the reagent manufacturer or validated
by the laboratory. b. Include the reference interval in the
patient’s report.
7. References:
• Manufacturer's insert for detailed procedures of Allergen-specific
IgE reagent kit.
• Laboratory-specific quality control procedures and data logs.
1. Review and Revision:
This SOP must be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change
in the testing procedure, reagents, or equipment. Changes must be
documented and approved by the laboratory manager.
