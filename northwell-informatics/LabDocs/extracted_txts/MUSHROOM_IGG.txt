Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Mushroom
IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis, interpretation,
and reporting of Mushroom IgG results to ensure accuracy, reliability,
and consistency.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing Mushroom
IgG testing by following this procedure. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring staff adherence to the protocols and for reviewing the
results for accuracy before reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a plain or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Acceptable Specimen: Plasma collected using EDTA or
heparinized tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
reader, microcentrifuge, micropipettes, incubator (37°C).
• Reagents: Mushroom IgG test kit, wash buffer, substrate solution,
stopping solution, standard controls.
• Supplies: Microtiter plates, pipette tips, calibration and control
materials, disposable gloves, and lab coats.
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning correctly.
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before use.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge serum or plasma samples at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to obtain a clear supernatant.
◦ Aliquot samples to reduce freeze-thaw cycles, if not
analyzed immediately.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to
appropriate wells on the ELISA plate.
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
materials.
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate
for another 30 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate
for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
◦ Add 100 µL of stopping solution to each well to halt the
reaction.
4. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Read the plate at the recommended wavelength (usually
450 nm) using the ELISA reader.
◦ Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of
the standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Mushroom IgG in patient
samples by comparing absorbance values to the standard
curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run standard controls with every batch of samples to ensure
assay accuracy.
• If controls do not fall within the established ranges, the entire run
should be repeated.
• Document all results, including control values, and any corrective
actions taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results automatically to the laboratory information
system (LIS) for review and verification.
• Critical or significantly elevated results should be flagged and
reviewed by the supervisor before reporting.
• Ensure all results coincide with the quality control standards
provided by the kit manufacturer.
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Assess each specimen's integrity before analysis for signs of
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• If the sample quality is questionable, document the issue and
request a new specimen from the patient if necessary.
9. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Results that fall significantly outside the normal range should be
reported immediately to the clinician.
• Follow the laboratory’s criteria for critical values and ensure all
communications are documented.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Acknowledge any methodological limitations as provided by the
manufacturer and documented in the assay kit insert.
• Inform the requesting clinician of any potential interferences that
may affect the results' accuracy.
11. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for detailed
information on the ELISA kit and procedural specifics.
• Laboratory internal quality control documentation for standard
ranges and accepted limits.
12. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs of all calibrations, equipment maintenance, quality
control results, and patient result records as per laboratory policy.
• Ensure all documentation is kept up to date and readily
accessible for review.
