Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Mustard Food IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Mustard Food IgG, ensuring accuracy and
reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in the
Mustard Food IgG testing procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the test as
per the procedure and documenting all steps accurately.
• Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP and
addressing any issues that arise during testing.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Microplate Reader
• ELISA Wash System
• Pipettes and Tips
• Multichannel Pipette
• Microcentrifuge
• Mustard Food IgG ELISA Kit
• Microtiter Plates
• Distilled or Deionized Water
• Calibrated Incubator
• Plate Shaker
5. SPECIMEN
• Preferred Specimen: Serum, collected in a red-top vacutainer.
• Storage: Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 72
hours. Freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use Positive and Negative IgG Controls provided in the ELISA kit.
• Run controls with each batch of samples.
• Ensure controls are within the expected range and document
results.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation
• Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
before use.
• Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and other kit-specific
reagents as directed.
7.2. Sample and Control Loading
• Label microtiter plate wells according to the layout plan ensuring
each sample, control, and standard is loaded correctly.
• Pipette 100 µL of each serum sample, control, and standard into
designated wells.
• Use a multichannel pipette for precision and consistency.
• Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7.3. Washing
• Aspirate liquid from wells and fill with 300 µL wash buffer.
• Repeat wash steps 3 times.
• After the last wash, invert the plate and blot it on a paper towel to
remove residual liquid.
7.4. Incubation with Conjugate
• Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate into each well.
• Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes on a plate
shaker set at 300 rpm.
7.5. Washing
• Repeat the washing steps as in Section 7.3.
7.6. Substrate Reaction
• Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes or until the desired color change is observed.
7.7. Stopping the Reaction
• Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction. The color changes from blue to yellow.
7.8. Reading the Plate
• Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an ELISA
microplate reader.
• Ensure plate reading is completed within 30 minutes of adding the
stop solution.
8. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Plot standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards.
• Calculate IgG levels in serum samples using the standard curve.
• Express results in U/mL.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and validated by a laboratory
technologist before official release.
• Notify the physician or healthcare provider of critical values via
appropriate channels.
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Perform internal quality control checks bi-weekly and monthly
validation for new reagent lots.
• Detailed logging of any deviations and corrective actions taken.

12. AMENDMENTS AND REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and amended as necessary to
reflect current good laboratory practices and updated guidelines.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate
and reliable results for Mustard Food IgG testing, thereby supporting
effective patient care.
