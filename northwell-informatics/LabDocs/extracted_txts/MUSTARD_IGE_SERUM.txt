Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MUSTARD, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a SOP for the analysis of Mustard, Immunoglobulin E
(IgE), and Serum in the laboratory to ensure accurate, reliable, and
timely results. This SOP outlines the steps for processing, analyzing,
and reporting the results for these specific tests.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to follow the
procedures outlined in this SOP and ensure that results are
generated accurately and efficiently.
1. DEFINITION
• MUSTARD: Refers to the detection and quantification of Mustard
agent metabolites in biological specimens.
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a class of antibodies associated with
allergic reactions and certain parasitic infections.
• Serum: General serum analysis including but not limited to
electrolytes, enzymes, hormones, and metabolites.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verify that specimen has already been collected, received, and
accessioned according to pre-analytical SOPs.
2. Ensure that the sample integrity is intact (i.e., no hemolysis,
clotting, or contamination). If sample integrity is questionable, a
small aliquot can be centrifuged to check for integrity issues.
3. For IgE and Serum, ensure that samples are centrifuged to
separate the serum from cellular components. Store separated
serum according to specific test requirements until analysis.
B. MUSTARD Analysis
1. Equipment:
◦ Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
◦ Appropriate reagents and standards
2. Procedure: a. Calibrate the GC-MS/LC-MS according to
manufacturer instructions. b. Prepare samples using solid
phase extraction (SPE) or other designated preparation
methods. c. Load prepared samples into the GC-MS/LC-MS. d.
Analyze samples and monitor for appropriate peaks
corresponding to Mustard agent metabolites. e. Record findings
in the instrument data log and export results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
C. IgE Analysis
1. Equipment:
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Reader or
Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) Analyzer
2. Procedure: a. Calibrate the ELISA/CLIA Analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions. b. Prepare standards, controls, and
samples according to kit protocol. c. Load samples and controls
into the analyzer. d. Run the assay and measure absorbance or
luminescence to quantify IgE concentration. e. Record findings
in the instrument data log and export results to the LIS.
D. Serum Analysis
1. Equipment:
◦ Biochemistry Analyzer
2. Procedure: a. Calibrate the Biochemistry Analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions. b. Prepare serum samples and
controls. c. Load serum samples into the analyzer and select
appropriate panels/tests (e.g., electrolytes, enzymes,
hormones). d. Run the assays and analyze results. e. Record
findings in the instrument data log and export results to the LIS.
E. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control a. Run quality control material
according to a set schedule as outlined in the SOP. b. Record
and review QC results for each analyte. c. If QC results are
outside acceptable limits, investigate and troubleshoot before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
F. Reporting Results
1. Results should be automatically transmitted to the LIS.
2. Review and verify results by a qualified technologist.
3. Report critical results according to site-specific guidelines and
ensure proper documentation of all actions taken.
G. Documentation
1. Maintain documentation for all calibration, sample preparation,
analysis, QC, and reporting steps.
2. Ensure all logs, worksheets, and electronic records are
complete and accurate.
