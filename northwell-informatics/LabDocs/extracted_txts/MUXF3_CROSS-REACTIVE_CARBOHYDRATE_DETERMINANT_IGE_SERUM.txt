Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MUXF3 (Cross-Reactive Carbohydrate
Determinant), IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing and documenting
the analysis of MUXF3 (Cross-Reactive Carbohydrate Determinant),
IgE in serum specimens. This ensures accurate and reliable results
for clinical interpretation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis, document all relevant information, and ensure the
procedures are followed accurately. Any deficiencies or deviations
should be immediately brought to the attention of the supervisor.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all MUXF3 (Cross-Reactive Carbohydrate
Determinant), IgE serum analyses performed in the laboratory.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• 5 mL serum collected via venipuncture.
• Specimen should be collected into a serum separator tube (SST)
and allowed to clot at room temperature.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens showing visible hemolysis or clots.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identification.
• Serum samples stored for more than 48 hours at 2-8°C without
prior freezing.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers (e.g., non-serum
tubes).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP or similar)
Reagents:
• MUXF3 (Cross-Reactive Carbohydrate Determinant) IgE-specific
reagent kit
• Quality control material (positive and negative controls)
Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
• Biohazard disposal containers
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify patient identification and check for proper labeling.
2. Centrifuge SST at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
3. Transfer serum to a properly labeled secondary tube if
necessary.
5.2 Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Record control results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
5.3 Sample Analysis:
1. Load the immunoassay analyzer with reagents and calibrate
according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Pipette a specified volume (as per reagent kit instructions) of
serum sample into the predefined wells of the analyzer.
3. Start the analysis process on the immunoassay analyzer.
4. Monitor the analysis and ensure the analyzer performs
correctly, checking for any error messages or alerts.
5.4 Interpretation and Documentation:
1. Retrieve results from the analyzer.
2. Review results for each sample, ensuring control results were
within acceptable limits.
3. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Flag any critical values according to site-specific guidelines and
notify the appropriate clinical personnel.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to reagent kit insert for MUXF3, IgE reference intervals.
Documentation:
• All results must be reviewed, verified, and documented in the LIS
with technician initials and date.
Critical Values:
• Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting and documentation of
critical values and notify the clinician immediately.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit insert for any limitations specific to the
MUXF3 (Cross-Reactive Carbohydrate Determinant), IgE test.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing (e.g., CAP surveys) and
document results and corrective actions when necessary.
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform weekly intra-laboratory quality checks using pre-
determined procedures and record all data.
