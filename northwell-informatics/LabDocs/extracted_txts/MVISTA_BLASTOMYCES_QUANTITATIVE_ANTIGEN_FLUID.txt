Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MVISTA
BLASTOMYCES QUANTITATIVE ANTIGEN, FLUID
1. PURPOSE:
To provide accurate and reliable measurement of Blastomyces
antigen levels in fluid samples using the MVista Blastomyces
Quantitative Antigen assay.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the MVista
Blastomyces Quantitative Antigen assay according to this SOP and
documenting all procedures and findings.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to fluid specimens including BAL, pleural fluid, CSF,
and other sterile body fluids collected from patients for the purpose of
identifying and quantifying Blastomyces antigens.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 1-3 mL of fluid (e.g., BAL, pleural fluid, CSF).
• Sterile, leak-proof container.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as soon as
possible. If a delay in processing is expected, refrigerate at 2-8°C
and process within 48 hours. If the delay is longer than 48 hours,
freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination or leakage.
• Specimens in anticoagulant or preservatives other than
acceptable preservatives (if any specified by the manufacturer).
• Improperly labeled or unlabeled specimens.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT:
• MVista Blastomyces Quantitative Antigen assay kit (store as per
manufacturer instructions).
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Incubator.
• Plate reader compatible with the assay kit.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform QC with each run of patient specimens.
• Use positive and negative controls provided in the assay kit or
separately validated by the laboratory.
• Document all QC results and ensure they fall within the
established acceptable range before proceeding with patient
sample testing.
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to equilibrate to room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare the workspace by wiping down surfaces with
appropriate disinfectant to maintain a sterile environment.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix fluid specimens well by gentle inversion.
◦ Centrifuge samples if necessary to remove particulates
(e.g., 10 minutes at 5000 rpm).
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the preparation of
working dilutions of reagents if required.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Dispense the required volume of each reagent and sample
into the appropriate wells of the assay plate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate as directed by the manufacturer.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as described in the kit instructions, ensuring
complete removal of wash buffer to minimize background
noise.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the detection antibodies/enzymes as per protocol.
◦ Perform subsequent incubations and washes as instructed.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Add the substrate and stop solutions as directed.
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
a microplate reader.
7. Data Interpretation:
◦ Use the kit’s calibration curve or standard concentrations to
calculate antigen levels in patient samples.
◦ Apply any correction factors provided in the assay’s protocol
to account for specific matrix effects.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Document raw data and calculations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Verify and validate results according to internal quality
assurance protocols.
3. Report quantitative Blastomyces antigen levels with reference
ranges and interpretive comments based on clinical guidelines.
4. Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the MVista Blastomyces Quantitative Antigen assay kit insert
for limitations regarding sensitivity, specificity, and potential cross-
reactivities.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If QC fails, do not proceed with testing patient samples. Review
the procedure, equipment, and reagents. Document and correct
any identified issues before retesting.
• In case of instrument error or assay failure, follow the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide and consult with the
supervisor if necessary.
