MVISTA COCCIDIOIDES QUANTITATIVE ANTIGEN EIA
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for the MVISTA
Coccidioides Quantitative Antigen Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA). This
will ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the results
produced.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay as outlined in this SOP. They must ensure that all steps are
followed accurately and that any issues or deviations are reported to
the supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all qualified laboratory staff involved in
conducting the MVISTA Coccidioides Quantitative Antigen EIA.
1. DEFINITIONS
MVISTA Coccidioides Quantitative Antigen EIA: A quantitative
enzyme immunoassay for the detection and measurement of
Coccidioides antigen in patient samples.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum or urine samples.
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum or urine.
• Storage: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and processed
within 48 hours. For long-term storage, samples should be frozen
at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• MVISTA Coccidioides Quantitative Antigen EIA Kit
• Microplate Reader (capable of reading at 450 nm with a reference
of 620-650 nm)
• Wash Buffer
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate shaker
• Timer
• Calibrated control solutions (low, medium, and high)
• Laboratory notepad or computer for recording results
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Vortex all samples and controls briefly before use.
3. Prepare wash buffer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Label the microplate layout and arrange the controls and
patient samples accordingly.
2. Pipette 100 μL of standards, controls, and patient samples into
the designated wells in duplicate.
3. Add 100 μL of the enzyme conjugate to each well.
4. Cover the plate with adhesive cover or plate sealer.
5. Incubate the plate on a microplate shaker at room temperature
(20-25°C) for 60 minutes.
6. Wash the plate:
◦ Discard the contents of the wells by aspiration or inversion
with a firm pat onto absorbent paper.
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with 300 μL of wash buffer. Ensure
that the wells are filled completely and all liquid is removed
after each wash.
7. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 10-30 minutes,
protected from light.
9. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference filter of
620-650 nm using a microplate reader.
C. Calculation of Results
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
(y-axis) versus the concentration of standards (x-axis).
2. Calculate the Coccidioides antigen concentration in the patient
samples using the standard curve. Ensure the calculations are
in the appropriate range indicated by the kit’s manufacturer.
3. Quality control results must be within specified ranges before
reporting patient results. If quality control results are out of
range, the assay is considered invalid and must be repeated.
4. Record the final results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and document on the appropriate forms.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• Ensure that the controls fall within the acceptable range provided
by the manufacturer.
• Document all control results and any corrective actions taken if
controls fall outside the acceptable range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Notify the ordering physician or department of critical values
promptly, according to laboratory policy.
• Enter results into the LIS and generate a report for release.
