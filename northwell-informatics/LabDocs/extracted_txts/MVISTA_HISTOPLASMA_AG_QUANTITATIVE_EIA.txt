Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MVISTA
Histoplasma Antigen Quantitative EIA
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, consistent, and timely results for the detection
and quantification of Histoplasma antigen in patient specimens using
the MVISTA Histoplasma Antigen Quantitative Enzyme Immunoassay
(EIA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technical staff are responsible for performing the assay according
to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and addressing any issues that may affect the quality of
results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Preferred Specimen Types:
• Urine: Collect 10 mL of urine in a sterile container. Store and
transport at 2-8°C. Suitable for testing up to 48 hours after
collection if kept at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Specimens that are not properly labeled and/or lack collection
date/time.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection if stored
at 2-8°C.
• Specimens with visible signs of contamination or compromised
integrity.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate spectrophotometer
• Centrifuge (capable of achieving 1500 g)
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
Reagents:
• MVISTA Histoplasma Antigen Quantitative EIA kit (including
microplate, standards, controls, wash buffer, conjugate, substrate,
stop solution)
• Deionized water
Supplies:
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Sterile collection containers
• Laboratory timer
• Disposable gloves
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, controls, standards, and specimens to room
temperature (18-25°C) before testing.
2. Set up the microplate spectrophotometer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge urine specimens at 1500 g for 15 minutes.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to a labeled clean tube for
testing.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Label the wells of the microplate to include standards,
controls, and patient specimens in duplicate.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and specimens into
assigned wells.
3. Adding Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate solution into each well using a
clean pipette tip.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with the diluted wash buffer,
ensuring complete removal of excess liquid after each wash.
◦ Aspirate or decant the wash buffer after each wash step.
5. Adding Substrate:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature (18-25°C) for 30
minutes avoiding light exposure.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance immediately at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculations:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the known standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Histoplasma antigen in
patient specimens by interpolation from the standard curve.
2. Verification:
◦ Ensure the controls fall within specified ranges. Review any
outlying results for quality control and repeat the test if
necessary.
◦ Verify patient results according to laboratory-specific
reporting guidelines.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all data including specimen labels, standard curve
values, and calculated patient results.
◦ Results should be electronically documented and reviewed
prior to release.
4. Critical Results:
◦ Immediately report critical values according to lab policy and
document the communication.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure reagent kits are within their expiration dates and stored
under recommended conditions.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing twice annually and document
performance.

assurance guidelines.
Approval and Review:
• This protocol is reviewed annually or upon significant
amendments to manufacturer’s instructions. The lab manager
approves revisions.
This SOP ensures that the procedures are standardized, allowing
consistent and reliable results for Histoplasma antigen detection and
quantification.
