Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): MVISTA Histoplasma Ag
Quantitative, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide instructions for the
quantitative measurement of Histoplasma antigen in spinal fluid
samples using the MVISTA Histoplasma Ag Quantitative test.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the assay, ensure quality control, and accurately document the test
results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff are trained and
for reviewing test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Spinal fluid (CSF)
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 48 hours
of collection. If testing cannot be completed within this time frame,
the specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 24 hours.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
Preparation: Bring frozen specimens to room temperature before
testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• MVISTA Histoplasma Ag Quantitative test system
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes (adjustable 10 µL – 1000 µL)
• Test tubes/vials
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• MVISTA Histoplasma Ag Quantitative reagents
• Controls and calibrators as provided by the manufacturer
• Buffer solution
Supplies:
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
1. PROCEDURE
a. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the spinal fluid sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes
to remove particulate matter.
2. Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube without
disturbing the pellet.
b. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration using the calibrators provided by the
manufacturer.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for programming the
calibrator values into the test system.
c. Quality Control:
1. Run low, medium, and high control samples along with patient
samples.
2. Ensure control results fall within the manufacturer’s specified
range before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
d. Assay Procedure:
1. Label test tubes/vials for each sample, control, and calibrator.
2. Pipette the required volume of buffer solution into each labeled
tube.
3. Add the appropriate volume of the spinal fluid sample, control,
or calibrator to the respective tubes.
4. Mix by vortexing briefly.
5. Incubate the tubes as specified in the kit insert (typically at
room temperature for the designated time).
6. After incubation, place the tubes in the detector reader for
analysis.
7. Record the readings and ensure that all results are
documented.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Interpretation:
• Results are reported as antigen concentrations based on the
standard curve generated from the calibrators.
• The laboratory's LIS will be used to record and verify results.
Reference Intervals:
• The reference interval for the MVISTA Histoplasma Ag
Quantitative test is provided in the package insert.
Critical Results:
• Critical results (e.g., significantly high antigen levels) must be
communicated immediately to the requesting physician or clinical
team in accordance with the lab's critical result reporting policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Daily Quality Control:
• Perform quality control checks with each assay run.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
• Do not report patient results unless QC passes.
Troubleshooting:
• If QC results are out of range, repeat the QC.
• If repeat QC fails, investigate the cause (e.g., reagent expiration,
equipment malfunction) and resolve the issue before proceeding
with patient samples.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the MVISTA Histoplasma Ag Quantitative kit insert for
assay limitations and potential interfering substances.
