Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Myasthenia Gravis
Evaluation with Muscle-Specific Kinase (MuSK) Reflex, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Myasthenia Gravis Evaluation with
Muscle-Specific Kinase (MuSK) Reflex in serum. This SOP ensures
that testing is performed consistently, accurately, and in compliance
with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the Myasthenia Gravis Evaluation with MuSK Reflex
testing.
1. DEFINITION
Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder
characterized by muscle weakness. The MuSK antibody test is used
to evaluate patients for this condition.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Volume: 1 mL of serum Minimum
Volume: 0.5 mL of serum Stability: Specimens must be stored and
transported at 2-8°C if delivery is expected within 72 hours. For
longer storage, freeze the specimen at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable conditions:
• Grossly hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in heparinized tubes
• Specimens not properly labeled or without a collection date/time
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer suitable for antibody testing (e.g., ELISA
reader)
• MuSK antibody test kit (Follow Manufacturer's Instructions)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution and stop solution for colorimetric assay
• Calibration and control materials as specified by the test kit
manufacturer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Allow reagents and specimens to come to room temperature.
• Prepare all necessary reagents and equipment according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure calibration of the immunoassay analyzer is up-to-date.
B. Running the Assay
1. Label all tubes/plates appropriately.
2. Add 100 µL of the serum specimen to the designated wells.
3. Add appropriate volume of diluent and reagents as instructed in
the kit.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time.
5. Wash the wells to remove unbound reagents using wash buffer
(3-5 wash cycles recommended).
6. Add the substrate solution and incubate for the time specified in
the kit instructions.
7. Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
C. Reading the Results
1. Insert the plate into the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength (typically
around 450 nm).
3. Calculate the antibody concentrations using the calibration
curve generated by the standards.
D. Interpretation and Reflex Testing
• If the MuSK antibody titer is within the positive range as defined
by the manufacturer:
◦ Report as positive for MuSK antibodies.
◦ Reflex test blood sample for Acetylcholine Receptor (AChR)
antibodies if requested.
• If the MuSK antibody titer is within the negative range:
◦ Report as negative for MuSK antibodies.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Verify that control results fall within the specified ranges before
validating patient results.
B. External Quality Control
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as available to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure results are accurately entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before releasing to the medical record.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• MuSK antibody negative: Below cut-off value defined by the
manufacturer
• MuSK antibody positive: At or above the cut-off value defined by
the manufacturer
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False-negative results may occur in patients with low antibody
levels.
• Interference from other diseases or conditions may affect results
and should be considered during patient evaluation.
