Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Myasthenia Gravis /
Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis and generation
of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic
Syndrome (LEMS) evaluations in serum samples, ensuring accurate
and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the Myasthenia Gravis/Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic
Syndrome evaluations as defined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory personnel to identify any deviations
from established procedures that may affect test results and to report
these to the supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of serum
Collection Requirements:
• Use a red top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge within 2 hours of collection to separate serum.
• Transfer serum into a labeled aliquot tube if necessary.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: Up to 8 hours
• 2-8°C: Up to 7 days
• -20°C or colder: Up to 30 days (for long-term storage)
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed
• Lipemic
• Icteric
• Collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin)
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader and washer
• Incubator capable of 37°C
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• ELISA kits specific for MG/LEMS detection
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
• Ensure the ELISA reader and washer are properly calibrated and
functioning.
• Prepare reagents and wash buffer as indicated in the kit insert.
• Protocols for reagent preparation should be referenced from the
ELISA kit manufacturer insert.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before beginning the assay.
◦ Prepare standards, controls, and patient samples as
outlined in the kit insert.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Label the microplate appropriately.
◦ Add the specified volume of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples into the designated wells.
◦ Add assay buffer to all wells, if required by the kit insert.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time according
to the kit insert.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate according to the specified procedure in
the kit insert, ensuring consistency in washing to minimize
variability.
5. Detection:
◦ Add detection antibodies or enzyme conjugates to each well
as directed by the kit procedure.
◦ Incubate and wash as specified in the kit insert.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for the specified
time.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well.
◦ Tap the plate gently to ensure thorough mixing.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the wavelength
specified by the kit, typically at 450 nm with reference
wavelengths as advised.
◦ Ensure all results are recorded promptly.
5. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the mean absorbance value for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient samples.
• Create a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of each
standard on the y-axis against its concentration on the x-axis. Fit
a best-fit curve through the standard points to generate the
standard curve.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR Ab) or P/Q-type voltage-
gated calcium channel antibodies (VGCC Ab) in patient samples.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls in each assay run to
ensure test validity.
• Results within the QC range validate the assay run. If controls fail,
reject the run and troubleshoot according to kit instructions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the concentrations of AChR Ab or VGCC Ab based on the
standard curve in appropriate units (e.g., nmol/L, pmol/L).
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider of critically abnormal
results promptly.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the kit-specific reference intervals provided by the
manufacturer. These intervals should be used unless laboratory-
specific validated reference ranges are established.
9. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
• Identify possible cross-reactivity and analytical interferences listed
in the kit insert.
• Ensure adequate controls are included to validate all results
properly.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert for the specific ELISA kit used (include the
kit name and catalog number).
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
immunoassay performance.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps taken during the assay are well-documented in
the lab's records, including deviations and corrective actions
taken when necessary.
• Retain documentation for future reference and potential audits.
12. REVIEW AND UPDATE
• Review and update protocol annually or if a new kit/method is
introduced.
• Ensure all staff are trained on any changes to the protocol.
