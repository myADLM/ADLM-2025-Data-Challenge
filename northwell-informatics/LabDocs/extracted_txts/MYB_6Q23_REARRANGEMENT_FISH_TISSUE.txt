Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MYB (6Q23)
REARRANGEMENT FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) in
TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
This document describes the protocol for performing Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) to detect the MYB (6q23) rearrangement in
tissue samples. The objective is to ensure accurate and reproducible
results to aid in diagnosis, prognostic evaluations, and therapeutic
decisions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to execute the FISH
procedure following the specifications in this SOP. Supervisors must
ensure compliance, address any deviations, and validate final results.
3. DEFINITIONS
FISH: A molecular technique used to detect chromosomal
abnormalities via fluorescent probes. MYB: MYB Proto-Oncogene is
located at chromosome 6q23.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Equipment and Materials
1. MYB (6q23) rearrangement-specific FISH probe kit
2. FISH Hybridization workstation and accessories
3. Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets
4. Microscope slides and coverslips
5. Tissue samples fixed (preferably FFPE blocks)
4.2 Tissue Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-6 µm thick sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks.
◦ Mount sections on positively charged microscope slides.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Heat slides at 60°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Sequentially immerse slides in xylene (2x for 10 minutes
each).
◦ Rehydrate slides with a series of ethanol washes (100%,
95%, 70%, and 50%) for 5 minutes each, followed by a brief
rinse in distilled water.
4.3 Pre-Treatment
1. Proteolytic Digestion:
◦ Immerse slides in pre-warmed 1X pretreatment solution at
37°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 2X SSC buffer at room temperature for 5
minutes.
2. Denaturation:
◦ Immerse the slides in pre-warmed denaturation solution at
73°C for precisely 5 minutes.
◦ Immediately immerse in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
◦ Sequentially immerse in 80%, 95%, and 100% ethanol at
room temperature for 1 minute each.
◦ Let slides air dry.
4.4 Hybridization
1. Probe Preparation:
◦ Denature the MYB FISH probe mix at 75°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Pre-warm the hybridization buffer at 37°C.
2. Application:
◦ Apply 10 µL of the denatured FISH probe mix to each tissue
section.
◦ Cover with a 22x22 mm coverslip and seal with rubber
cement.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Incubate slides in a hybridization oven at 37°C for 16-24
hours.
4.5 Post-Hybridization Washes and Counterstaining
1. Washing:
◦ Carefully remove coverslip by immersing slides in 2X SSC
buffer (with 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature for
approximately 5 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 0.4X SSC/0.3% Tween-20 pre-warmed to
73°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in 2X SSC at room temperature for 2 minutes.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).
◦ Apply antifade solution and coverslip.
4.6 Microscopy and Analysis
• Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filter sets (DAPI, FITC, TRITC).
• Analyze at least 200 interphase nuclei per sample.
• Interpret as follows:
◦ Normal: Two red signals and two green signals.
◦ Abnormal: Split red and green signals indicating MYB
rearrangement.
4.7 Reporting Results
• Document the number of normal versus abnormal nuclei.
• Calculate the percentage of abnormal cells.
• Generate a report including the findings, with interpretation by a
qualified pathologist.
4.8 Quality Control
1. Control Slides:
◦ Run a positive control slide with known MYB rearrangement
and a negative control with normal tissue.
2. Verification:
◦ Review any questionable results with a second technologist
and/or quality control program.
3. Documentation:
◦ Maintain thorough records of each step and condition,
including probe hybridization, microscope settings,
observations and image captures.
