Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for
Mycobacterial Culture, Blood
Title: SOP for Analytical Phase of Mycobacterial Culture from
Blood Specimens
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for mycobacterial culture from blood
specimens. This SOP ensures the accuracy and reliability of test
results, guides laboratory staff in the analysis procedure, and
provides instructions for quality control and troubleshooting.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
documenting, and verifying the procedures defined in this SOP.
• All staff are responsible for identifying any non-conformities and
reporting them to a supervisor immediately.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Mycobacteria: Bacteria that may cause infections, including
tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
• Analytical Phase: The phase in testing where the specimen is
analyzed and test results are generated.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Blood collected in a Myco/F Lytic bottle or other
suitable blood culture media designed for mycobacteria recovery.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum volume requirements as indicated
by the manufacturer of the blood culture bottle (usually 8-10 mL).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Blood culture system (e.g., BACTEC, BacT/ALERT) for
automated culture monitoring.
• Biosafety Cabinet (Class II) for handling cultures.
• Incubator set at 35-37°C.
• MGIT tubes if applicable.
• Ziehl-Neelsen staining kit.
• GeneXpert systems for identification, if available.
• Species-specific reagents for molecular identification.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Processing:
1. Blood Culture Inoculation:
◦ Upon specimen receipt, ensure that all pertinent information
such as patient identification and collection time is correctly
documented.
◦ Aseptically inoculate the blood specimen into the
mycobacterial blood culture bottle according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Automated Monitoring:
◦ Load the inoculated bottles into the automated culture
system.
◦ Program the system for continuous monitoring based on the
manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate at 35-37°C for a minimum of 42 days.
◦ Regularly monitor the automated system for signals
indicating positive growth.
B) Detection:
1. Positive Culture:
◦ When a culture bottle flags positive, remove it from the
incubator.
◦ Perform a Ziehl-Neelsen stain or auramine-rhodamine stain
on a smear prepared from the positive blood culture.
◦ Examine the smear under a microscope for acid-fast bacilli
(AFB).
2. Identification:
◦ If AFB are present, proceed with molecular testing for
identification (e.g., GeneXpert, DNA probe test, or other
PCR-based identification).
◦ Set up subcultures on solid media (e.g. Lowenstein-Jensen)
if necessary.
◦ Incubate subcultures at 35-37°C and monitor for growth.
C) Negative Culture:
• If no growth is detected after 42 days of incubation, report the
culture as no mycobacteria isolated.
• Discard the culture bottle as per biohazard waste disposal
guidelines.
D) Quality Control:
1. Positive Control:
◦ Include a known mycobacteria-positive control with each
batch of cultures to ensure proper growth and detection.
2. Negative Control:
◦ Include a sterile media control to monitor contamination.
3. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Calibrate and maintain all equipment (e.g., incubators,
automated culture systems) following the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Regularly record temperature and instrument performance.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Positive Results:
◦ Report AFB detected and identified species to the relevant
healthcare provider.
◦ Document all results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Negative Results:
◦ Confirm no growth at 42 days and finalize the report as no
mycobacteria isolated.
F) Troubleshooting:
• In case of false positives/contaminations:
◦ Review procedure adherence and sterility protocols.
◦ Investigate possible sources of contamination and address
immediately.
◦ Repeat testing if necessary.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are handled aseptically to avoid
contamination.
• Interpret results with caution, especially in polymicrobial samples
which may interfere with detection.
