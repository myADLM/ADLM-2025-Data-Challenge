Standard Operating Procedure for MYCOBACTERIA (AFB)
BLOOD CULTURE: Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Mycobacteria (Acid-Fast Bacilli) blood culture to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure is to be performed by trained laboratory personnel.
Laboratory technologists are responsible for the execution of the
analysis, ensuring the quality and integrity of the sample, and proper
documentation and reporting of results.
3. DEFINITION
Mycobacteria are a type of bacteria that include pathogens known to
cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis and
leprosy. Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) are a subset of bacteria that retain
certain dyes after being washed in an acid solution.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
1. Automated Blood Culture System (e.g., BACTEC MGIT 960
System)
2. Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tubes (MGIT)
3. Incubator (37°C)
4. Centrifuge (swinging bucket rotor)
5. AFB staining supplies (e.g., Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Kinyoun stain
or Auramine-O stain)
6. Microscope (brightfield or fluorescent depending on staining
method used)
7. Sterile pipettes
8. Biosafety Level 2 or 3 (BSL-2 or BSL-3) safety cabinet
9. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coat,
gloves, and eye protection.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Blood Culture Incubation
1. Place each blood culture bottle into the automated blood culture
system.
2. Incubate according to the manufacturer's instructions. MGIT
tubes are incubated at 37°C.
3. The system will analyze and continuously monitor for microbial
growth using fluorescence technology.
5.2 Positive Culture
1. When the system signals a positive culture, retrieve the tube
from the instrument.
2. Transport the tube to a biosafety cabinet following all biosafety
protocols.
3. Label the tube appropriately with patient identification and date.
5.3 Sample Processing
1. Under the biosafety cabinet, remove the cap of the blood
culture bottle.
2. Using a sterile pipette, aspirate approximately 1 mL of the
culture fluid.
3. Centrifuge the aspirate at 3000×g for 15 minutes to pellet the
bacteria.
4. Carefully decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1
mL of sterile saline.
5.4 AFB Stain and Microscopy
1. Prepare a smear of the resuspended pellet on a glass slide.
2. Air-dry and heat-fix the smear.
3. Stain the smear using the Ziehl-Neelsen, Kinyoun, or Auramine-
O method.
◦ For Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun stains: Carbol fuchsin, Acid-
alcohol decolorizer, Methylene blue.
◦ For Auramine-O: Auramine stain, Acid-alcohol decolorizer,
Potassium permanganate.
4. Examine the stained smear under a brightfield (for Ziehl-
Neelsen or Kinyoun) or under a fluorescence microscope (for
Auramine-O).
5. Look for the presence of Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB).
5.5 Identification and Reporting
1. Record observations, noting the presence and quantity of AFB
seen (e.g., rare, few, moderate, many).
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Report results as either:
◦ "Positive for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) - Mycobacteria
suspected. Further identification in process."
◦ "Negative for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB)."
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Ensure all positive and negative controls are run with each
batch of stains.
2. Verify microscope calibration and proper functioning regularly.
3. Perform bi-weekly instrument checks and maintain logs.
4. Maintain records of all quality control measures and results.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Always work within a biosafety cabinet (BSL-2 or BSL-3) when
handling specimens.
2. Wear appropriate PPE at all times: lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
3. Follow all laboratory waste disposal protocols for biohazard
materials.
4. Decontaminate work surfaces with appropriate disinfectant after
each use.
