Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mycobacteria and Nocardia
Culture
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for the cultivation,
identification, and reporting of Mycobacteria and Nocardia
species from clinical specimens to ensure accurate and timely
diagnosis. This includes the handling of specimens, processing
for culture, incubation, observation, identification, and
documentation of results.
Responsibility: All trained laboratory staff are responsible for adhering
to this SOP. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
compliance with the procedure and to address any issues that arise
during the culture process.
1. DEFINITION Mycobacteria and Nocardia are genera of aerobic,
acid-fast bacteria which can cause a variety of infections,
including tuberculosis, pulmonary diseases, and cutaneous
infections. Culturing these bacteria requires specific media,
incubation conditions, and identification protocols.
2. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Preparation: i. Specimens
commonly include sputum, bronchial washings, tissue biopsies,
body fluids, and wound aspirates. ii. Ensure specimens are
properly labeled with patient information, collection time, and
sample type. iii. Process specimens promptly upon receipt.
B. Specimen Decontamination/Digestion: i. Sputum and non-sterile
specimens need to be decontaminated. Use NALC-NaOH (N-acetyl-
L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide) method for digestion and
decontamination. ii. Mix the specimen with an equal volume of NALC-
NaOH solution. iii. Vortex briefly and let stand for 15-20 minutes at
room temperature. iv. Add phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and centrifuge
at 3,000 x g for 15 minutes. v. Discard the supernatant and
resuspend the pellet in sterile phosphate buffer.
C. Inoculation onto Media: i. Use Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium
and Middlebrook 7H11 agar for Mycobacteria. ii. Use Brain Heart
Infusion (BHI) agar with antibiotics and selective media like TMA
(Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract) for Nocardia. iii. Aseptically
inoculate the prepared pellet onto solid media. iv. Incubate
Mycobacteria cultures in a CO2 incubator at 37°C for up to 8 weeks.
v. Incubate Nocardia cultures at 30°C and 37°C for up to 4 weeks.
D. Observation and Identification: i. Monitor cultures weekly for
growth. ii. Record initial observations of colony morphology and color.
iii. Perform Acid-Fast staining (Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun) for
identification. iv. Use biochemical tests (e.g., niacin, nitrate reduction)
and molecular methods (e.g., PCR) to further identify isolates.
E. Quality Control: i. Perform quality control on new batches of media
using known positive and negative controls. ii. Run positive and
negative controls with each batch of staining reagents.
F. Reporting Results: i. Record and report growth characteristics,
staining results, and final identification in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). ii. Use standard terminology and coding for
consistency. iii. Ensure that preliminary positive growth is reported to
the appropriate requesting clinician immediately. iv. Document all
steps taken from specimen receipt to final reporting.
G. Specimen Retention and Disposal: i. Retain positive cultures for at
least 6 months or as required by regulations. ii. Autoclave and
dispose of negative cultures and spent media per biohazard waste
disposal protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS Not applicable – presence of
Mycobacteria or Nocardia is diagnostic.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS i. Cross-contamination can lead to
false positives. ii. Overgrowth by other bacteria can obscure
Mycobacterial or Nocardia growth — use selective media to
mitigate. iii. Specific environmental conditions and prolonged
incubation periods are crucial for isolation success.
