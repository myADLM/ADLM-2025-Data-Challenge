Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) No. XXXX
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Mycobacteria Culture on Bone
Marrow
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the standard procedures for the analytical
phase of processing, culturing, and identifying Mycobacteria species
from bone marrow specimens received in the clinical laboratory. This
assures consistency, accuracy, and quality of results while minimizing
potential contamination and ensuring the safety of the laboratory
personnel.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of bone marrow specimens for Mycobacteria culture.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP when performing Mycobacteria culture on bone marrow
specimens. The laboratory supervisor will ensure compliance with the
procedure and troubleshoot any deviations or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Bone marrow aspirate.
• Collection Container: Sterile, heparin-coated bone marrow
collection tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 1-2 mL.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Mycobacteria culture media (e.g., Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) slants,
Middlebrook 7H9 broth)
• Tween 80 & NaOH for decontamination and digestion procedure
• Incubator set to 35-37°C
• Staining reagents (Ziehl-Neelsen stain or Auramine-Rhodamine
stain)
• AFB Microscope
• Quality control strains (e.g., M. tuberculosis H37Rv)
6. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Perform all specimen processing in a Class II biosafety cabinet.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and N95 respirator.
• Follow all biosafety and waste disposal protocols as per
laboratory policy.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing and Decontamination
1. Labeling and Logging: Verify the specimen with the requisition
form. Log the specimen into the laboratory’s tracking system.
2. Initial Processing: Mix the bone marrow aspirate gently and
aliquot 1-2 mL into a sterile tube.
3. Decontaminate: Treat the aliquot with an equal volume of
NaOH-NaCl solution (final concentration 2% NaOH) with 0.5%
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC) for 15-20 minutes to
decontaminate. During this period, ensure occasional mixing.
4. Neutralization: Add Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to the
sample to neutralize the alkaline solution and bring the volume
up to 50 mL. Mix thoroughly.
5. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the sample at 3000 x g for 15
minutes.
6. Decant Supernatant: Carefully decant the supernatant inside
the biosafety cabinet without disturbing the pellet.
B. Culture Inoculation
1. Resuspend Pellet: Resuspend the pellet in 2.0 mL of sterile
PBS.
2. Inoculation onto Solid Media: Inoculate 0.5 mL of the
suspension onto LJ slants. Spread evenly across the surface.
3. Inoculation into Liquid Media: Add 0.5 mL of the suspension
into 8-10 mL of Middlebrook 7H9 broth in a culture tube.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate LJ slants at 35-37°C in a tilted position for the first
week.
◦ Incubate Middlebrook 7H9 broth in a standing position at
35-37°C under aerobic conditions.
◦ Monitor cultures weekly for up to 8 weeks for any signs of
growth.
C. Identification of Mycobacteria
1. Examine Cultures: Check cultures weekly. Note growth
characteristics and time to positivity.
2. Staining: Perform Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) staining on any
colonies that appear on LJ slants.
◦ Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining indicating acid-fast bacilli (red
rods).
◦ Auramine-Rhodamine fluorescence microscopy for faster
screening.
3. Confirmatory Tests:
◦ Perform confirmatory tests like PCR for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex or HPLC for Mycobacterium species.
D. Reporting Results
1. Documentation: Document all observations and results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Interim Reports: Provide interim reports if growth observed
before end of 8 weeks.
3. Final Report: After 8 weeks of incubation, report results
together with smears and identification tests.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive and Negative Controls should be included with every
batch of specimens processed.
• Use standardized and quality-controlled culture media.
• Maintain rigorous documentation and verification of all processes
and results.
9. RECORDS AND REPORTING
• All results and observations must be logged into the Laboratory
Information System.
• Any deviations or incidents that occur must be reported to the
supervisor immediately.
• Final reports should be verified by a supervisor before releasing
to clinical staff.
