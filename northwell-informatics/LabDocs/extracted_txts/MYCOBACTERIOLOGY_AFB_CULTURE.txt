STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE MYCOBACTERIOLOGY
(AFB) CULTURE 1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure
for the processing, incubation, and interpretation of acid-fast bacilli
(AFB) cultures to ensure accurate and timely reporting of
mycobacterial infections.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred/
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh sputum specimens collected using sterile containers.
• Bronchoalveolar lavage, gastric lavage, urine, tissue, and pleural
fluid specimens.
• Note: For non-pulmonary specimens, decontamination is
necessary before culture.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens showing signs of contamination.
• Specimens that have not been transported properly (e.g., not kept
cold).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Biosafety Cabinet (Class II)
• Sterile collection containers
• Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) system
• Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) slants
• Middlebrook 7H10 plates
• Oxalic acid for specimen decontamination
• Ziehl-Neelsen staining kit
• Incubator set at 35-37°C
• Sterile loops, swabs, and pipettes
4. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Processing
1. Receive specimen and verify patient information.
2. Decontaminate specimen: Add an equal volume of
decontamination solution (e.g., 2% NaOH or oxalic acid) to the
specimen and mix for 15 minutes.
3. Neutralize with sterile phosphate buffer to stop the
decontamination process and centrifuge the mixture at 3000g
for 20 minutes.
4. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in sterile
saline.
B. Inoculation
1. Inoculate MGIT tubes with 0.5 mL of the processed specimen.
2. Inoculate one LJ slant and one Middlebrook 7H10 plate with 0.1
mL of the processed specimen using a sterile loop.
3. Seal tubes and plates properly and label them with patient
information and date of inoculation.
C. Incubation
1. Place MGIT tubes, LJ slants, and Middlebrook 7H10 plates in
the incubator at 35-37°C.
2. Observe MGIT tubes daily for fluorescence indicating growth.
3. Check LJ slants and Middlebrook 7H10 plates weekly for signs
of colony formation.
4. Incubate MGIT tubes for 42 days and solid media (LJ and
Middlebrook 7H10) for up to 8 weeks.
D. Identification
1. Positive MGIT tubes are screened for AFB using Ziehl-Neelsen
staining.
2. Positive cultures on solid media are also stained and examined
for AFB.
3. Perform additional biochemical tests to confirm the identity of
Mycobacterium species (e.g., niacin production, nitrate
reduction, catalase test).
4. If necessary, employ molecular methods (e.g., PCR) for species
identification.
E. Reporting Results
1. Report negative cultures as "No growth of AFB" after the
completion of the incubation period.
2. Report positive cultures with the mycobacterial species
identified and results of biochemical tests.
3. Critical results must be promptly communicated to the physician
or relevant clinical team member.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use a positive control strain (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
H37Rv) and negative control for each batch of cultures.
• Perform biweekly environmental monitoring of incubators and
biosafety cabinets.
• Use commercially available quality control reagents to verify the
efficacy of staining and biochemical test kits.
6. REFERENCES Refer to the latest Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and Mycobacteriology
laboratory manuals for detailed procedural methods and updates.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to MGIT package inserts and
laboratory protocol manuals for specific limitations. Note variability in
growth rates among different Mycobacterium species.
This protocol facilitates the accurate generation and reporting of AFB
culture results while adhering to laboratory safety and quality control
standards.
