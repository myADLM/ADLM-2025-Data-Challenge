Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Protocol for Analytical Detection of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis
Complex and Rifampin Resistance via PCR in Sputum Samples
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the molecular detection of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and the identification of
rifampin resistance in sputum samples using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) techniques.
1. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing
MTBC and rifampin resistance detection via PCR in sputum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
protocol and for maintaining the integrity and quality of the analytical
phase of testing. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence
to the SOP and addressing any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN
4.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• 3 to 5 ml of sputum collected in a sterile, leak-proof container.
• Specimens should be delivered to the laboratory within 24 hours
of collection.
• If delayed, refrigerate samples at 2-8°C for no more than 72
hours.
4.2. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with excessive saliva or food particles.
• Samples with insufficient volume (< 3 ml).
• Samples not received within the specified time frame and non-
refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1. Equipment:
• Biological safety cabinet (Class II)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• DNA extraction system (if applicable)
5.2. Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• MTBC-specific primers and probes
• Rifampin resistance-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control DNA
• Negative control (Nuclease-free water or known negative sample)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction:
1. Work inside a biological safety cabinet with appropriate PPE
including gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
2. Centrifuge the sputum sample at 3000 x g for 20 minutes to
pellet the bacterial cells.
3. Decontaminate the sputum sample using an appropriate
decontamination reagent, following the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Vortex the sample briefly to ensure thorough mixing and
incubate according to the reagent protocol.
5. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 20 minutes and
discard the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet.
6. Resuspend the cell pellet in a suitable volume of lysis buffer
from the DNA extraction kit.
7. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate the DNA. Elute
the DNA in an appropriate volume of elution buffer.
8. Verify the DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
6.2. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, which typically includes DNA polymerase,
nucleotides, primers, and probes in appropriate concentrations.
2. Add 5 μL of extracted DNA to the PCR master mix in
appropriate PCR tubes or plates.
3. Include positive control (known MTBC DNA) and negative
control (nuclease-free water or known negative sample).
4. Seal the tubes or plates and load them into the real-time PCR
instrument.
5. Program the thermal cycler according to the specific
requirements for MTBC and rifampin resistance detection
(generally including initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation, annealing, and extension).
6. Run the PCR and monitor the amplification plots for each
sample.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify the results of positive and negative controls to ensure there
is no contamination or amplification failure.
• Repeat any test if controls do not perform as expected.
• Calibration and maintenance of the PCR equipment and pipettes
should be done regularly according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1. Interpretation:
• A positive PCR result for MTBC-specific genes indicates the
presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.
• A positive PCR result for rifampin resistance-specific genes
indicates the presence of rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis.
• Negative results indicate the absent or below-detection limit levels
of MTBC and rifampin resistance mutations.
8.2. Documentation:
• Record PCR results, including the control outcomes, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify results with a second technologist as per laboratory policy.
• Report the results to the requesting physician or healthcare
provider according to the defined reporting guidelines.

This protocol should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure
compliance with the latest standards and technological
advancements. Laboratory staff should be trained and competent to
perform these procedures to maintain the highest quality of results.
