Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex,
Molecular Detection, PCR, Paraffin, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of Mycobacterium
Tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) detection using molecular PCR
techniques in paraffin-embedded tissue samples.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory staff responsible for performing
and interpreting PCR assays for MTBC detection in paraffin-
embedded tissue samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists performing the assay must follow this SOP to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
• Supervisors must ensure that technologists are trained and
adhere to this protocol.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any deviations and take
corrective actions if necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable specimens:
• Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or sections.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled or without proper requisition
forms.
• Specimens with insufficient quantity of tissue for analysis.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA Extraction Kit specific for paraffin-embedded tissues
• MTBC-specific PCR Kit:
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ MTBC-specific primers and probes
◦ Positive and negative controls
• Thermal Cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Ethanol
• Vortex mixer
• PCR tubes or plates
• PCR workstation with UV decontamination capabilities
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction
1. Deparaffinization and DNA Extraction
◦ Cut 5-10 micrometer sections from the paraffin-embedded
tissue block.
◦ Place tissue sections into a microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add xylene to deparaffinize the tissue sections, vortex
briefly, and incubate at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the tube and remove the xylene.
◦ Wash the tissue pellet with ethanol, centrifuge, and remove
ethanol.
◦ Allow the pellet to air dry.
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit instructions to extract DNA
from the deparaffinized tissue.
6.2. PCR Setup
1. Preparation of PCR Mix
◦ Thaw all PCR reagents on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the MTBC-
specific PCR kit instructions.
◦ Aliquot the appropriate volume of Master Mix into PCR
tubes or wells of a PCR plate.
◦ Add extracted DNA (template) to each tube or well.
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each
run.
◦ Mix the contents gently and briefly centrifuge.
2. PCR Amplification
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the PCR cycling
parameters provided in the MTBC-specific PCR kit
instructions.
◦ Place the PCR tubes or plate into the thermal cycler.
◦ Start the amplification process.
6.3. Post-PCR Analysis
1. Detection and Analysis
◦ After completion of the PCR run, analyze the amplified
products.
◦ Use the real-time PCR instrument’s software to assess the
amplification curves of the samples and controls.
2. Interpretation of Results
◦ Positive Control: Amplification within the expected cycle
threshold (Ct) range confirms the assay is functioning
correctly.
◦ Negative Control: No amplification should be observed,
indicating no contamination.
◦ Sample: Ct values within the established range for MTBC
are considered positive; absent or outside range Ct values
are considered negative.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control on each new lot of reagents and maintain
documentation.
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay reliability.
• Do not use expired reagents.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Document all relevant details of the sample, reagents, and
controls in the laboratory information system.
• Review and verify the results before releasing them.
• Report results according to laboratory protocol:
◦ Positive for MTBC: "Detected"
◦ Negative for MTBC: "Not Detected"
◦ Invalid: "Invalid – Repeat Assay"
9. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Handle all specimens and reagents in a biosafety cabinet
whenever possible.
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines regarding the handling and
disposal of hazardous materials.
