Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Mycobacterium Tuberculosis
Complex, Molecular Detection by PCR
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps for the molecular
detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) using PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction) methodology. This is to ensure
accurate, timely, and reproducible results for the diagnosis of
tuberculosis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel trained in
molecular techniques are responsible for processing the specimens
and performing the MTBC PCR test. It is their duty to ensure that all
steps are followed according to this SOP, and issues are promptly
addressed to supervisors.
2. DEFINITION Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)
includes the following species, primarily Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
which are the causative agents of tuberculosis in humans.
3. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types: Sputum, bronchial washings, bronchoalveolar
lavage, pleural fluid, tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and
other body fluids.
• Volume Requirement: At least 1 mL of liquid sample or 1 gram of
solid sample.
• Transport and Storage: Specimens must be transported to the
laboratory as soon as possible at 2-8°C. If a delay is inevitable,
samples should be stored at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and sterile filtered tips
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit
• PCR Master Mix and specific primers for MTBC
• Positive and negative control samples
• Nuclease-free water
• DNAse/RNAse decontamination solutions
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Biosafety Precautions: Perform all specimen handling in a
Class II Biosafety Cabinet. Wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, lab coat, and
face mask/shield.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ For liquid specimens: Centrifuge at 3000 x g for 20 minutes
to concentrate the bacteria. Decant supernatant and
resuspend pellet in 1 mL saline.
◦ For solid specimens: Homogenize tissue samples using a
sterile mortar and pestle. Add 1 mL saline to the
homogenized material.
B) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the nucleic acid
extraction kit to extract DNA from the processed specimens.
2. Include a negative extraction control (process the buffer as a
sample) to monitor for contamination.
C) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents, including PCR Master Mix, primers, and
controls, on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
protocol and include the appropriate final concentrations of
primers and probes specific to MTBC.
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
4. Add extracted DNA (5-10 µL) from samples, positive control,
and negative control into separate PCR tubes.
5. Seal the tubes or plate, and briefly centrifuge to ensure
contents are collected at the bottom.
6. Load tubes/plate into the PCR thermocycler.
D) PCR Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
• Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
• Annealing and Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds
• Number of cycles: 45
E) Result Analysis:
1. After PCR, analyze the amplification curves using real-time
PCR instrumentation software.
2. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Negative Control (NTC) must show no amplification.
◦ Positive Control should generate expected amplification
curves.
◦ Samples showing amplification curves crossing the
threshold before 38 cycles are considered positive for
MTBC.
3. Record the results accordingly in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
F) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
runs.
2. Monitor the amplification of housekeeping genes or internal
controls to assess the quality of the specimen.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• No Amplification in Controls: Repeat the extraction and PCR
for all samples.
• Cross-Contamination Detected: Implement full decontamination
protocols in all workspaces and reassess all samples.
• Poor Amplification Efficiency: Check the expiry date of
reagents, and ensure proper storage and handling were
maintained.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS: Follow all biosafety guidelines
and ensure workspace decontamination post-procedure. Dispose of
medical waste according to biohazard protocols.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document all results in the laboratory information system.
• Inconclusive results must be repeated or verified with another
detection method.
• Critical results must be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider.
