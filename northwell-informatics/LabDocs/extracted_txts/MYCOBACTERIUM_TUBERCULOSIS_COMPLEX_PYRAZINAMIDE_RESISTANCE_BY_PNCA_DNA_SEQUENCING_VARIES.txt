STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
TITLE: Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex, Pyrazinamide
Resistance by pncA DNA Sequencing
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for detecting
pyrazinamide resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
(MTBC) using pncA DNA sequencing.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in MTBC
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, DNA sequencing, and sequence
analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing.
• Ensuring the quality control and validation of results.
• Documenting and reporting results according to laboratory
policies.
Supervisors are responsible for:
• Verifying that all personnel are trained and competent.
• Ensuring all equipment and reagents are up-to-date and properly
maintained.
• Reviewing and validating results before final reporting.
4. DEFINITION:
pncA DNA Sequencing: A molecular technique used to identify
mutations in the pncA gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are
associated with resistance to the antibiotic pyrazinamide.

6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Thermal cycler for PCR
• DNA sequencer
• Nanodrop or equivalent spectrophotometer
• Centrifuge
• Vortex
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit suitable for MTBC
• PCR master mix
• Primers specific for pncA gene
• Sequencing reagents and buffer
• Ethanol
• Molecular-grade water
Supplies:
• Sterile tubes (microcentrifuge and PCR tubes)

• DNA ladder or appropriate size marker
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Process clinical specimens (e.g., sputum, culture) as per standard
laboratory procedures for MTBC.
• Extract DNA using the designated DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's protocol.
7.2 PCR Amplification:
• Prepare PCR master mix according to the reagent manufacturer’s
instructions, including primers specific for the pncA gene.
• Add 1-5 µL of extracted DNA to the PCR mix.
• Run the PCR using the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
• Store PCR products at 4°C until sequencing.
7.3 DNA Sequencing:
• Purify PCR products to remove unincorporated dNTPs and
primers.
• Set up the sequencing reaction using purified PCR products,
sequencing primers, and sequencing reagents following the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform sequencing on a DNA sequencer.
• Analyze sequencing data using appropriate analysis software.
7.4 Interpretation of Results:
• Compare the obtained sequence to the reference sequence for
the pncA gene.
• Identify and document the presence of any mutations known to
confer pyrazinamide resistance.
• Use validated bioinformatics tools and mutation databases for
resistance interpretation.
7.5 Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each DNA extraction,
PCR, and sequencing run.
• Verify the performance of all equipment and reagents prior to use.
• Document any deviations from expected results and investigate
potential causes.
7.6 Reporting Results:
• Ensure results are reviewed and validated by a supervisor or
qualified personnel.
• Report results according to laboratory protocols, including any
identified mutations and their interpretations relating to
pyrazinamide resistance.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
8.1 Quality Assurance:
• Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment.
• Perform internal and external quality assessments periodically.
• Document all maintenance, calibrations, and quality control
activities.
8.2 Troubleshooting:
• If amplification is not achieved, confirm the quality of DNA
extraction and PCR conditions.
• If sequencing quality is poor, verify the purity of PCR products and
reagent performance.
• Document and address recurrent issues in the Quality Control log.
9. SAFETY:
• Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of biological and chemical waste according to safety
regulations.
