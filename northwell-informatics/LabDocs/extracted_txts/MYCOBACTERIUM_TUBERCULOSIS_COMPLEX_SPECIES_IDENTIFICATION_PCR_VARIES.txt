STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the identification of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex (MTBC) species using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) to provide accurate, reliable, and timely results for
patient diagnosis and management.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to follow this
procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results. The supervisor is
responsible for verifying that these procedures are followed correctly
and for addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.
2. PRINCIPLE AND INTRODUCTION
The identification of MTBC species using PCR involves the
amplification and detection of DNA sequences specific to the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. This method provides a rapid
and sensitive approach compared to traditional culture techniques,
offering results within hours rather than weeks.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Types:
• Sputum
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
• Tissue biopsies
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Pleural fluid
• Other clinical samples
Specimen Collection:
• Collect specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers.
• Ensure specimens are collected following standard biosafety
guidelines to avoid contamination.
Specimen Transport and Storage:
• Transport specimens to the laboratory immediately at 2-8°C.
• If delay in processing is anticipated, store at 4°C for up to 72
hours or at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not properly labeled.
• Specimens that have leaked or are visibly contaminated.
• Specimens that have not been stored or transported under
appropriate conditions.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit specific for mycobacterial DNA.
• PCR Master Mix containing all necessary PCR components.
• MTBC-specific primers and probes.
• Nuclease-free water.
Equipment:
• Biosafety cabinet Level II.
• Real-time PCR machine.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Thermal cycler.
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips.
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes.
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Label microcentrifuge tubes for each specimen and control.
2. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, extract nucleic acids
from each specimen using a mycobacterial DNA extraction kit.
3. Elute DNA in the appropriate buffer as suggested by the kit
protocol.
4. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C if not proceeding to PCR
immediately.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents and template DNA on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR Master Mix as follows per reaction:
◦ Nuclease-free water: X μL
◦ PCR buffer with MgCl2: X μL
◦ dNTPs mix: X μL
◦ Primers (forward and reverse): X μL each
◦ Probe: X μL
◦ Taq DNA polymerase: X μL
3. Aliquot the Master Mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
4. Add the extracted DNA to the PCR tubes or wells:
◦ Patient samples: X μL of extracted DNA
◦ Positive control: Known MTBC DNA
◦ Negative control: Nuclease-free water
5. Mix contents thoroughly and spin briefly to collect at the bottom
of the tubes.
C. PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Place the PCR tubes or plate into the thermal cycler.
2. Set the thermal cycler with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 1 minute
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
3. Start the PCR run.
6. POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE
Detection and Interpretation:
1. After completion of the PCR run, analyze the data using the
real-time PCR software.
2. Confirm the presence of MTBC by observing the amplification
curves and Ct (cycle threshold) values for each sample.
3. Compare with the positive and negative controls to validate the
run.
4. Report results as follows:
◦ Positive: Amplification with Ct value within the expected
range.
◦ Negative: No amplification or Ct value beyond the threshold.
◦ Invalid: Poor quality sample or PCR inhibition if results from
controls are not as expected.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Include a positive control (known MTBC DNA) and a negative
control (nuclease-free water) in every run.
• Use extraction controls to monitor the efficiency of nucleic acid
extraction.
External Quality Assessment:
• Participate in external quality assessment programs to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of results.
• Document and review QC results routinely.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are reported in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Positive results should be reported immediately to the requesting
physician or infectious disease specialist if indicated per laboratory
guidelines.

10. MODIFICATIONS AND REVISIONS
Document any amendments to this SOP, including authorization and
implementation dates. Keep a record of all reviewed and revised
versions as part of the quality management system.
This protocol is now ready for review and approval by the laboratory
director or the designated authority. For detailed troubleshooting and
equipment maintenance, refer to specific instrument manuals and
manufacturer guidelines.
