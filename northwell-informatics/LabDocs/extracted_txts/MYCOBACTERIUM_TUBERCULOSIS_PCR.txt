Standard Operating Procedure for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis
PCR Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the PCR analysis of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical specimens. This protocol
ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability in generating test
results for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
PCR analysis, verifying results, and taking corrective actions when
necessary. Supervisors must ensure that all personnel adhere to the
procedure as outlined.
Scope:
This SOP applies to PCR testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on
clinical specimens including sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL),
tissue, and other body fluids.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstation
• PCR Cycler (Thermocycler)
• Biohazard Safety Cabinet
• DNA Extraction Kit (e.g. Qiagen DNA extraction kit)
• Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR Reagent Kit
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips (filter/sterile)
• Nucleic Acid-Free Water
• Positive and Negative Controls
• Sterile Microcentrifuge Tubes
• Vortex Mixer
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory Timer
• Gloves, Lab Coats, and Other PPE
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types: Sputum, BAL, tissue, other body fluids
• Collection: Collect specimens in sterile containers.
• Transport: Transport specimens to the laboratory immediately. If
delays are expected, keep specimens refrigerated at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens without proper labeling,
leaking containers, or those received beyond the specified time
frame for transport.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase
• Check Specimen Integrity: Ensure specimens are correctly
labeled and are free from contamination or damage.
• Accession Specimens: Log all specimens into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Prepare Work Area: Clean and disinfect the PCR workstation
and biological safety cabinet before use.
B. Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Preparation:
• Sputum/BAL:
◦ Homogenize the specimen using a vortex mixer.
◦ Treat specimens with a mucolytic agent if necessary.
◦ Pipette 1-2 mL of the specimen into a sterile microcentrifuge
tube.
• Tissue:
◦ Homogenize using a tissue grinder.
◦ Suspend tissue in sterile saline or PBS.
◦ Pipette the suspension into a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
• Other body fluids:
◦ Directly pipette 1-2 mL into a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
2. DNA Extraction:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction using
the Qiagen DNA Extraction Kit or equivalent.
• Include a negative extraction control (NEC) with each batch.
• After extraction, store the DNA at -20°C if not proceeding
immediately to PCR.
3. PCR Setup:
• Prepare the PCR Master Mix by combining:
◦ PCR Buffer (as provided)
◦ dNTPs
◦ Primers/Probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis
◦ Taq Polymerase
◦ Nucleic Acid-Free Water
• Aliquot the Master Mix into PCR tubes.
• Add 2-5 µL of extracted DNA to each PCR tube.
• Include a positive control DNA and a no-template control (NTC) to
monitor for contamination.
4. PCR Amplification:
• Place tubes into the PCR cycler.
• Program the thermocycler according to the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis PCR Kit instructions, typically:
1. Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 min
2. 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 sec
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 min
C. Post-Analytical Phase
1. Data Analysis:
• Use the PCR cycler software to interpret the amplification curves.
• Validate the positives with the positive control and check for any
amplification in the NTC.
• Threshold Cycle (Ct) values are to be noted and reviewed:
◦ Ct < 35 is considered positive.
◦ Ct ≥ 35 requires further review (weak positive or negative as
per consultation with supervisor).
◦ No amplification or Ct ≥ 40 in NTC indicates no contamination.
2. Result Reporting:
• Enter results into the LIS.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines:
◦ Positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis
◦ Negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis
◦ Indeterminate (with a comment indicating need for repeat
testing)
3. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch.
• Perform internal quality control with each shipment of PCR
reagent kits, ensuring consistency with reference materials.
• Record all QC results and corrective actions in the laboratory
quality control log.
4. Troubleshooting:
• If positive controls fail to amplify or NTC shows amplification,
reassess and repeat testing. Review potential contamination
sources.
• Consult with the supervisor for any persistent issues.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Results are qualitative:
• Positive: Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA detected.
• Negative: Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA not detected.
• Indeterminate: Results inconclusive, recommend a repeat test.
1. LIMITATIONS
• False positives may occur due to contamination.
• False negatives may occur due to improper specimen handling,
low bacterial load, or PCR inhibition.
• Follow-up with additional tests or clinical correlation as needed.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all specimens received, data generated,
control results, and corrective actions.
• Store PCR result documentation, including raw data and analysis,
for a minimum of two years.
