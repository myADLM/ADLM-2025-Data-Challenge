STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) FOR MYCOLOGY
(FUNGAL) CULTURE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the isolation, identification,
and reporting of fungi from clinical specimens, ensuring accuracy and
reproducibility of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform fungal
cultures and involves all stages from inoculation to identification and
reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate and timely identification of fungal pathogens.
Supervisors are responsible for providing appropriate training and
ensuring adherence to SOPs.
4. DEFINITION
Fungal culture is a laboratory test to isolate and identify pathogenic
fungi from clinical specimens.

6. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Biosafety cabinet (BSC)
• Sterile inoculation loops and needles
• Agar plates (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, Mycosel, Birdseed Agar,
Potato Dextrose Agar, Chromogenic Agar)
• Incubator (25°C, 30°C, 35°C)
• Microscope with lactophenol cotton blue stain and potassium
hydroxide (KOH)
• Sterile swabs
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, face mask)
• Logbooks and recording sheets
• Culture identification systems (e.g. MALDI-TOF MS)
7. SPECIMEN TYPE AND REQUIREMENTS
• Specimens: Skin scrapings, nail clippings, hair, sputum,
bronchoalveolar lavage, blood, sterile body fluids, biopsy tissues.
• Transport and storage: Transport to the laboratory as soon as
possible. If delay is anticipated, store specimens at 4°C.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing
1. Don appropriate PPE before handling specimens.
2. Perform specimen handling in a biosafety cabinet.
3. Document specimen details in the logbook, including patient ID,
specimen type, date, and time of collection.
B. Direct Microscopic Examination
1. Prepare a KOH mount for preliminary examination of skin
scrapings, nails, and hair.
a. Place a small amount of specimen on a glass slide. b. Add
1-2 drops of KOH solution. c. Gently heat the slide (if
necessary) and cover with a coverslip. d. Examine under the
microscope for fungal elements.
C. Culture Inoculation
1. Inoculate the specimen onto appropriate media:
a. Sabouraud Dextrose Agar for general fungal isolation. b.
Mycosel Agar for isolation of dermatophytes. c. Birdseed Agar
for differentiation of Cryptococcus species. d. Chromogenic
Agar for presumptive identification of Candida species.
2. Incubate at appropriate temperatures: a. 25-30°C for
dermatophytes and molds. b. 35°C for yeasts and dimorphic
fungi.
3. Incubate plates for up to 4 weeks. Check daily for growth and
record observations.
D. Identification
1. Examine colony morphology, color, and texture.
2. Perform microscopic examination using a lactophenol cotton
blue stain: a. Place a small piece of colony on a glass slide. b.
Add a drop of lactophenol cotton blue stain and cover with a
coverslip. c. Examine under the microscope to identify fungal
structures.
3. Use biochemical and molecular methods, if necessary, for
further identification: a. Perform API 20C AUX for yeasts. b.
Utilize MALDI-TOF MS for species-level identification.
4. For yeasts suspected of being Candida, perform germ tube
test.
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls for media and stains.
2. Document control results and ensure QC passes before patient
samples.
F. Reporting Results
1. Record colony characteristics and identification results in the
logbook.
2. All results should be verified by a second technologist or
supervisor.
3. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Notify the physician or clinical team of any clinically
significant fungi.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Adhere to all standard quality control measures.
2. Participate in proficiency testing and continuing education.
3. Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment.
4. Document and review all incidents and corrective actions.
10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
1. Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
2. Use biosafety cabinets for all specimen processing.
3. Disinfect work surfaces before and after use.
