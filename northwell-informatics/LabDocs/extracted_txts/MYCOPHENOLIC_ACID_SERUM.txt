Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mycophenolic Acid,
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
Mycophenolic Acid (MPA) levels in serum samples in order to ensure
accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all personnel performing the
Mycophenolic Acid (MPA) serum analysis in the clinical laboratory.
3. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Mycophenolic Acid Assay Kit
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guidelines
4. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to perform and document the Mycophenolic Acid, serum
analysis, following the procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the supervisor to review and ensure compliance with
this protocol.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
5.1 Specimen Type
• Serum
5.2 Collection
• Collect blood in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes.
• Separate the serum from the clot immediately after centrifugation.
• Transfer serum into a clean, labeled aliquot tube.
5.3 Storage and Stability
• Store serum samples refrigerated at 2-8°C if analyzed within 7
days.
• For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. INTERFERENCES
• No hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples should be used as they
may interfere with the assay results.
• Medications or other substances in the serum that may affect the
MPA levels should be documented.
7. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
7.1 Equipment
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• -20°C Freezer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Mycophenolic Acid Assay Kit
• Automated analyzer (if applicable)
7.2 Reagents
• Mycophenolic Acid Calibrators
• Mycophenolic Acid Quality Control materials (low, medium, high)
• Reagent-grade Water
7.3 Supplies
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes
• Aliquot tubes
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Logbooks
8. PROCEDURE
8.1 Preparation
1. Bring all reagents, calibrators, and samples to room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare the reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Label all tubes and log information appropriately.
8.2 Calibration
1. Prepare calibrators according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Program the calibrator concentrations into the automated
analyzer or manually plot a calibration curve.
3. Run the calibrators and ensure the calibration curve meets
quality control specifications.
8.3 Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) at the
beginning of each analytical run and after any calibration.
2. Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document all QC results.
8.4 Sample Analysis
1. Place the serum samples on the analyzer if using an automated
system, or manually pipette into reaction tubes according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Follow the assay protocol strictly (e.g., incubation times,
reagent addition, washing steps if ELISA-based).
3. Measure the absorbance or read the results according to the
instructions provided with the assay kit.
4. Record the results.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION
1. Compare patient sample results with the calibration curve or
reference values provided in the assay kit insert.
2. Validate the results by ensuring they fall within the linear range
of the assay.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a technologist
before releasing them.
3. Report any critical values to the attending physician
immediately, following the established protocol for critical
results.
11. SAMPLE INTEGRITY CHECK
1. Review samples for any visible signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus.
2. Document sample conditions in the case of questionable
integrity and consult with a supervisor if necessary.
12. LIMITATIONS
1. The assay is sensitive to certain interferences; follow the
manufacturer's instructions regarding interfering substances.
2. Ensure proper sample handling to avoid degradation of
Mycophenolic Acid.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, do not
proceed with patient sample analysis. Investigate potential
causes such as reagent expiration, instrument malfunction, or
procedural error.
2. Repeat any assay steps as needed, following the
manufacturer's guidelines.
14. DOCUMENTATION
1. Record all data, including sample IDs, QC results, calibration
curves, and patient results in logbooks or electronic records.
2. Maintain records for a minimum of 2 years for traceability.
15. SAFETY
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
2. Handle all biological specimens and reagents as potentially
infectious.
3. Follow waste disposal regulations for biohazard and chemical
waste.
