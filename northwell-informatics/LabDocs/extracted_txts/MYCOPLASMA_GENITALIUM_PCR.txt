Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Laboratory Procedure for
Mycoplasma genitalium PCR
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the analysis and
testing of Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) using
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in order to generate
accurate and reliable results for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting the PCR analysis for M. genitalium,
ensuring the accuracy, and maintaining the integrity of test results. It
is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff
adhere to the protocols and that corrective actions are taken as
necessary.
1. DEFINITION M. genitalium PCR is a molecular technique used
to detect the presence of genetic material (DNA) from M.
genitalium in clinical specimens, which is essential for
diagnosing infections caused by this pathogen.
2. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
3.1 Equipment:
• PCR thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Nucleic acid extraction kit
• Real-time PCR system (if using qPCR)
3.2 Materials:
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL and 0.2 mL)
• PCR tubes or plates (if using a plate-based PCR system)
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Laboratory tissue wipes
• Biohazard waste disposal bags
3.3 Reagents:
• Master mix containing Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and buffer
• Positive control DNA for M. genitalium
• Negative control (nuclease-free water)
• Primers and probes specific for M. genitalium (if using qPCR)
• Nucleic acid extraction reagents
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Confirm that the specimens have been properly collected,
received, and accessioned according to laboratory protocols.
• Acceptable specimens include urethral swabs, cervical swabs,
and urine.
• Process specimens as soon as possible or store at 2-8°C for up
to 24 hours if immediate processing is not possible.
4.2 Nucleic Acid Extraction:
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the nucleic acid
extraction kit.
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are ready before starting the
extraction.
• Include positive and negative extraction controls in each batch.
• Transfer specimens into appropriate lysis buffer and proceed with
nucleic acid extraction.
• Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA (optional for
quality control).
4.3 PCR Setup:
• Prepare a PCR master mix as per manufacturer's guidelines. The
master mix should contain all necessary components except the
sample DNA.
• Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates in a clean
workspace free of contaminants.
• Add template DNA (from the extraction), positive control, and
negative control to the appropriate tubes, ensuring no cross-
contamination.
• Cap the tubes or seal the plates.
4.4 PCR Cycling:
• Place the PCR tubes or plates into the PCR thermocycler.
• Program the PCR thermocycler with the following cycling
conditions (example conditions; adjust as needed for your setup):
1. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
2. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
3. Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
4. Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
5. Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
6. Hold: 4°C until analysis
4.5 Detection and Analysis:
• If using endpoint PCR, run the PCR products on an agarose gel
and visualize under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide
(use proper safety precautions).
• If using real-time PCR (qPCR), analyze amplification plots and Ct
values.
• Compare results against the positive and negative controls to
validate each run.
• Interpret the results as positive, negative, or inconclusive based
on the presence or absence of a specific amplification band or
threshold cycle (Ct) values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to ensure the accuracy of the PCR.
◦ Verify the performance of the PCR reagents and equipment
regularly.
◦ Document all control results and any anomalies that occur
during the run.
2. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Report positive results immediately following laboratory
protocols for critical results.
◦ If results are inconclusive, consider repeating the analysis or
performing additional confirmatory testing.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ No amplification of positive control: check reagent integrity,
cycling conditions, and instrument functionality.
◦ Amplification in negative control: indicates potential
contamination; decontaminate work areas and repeat the
assay.
◦ Weak or delayed amplification: check sample quality, DNA
extraction efficiency, and reagent expiry.
4. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
◦ Handle all specimens as if potentially infectious.
◦ Dispose of biohazard waste according to regulations.
5. REFERENCES:
◦ Refer to the specific product inserts and molecular biology
guidelines provided by the manufacturer for PCR reagents
and instruments.
This SOP ensures that Mycoplasma genitalium PCR testing is
performed consistently and accurately to provide reliable diagnostic
results. All steps and results must be thoroughly documented in the
laboratory records.
