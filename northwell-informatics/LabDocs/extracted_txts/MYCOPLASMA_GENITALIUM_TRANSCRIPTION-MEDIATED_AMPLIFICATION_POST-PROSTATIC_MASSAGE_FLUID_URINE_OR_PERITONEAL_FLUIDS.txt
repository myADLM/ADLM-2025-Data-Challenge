MYCOPLASMA GENITALIUM DETECTION
USING TRANSCRIPTION-MEDIATED
AMPLIFICATION
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for the detection of Mycoplasma
genitalium from post-prostatic massage fluid/urine or peritoneal fluids
using Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol accurately for the detection of Mycoplasma genitalium. The
personnel must ensure that all steps, including quality control,
sample handling, and result reporting, are carried out correctly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Acceptable Specimens
• Post-prostatic massage fluid/urine.
• Peritoneal fluids.
• Specimens must arrive in the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection and should be transported under refrigerated conditions
(2-8°C).
B. Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens that are not transported under proper conditions.
• Specimens that are beyond the 24-hour stability period.
• Specimens with evidence of contamination or insufficient volume.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• TMA assay test kit.
• Specimen transport and collection containers.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Sterile gloves.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• TMA-compatible analyzer.
• Controls (positive and negative).
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C).
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Check Specimens:
◦ Ensure specimens are correctly labeled with patient
identifiers.
◦ Verify that specimens are within the acceptable transport
and storage conditions.
2. Aliquot Specimens:
◦ If necessary, aliquot the specimen into a sterile tube for
testing. Ensure to minimize time specimens are outside of
the refrigerator.
3. Mix Specimens:
◦ Vortex specimens briefly to ensure they are well-mixed
before analysis.
B. Assay Setup
1. Prepare Reagents:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the TMA assay kit
instructions. This includes thawing any frozen components
and ensuring all reagents are at room temperature before
use.
2. Load Specimens:
◦ Pipette the required volume of the specimen into the
reaction vessels specified by the kit instructions. Use clean,
sterile pipette tips for each specimen to avoid cross-
contamination.
3. Load Controls:
◦ Include both positive and negative controls in each batch to
ensure assay validity.
4. Initiate Assay:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions to initiate the TMA
assay on the specified analyzer. This typically involves
loading the reaction vessels into the machine and starting
the program designed for Mycoplasma genitalium detection.
C. Amplification and Detection
1. Amplification:
◦ The machine will automate the amplification process, which
includes the transcription of the target RNA into amplified
sequences.
2. Detection:
◦ The machine will detect the amplified sequences, indicating
the presence or absence of Mycoplasma genitalium.
D. Quality Control
1. Control Results:
◦ Review results from the positive and negative controls
before validating patient results. Controls must fall within the
acceptable range provided by the kit instructions.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If controls fail, do not report patient results. Identify and
rectify the problem before re-running the controls and
patient specimens.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review Results:
◦ Check each result to ensure it is within the expected
parameters of the assay.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Positive results indicate the presence of Mycoplasma
genitalium in the specimen.
◦ Negative results indicate the absence of Mycoplasma
genitalium in the specimen.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Ensure all positive results are confirmed and reported
to the relevant healthcare providers following laboratory
protocols.
4. Result Verification:
◦ A designated technologist must review and verify results
before final reporting.

8. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Proper PPE should be worn when handling specimens.
• All biohazard waste should be disposed of according to laboratory
safety protocols.
• Ensure periodic calibration and maintenance of all equipment
used.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure reliable
and accurate detection of Mycoplasma genitalium using the
Transcription-Mediated Amplification method.
