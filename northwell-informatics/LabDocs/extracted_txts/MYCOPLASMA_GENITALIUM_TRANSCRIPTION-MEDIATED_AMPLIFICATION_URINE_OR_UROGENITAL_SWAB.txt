Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Mycoplasma
genitalium Detection by Transcription-Mediated Amplification
(TMA), Urine or Urogenital Swab
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of Mycoplasma
genitalium in urine or urogenital swab specimens using Transcription-
Mediated Amplification (TMA) technology.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform Mycoplasma genitalium testing using TMA.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to ensure that testing is
performed according to this SOP and that results are accurate and
reported timely.
4. SPECIMENS
4.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Urine: First-catch urine specimen (20-30 mL of the initial stream)
collected in a sterile container.
• Urogenital Swab: Urethral swab for males or endocervical/vaginal
swab for females collected using a swab transport system
recommended for TMA assays.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identification.
• Specimens with insufficient volume for testing.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
proper storage (e.g., unrefrigerated).
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment:
• TMA Instrument (e.g., Hologic Panther system)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (calibrated)
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
5.2 Reagents:
• TMA assay kit specific for Mycoplasma genitalium (manufacturer-
specific, e.g., Hologic Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium Assay)
• Specimen transport and collection kits
• Controls: Positive and Negative controls provided with the assay
kit
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify patient identification and specimen labeling.
2. Inspect the specimen for proper volume and integrity.
3. For urine specimens, transfer 4 mL of urine into a transport tube
using a pipette.
4. For urogenital swabs, transfer the swab into the transport
medium provided.
6.2 Pre-Analytical Check:
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and instruments are at optimal
operating conditions and within expiration dates.
2. Set up the TMA instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Run daily control samples (positive and negative) to check the
performance of the assay.
6.3 TMA Assay:
1. Load patient specimens and controls into the designated
positions on the TMA instrument.
2. Program the instrument according to the assay-specific protocol
provided by the manufacturer (e.g., Hologic Panther System
Mycoplasma genitalium Assay Instructions).
3. Initiate the assay run.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Control Testing:
• Positive and Negative controls must be included in each assay
run.
• Internal validation checks must be performed as per the
manufacturer’s specifications.
7.2 Result Validation:
• Results need to be reviewed and validated by a certified
technologist.
• Any assay failure or control failure must be investigated and
resolved before patient results are released.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 Interpretation:
• Report results as Positive, Negative, or Indeterminate based on
the assay criteria.
• Indeterminate results require re-testing with a new specimen.
8.2 Documentation:
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all quality control and maintenance documentation is
complete.
9. MAINTENANCE
9.1 Routine Maintenance:
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance of the TMA
instrument as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
10.1 Biosafety:
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling
specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of biohazard waste as per laboratory protocols.
