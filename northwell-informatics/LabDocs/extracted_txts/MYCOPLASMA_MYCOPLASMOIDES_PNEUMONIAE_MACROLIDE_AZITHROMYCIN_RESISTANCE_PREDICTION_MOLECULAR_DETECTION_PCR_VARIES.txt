Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MYCOPLASMA (MYCOPLASMOIDES)
PNEUMONIAE MACROLIDE (AZITHROMYCIN) RESISTANCE
PREDICTION, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Mycoplasma pneumoniae macrolide
(Azithromycin) resistance prediction using molecular detection by
PCR. This process ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
outlined procedure.
• It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure proper
adherence to the procedure and to address any issues relevant to
test performance.
1. DEFINITIONS
Mycoplasma pneumoniae: A bacterium that causes respiratory
infections. Macrolide resistance: Resistance to macrolide antibiotics
such as Azithromycin. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A
molecular technique used to amplify and detect specific DNA
sequences.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR Instrument
• Thermal Cycler
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Master Mix
• Primers and Probes specific for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and
macrolide resistance genes (e.g. 23S rRNA mutations)
• Nuclease-Free Water
• Positive Control DNA
• Negative Control (No Template Control)
• PCR tubes or plates
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and Filter Tips
• QPCR plate sealer
• Vortex Mixer
• Cold Block or Ice Bucket
• Proper PPE (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA from the received clinical specimen using a validated
DNA extraction kit as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Include appropriate extraction controls.
• Quantify and assess DNA quality if necessary.
4.2 PCR Setup
• Prepare PCR Master Mix by combining the following components
in a sterile, nuclease-free microcentrifuge tube:
◦ 10 µl of PCR Master Mix
◦ 1 µl of Mycoplasma pneumoniae Specific Primer/Probe Mix
◦ 1 µl of Macrolide Resistance Primer/Probe Mix
◦ 5 µl of extracted DNA (Template)
◦ 3 µl of Nuclease-Free Water
(Note: Adjust volumes appropriately based on manufacturer's
recommendations and reaction setup)
• Prepare a Positive Control using DNA from a known Mycoplasma
pneumoniae resistant strain.
• Prepare a Negative Control with Nuclease-Free Water instead of
DNA template.
• Aliquot 20 µl of the PCR reaction mixture into each well of a PCR
plate or tube.
4.3 Real-Time PCR Cycling Conditions
• Load the PCR plate/tubes into the Real-Time PCR instrument.
• Set the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of Cycles: 45 cycles
4.4 Data Analysis
• Analyze the results according to the Real-Time PCR instrument
software.
• Ensure the Positive Control has amplified in all runs and the
Negative Control is void of amplification.
• Interpret the test results for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and
evaluate the presence of macrolide resistance based on the
amplification curve and Ct values.
4.5 Controls Include the following in every PCR run:
• Positive Control: Confirms the assay works as intended.
• Negative Control: Ensures no contamination occurred during the
procedure.
• Extraction Control: Monitors the accuracy of the DNA extraction
process.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive Result:
◦ Detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae target DNA with
expected Ct value range.
◦ Detection of macrolide resistance gene mutation indication
azithromycin resistance.
• Negative Result:
◦ No detectable Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA and no
amplification signal.
• Invalid Result:
◦ Positive control does not amplify or negative control shows
amplification, repeat the test.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify findings with a second technologist or data manager as
required.
• Report interpreted results to the referring physician or appropriate
clinical personnel.
For positive results:
• “Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA detected with resistance to
Azithromycin.”
For negative results:
• “Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA not detected.”
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for PCR equipment and reagent kits.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
molecular testing.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Implement regular validation of equipment and reagents.
• Perform routine maintenance checks on the PCR instrument.
• Follow internal and external quality assurance and proficiency
testing programs to ensure consistent high-quality performance.
1. SAFETY AND BIOSAFETY
• Follow institutional biosafety guidelines for handling clinical
specimens.
• Ensure appropriate disposal of amplified PCR products to prevent
contamination.
• Use appropriate PPE to minimize risk exposure.
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required by changes in
techniques, protocols, or regulations.
