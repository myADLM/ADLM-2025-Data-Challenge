Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Mycoplasma pneumoniae with Macrolide Resistance Reflex,
Molecular Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE This procedure provides guidelines for the molecular
detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae with macrolide resistance
reflex using PCR methodology. The aim is to ensure the accurate,
consistent, and timely generation of test results for clinical diagnoses.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are
authorized and trained to perform molecular diagnostic testing for
Mycoplasma pneumoniae and macrolide resistance detection.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Following the outlined procedures to maintain the integrity and
accuracy of test results.
• Ensuring that quality control and quality assurance protocols are
strictly adhered to.
• Documenting all steps and any deviations from the standard
procedure, while promptly reporting to a supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Respiratory samples (e.g., throat swabs,
nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage).
• Collection: Specimens should be collected in sterile, leak-proof
containers and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible.
• Storage: If a delay in processing is expected, specimens should
be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For longer storage,
specimens should be frozen at -70°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Instrument (capable of real-time detection)
• DNA Extraction Kit (validated for use with respiratory samples)
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR Master Mix
• Macrolide Resistance PCR Master Mix
• Nucleic acid-free water
• Positive and negative control samples
• PCR tubes/plates
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers
• Appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
extraction kit to isolate nucleic acids from the respiratory
specimen.
◦ Ensure that quality control specimens (positive and negative
controls) are processed simultaneously.
◦ Aliquot the extracted DNA into labeled tubes and store at
-20°C if not proceeding immediately to PCR.
2. PCR Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents and master mixes, if frozen, to room
temperature.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, including all required
components specific for Mycoplasma pneumoniae
detection.
◦ For macrolide resistance detection, prepare a separate
master mix accordingly.
3. Reaction Setup:
◦ Allocate appropriate volumes of master mix to each PCR
tube or well.
◦ Dispense extracted DNA samples into designated wells.
◦ Include the positive control, negative control, and no
template control (NTC) in each run.
◦ Seal the PCR plate/tubes securely to prevent evaporation.
4. PCR Cycling:
◦ Place the PCR plate/tubes into the PCR instrument.
◦ Program the PCR cycler with the following conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Amplification (45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 60 seconds
◦ Ensure the appropriate detection channels are selected for
real-time monitoring.
B. Result Analysis
1. Data Review:
◦ Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze the amplification
curves.
◦ Verify that the controls have performed as expected:
▪ The positive control should exhibit amplification.
▪ The negative control and NTC should not exhibit any
amplification.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Samples with an amplification curve (Ct value within the
expected range) for Mycoplasma pneumoniae are
considered positive for the infection.
◦ For positive samples, proceed with the macrolide resistance
PCR to determine antibiotic resistance.
3. Macrolide Resistance Detection:
◦ Similarly, review the amplification curves for macrolide
resistance genes.
◦ Positive amplification indicates the presence of resistance
genes, while no amplification suggests susceptibility.
C. Documentation and Reporting
1. Record Keeping:
◦ Document all steps, reagent lot numbers, results, and any
observations in the laboratory logbook or designated
electronic records.
◦ Include control results and any deviations from the protocol.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Verify and review the results.
◦ Input final, verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review and reporting by the clinical
pathologist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that DNA extraction, PCR setup, and thermocycling are
performed with precision and adherence to established
guidelines.
• Regularly calibrate equipment and perform maintenance as
required.
• Participate in external and internal proficiency testing to validate
assay performance.
