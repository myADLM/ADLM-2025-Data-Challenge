Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Mycoplasma pneumoniae Antibodies, IgG and IgM, Serum
Purpose: To outline the procedure for the analytical phase in the
detection and quantification of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies
(IgG and IgM) in serum samples using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other specified immunoassay
method. This test helps in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infections.
Specimen: Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
• The specimen should be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection
and stored at 2-8°C until analysis.
• Specimens may be stored frozen at -20°C for longer-term
storage.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing additives such as EDTA,
citrate, or heparin.
• Samples without proper labeling or documentation.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA kit for Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies (IgG and IgM)
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
• Lab timer
• Calibrated traceable thermometer
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, equipment, and specimen are at the
required temperature.
◦ Thoroughly read and understand the manufacturer's
instructions for the specific ELISA kit being used.
◦ Set up the microplate reader and calibrate it according to
manufacturing guidelines.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature if needed.
◦ Allow refrigerated specimens to warm to room temperature
before testing.
◦ Mix specimens gently before pipetting to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add appropriate volumes of diluted serum samples,
calibrators, standards, and controls to the wells of the
microplate as per kit instructions.
◦ Incubate samples with assay-specific reagents at specified
times and temperatures according to the kit's protocol.
◦ Wash wells as instructed to remove unbound materials.
◦ Add substrate solution to the wells and incubate again to
allow for color development.
◦ Stop the reaction as per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength
using the microplate reader.
◦ Compare the absorbance values to the standard curve to
quantify antibody levels.
◦ Ensure proper quality control by running positive and
negative controls and verifying their results.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality controls alongside patient specimens to
verify the accuracy of the assay.
◦ Document all quality control measures and results.
◦ If quality control results fall outside acceptable ranges,
troubleshooting steps should be taken as outlined in the
manufacturer's manual.
6. Result Interpretation:
◦ Follow manufacturer guidelines for interpreting antibody
levels.
◦ Report as positive or negative for IgG and IgM antibodies,
with relative concentration values when appropriate.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review and verification.
◦ Notify the appropriate clinical staff if critical results are
obtained.
◦ Ensure the results are filed and documented according to
site-specific reporting guidelines.
8. Sample Retention:
◦ Retain serum samples for a minimum of 1 week at 2-8°C
following analysis for possible re-testing.
◦ Dispose of expired or processed samples according to lab
safety protocols.
