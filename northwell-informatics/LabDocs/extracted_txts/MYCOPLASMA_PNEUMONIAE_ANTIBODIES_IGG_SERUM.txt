Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for MYCOPLASMA
PNEUMONIAE ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for the
analysis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae Antibodies, IgG in serum
specimens. This test is used for qualitative and quantitative detection
of IgG antibodies specific to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in human
serum.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
accurately and diligently. Laboratory technologists and technicians
are responsible for performing the assay, recording results, and
notifying the supervisor of any issues or deviations from the norm.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a gold-top or red-
top tube.
◦ Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum.
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Room Temperature: 48 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C or lower): 30 days
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
▪ Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
▪ Specimens that have been stored beyond stability limits.
2. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit specific
for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG antibodies.
◦ Microplate reader set to 450 nm for absorbance
measurement.
◦ Adjustable micropipettes and sterile pipette tips.
◦ Plate washers (automatic or manual).
◦ Incubator set to 37°C.
◦ Timer.
◦ Deionized or distilled water.
◦ Controls and calibrators provided with the ELISA kit.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation - Allow all reagents, controls, and specimens to
reach room temperature before starting the assay. - Prepare
reagents according to the instructions provided in the ELISA kit
insert.
B. Assay Procedure 1. Label appropriate number of microwells
for standards, controls, and patient samples. 2. Add 100 µL of
standards, controls, and serum samples into the designated
wells. 3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 45 minutes. 4. Wash the
plate 3-5 times with the provided wash solution. 5. Add 100 µL
of enzyme conjugate to each well. 6. Incubate at 37°C for 30
minutes. 7. Wash the plate 3-5 times with wash solution. 8. Add
100 µL of substrate solution to each well. 9. Incubate at room
temperature in the dark for 15 minutes. 10. Add 100 µL of stop
solution to each well to terminate the reaction. 11. Read the
absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance values for the standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Plot the standard curve on graph paper or use pre-
established standard calibration software.
◦ Determine the IgG concentration in the patient samples by
locating the absorbance values on the standard curve.
◦ Interpret test results according to the cutoff values provided
by the kit manufacturer to determine positive or negative
results for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG antibodies.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
◦ All controls must fall within the predefined acceptable
ranges. If the control results are not within the limits, the run
must be repeated.
◦ Record all control and patient results in the appropriate logs.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified
by the technologist.
◦ Report quantitative results in IU/mL.
◦ Include interpretative comments regarding positive,
negative, or indeterminate results based on established
guidelines from the kit insert.
7. LIMITATIONS
◦ Results from hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may
be inaccurate.
◦ False-positive or false-negative results may be observed in
individuals with other infections or with
immunocompromised states.
◦ Cross-reactivity with antibodies against other Mycoplasma
species or related pathogens may occur.
