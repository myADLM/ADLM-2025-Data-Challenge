Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating
Results for Mycoplasma pneumoniae Antibodies, IgM,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To accurately and efficiently generate results for Mycoplasma
pneumoniae IgM antibodies in serum specimens using enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This SOP ensures that all
testing procedures are followed correctly to achieve reliable and
reproducible results.
2. DEFINITION
Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibodies testing involves the
detection of specific antibodies related to Mycoplasma pneumoniae
infection. The purpose of this test is often to diagnose acute
infections.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Trained laboratory personnel will perform the testing, ensure quality
control, and document results according to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the staff to notify the supervisor of any issues that
could affect testing accuracy.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Preferred/Acceptable: 5 mL of blood collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed specimens, lipemic specimens, or
incorrectly labeled specimens.
• Stability: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if testing
cannot be performed immediately and must be tested within 72
hours. For long-term storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C or
below.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader
• ELISA Microplate washer
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Calibrated ELISA plate
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibody ELISA kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Disposable pipette tips
• Timer
• Reagent reservoirs
• Plate seals
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure that all reagents and specimens are at room
temperature before beginning the assay.
2. Review quality control and calibration records.
B. ELISA Assay Procedure
1. Plate Preparation
◦ Label and organize the microplate wells according to the
test layout: Calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition
◦ Pipette 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum
samples into the designated wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Seal the plate with a cover and incubate at room
temperature (20-25°C) for the time specified in the kit insert
(usually 60 minutes).
3. Plate Washing
◦ After incubation, wash the plate 3-5 times using an
automatic plate washer with the wash buffer included in the
kit.
4. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Seal the plate with a cover and incubate at room
temperature for the time specified (usually 10-20 minutes).
5. Reading Results
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well and mix gently.
◦ Read the plate on the ELISA reader at 450 nm within 15
minutes of adding the stop solution.
6. Quality Control
◦ Ensure that the readings of positive control, negative
control, and calibrators fall within the predetermined range.
Document any deviations and take corrective action.
C. Interpretation of Results
1. Data Analysis
◦ Calculate the sample’s absorbance values. Compare the
patient sample readings to the calibrator curve to determine
the concentration of IgM antibodies.
2. Reporting
◦ Report results according to site-specific guidelines. Positive
results indicate an acute infection, while negative results
suggest no acute infection or low levels of specific IgM
antibodies.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control material must be run with each batch of tests:
• Positive and negative controls and calibrators must be prepared
and assayed according to the kit instructions.
• Results for controls and calibrators must fall within the acceptable
range specified in the kit insert.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be entered into the LIS system. All results must be
reviewed and authorized by authorized personnel before being
released. Any critical values must be communicated promptly to the
attending physician as per established guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the kit insert for reference intervals, which typically state:
• Negative: Below the specified cutoff value
• Equivocal: Between low and high cutoff values (perform repeat
testing or additional diagnostic testing)
• Positive: Above the cutoff value
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to cross-
reactivity, sensitivity, and specificity.
