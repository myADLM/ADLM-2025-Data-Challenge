Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Mycoplasma pneumoniae Antibody Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate interpretation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae
antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) in patient specimens to aid in the
diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all qualified personnel responsible for
processing and interpreting Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody tests
within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
protocol, performing tests, recording results, and taking appropriate
actions based on the results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and accuracy of the tests performed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection: Blood collected in a red-top tube, serum separator
tube, or plasma separator tube.
• Processing: Centrifuge to separate serum/plasma.
• Specimen Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
For longer storage, specimens must be frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader or equivalent analytical device.
• ELISA Kit for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and IgM, or
equivalent immunoassay kits.
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the kit manufacturer.
• Micropipettes, centrifuge tubes, and other standard laboratory
equipment.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled with patient identification
and collection date/time.
• Thaw frozen specimens completely and mix thoroughly before
testing.
• Ensure serum/plasma is clear and free of hemolysis.
6.2. Assay Procedure:
• Perform the ELISA or equivalent assay for Mycoplasma
pneumoniae IgG and/or IgM according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Include appropriate positive and negative controls, as well as
calibrators for validation.
6.3. Result Interpretation:
• Compare the optical density (OD) values of the patient specimens
to those of the controls and calibrators.
• Calculate the antibody index or titer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
6.4. Reference Ranges:
• IgM:
◦ Negative: Index <0.9, suggests no current infection.
◦ Equivocal: Index 0.9-1.1, retesting in 2-4 weeks
recommended.
◦ Positive: Index >1.1, suggests current or recent infection.
• IgG:
◦ Negative: Index <0.9, suggests no prior exposure or immunity.
◦ Equivocal: Index 0.9-1.1, retesting in 2-4 weeks
recommended.
◦ Positive: Index >1.1, suggests past infection or immunity.
6.5. Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control samples (positive and negative
controls) with each batch of tests.
• Review control results to ensure they fall within the established
reference ranges before releasing patient results.
• Document all control results and take corrective action for any
control outliers per laboratory policies.
6.6. Troubleshooting:
• If control results are outside the acceptable range, do not report
patient results.
• Review reagent and specimen handling protocols.
• Repeat tests or use a new reagent batch if necessary.
• Contact the manufacturer for technical support if needed.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify that results match patient identifiers and other relevant
patient information.
• Check for any critical results as defined by laboratory policy and
follow established protocols for critical result reporting.
• Notify healthcare provider of results needing immediate clinical
action.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Record and maintain all testing details, including specimen
receipt, lot numbers of reagents, calibration data, and quality
control data.
• Keep all records for a minimum retention period as per laboratory
policy and regulatory requirements.
9. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIMITATIONS
• Interpretation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and IgM results
should be considered in conjunction with clinical findings and
other diagnostic tests.
• Cross-reactivity with other organisms, underlying conditions
affecting immune response, or specimen handling errors can
affect results.

• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) of the specific
Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and IgM assay kits.

Manuals.
11. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This protocol should be reviewed and updated annually or as
required by changes in technology, methodology, or regulatory
requirements.
