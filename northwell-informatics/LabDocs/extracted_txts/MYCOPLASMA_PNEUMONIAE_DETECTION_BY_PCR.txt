SOP: Mycoplasma pneumoniae Detection
by PCR
1. PURPOSE
This procedure is designed to outline the steps for detecting
Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical specimens by Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The protocol ensures
accurate, reliable results through standardized methods.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to clinical specimens such as nasopharyngeal
swabs, throat swabs, sputum, or other respiratory specimens
submitted for testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP
to perform Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR testing. It is the
responsibility of the technical supervisor to ensure that personnel are
trained and proficient in this procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A laboratory technique used to
amplify DNA sequences.
M. pneumoniae: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a pathogen causing
respiratory infections.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR master mix (including primers/probes specific for M.
pneumoniae)
• Clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs,
sputum, etc.)
• Nucleic acid-free tubes and pipette tips
• Positive and negative control samples
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Spectrophotometer (optional for quantitation)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, or other
respiratory specimens.
◦ Specimens should be transported to the laboratory within 24
hours and stored at 2-8°C. If longer storage is needed,
samples should be frozen at -20°C or below.
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are not respiratory in origin.
◦ Specimens transported beyond 24 hours at room
temperature without appropriate refrigeration or freezing.
3. Specimen Handling:
◦ All specimens are handled in a biosafety cabinet following
standard biosafety procedures.
6.2 DNA Extraction
1. Extraction Process:
◦ Use the recommended DNA extraction kit per
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure to include a negative extraction control to monitor for
contamination.
6.3 PCR Reaction Setup
1. Preparation of Master Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. This typically includes DNA
polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, primers, and probes specific for
M. pneumoniae.
◦ Vortex briefly and centrifuge to collect contents at the
bottom of the tube.
2. Loading PCR Plates/Tubes:
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a 96-well plate (as
appropriate).
◦ Add extracted DNA (5-10 µL) to each tube/well containing
the master mix. Include a positive control, negative control,
and the extraction control.
◦ Ensure tubes/caps are tightly sealed to prevent aerosol
formation.
6.4 PCR Amplification
1. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 40
6.5 Detection and Interpretation of Results
1. Post-PCR Analysis:
◦ Analyze the amplified products using a suitable detection
method (e.g., gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR detection
system).
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Positive control should show amplification, indicative of
assay functionality.
◦ Negative control should show no amplification, indicating the
absence of contamination.
◦ Specimens with exponential amplification curve (Ct value
within expected range) are considered positive for M.
pneumoniae.
◦ Absence of amplification in specimens, alongside
amplification in positive control, indicates a negative result.
6.6 Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
◦ Document all control results for assurance of validity.
2. Inter-laboratory Comparisons:
◦ Participate in regular proficiency testing to ensure
consistency and accuracy of results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documenting Results:
◦ Enter results for each specimen into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Review and verify all results prior to release. Ensure that the
positive and negative controls provided expected results.
◦ Report positive results promptly to the requesting physician
and/or infection control department as per institutional
policy.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If no amplification is observed in positive control:
◦ Repeat the assay with fresh reagents.
◦ Check PCR machine calibration.
• If contamination is suspected (false positives in negative control):
◦ Decontaminate work area and equipment.
◦ Follow-up with a repeat assay using new reagents.
