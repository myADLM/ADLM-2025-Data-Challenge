Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MYC Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. Purpose
To outline the procedures for the technical component of MYC
immunostaining, ensuring accurate and reliable staining results are
generated in a consistent manner in compliance with CLIA
requirements.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
the MYC immunostaining procedure and document all activities as
specified in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff
follow the protocol and address any issues that arise.
1. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure the tissue blocks are adequately fixed with 10% neutral
buffered formalin.
• FFPE tissue sections should be cut at a thickness of 4-5 microns
and mounted on positively charged microscope slides.
1. Reagents and Materials
Reagents:
• MYC primary antibody
• Secondary antibody with appropriate enzyme label (e.g., HRP-
conjugated)
• Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
• Blocking solution
Materials:
• Water bath
• Staining jars
• Humidified chamber for incubation
• Cover slips and mounting medium
• Microtome
• Forceps, slide racks, and other standard histological tools
1. Equipment
• Automated immunostainer (if available)
• Light microscope
• Incubator set at appropriate temperature
1. Procedure
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Cut FFPE tissue sections at 4-5 microns and mount on
positively charged slides.
2. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the sections in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes
each).
2. Rehydrate the sections through graded alcohols:
◦ 100% Ethanol, 2 changes, 3 minutes each.
◦ 95% Ethanol, 3 minutes.
◦ 70% Ethanol, 3 minutes.
3. Rinse in distilled water, 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable method (heat-induced
epitope retrieval - HIER is commonly used):
◦ Place slides in a retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH
6.0) and heat in a microwave oven, pressure cooker, or
water bath according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature.
D. Blocking:
1. Incubate sections in blocking solution for 10-15 minutes to
reduce non-specific background staining.
2. Rinse sections briefly in PBS or TBS.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the MYC primary antibody to the sections and incubate:
◦ Optimal dilution and incubation time should be determined
based on validation data.
◦ Incubate typically at room temperature for 1 hour or
overnight at 4°C.
F. Washing:
1. Wash sections in PBS or TBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
G. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated or other) and
incubate as per the antibody datasheet recommendations
(usually 30-60 minutes at room temperature).
2. Wash sections in PBS or TBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
H. Chromogen Development:
1. Apply the chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) to the sections and
monitor under a microscope for the development of the stain.
2. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
I. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in distilled water and then in running tap water for bluing.
J. Dehydration, Clearing, and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols and xylene:
◦ 70% Ethanol, 1 minute.
◦ 95% Ethanol, 1 minute.
◦ 100% Ethanol, 2 changes, 1 minute each.
◦ Xylene, 2 changes, 1 minute each.
2. Mount sections with a suitable mounting medium and cover
slips.
3. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls with each staining run.
• Positive control: Known tissue expressing MYC.
• Negative control: Tissue processed with the omission of the
primary antibody.
1. Result Documentation:
• Log all performed procedures, including antibody lot numbers,
incubation times and temperatures, and any deviations from the
SOP in the laboratory information system (LIS) or manual log
book.
• Quality control results, including the performance of control
sections, should be recorded.
1. References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for all antibodies and reagents used.
• Current literature on immunohistochemical techniques and MYC
staining protocols.
1. Safety Considerations:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents, including xylene and alcohol, in a well-
ventilated area.
• Dispose of waste materials according to biohazard and chemical
safety guidelines.
1. Troubleshooting:
• If staining is weak or non-specific, review the antigen retrieval
process and antibody dilutions.
• If background staining is problematic, optimize blocking conditions
and washing steps.
• Consult with supervisors if persistent issues arise.
This protocol ensures consistent and reliable MYC immunostaining
while meeting regulatory and accreditation standards for laboratory
practice.
