Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase:
MYD88 L265P Somatic Gene Mutation, DNA Allele-
Specific PCR
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of MYD88 L265P
somatic gene mutation using DNA allele-specific PCR. This includes
the proper handling of reagents, DNA extraction, preparation of the
PCR reaction, amplification, detection, documentation, analysis, and
reporting of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the molecular diagnostics laboratory certified
under CLIA. It is intended for use by qualified personnel trained in
molecular techniques.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing MYD88
L265P mutation testing to follow this procedure to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• MYD88 L265P: A specific mutation in the MYD88 gene,
commonly associated with certain types of lymphomas and
hematologic malignancies.
• DNA Allele-Specific PCR: A PCR technique used to selectively
amplify sequences with specific alleles.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Peripheral blood
◦ Bone marrow aspirates
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
• Specimen Storage:
◦ Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples should be stored
at 2-8°C and processed within 24 hours.
◦ FFPE samples should be stored at room temperature.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly stored.
6. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ MYD88 L265P mutation detection PCR kit
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive and negative controls specific for MYD88 L265P
mutation
• Equipment:
◦ PCR cycler
◦ Real-time PCR machine
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and filter tips
◦ Gel electrophoresis apparatus (if applicable)
◦ UV transilluminator (if applicable)
• Supplies:
◦ PCR tubes
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Gloves and lab coat
◦ Ice and ice bucket
◦ Ethanol
7. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Peripheral Blood/Bone Marrow:
◦ Use the DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Quantify the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.
◦ Dilute DNA to 50 ng/μL with nuclease-free water.
2. FFPE Tissue:
◦ Section the tissue and deparaffinize as per the protocol.
◦ Use the DNA extraction kit specific for FFPE tissues.
◦ Quantify the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.
◦ Dilute DNA to 50 ng/μL with nuclease-free water.
B) PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the MYD88 L265P
detection kit’s instructions. This typically includes:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Allele-specific primers
◦ Taq polymerase
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes, each containing 50 ng
of DNA template.
3. Include a no-template control (NTC) and positive control within
each PCR run.
4. Cap the tubes, mix gently, and briefly centrifuge to collect the
contents at the bottom.
C) PCR Amplification
1. Place the tubes in the PCR cycler and program the machine for
the following cycling conditions, which may vary according to
the specific kit:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
D) Detection
1. Real-Time PCR (preferred method):
◦ Load the amplified products into the real-time PCR machine.
◦ Analyze the results according to the instrument and kit
instructions. A threshold cycle (Ct) value will be generated,
and mutation status can be determined.
2. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
◦ Prepare an agarose gel and electrophoresis buffer.
◦ Load PCR product and run electrophoresis at 100V until the
dye front reaches ¾ of the gel.
◦ Visualize bands under UV light and document results.
E) Quality Control
1. Ensure that all positive and negative controls produce expected
results. Repeat the run if controls fail.
2. Assess the integrity of DNA and PCR performance by checking
for smear or primer-dimer formation in the negative control lane
(if using gel electrophoresis)
8. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record all observations, results, and quality control data in the
laboratory information system.
2. Interpret the data and review for consistency and accuracy.
Document the presence or absence of the MYD88 L265P
mutation.
3. Report verified results to the appropriate clinical personnel.
Results should include:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Specimen type
◦ DNA concentration and purity
◦ PCR kit and lot number
◦ Mutation status: Positive, Negative, or Indeterminate
◦ Reviewer’s name and signature
◦ Date of report
