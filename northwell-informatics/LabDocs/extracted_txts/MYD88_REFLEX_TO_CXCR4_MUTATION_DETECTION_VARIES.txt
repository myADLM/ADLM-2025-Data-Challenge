Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: MYD88 Reflex to CXCR4 Mutation Detection, Varies
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
Department: Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
To delineate the methods and procedures for the reflex testing of
MYD88 mutation and subsequent testing for CXCR4 mutation
detection when MYD88 is positive, ensuring accuracy and reliability
in all results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the handling and processing of patient
samples for MYD88 reflex to CXCR4 mutation detection within the
Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
• MYD88: Myeloid Differentiation Primary Response 88, a gene
involved in cell signaling.
• CXCR4: Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4, a gene involved in
metastasis and cell survival.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory scientists are responsible for the execution
of the procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for verifying results and
overall process quality.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate.
• Volume: Minimum 10 mL of peripheral blood in EDTA tube or 3
mL of bone marrow.
• Storage Conditions: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and
processed within 72 hours of collection.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR thermocycler
• DNA extraction kits
• MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation detection kits
• Appropriate PCR reagents (primers, probes, etc.)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (filter tips recommended)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sterile, nuclease-free tubes and consumables
7. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Add 200 µL of blood or bone marrow specimen to a
microcentrifuge tube containing 20 µL of Proteinase K.
2. Add 200 µL of lysis buffer and mix thoroughly.
3. Incubate the mixture at 56°C for 10 minutes.
4. Following incubation, transfer the lysate to the spin column and
centrifuge at 8000 RCF for 1 minute.
5. Add 500 µL of wash buffer to the column and centrifuge at 8000
RCF for 1 minute.
6. Repeat the washing step.
7. Elute the DNA by adding 50 µL of elution buffer to the column,
incubation for 1 minute at room temperature, and centrifuge at
8000 RCF for 1 minute.
8. Measure the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer and adjust to the required concentration for PCR.
B) MYD88 Mutation Detection:
1. Prepare the real-time PCR master mix following the kit
instructions.
2. Add appropriate volumes of the master mix and DNA sample to
a PCR reaction plate.
3. Seal the plate and load it onto the real-time PCR thermocycler.
4. Run the PCR program as specified by the MYD88 mutation
detection kit.
5. Analyze the results using the provided software. Positive
controls should show amplification, and no signal should
appear in negative controls.
C) Reflex to CXCR4 Mutation Detection (if MYD88 positive):
1. Using the remaining DNA sample, set up the real-time PCR
reactions with the CXCR4 mutation detection kit.
2. Follow the same preparation, loading, and amplification steps
as used for MYD88.
3. Analyze the CXCR4 mutation results with the appropriate
software. Similar positive and negative control checks apply.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls for both MYD88 and
CXCR4 tests in each run.
• Review all control results to ensure valid test runs.
• Perform routine verification of reagents and equipment calibration
before use.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile the data from the real-time PCR software and manually
verify it against control results.
• If MYD88 is negative, the testing ends there.
• If MYD88 is positive, proceed to report both MYD88 and CXCR4
results.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
physician review.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• MYD88 Mutation: Detected or Not Detected.
• CXCR4 Mutation: Detected or Not Detected.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inadequate DNA concentration or quality may lead to invalid
results.
• Mutations outside the targeted regions of the kits will not be
detected.
