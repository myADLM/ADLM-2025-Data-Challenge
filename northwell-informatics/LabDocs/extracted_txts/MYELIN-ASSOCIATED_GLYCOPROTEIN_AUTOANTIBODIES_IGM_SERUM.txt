Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein
Autoantibodies, IgM, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for Myelin-Associated
Glycoprotein (MAG) Autoantibodies, IgM in serum samples. This
document includes specimen requirements, equipment, reagents,
and supplies, detailed analytical procedures, quality control
measures, and result reporting guidelines.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
Specimen type: Serum Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of blood collected in a red-top or SST (serum separator
tube)
• Allow blood sample to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
and then centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum
from cells
• Specimens should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) and can be stored
up to 7 days.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens in collection tubes with anticoagulants (EDTA,
heparin, citrate)
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 7 days after
collection
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
instrument or microplate reader
• ELISA kit for Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein Autoantibodies, IgM
(commercially available and validated for use)
• Calibrators and controls provided within the ELISA kit
• Micropipettes and pipette tips (calibrated)
• Microplate washer
• Plate shaker
• Distilled or deionized water
• Waste disposal containers
• Protective laboratory coat, gloves, and eye protection
1. PROCEDURE:
a. Preparation:
• Confirm receipt and condition of specimen according to specimen
requirements.
• Equilibrate all reagents, controls, and serum specimens to room
temperature (20-25°C) prior to assay.
b. Assay Procedure:
1. Label ELISA plate strips according to the manual provided in
the kit.
2. Prepare diluent buffer, wash buffer, substrate reagent, and stop
solution as per the kit instructions.
3. Add appropriate volume of controls, calibrators, and patient
serum samples to designated wells on the ELISA plate.
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the specified
duration as per kit instructions.
5. Wash the plate repeatedly to remove non-bound components
using microplate washer.
6. Add conjugate reagent to each well and incubate as specified.
7. Wash the plate again to remove non-bound conjugate reagent.
8. Add substrate reagent to each well and incubate in the dark at
room temperature for the specified duration.
9. Stop the reaction with the provided stop solution at the
specified time interval.
10. Immediately read the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set to the appropriate wavelength specified in
the ELISA kit instructions.
11. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include both positive and negative controls with each batch of
patient samples.
• Ensure calibrators span the dynamic range of the assay.
• Verify instrument calibration and maintenance logs periodically.
• Quality control results must fall within predetermined ranges for
the assay to be valid.
• Record all control results, and investigate any deviations before
reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• The OD readings will be converted to concentration values using
a standard curve based on the calibrators.
• Review and validate calculated results before reporting.
• Results should be reported as either "Positive," "Negative," or
"Indeterminate" based on established cut-off values provided
within the assay kit.
• Document any deviations, troubleshooting steps, and final result
interpretations.
1. REFERENCES:
• Insert manufacturer’s kit instructions for the Myelin-Associated
Glycoprotein Autoantibodies, IgM ELISA kit.
• Current clinical laboratory standards and guidelines on
autoimmune antibody assays.
• Laboratory sample handling and processing SOP.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols.
• Dispose of biohazard materials according to laboratory guidelines.
• Ensure compliance with CLIA regulations and standards for
clinical laboratory testing.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory staff to
ensure all steps are followed correctly for the generation of accurate
and reliable results for Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein
Autoantibodies, IgM. Quality assurance and supervision are provided
by a designated quality officer.
