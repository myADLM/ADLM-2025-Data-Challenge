Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MYELIN
OLIGODENDROCYTE GLYCOPROTEIN (MOG-IgG1)
FLUORESCENCE-ACTIVATED CELL SORTING (FACS) ASSAY,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical phase steps for generating results for Myelin
Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG-IgG1) using a Fluorescence-
activated Cell Sorting (FACS) assay in serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the MOG-IgG1 FACS assay as described in this procedure
and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 1 mL of serum, separated from a 5 mL
whole blood sample collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when stored
at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples, and samples with less than 0.5 mL of serum.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (FACS machine)
• Analyzing software compatible with FACS data
• MOG-IgG1 antigen-coated beads
• Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies specific for human
IgG1
• Flow cytometry buffers (e.g., PBS with 1% BSA)
• Conical centrifuge tubes (15 mL or 50 mL)
• Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL)
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Ice or ice packs
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature or on ice if
necessary. Mix gently by inverting.
2. Spin the serum samples at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes to remove
any residual cells or debris. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh
tube without disturbing the pellet.
B. Preparation of Reagents and Controls
1. Prepare the MOG-IgG1 antigen-coated beads according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare the fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies specific
for human IgG1 by diluting them in the flow cytometry buffer.
3. Include appropriate controls:
◦ Negative Control: Serum from healthy donors.
◦ Positive Control: Serum known to contain MOG-IgG1
antibodies.
C. Incubation
1. Aliquot 50 µL of antigen-coated beads into each microcentrifuge
tube.
2. Add 50 µL of serum sample, negative control, and positive
control to the respective tubes.
3. Vortex gently and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour with
gentle agitation.
D. Washing
1. Add 1 mL flow cytometry buffer to each tube and centrifuge at
300 x g for 5 minutes.
2. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the bead
pellet.
3. Repeat the wash step two more times.
E. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Add 100 µL of diluted fluorescently labeled secondary
antibodies to each tube.
2. Vortex gently and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes
in the dark to protect from light.
F. Final Washes
1. Add 1 mL flow cytometry buffer to each tube and centrifuge at
300 x g for 5 minutes.
2. Aspirate the supernatant carefully.
3. Repeat the wash step two more times.
4. Resuspend the beads in 300 µL of flow cytometry buffer for
analysis.
G. Acquisition and Analysis with FACS
1. Set up the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions and calibrate it with standard fluorescent beads if
necessary.
2. Load the prepared samples into the FACS machine.
3. Acquire data for each sample, ensuring that at least 10,000
events per sample are recorded.
4. Analyze the data using the specific software, setting
appropriate gates to identify bead-bound antibody fluorescence.
5. Calculate the MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) for each
sample and compare it with the controls to determine the
presence and levels of MOG-IgG1 antibodies.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative and positive controls in each assay run to
validate the performance of the test.
• Analyze the QC results against established ranges before
reporting patient results.
• Review the FACS machine QC logs and service records regularly
to ensure optimal performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are interpreted based on the MFI values relative to the
controls.
• Report results as positive or negative for MOG-IgG1 antibodies,
with quantitative values if required.
• Document and review all raw data, analytical steps, and final
results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for MOG-IgG1 antigen-coated beads
and fluorescent antibodies.
• Flow cytometer user manual and software guides.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards for flow cytometry
assays.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If assays produce unexpected results, verify the integrity of
samples and reagents, re-evaluate the assay protocol, and
perform troubleshooting steps as necessary.
• Consult with a supervisor or technical expert if persistent issues
occur.
