Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Myelodysplastic Syndrome by Flow
Cytometry, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps required for the analytical phase of
generating results for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) by flow
cytometry using bone marrow specimens. This includes preparation,
analysis, data interpretation, and quality control procedures to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
flow cytometry analysis, interpreting data, and documenting results
according to this procedure. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with all procedures and addressing any discrepancies or
issues.
2. DEFINITION
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a group of hematologic
disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and dysplasia in
one or more of the bone marrow cell lineages. Flow cytometry is
used to analyze the immunophenotypic features of bone marrow cells
to support diagnosis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Bone marrow aspirate Container: Sterile tube with
anticoagulant (e.g., EDTA) Volume: Minimum 2 mL of bone marrow
aspirate Transport: Specimen should be kept at room temperature
and transported to the laboratory immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identification
• Specimens that are clotted or hemolyzed
• Specimens that are contaminated or have leaked during
transport.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: Flow cytometer, centrifuge, vortex mixer, refrigerator
Reagents: Fluorescently labeled antibodies specific to cell markers
(e.g., CD34, CD19, CD45), lysing solution, wash buffer, fixation
solution Supplies: Sterile tubes, pipettes, FACS tubes
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Sample:
1. Ensure bone marrow aspirate is adequately mixed to prevent
clotting.
2. Aliquot 100μL of bone marrow aspirate into FACS tubes.
3. Add fluorescently labeled antibodies to each tube as per the
established panel for MDS diagnosis.
4. Vortex the tubes gently and incubate for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature in the dark.
5. Add lysing solution to each tube to lyse red blood cells and wait
for the specified period according to the reagent instructions.
6. Centrifuge the tubes at 300g for 5 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
7. Wash cells twice with wash buffer by centrifuging at 300g for 5
minutes and resuspending in wash buffer.
8. Fix cells using the fixation solution, if necessary.
Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Calibrate and perform quality control checks on the flow
cytometer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set up the flow cytometer's acquisition parameters according to
the antibody panel and specific markers for MDS.
3. Run the prepared samples through the flow cytometer, ensuring
proper gating strategy and fluorescence compensation.
4. Acquire data and save the files for analysis.
Data Analysis:
1. Evaluate the cell population distribution focusing on markers
indicative of MDS (e.g., CD34+, CD19+, CD45+).
2. Use software to analyze flow cytometry data, applying
appropriate gating and excluding debris.
3. Interpret results by correlating abnormal immunophenotypic
patterns with MDS diagnostic criteria.
4. Document findings in the laboratory information system for
verification.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Daily Quality Control:
1. Validate flow cytometer’s performance daily using calibration
beads.
2. Run a positive and negative control for each antibody used in
the panel.
3. Document any issues and corrective actions taken in the quality
control log.
Periodic Quality Control:
1. Monthly comparison of flow cytometer performance using
standardized control blood samples.
2. Perform lot-to-lot comparisons for new batches of antibodies.
Reporting Results:
1. Results are entered into the laboratory information system for
review and verification.
2. Possible abnormal findings, such as aberrant expression of
markers, are highlighted for further review.
3. Provide interpretive statements based on flow cytometry results
correlating with MDS diagnostic criteria.
4. Results are communicated to the ordering physician according
to lab protocols.
Reference Intervals: Refer to specific guidelines for normal ranges
of markers in bone marrow cells and establish diagnostic criteria for
MDS based on clinical practice standards.
Method Limitations: Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for
antibody limitations and potential interferences affecting results.

I have tailored a protocol for performing flow cytometry analysis of
bone marrow specimens to diagnose Myelodysplastic Syndrome
(MDS) and included detailed procedural, quality control steps, and
reporting criteria. If you need protocols for specific equipment or
reagents, let me know and I will include them.
