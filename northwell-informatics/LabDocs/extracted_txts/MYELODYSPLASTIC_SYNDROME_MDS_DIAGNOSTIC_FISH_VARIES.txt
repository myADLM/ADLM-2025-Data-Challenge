Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Diagnostic
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed and standardized procedure
for the analytical phase of generating diagnostic results for
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) using Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH).
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the FISH analysis for the diagnosis of
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All personnel performing FISH analysis must
adhere to this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable diagnostic
results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Acceptable: Bone marrow or
peripheral blood specimens collected in sodium heparin or
EDTA. Volume: 2-3 mL bone marrow aspirate or 5-10 mL
peripheral blood.
Rejection Criteria: Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, improperly
labeled, or received outside of the 48-hour window post-collection.
Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT Reagents: FISH probes
specific for common MDS-associated chromosomal
abnormalities (e.g., 5q-, -7/del(7q), +8, -20/del(20q)).
Equipment: Fluorescence microscope. Thermocycler. Hybridization
oven. Microscope slides, coverslips. Appropriate image analysis
software.
1. PROCEDURE A). Slide Preparation:
Prepare slides by pipetting 100 µL of cell suspension onto each slide.
Allow slides to air dry completely. Fix the cells by immersing the
slides in a Carnoy’s fixative solution (methanol:acetic acid, 3:1) for 10
minutes. Allow slides to air dry again.
B). Denaturation: Pre-treat slides with 2X SSC (saline-sodium citrate)
at room temperature for 5 minutes. Dehydrate slides through an
ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) for 2 minutes each, and air dry.
C). Hybridization: Apply 10 µL of FISH probe mixture to each slide.
Simultaneously, cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
Place slides on a thermocycler set to 75°C for 2 minutes for
denaturation. Transfer slides to a 37°C hybridization oven and
incubate for 12-16 hours.
D). Post-hybridization Washing: Remove the coverslip and wash the
slides in 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 75°C for 2 minutes. Air-dry the slides
in the dark.
E). Counterstaining: Apply 10 µL of DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole) solution to each slide. Cover with a coverslip and
incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
F). Analysis: Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filters. Capture images using the image analysis
software. Count 200 interphase nuclei per probe set.
G). Interpretation: Interpret the FISH signals according to established
laboratory criteria for each probe. Determine cut-off values for
positivity/negativity based on normal reference ranges.
H). Quality Control: Run positive and negative controls with each
batch of patient samples. Review and document control results
before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS Report format should include: Patient
information (name, ID, date of birth). Specimen information
(source, date of collection). Results of FISH analysis (positive
or negative for each chromosomal abnormality tested).
Interpretation of results in the context of MDS diagnosis.
Signature of the technologist and reviewing supervisor.
2. CRITICAL VALUES Any results indicative of a new diagnosis or
significant change in MDS status should be communicated
immediately to the responsible clinician.
3. LIMITATIONS FISH analysis has limits in resolution; it may not
detect submicroscopic or complex chromosomal
rearrangements. Sample quality and processing can affect
results; ensure proper sample handling and slide preparation.
Certain rare chromosomal abnormalities associated with MDS
may require additional or alternative testing modalities.
4. REFERENCES Current literature on MDS FISH analysis and
probe manufacturer guidelines. Laboratory’s established
validation studies for FISH probes. Laboratory-specific quality
control and assurance manuals.
5. DOCUMENTATION Maintain records of all FISH analyses,
including raw data, images, control results, and final reports, for
a minimum of 10 years in compliance with CLIA regulations.
