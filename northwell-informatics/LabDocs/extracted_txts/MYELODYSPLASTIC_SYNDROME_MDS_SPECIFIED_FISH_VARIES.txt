Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS),
Specified FISH, Various Probes
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely analysis of fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities
associated with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who are involved in the
analytical phase of FISH testing for MDS using specified probes.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures outlined in this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance and for addressing any
deviations or issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Bone marrow aspirate, peripheral blood, or core
biopsy.
• Volume: A minimum of 2-5 mL of specimen is required.
• Transportation: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory at 4-8°C in a leak-proof container.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence Microscope
• FISH probes for specific chromosomal regions pertinent to MDS
(e.g., 5q-, 7q-, 8+, 20q-, and complex karyotypes)
• Hybridization buffer
• Denaturing solution
• Wash buffers
• DAPI counterstain
• Humidified hybridization chamber
• Coverslips
• Immersion oil
• Glass slides
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use a known positive control and a negative control for each
FISH probe batch.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all quality control activities and the results in the
appropriate log.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Prepare bone marrow or peripheral blood smear on clean glass
slides.
2. Allow slides to air-dry completely.
3. Fix the slides in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) for 10 minutes.
B. Pre-Treatment:
1. Immerse slides in a prepared denaturing solution (e.g., 70%
formamide in 2x SSC) at 72°C for 2 minutes.
2. Immediately transfer slides into an ethanol dehydration series
(70%, 85%, and 100%) for 1 minute each.
C. Hybridization:
1. Apply 10 µL of FISH probe mixture directly to the target area on
the slide.
2. Cover the slide with a coverslip and seal the edges with rubber
cement.
3. Place the slides in a humidified hybridization chamber.
4. Incubate at 73°C for 2 minutes to denature the probe and the
target DNA.
5. Hybridize overnight at 37°C.
D. Post-Hybridization Washing:
1. Remove coverslip carefully.
2. Immerse slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 pre-warmed to 72°C
for 2 minutes.
3. Wash slides in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1
minute.
E. Counterstaining:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI solution to the target area on the slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip.
3. Allow to rest for 5 minutes at room temperature.
F. Microscopy Examination:
1. Using a fluorescence microscope, examine the slides at 1000x
magnification with appropriate filters for DAPI and FISH probes.
2. Analyze a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei per specimen.
3. Record the number of cells displaying each signal pattern.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare the observed signal patterns with the expected
outcomes for each specific FISH probe.
• Interpret the results according to the laboratory’s established
guidelines for MDS-related abnormalities.
• Positive findings should indicate the presence of specific
chromosomal abnormalities associated with MDS.
• Negative results imply a lack of detected MDS-related
chromosomal abnormalities by the probes used.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Include all relevant information: patient details, specimen type,
probe used, and signal patterns observed.
• Interpretative comments should be added based on the findings,
indicating whether the results are consistent with MDS.
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Repeat analysis if results are ambiguous or quality control fails.
• Troubleshoot common issues such as weak signals, poor
hybridization, or non-specific binding by reviewing the specimen
quality, probe preparation, and hybridization conditions.
