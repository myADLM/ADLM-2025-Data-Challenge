Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of Myeloid Sarcoma using Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) on tissue samples.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
follow this SOP to accurately determine the presence of
chromosomal abnormalities associated with Myeloid Sarcoma using
FISH techniques. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the procedure and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. DEFINITION Myeloid Sarcoma, also known as granulocytic
sarcoma or chloroma, is a rare extramedullary tumor composed
of immature myeloid cells. FISH is used to detect specific
genetic abnormalities in the tissue sample, aiding in diagnosis
and treatment planning.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets
• FISH probes specific to Myeloid Sarcoma markers (e.g., RUNX1-
RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, PML-RARA, etc.)
• Tissue culture slides
• Pretreatment kit (e.g., paraffin pretreatment reagent kit)
• Denaturation/hybridization system
• Wash buffers
• Mounting medium containing DAPI
• Immersion oil
• Pipettes and tips
• Humidity chamber
• Timer
• Laboratory notebook/log
1. PROCEDURE A) Pre-Treatment of Tissue Section
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration a. Place the paraffin-fixed
tissue sections on slides. b. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by
immersing into xylene for 10 minutes, twice. c. Rehydrate the
tissue sections through a series of ethanol washes (100%,
95%, 70%, and distilled water for 5 minutes each).
3. Pretreatment a. Pretreat the tissue sections using the
pretreatment kit as per manufacturer’s instructions. b. After
pretreatment, rinse the slides in distilled water and then with
wash buffer.
B) FISH Procedure
1. Denaturation and Hybridization a. Apply FISH probe mixture to
the tissue sections. b. Cover each section with a cover slip and
seal the edges with rubber cement. c. Place the slides in a
denaturation/hybridization system. d. Denature sections at
72-75°C for 5 minutes. e. Hybridize at 37°C in a humidity
chamber overnight (12-16 hours).
2. Post-Hybridization Wash a. Remove the coverslips carefully
under minimal agitation. b. Wash the slides in two changes of
pre-warmed wash buffer at 45-50°C for 5 minutes each. c.
Rinse the slides briefly in distilled water.
3. Counterstaining and Mounting a. Counterstain the slides by
applying 10 µL of DAPI mounting medium. b. Cover the
sections with cover slips and seal with nail polish.
C) Fluorescence Microscopy
1. Examination and Scoring a. Examine the slides under a
fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets for the
FISH probes used (e.g., dual/triple band-pass filters). b.
Analyze not fewer than 200 nuclei per sample. c. Document the
number and patterns of fluorescent signals (e.g., fused signals,
split signals, or extra signals) observed. d. Record findings and
interpretations in the laboratory notebook/log.
D) Interpretation of Results
1. Interpretation Criteria a. Identify the presence of expected
chromosomal abnormalities based on FISH probe design. b.
Criteria for positive result:
◦ RUNX1-RUNX1T1 translocation (e.g., observed in at least
5% of nuclei examined).
◦ Loss or gains of genetic material related to Myeloid
Sarcoma. c. Criteria for negative result:
◦ Appropriate distribution and number of probe signals
indicating no chromosomal aberrations related to Myeloid
Sarcoma. d. Include any additional notes on signal patterns
or artifacts.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform FISH with appropriate control tissues known to be
positive and negative for the target abnormalities.
• Include positive and negative control slides in each batch
processed.
• Ensure instrument calibration and maintenance is performed
regularly.
• Document and report any deviations from the protocol, and
corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile findings into a comprehensive report.
• Include patient demographics, specimen identification,
methodology, results, and interpretation based on FISH.
• Verify results by the technologist and review by the supervisor
before entering into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
