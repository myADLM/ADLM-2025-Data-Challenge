Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Generating Results
for Myeloma, High Risk with Reflex Probes, Diagnostic FISH
Evaluation, Fixed Cell Pellet
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for generating results from
myeloma, high-risk with reflex probes, diagnostic Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) evaluation using fixed cell pellets.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen:
• Preferred Specimen: Bone marrow aspirate (1-2 mL) collected in
a Sodium Heparin tube (green-top tube).
• Acceptable Specimen: Blood sample (minimum 5 mL) collected
in a Sodium Heparin tube.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens arriving more than 48
hours post-collection or those not in the appropriate collection
tubes.
• Specimen Transport: Transport specimens at room temperature
promptly to the lab ensuring minimal delay.
Preparation:
• Fixed Cell Pellet Preparation: Percoll density centrifugation to
isolate mononuclear cells, followed by fixation with appropriate
fixative (e.g., Carnoy's solution).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope capable of detecting probes.
• Class II Biosafety Cabinet (BSC)
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Fume Hood
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• FISH probes specific for Myeloma-related abnormalities.
• Slide warmer
• Sterile, filtered pipette tips
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Hybridization solution (as per FISH probe manufacturer’s
guidelines)
• Washing solutions (as per FISH probe manufacturer’s guidelines)
• Counter stains (e.g., DAPI)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Generation of Fixed Cell Pellet:
1. Bone marrow aspiration or blood collection: Collect
specimens in a Sodium Heparin tube.
2. Centrifugation: Perform density gradient centrifugation to
separate mononuclear cells.
3. Cell Fixation: Fix cells using Carnoy's solution.
4. Pellet Preparation: Concentrate fixed cells into a pellet.
B. Diagnostic FISH Evaluation:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Place a small aliquot of the fixed cell pellet onto a clean
microscope slide.
◦ Allow the slide to dry on a slide warmer at 37°C.
2. Denaturation and Hybridization:
◦ Denature the DNA on the slide by immersing in a
denaturation solution (as per manufacturer's instructions).
◦ Apply the selected FISH probe hybridization solution onto
the slide.
◦ Apply a coverslip and seal the edges.
◦ Incubate the slides in a humidified hybridization chamber at
the prescribed temperature (usually 37°C) for the
recommended duration (typically overnight).
3. Post-Hybridization Washes:
◦ Remove the coverslips and perform post-hybridization
washes as recommended by the FISH probe manufacturer
to remove unbound probes.
4. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply a DAPI counterstain to the slides.
◦ Cover with clean coverslips and allow drying before
analysis.
C. Microscopic Analysis:
1. Imaging:
◦ Use a fluorescence microscope to analyze the hybridized
FISH probes.
◦ Capture images of the cells showing fluorescent signals.
2. Scoring:
◦ Score at least 100-200 nuclei per sample for the presence
of probe signals.
◦ Identify and document any abnormalities noted (e.g.,
rearrangements, deletions, amplifications).
D. Reflex Testing:
1. Detection of Abnormalities:
◦ If initial FISH analysis reveals abnormalities associated with
high-risk myeloma, perform reflex testing using additional
specific probes.
2. Reflex Probes:
◦ Repeat the denaturation, hybridization, washing, and
microscopic analysis steps using the additional FISH
probes.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Data Recording:
◦ Document FISH results, including the percentage of nuclei
exhibiting abnormalities.
◦ Record the types of abnormalities found.
2. Result Review:
◦ A qualified technologist will review all results.
◦ In case of abnormal findings, ensure a second technologist
verifies the results.
3. Result Verification and Transmission:
◦ Review and verify results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Transmit verified results to the requesting physician.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Slide Validation:
◦ Include a positive and negative control slide with each
batch.
◦ The positive control slide ensures that FISH probe
hybridization and detection are functioning correctly.
◦ The negative control slide should have no fluorescent
signals, ensuring no contamination or non-specific binding.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate and maintain the fluorescence microscope as per
the manufacturer's recommendations.
