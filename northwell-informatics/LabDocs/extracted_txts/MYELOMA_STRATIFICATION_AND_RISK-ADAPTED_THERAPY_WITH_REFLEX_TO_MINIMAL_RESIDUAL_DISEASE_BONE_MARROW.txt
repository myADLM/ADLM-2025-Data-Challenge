Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Myeloma
Stratification and Risk-Adapted Therapy with Reflex to Minimal
Residual Disease, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide clear and precise steps for
the analytical phase of generating results for Myeloma Stratification
and Risk-Adapted Therapy with Reflex to Minimal Residual Disease
(MRD), Bone Marrow. This protocol ensures that the laboratory tests
are performed accurately, timely, and correctly to assist clinicians in
stratifying myeloma and adapting therapy, as well as determining
MRD.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff is responsible for carrying out the
analytical procedures outlined in this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedures are
followed accurately and for addressing any issues that arise
during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Bone marrow aspirate collected properly in EDTA tubes or other
accepted anticoagulant tubes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, coagulated, or improperly
labeled.
• Specimens in expired collection tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (e.g., Navios, BD FACSCanto)
• PCR equipment for gene rearrangement studies
• Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms for MRD
• Reagents for immunophenotyping and PCR
• Appropriate software for analysis
All equipment and reagents must be validated for accuracy and
precision before use.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated according to
manufacturer and lab guidelines.
2. Prepare bone marrow specimen by thoroughly mixing to avoid
clumping or coagulation.
3. Aliquot appropriate volumes for flow cytometry, PCR, and NGS
analysis.
B. Risk Stratification (Flow Cytometry Analysis)
1. Perform immunophenotyping using appropriate antibody panels
targeting specific markers for plasma cells (e.g., CD38,
CD138), determining clonality (e.g., kappa/lambda light chains),
and other relevant markers.
2. Record data and compare it with established criteria for risk
stratification.
3. Analyze the data using appropriate software and generate
stratification results.
C. Risk-Adapted Therapy Analysis
1. Assess gene expression profiles associated with therapy
response using qPCR or microarray-based platforms.
2. Identify genetic mutations or aberrations relevant to myeloma
(e.g., t(4;14), del(17p)).
3. Generate reports that indicate potential therapy adaptations
based on genetic profiles.
D. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Analysis
1. Perform NGS on bone marrow samples for sensitive detection
of residual myeloma cells.
2. Use specific MRD markers established in protocol (e.g., IgH
rearrangements).
3. Analyze sequence data and evaluate MRD presence based on
established thresholds.
E. Validation and Quality Control
1. Use internal and external quality control samples to validate
results.
2. Run parallel testing on another platform if necessary to verify
accuracy.
3. Document all results, QC procedures, equipment calibration,
and any corrective actions taken.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile data from flow cytometry, gene profiling, and MRD
analysis.
• Review and verify results prior to report generation.
• Provide detailed reports including all relevant markers, genetic
mutations, risk stratification outcomes, therapy recommendations,
and MRD status.
• Ensure reports are accessible by authorized clinical staff for
myeloma management.

Include references to:
• Manufacturer manuals for equipment used (e.g., Navios Flow
Cytometer, PCR setup)
• Peer-reviewed journals relevant to myeloma stratification, risk-
adapted therapies, and MRD analysis
• Clinical practice guidelines from relevant medical associations
