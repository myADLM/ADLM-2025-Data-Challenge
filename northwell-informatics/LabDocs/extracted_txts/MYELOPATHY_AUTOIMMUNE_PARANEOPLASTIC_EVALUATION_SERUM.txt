Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MYELOPATHY, AUTOIMMUNE/
PARANEOPLASTIC EVALUATION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process for the analytical phase of Myelopathy,
Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation in serum specimens,
ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the qualified laboratory personnel to perform
the outlined procedures accurately and ensure proper documentation
and reporting of results.
1. PROCEDURE
2.1 Test Principle: This evaluation assesses the presence of
autoantibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic
disorders affecting the spinal cord (myelopathy). It includes
comprehensive tests using immunoassays to detect specific
antibodies.
2.2 Required Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Immunoassay analyzer (specific model according to laboratory
standards)
• Microtiter plates
• Serum calibrators and controls
• Substrates and enzymes for the immunoassay reactions
• Wash buffer and other necessary reagents
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microplate reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Timer
Note: Follow manufacturers’ guidelines for all reagents and
equipment used in this procedure.
2.3 Specimen Requirements:
• Serum samples collected in appropriate collection tubes (e.g.,
SST - Serum Separator Tubes).
• Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 72 hours
of collection. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples with an insufficient volume.
• Clotted specimens or samples not collected in the proper tube.
2.4 Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are brought to room
temperature before use.
• Vortex serum samples to mix thoroughly before analysis.
2.5 Analytical Procedure:
A) Assay Preparation:
1. Prepare microtiter plate by adding the necessary buffers,
substrates, and other reagents according to the immunoassay
kit insert.
2. Use freshly prepared or properly stored calibrators and
controls.
B) Sample Application:
1. Add appropriate volume of serum sample (as specified by the
kit) to designated wells on the microtiter plate.
2. Include standard controls and calibrators on each plate for each
assay run.
C) Incubation and Washing:
1. Incubate the plate as specified by the assay kit. Typically, at
37°C for 1-2 hours or as directed.
2. Perform washing steps using wash buffer. Ensure that all
residual solution is thoroughly removed to avoid cross-
contamination.
D) Development:
1. Add substrate to each well, followed by the appropriate
incubation time.
2. Stop reaction with stop solution when specified color (usually
blue to yellow) is developed.
E) Reading and Interpretation:
1. Read the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader at
the specified wavelength, generally 450 nm.
2. Compare sample absorbance readings to standard curve
generated from calibrators.
2.6 Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of control (positive and negative) in
each run.
2. If control results fall outside established ranges, investigate,
and resolve the issue before proceeding with patient specimen
analysis.
2.7 Data Analysis:
1. Calculate results using the standard curve. Software associated
with the microplate reader may provide automatic calculations.
2. Verify results against known controls and observe for any
inconsistencies or aberrations.
2.8 Reporting Results:
1. Enter numerical results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Verify and validate results by experienced personnel.
3. Document any critical results and notify the responsible
healthcare provider in accordance with laboratory policy.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals may vary by assay and should align with those
provided by the reagent manufacturer or from laboratory-established
validation studies:
• Negative: Absence of specific autoantibodies.
• Indeterminate: Borderline positive results, consider repeating the
test or follow-up testing.
• Positive: Presence of specific autoantibodies indicating potential
autoimmune or paraneoplastic myelopathy. Further clinical
correlation required.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit inserts for specific limitations, including
potential cross-reactivity, sensitivity, and specificity.
5. DOCUMENTATION and REVIEW
• All procedures, calibrations, QC results, and patient results shall
be documented.
• Regular reviews of QC data and procedures shall be performed to
ensure ongoing compliance and accuracy.

This SOP must be regularly updated to reflect new methods,
reagents, and instrumentation in line with advances in laboratory
practice.
