Standard Operating Protocol for MYELOPATHY, AUTOIMMUNE/
PARANEOPLASTIC EVALUATION, SPINAL FLUID
1. Purpose:
To ensure the accurate and timely processing of spinal fluid
specimens for the diagnosis and evaluation of autoimmune/
paraneoplastic myelopathy.
2. Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document all analytical procedures as outlined in this
SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for monitoring
compliance and addressing any procedural deficiencies.
3. Definitions:
Myelopathy: A general term denoting functional/clinical disturbances
or pathologic changes in the spinal cord.
Autoimmune: A condition arising from an abnormal immune response
to a normal body part.
Paraneoplastic: A syndrome (collection of symptoms) that is the
consequence of cancer in the body, not due to the local presence of
cancer cells.
4. Specimen Requirements:
Preferred Specimen:
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) collected in sterile tubes (appropriate
volume: 1-5 mL per tube).
• Note: CSF should be kept at 2-8°C if not processed immediately
and should be processed within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or contaminated.
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled with patient
identification.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Luminex or equivalent)
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits for
autoimmune markers (e.g., anti-Hu, anti-Ri, anti-Yo antibodies)
• Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) substrates and slides if
applicable
• Control and calibration materials
• Sterile pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. Quality Control:
• Utilize commercial controls (normal and abnormal) to ensure test
precision and accuracy. Perform control testing at the beginning of
each analytical run.
• Any control results falling outside the established acceptable
range must be investigated, and appropriate corrective actions
must be documented.
7. Procedural Steps:
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen integrity and label accuracy.
2. Aliquot an appropriate volume (e.g., 200-500 µL) into a
microcentrifuge tube for each assay to be performed.
3. Centrifuge samples at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at 2-8°C.
B. Immunoassay Analysis:
1. Prepare the automated immunoassay analyzer by performing
daily maintenance and calibration as per manufacturer
instructions.
2. Load specimens, controls, and calibration materials onto the
analyzer.
3. If performing ELISA, prepare plate and reagents as per the kit
instructions.
4. Run the immunoassay following the specific protocol for each
antibody targeted. Document all steps taken.
5. For ELISA, after incubation and washing steps, measure
absorbance using a microplate reader set to the appropriate
wavelength.
C. Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) – if applicable:
1. Prepare and fix substrate slides from commercial kits.
2. Add patient and control sera to individual wells, incubate, wash,
and apply secondary conjugated antibody.
3. Visualize and record results using a fluorescent microscope.
8. Reporting Results:
• Ensure results are reviewed and validated by a designated
laboratory technologist.
• Report findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) with
appropriate reference ranges and interpretive comments on
clinical relevance.
• Critical results must be communicated to the requesting clinician
immediately and documented according to laboratory policy.
9. Method Limitations:
• Any limitations or factors that could interfere with the assay's
accuracy, including sample handling variations, incomplete
washing in ELISA, or improper calibration must be noted and
procedures followed to mitigate these risks.
• Refer to specific assay inserts for detailed limitations.
10. Documentation and Review:
• Log all procedural steps, test results, quality control data, and any
deviations or corrective actions in the appropriate logs/forms.
• Periodically review SOP and quality control data to ensure
procedure adherence and continuous improvement of assay
performance.

This SOP aims to provide a meticulous approach to clinically
essential assays and systematically document every aspect to
maintain compliance with regulatory standards. If you need a detailed
extraction procedure or have specific assay kits used, please provide
additional details to refine this protocol.
