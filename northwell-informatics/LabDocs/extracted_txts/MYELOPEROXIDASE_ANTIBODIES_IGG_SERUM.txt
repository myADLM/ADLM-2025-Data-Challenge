Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Procedure for Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Antibodies,
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and precise measurement of Myeloperoxidase
(MPO) Antibodies, IgG in serum samples using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or another validated method. This
SOP describes the step-by-step process to be followed during the
analytical phase, providing high-quality test results for clinical use.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to qualified laboratory personnel performing
the analysis of MPO Antibodies, IgG in serum samples within the
clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
a. Laboratory Personnel: Responsible for following the SOP and
ensuring proper handling, analysis, and documentation of results. b.
Laboratory Supervisor: Ensures compliance with the SOP, timely
maintenance of equipment, and resolution of any issues arising
during the analytical process.
1. DEFINITIONS
MPO (Myeloperoxidase) Antibodies, IgG: Autoantibodies directed
against the enzyme myeloperoxidase commonly used as a marker
for certain types of vasculitis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
prescribed wavelength.
• Incubator or water bath (for consistent temperature control during
incubation steps).
• Precision pipettes and disposable tips.
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge.
• Calibration and control material (traceable to reference standards
if available).
b. Reagents:
• MPO Antibodies ELISA Kit (commercially available, stored
according to manufacturer’s instructions).
• Calibrators and Controls provided with the ELISA kit.
c. Supplies:
• Microtiter plates.
• Wash buffer.
• Substrate solution.
• Stop solution.
• Sample diluent.
• Disposable gloves and lab coats.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before starting the assay (about 30 minutes).
2. Set up the microplate reader and ensure it is calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Confirm that serum samples have been prepared according to
the sample collection and preparation SOP.
2. Label all tubes, wells, and reagents clearly to avoid mix-up.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and diluted serum
sample to the respective wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Incubate the plate for the designated time at the prescribed
temperature (refer to the kit instructions, typically 1 hour at
37°C).
3. Wash the plate as recommended by the manufacturer, typically
3-5 times with wash buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate for the specified duration at the prescribed
temperature (refer to kit instructions).
6. Wash the plate as detailed above.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark for the time specified by the manufacturer (typically
15-30 minutes).
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well in the same order as
the substrate was added.
D. Measurement
1. Measure and record the absorbance at the specified
wavelength using the microplate reader (typically 450 nm with
reference wavelength at 620-630 nm).
E. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
1. Use the absorbance readings from the calibrators to generate a
standard curve.
2. Calculate the concentration of MPO Antibodies, IgG in the
serum samples based on the standard curve.
3. Interpret results according to established reference ranges
provided with the assay kit.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run quality control samples along with each batch of patient
samples. Accept/reject criteria should be based on standard
laboratory practices and kit specifications.
6. Document and review all quality control results. Investigate and
resolve any out-of-control results before reporting patient
results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
careful review and verification.
9. Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting and notification of
critical values if applicable.
10. MAINTENANCE
11. Regularly perform maintenance on equipment according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
12. Maintain records of maintenance, calibration, and any
troubleshooting performed.
