Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
Myeloperoxidase Antibody, Serum (MPO Antibody, Serum)
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytic phase of testing
Myeloperoxidase Antibody, Serum (MPO Ab, Serum) to ensure
accurate and reliable results. This procedure includes guidelines for
sample preparation, equipment use, reagent handling, analysis,
quality control, and result reporting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum from a collected blood sample, ideally 5 mL, in a serum
separator tube (SST).
Specimen Stability:
• Store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or heparin tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA or
Chemiluminescence Immunoassay)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Vortex mixer
Reagents and Supplies:
• MPO Antibody-specific assay kit (follow manufacturer's
instructions)
• Quality control material (negative and positive controls)
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Lab consumables (e.g., pipette tips, reaction tubes)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood sample in an SST at 3000 RPM
for 10 minutes to separate the serum.
2. Carefully transfer the serum into a clean, properly labeled
aliquot tube.
B) Loading Samples and Reagents:
1. Turn on the automated immunoassay analyzer and perform
necessary system checks.
2. Load MPO Ab assay kit reagents into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's protocol.
3. Load patient serum samples and quality control materials into
the designated positions on the analyzer.
C) Running the Assay:
1. Initiate the run by selecting the MPO Ab assay on the analyzer's
menu.
2. Ensure that all sample and reagent loading steps are correctly
followed to avoid any cross-contamination.
3. The analyzer will automatically add the required volumes of
reagents to the patient samples and controls, incubate, and
measure the reaction.
D) Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Retrieve the results from the assay analyzer after the
completion of the run.
2. Review all quality control data to ensure that they are within
acceptable ranges before validating patient results.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Perform a two-level quality control (QC) check with each assay
run using negative and positive control materials.
5. Results for control samples must fall within the predefined
acceptable ranges provided by the reagent manufacturer.
6. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken in the
QC logbook.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Review all patient results for consistency and accuracy.
9. Enter test results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
10. Report any critical values promptly to the ordering physician
according to laboratory protocol.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
12. If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, perform the
following steps:
◦ Re-calibrate the analyzer if necessary.
◦ Re-run the QC samples.
◦ If QC failure persists, troubleshoot according to the
analyzer's manual and consult with the supervisor.
13. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the analyzer as
per the manufacturer's guidelines.
