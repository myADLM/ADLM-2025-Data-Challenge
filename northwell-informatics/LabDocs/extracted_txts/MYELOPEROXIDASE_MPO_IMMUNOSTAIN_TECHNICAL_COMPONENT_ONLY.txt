Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Myeloperoxidase (MPO)
Immunostain - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing Myeloperoxidase (MPO)
immunostain on histological or cytological specimens in order to
achieve consistent and reliable staining results for diagnostic
purposes.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
carry out MPO immunostaining in accordance with this SOP.
• All staff must ensure that the procedure is followed meticulously to
ensure accurate and reproducible results.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
• Cytological specimens fixed in alcohol or similar fixatives and
processed on slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are inadequately fixed or poorly processed.
• Specimens with excessive autolysis or fixation artifacts.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• MPO primary antibody (Ensure it is within expiry date and
properly stored)
• Secondary antibody reagent kit (Envision+/HRP, DAKO, or
equivalent)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (pH 7.4)
• Moist Chamber or antibody incubator
• Chromogenic substrate (DAB or equivalent)
• Hematoxylin or alternative counterstain
• Xylene
• Ethanol (70%, 95%, and 100%)
• Mounting media
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Humidified chamber for antibody incubation
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Incubator (37°C)
• Hot plate or drying oven
• Paraffin dispensing center
• Automated or manual staining system
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Section paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at 3-4 microns
thickness and place sections on positively charged glass slides.
2. Bake slides on a hot plate or an oven at 60°C for 1 hour to
ensure adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections with three changes of xylene for 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through graded ethanol: 100%, 95%, and
70% for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval (if required based on manufacturer's
instructions):
1. Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (citrate
buffer pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer pH 9.0) and perform heat-
mediated antigen retrieval by microwaving at high power for
10-20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool down to room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes.
D. Staining Procedure:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3. Apply the primary MPO antibody to the slides, ensuring
complete tissue coverage, and incubate in a humidified
chamber for 30 minutes at room temperature.
4. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5-minute changes.
5. Apply the secondary antibody reagent to the slides and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5-minute changes.
7. Apply chromogen (DAB or equivalent) solution to the slides and
incubate for 5-10 minutes or until optimal staining is achieved.
8. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
9. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1 minute, followed by a
brief wash in running tap water.
10. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol: 70%, 95%, and
100% for 2 minutes each.
11. Clear sections in xylene for 2 x 5-minute changes.
E. Mounting:
1. Mount coverslips onto slides using an appropriate mounting
medium.
2. Allow slides to dry thoroughly before viewing under a
microscope.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run
to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of the results.
• Record the batch number and expiry date of all reagents used in
the procedure.
• Verify that the control slides exhibit appropriate staining patterns:
◦ Positive control should show dark brown MPO staining in
granulocytes.
◦ Negative control (primary antibody omitted) should show no
staining.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If staining is weak, increase the incubation time for the primary or
secondary antibody.
• If background staining is high, optimize blocking steps or increase
washing times.
• Ensure antibody dilution and incubation conditions are consistent
with the manufacturer's recommendations.
1. STORAGE AND HANDLING
• Store all reagents according to manufacturer instructions.
• Properly label and document all reagents and slides.
• Handle all biological samples and hazardous chemicals with
appropriate safety measures, including the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Stained slides are interpreted by a qualified pathologist.
• Record findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
ensure proper documentation.

This SOP should be revised periodically to incorporate any changes
in methodology, instrumentation, or reagents, and to address any
troubleshooting insights gained through routine practice.
