Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Stain
1. PURPOSE
This protocol aims to standardize the procedure for staining and
analyzing myeloperoxidase (MPO) in blood or bone marrow smears.
This helps ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results used in
diagnosing and distinguishing between various types of leukemia and
other hematologic disorders.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing, documenting, and analyzing MPO stains as defined in
this procedure. It is the responsibility of all personnel to identify and
report any deficiencies in staining that may affect test results and
notify a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Peripheral blood or bone marrow smear slides prepared with
freshly obtained blood/bone marrow aspirate.
Unacceptable:
• Smears with excessive drying or smears prepared more than 24
hours prior to staining.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Light microscope with appropriate objectives
• MPO staining kit (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific)
• Freshly prepared smears
• Coplin jars for staining
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Timer
• Positive and negative controls
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Ensure smears are properly labeled and dry.
• Use positive and negative control slides for each batch of
staining.
Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare staining reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
Staining Process:
1. Flood the smear slide with the MPO staining solution and
incubate in a Coplin jar at 37°C for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides gently with distilled water to remove excess stain.
3. Apply counterstain if indicated by the staining kit instructions
and let sit for 2-3 minutes.
4. Rinse again with distilled water.
5. Allow slides to air dry.
Microscopic Examination:
1. Examine stained smears under the light microscope at 40x,
100x, and oil immersion (1000x) objectives.
2. Identify and count MPO-positive cells, characterized by distinct
blue-green granules in the cytoplasm.
Quality Control and Validation:
1. Ensure each staining batch includes appropriate positive and
negative control slides.
2. Compare stained slides against established control slides to
verify staining quality.
3. If the control slides do not show expected results, repeat the
staining procedure.
4. Document control results along with the patient sample results.
Documentation:
• Record patient details, staining date, time, microscope used, and
results.
• Enter results into laboratory information system (LIS) and verify.
Reporting Results:
• Results of MPO staining should indicate the percentage of MPO-
positive cells counted, and any relevant comments regarding
staining quality or cell morphology.
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for documentation and reporting.
Method Limitations:
• The intensity and distribution of MPO staining may vary
depending on sample quality and preparation.
• Hematological discrepancies should be correlated with clinical
findings and other diagnostic tests.
References:
• Package insert and detailed instructions for MPO staining kit
used.
• Laboratory's specific quality control guidelines for MPO staining.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS AND ALERT VALUES
Critical results should be promptly communicated to the attending
physician or responsible healthcare provider following laboratory
policy. Ensure proper documentation of communication in the LIS.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure
compliance with new regulations, updated recommendations, or
changes in method or materials.
