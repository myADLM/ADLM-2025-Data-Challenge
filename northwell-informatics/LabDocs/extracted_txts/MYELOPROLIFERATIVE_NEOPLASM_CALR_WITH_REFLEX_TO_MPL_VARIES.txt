Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, CALR with
Reflex to MPL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for analyzing samples for CALR
gene mutations in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and, if
CALR mutations are negative, the reflex testing for MPL mutations.
This protocol ensures that all steps are performed consistently and
accurately, ensuring reliable and reproducible results.
Responsibility: All technical staff and laboratory personnel trained in
molecular diagnostics and genetic testing techniques are responsible
for following this SOP. The supervising molecular pathologist or
laboratory director is responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any deviations from the protocol.
1. DEFINITIONS
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs): A group of blood cancers that
cause an overproduction of blood cells in the bone marrow. CALR
Gene Mutation: Mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene associated
with MPNs. MPL Gene Mutation: Mutations in the myeloproliferative
leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) gene associated with MPNs.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Preparation
a. Preferred Specimen Type: Peripheral blood or bone marrow
aspirate collected in EDTA (lavender top tube).
• Minimum volume requirement: 5 mL peripheral blood or 2 mL
bone marrow aspirate.
• Specimen stability: Process within 72 hours of collection if stored
at 2-8°C. b. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens collected in other anticoagulants.
• Contaminated or hemolyzed specimens. c. Specimen
Preparation:
• Perform preliminary quality check for specimen integrity.
• Extract DNA using a suitable genomic DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
B. DNA Extraction
a. Follow the DNA extraction protocol specific to the kit being used in
the laboratory. b. Quantify DNA concentration using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer or equivalent. c. Adjust DNA concentration to
10-50 ng/µL for PCR analysis.
C. PCR Amplification and Mutation Detection for CALR Gene
a. PCR Setup:
• Set up a PCR master mix containing: i. PCR buffer ii. dNTP mix iii.
Forward and reverse primers for CALR exon 9 iv. DNA
polymerase v. Nuclease-free water
• Add DNA template to the master mix. b. PCR Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
• 35 cycles of: i. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds ii. Annealing:
60°C for 30 seconds iii. Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes c. Analysis of PCR Products:
• Run PCR products on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium
bromide or use alternative visualization methods.
• Visualize bands under UV light and document results. d.
Interpretation:
• If CALR mutation is detected, record and report the result.
• If no CALR mutation is detected, proceed to reflex testing for MPL
mutations.
D. Reflex PCR Amplification and Mutation Detection for MPL Gene
a. PCR Setup:
• Set up a PCR master mix containing: i. PCR buffer ii. dNTP mix iii.
Forward and reverse primers for MPL exon 10 iv. DNA
polymerase v. Nuclease-free water
• Add DNA template to the master mix. b. PCR Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
• 35 cycles of: i. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds ii. Annealing:
58°C for 30 seconds iii. Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes c. Analysis of PCR Products:
• Run PCR products on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium
bromide or use alternative visualization methods.
• Visualize bands under UV light and document results. d.
Interpretation:
• If MPL mutation is detected, record and report the result.
• If no MPL mutation is detected, report as negative for CALR and
MPL mutations.
E. Quality Control
a. Use positive and negative control samples in each PCR run to
ensure assay performance. b. Document all control results and
ensure they fall within acceptable ranges. c. Investigate and resolve
any control failures before releasing patient results.
F. Reporting Results
a. Review and verify all PCR and mutation analysis results. b. Record
findings in the laboratory information system (LIS). c. Report results
following site-specific guidelines.
• Positive CALR mutation result.
• Negative CALR mutation result with reflex to MPL testing.
• Positive or negative MPL mutation result.
G. Limitations
a. This assay detects only the known mutations in CALR exon 9 and
MPL exon 10. b. Mutations in other regions or genes will not be
detected. c. Ensure proper handling and processing of specimens to
avoid contamination and ensure DNA integrity.
