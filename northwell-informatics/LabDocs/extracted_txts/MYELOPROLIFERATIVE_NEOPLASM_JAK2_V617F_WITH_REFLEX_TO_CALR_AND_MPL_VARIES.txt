Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASM, JAK2 V617F WITH
REFLEX TO CALR AND MPL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation, and reflex testing for CALR
and MPL mutations in patients suspected of having myeloproliferative
neoplasms. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable results that
aid in the diagnosis and treatment planning for these patients.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing molecular diagnostic tests for myeloproliferative
neoplasms.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for executing each
step of the procedure, recording results, performing quality
control, and maintaining equipment.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing, validating, and
documenting the final results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type:
◦ Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (purple-top) tubes.
Specimen Stability:
◦ Blood specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
Specimens should be processed within this timeframe to
ensure accuracy of results.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ PCR cycler and associated consumables.
◦ JAK2 V617F mutation detection kit.
◦ CALR and MPL mutation detection kits for reflex testing.
◦ Nucleic acid extraction kit.
◦ Disposable pipette tips with aerosol barriers.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Thermal Cycler.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for nucleic acid
extraction from peripheral blood.
◦ Ensure that extracted DNA is of high purity and
concentration (measured by spectrophotometry).
B. Primary Analysis - JAK2 V617F Detection
◦ Prepare PCR master mix as per the JAK2 V617F mutation
detection kit manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Amplify target DNA as per prescribed thermal cycler
settings: initial denaturation, cycling steps (denaturation,
annealing, extension), and final hold.
◦ Analyse PCR products using appropriate detection methods
(e.g., gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR).
C. Reflex Analysis - CALR and MPL Detection
◦ If the JAK2 V617F mutation is negative, proceed to reflex
testing for CALR and MPL: a. CALR Mutation Detection: -
Prepare PCR master mix as per the CALR mutation
detection kit instructions. - Perform thermal cycling and
post-PCR analysis. b. MPL Mutation Detection: - Prepare
PCR master mix as per the MPL mutation detection kit
instructions. - Perform thermal cycling and post-PCR
analysis.
D. Result Interpretation and Reporting
◦ Interpret results based on the manufacturer’s guidelines and
established laboratory protocols.
◦ Document findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Validate and verify results with a designated supervisor
before reporting.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of
testing.
◦ For each new lot of reagents and kits, perform validation
according to internal quality control guidelines.
◦ Record all quality control results and follow up on any
deviations as necessary.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
◦ Fax or electronically transmit results to the referring
physician following internal reporting guidelines.
◦ Ensure that reflex test results are clearly documented.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
◦ JAK2 V617F mutation: Not detected; Detected.
◦ CALR mutation: Type 1; Type 2; Not detected.
◦ MPL mutation: Not detected; Detected.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure the specimen is properly stored and processed
within the stability timeframe.
◦ Refer to the kit inserts for limitations regarding sensitivity,
specificity, and potential interfering substances.
8. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instruction manuals for JAK2, CALR, and
MPL mutation detection kits.
◦ Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of
myeloproliferative neoplasms.
9. DOCUMENT CONTROL
◦ This SOP will be reviewed annually or upon introduction of
new equipment, reagents, or significant procedural changes.
◦ Changes must be documented and approved by the
supervisory staff before implementation.
