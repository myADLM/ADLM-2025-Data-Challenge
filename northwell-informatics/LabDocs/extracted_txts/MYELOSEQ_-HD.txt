Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Results using
MYELOSEQ™-HD
1. Purpose:
This SOP outlines the procedure for generating results using the
MYELOSEQ™-HD assay, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) test
for detecting mutations in myeloid malignancies. The goal is to
ensure accurate, reliable results while maintaining high standards of
quality control and documentation.
1. Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document all steps of this protocol. Supervisors will review and
ensure adherence to the procedures, including the performance of
necessary corrective actions.
1. Specimen Requirements:
An appropriate specimen (bone marrow aspirate, whole blood) must
be collected, received, and accessioned prior to analysis. Ensure that
the specimen meets the required criteria and condition before
proceeding with the MYELOSEQ™-HD assay.
1. Materials and Equipment:
• MYELOSEQ™-HD Assay Kit
• Reagents and consumables as specified in the kit manual
• Sequencing instrument compatible with MYELOSEQ™-HD
• Appropriate pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Thermal cycler
• Automated NGS library preparation system (if applicable)
• Clean work surfaces, including PCR workstations
1. Procedure:
A. Specimen Preparation:
• Lysate Preparation: Follow the specific instructions provided in the
MYELOSEQ™-HD Assay Kit manual for extracting DNA from the
bone marrow or blood sample.
• DNA Quality and Quantification: Use spectrophotometric and
fluorometric methods to assess DNA concentration and purity.
Ensure the extracted DNA meets the kit-specific criteria for purity
and concentration.
B. Library Preparation:
• Library Construction: Utilize the MYELOSEQ™-HD library
preparation protocol as per kit instructions. Adhere strictly to
recommended incubation times and temperatures.
• Quantification and Quality Check: Assess the quality and
concentration of the prepared libraries using a microfluidic
electrophoresis system (e.g., Bioanalyzer). Ensure the library
meets the specified criteria in the MYELOSEQ™-HD
documentation.
C. Sequencing:
• Load the prepared library into the sequencer according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Run the sequencing instrument following the standard operation
procedure specific to the sequencer.
D. Data Analysis:
• Primary Analysis: Utilize software provided with the sequencing
platform to perform primary data analysis, including base calling
and quality score assignment.
• Secondary Analysis: Use the MYELOSEQ™-HD analysis
software to map and align sequences, detect variants, and
generate the mutation report.
• Quality Control: Review quality metrics and confirm that
sequencing quality (e.g., coverage, read depth) meets the criteria
specified in the MYELOSEQ™-HD manual.
E. Interpretation and Reporting:
• Validate Results: Cross-check variants against internal databases
and published literature to validate clinical significance.
• Annotate and Interpret: Utilize clinical guidelines and decision
support software to annotate findings, providing insights into the
clinical relevance of detected mutations.
• Report Generation: Generate a comprehensive report including
detected mutations, their clinical significance, and recommended
follow-up actions. Ensure the report follows institutional protocols
for format and content.
1. Quality Control and Assurance:
◦ Run external and internal controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Document all steps, including deviations from the protocol,
and corrective actions taken.
◦ Maintain thorough logs of instrument runs, reagent lots, and
any maintenance activities.
◦ Regularly review protocols and update as necessary based
on new guidelines or internal audits.
2. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all analytical phase documentation is complete and
accurate.
◦ Maintain logs of specimen preparation, library preparation,
sequencing runs, analyses, and reports.
◦ Upload the results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and ensure timely verification and release by
authorized personnel.
3. Corrective Actions:
◦ In the event of non-conformance (e.g., QC failure, abnormal
metrics), perform root cause analysis and document
corrective steps.
◦ Re-run samples if necessary, ensuring that new controls are
in place.
