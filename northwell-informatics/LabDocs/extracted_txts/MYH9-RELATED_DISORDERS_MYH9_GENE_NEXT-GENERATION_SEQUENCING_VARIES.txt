Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of MYH9-
RELATED DISORDERS, MYH9 GENE, NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING
1. Purpose To outline the standard procedures for analyzing
MYH9 gene sequences in patients with MYH9-related disorders
using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, ensuring
the accuracy and reliability of reported results.
2. Scope This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible
for the processing and analysis of NGS data for MYH9-related
disorders.
3. Responsibility
• The Clinical Laboratory Director is responsible for ensuring
adherence to the SOP.
• Laboratory Technologists/Scientists are responsible for executing
the procedures as described.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any discrepancies or
issues to a supervisor immediately.
1. Specimen Information Assume that the blood or tissue
samples have been collected, received, and accessioned. DNA
extraction has been completed prior to this procedure.
2. Procedure
A. DNA Library Preparation
1. Quantification and Quality Check
◦ Use a fluorometric method (e.g., Qubit) to quantify DNA.
◦ Assess DNA quality using agarose gel electrophoresis or a
fragment analyzer.
◦ Record DNA concentration and quality metrics.
2. Library Construction
◦ Normalize DNA to the required concentration (e.g., 10 ng/μl)
as per the library preparation kit protocol.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instruction specific for NGS library
preparation (e.g., Illumina or Ion Torrent).
◦ Include all necessary controls (positive, negative) and
ensure proper indexing.
3. Quality Control
◦ Assess the quantity and quality of the constructed library
using a suitable method (e.g., Qubit, Bioanalyzer).
◦ Only proceed if the library meets the specified quality
metrics.
B. Sequencing
1. Loading Samples
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines to load the prepared
libraries onto the sequencing platform.
◦ Utilize proper pipetting techniques to prevent contamination.
2. Sequencing Run
◦ Initiate a sequencing run following instrument presets and
protocols.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for any alerts or system errors.
3. Data Quality Check
◦ Perform quality control checks on the sequencing run data
using analysis software (e.g., FastQC).
◦ Criteria for high-quality data include Q-scores, read length,
percentage of reads passing filter, and overall yield.
C. Data Analysis
1. Alignment and Variant Calling
◦ Use bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, GATK) to align
sequencing reads to the reference genome (GRCh38/hg38).
◦ Perform variant calling to identify deviations from the
reference sequence.
2. Data Filtering
◦ Apply relevant filters to retain high-confidence variants (e.g.,
depth of coverage > 20x, variant allele frequency > 20%).
◦ Annotate variants using a variant annotation tool (e.g.,
ANNOVAR, VEP).
3. Variant Interpretation
◦ Interpret variants based on established databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD) and guidelines (ACMG).
◦ Evaluate pathogenicity in the context of the patient’s clinical
presentation.
D. Reporting Results
1. Report Generation
◦ Generate a draft report including patient details, observed
variants, and their clinical significance.
◦ Present findings in a clear, concise manner, ensuring
scientific accuracy and correctness.
2. Quality Control Review
◦ Have a second qualified scientist independently review the
data and the draft report.
◦ Confirm accuracy and completeness before finalizing the
report.
3. Final Review and Sign-Out
◦ The Clinical Laboratory Director will review and sign out the
final report.
◦ Ensure timely delivery of the report to the requesting
clinician.
4. Documentation and Record Keeping
◦ Store all analysis records, raw data, and reports securely in
accordance with laboratory guidelines.
◦ Ensure confidentiality and data protection protocols are
adhered to.
5. Quality Control and Troubleshooting
• Regularly calibrate and maintain sequencing equipment as per
manufacturer recommendations.
• Participate in external proficiency testing (e.g., CAP, EMQN) for
NGS.
• Document and resolve any discrepancies or errors in data
analysis promptly.
1. References
• Latest relevant publications and guidelines on NGS data analysis
and variant interpretation.
• Instrument-specific standard manuals and manufacturer's
instructions.
1. Review and Revision
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to remain current with technological advances and regulatory
standards.
This protocol should provide a complete guide to generating and
reporting accurate results for MYH9-related disorders using NGS.
Ensure all lab personnel are properly trained and familiar with this
SOP prior to performing any tasks outlined within it.
