Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: MYOD1 Mutation
Analysis using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) in Tumor
Samples
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for MYOD1 mutation analysis using
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) in tumor specimens. This
SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results in the
detection of MYOD1 mutations using NGS technology in a
clinical laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the NGS
procedures following this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the NGS
processes ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
MYOD1: Myogenic differentiation 1, a gene involved in
myogenesis, the process of muscle cell formation. NGS: Next-
Generation Sequencing, an advanced sequencing technology
that allows for rapid sequencing of large fragments of DNA.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type:
• Tumor tissue (fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE))
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Fresh or frozen tissue: Transport in sterile containers on ice. Store
at -80°C if processing is delayed.
• FFPE tissue blocks: Store at room temperature.
• Ensure proper labeling with patient information, collection date,
and time.
• FFPE tissue sections must be on uncharged microscope slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation.
• Specimens showing signs of contamination or degradation.
• Specimens frozen and thawed more than once.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome for FFPE specimens
• Sterile containers for fresh/frozen tissues
• DNA extraction kits (specific to the type of tissue)
• Quantification equipment (e.g., Qubit fluorometer)
• NGS library preparation kits
• Illumina or equivalent NGS platform
• PCR reagents and thermocycler
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis
1. PROCEDURE A) DNA Extraction and Quality Control:
2. FFPE Tissue: a. Deparaffinize slides using xylene and ethanol.
b. Scrape and collect tissue into microcentrifuge tubes. c.
Perform DNA extraction using appropriate FFPE DNA
extraction kit.
3. Fresh/Frozen Tissue: a. Homogenize tissue using a mechanical
tissue homogenizer. b. Extract DNA using appropriate tissue
DNA extraction kit.
4. Quantify DNA using Qubit fluorometer and assess purity by
measuring A260/A280 ratio using a spectrophotometer.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Fragment the DNA to the desired size using sonication or
enzymatic digestion.
2. Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation following the
NGS library preparation kit instructions.
3. Purify the prepared library using magnetic beads.
4. Quantify and assess library quality using Agilent Bioanalyzer or
equivalent.
C) Sequencing:
1. Load libraries onto Illumina or equivalent NGS platform
following manufacturer instructions.
2. Perform sequencing run ensuring correct machine and reagent
settings.
3. Monitor run and address any alerts or warnings generated by
the sequencing instrument.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Use bioinformatics software to analyze raw sequencing data.
2. Align reads to the reference genome and identify MYOD1
mutations.
3. Validate identified mutations using appropriate algorithms.
4. Interpret results and generate a comprehensive report including
variant annotation and clinical significance.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative controls during DNA
extraction and library preparation steps.
• Perform internal quality controls as per NGS platform
recommendations.
• Review sequencing quality metrics and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
• Document all QC results and any deviations along with corrective
actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Result the identified variants using predefined mutation
nomenclature.
• Include recommendations for further clinical actions if needed.
• Verify and sign off by the laboratory technologist.
• Supervisory review and signature for final report release.
