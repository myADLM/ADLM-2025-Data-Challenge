Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MYOGENIC
DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGEN 1 (MYOD1) Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical protocols for performing the MYOGENIC
DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGEN 1 (MYOD1) immunostain, technical
component only. This procedure ensures consistency, accuracy, and
reliability in the immunohistochemical staining of MYOD1 on formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Responsibility:
• The laboratory staff are responsible for the proper execution of
the MYOD1 immunostaining procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the supervising pathologist to review and
interpret the results.
1. DEFINITION
MYOD1 Immunostain: An immunohistochemical method used to
detect MYOD1 protein expression in tissue sections. This technique
is essential for identifying myogenic cells in various tissue samples.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Optimal tissue section thickness: 4-5 microns
• Unstained slides to be prepared and handled according to
standard laboratory protocols
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Primary antibody: Anti-MYOD1
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate secondary antibody conjugated
with a detection enzyme or fluorochrome
• Detection system: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) or other suitable
chromogen
• Buffer solutions: PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline), pH 7.4
• Blocking solution
• Enzyme digestion or antigen retrieval solution
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide stainer (automated or manual setup)
• Microscope
• Coverslipper
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Cut 4-5 micron thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks.
2. Place sections on charged slides and incubate at 58-60°C for 1
hour or overnight at 37°C to ensure adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes, repeat twice.
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols: 100% ethanol for 5
minutes, 95% ethanol for 5 minutes, 70% ethanol for 5 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using
appropriate buffer solution (e.g., citrate or EDTA buffer, pH 6.0
or 9.0).
2. Heat slides in retrieval solution using a microwave, pressure
cooker, or water bath for specified duration as per reagent
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Allow slides to cool in retrieval solution, then rinse in PBS.
D. Blocking
1. Incubate slides in blocking solution for 10-20 minutes to block
non-specific binding sites.
2. Wash slides in PBS.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply primary MYOD1 antibody to the tissue sections.
2. Incubate in a humidified chamber for the time specified by the
antibody manufacturer, typically 60 minutes at room
temperature.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Apply appropriate secondary antibody to the sections.
2. Incubate for the time suggested by the vendor.
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4. Apply the enzyme conjugate and incubate.
5. Rinse slides in PBS.
G. Chromogen Application
1. Apply DAB or another suitable chromogen to tissue sections.
2. Incubate until the desired intensity of staining is achieved.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water.
3. Differentiate in acid alcohol if needed.
4. Rinse in running tap water until blue.
I. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate through graded alcohols: 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol,
100% ethanol, and clear in xylene.
2. Mount coverslips with a suitable mounting medium.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each run to
validate the staining results.
• Monitor the performance of reagents and staining equipment
regularly.
• Document all Quality Control (QC) results for review and quality
assurance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Once the staining is completed, the slides should be reviewed by
a certified pathologist or trained technician.
• Results (staining intensity and distribution) must be documented
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Technical component only: The pathologist will interpret and
report clinical significance separately.
