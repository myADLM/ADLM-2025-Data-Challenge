Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MYOGENIN
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the technical performance of
Myogenin Immunostaining, ensuring accurate and reproducible
results for diagnostic interpretation.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to strictly
adhere to this procedure, maintain the quality control standards, and
ensure proper documentation throughout the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not fixed in formalin.
• Specimens with incomplete fixation.
• Frozen tissue sections.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Myogenin primary antibody (mouse monoclonal, typically at a
concentration of 1:50 to 1:100 dilution)
• Blocking reagent (e.g., normal serum or protein block)
• Secondary antibody (e.g., anti-mouse IgG conjugated with biotin)
• DAB substrate (3,3'-diaminobenzidine)
• Mounting medium
• Hematoxylin solution for counterstaining
Supplies:
• Positive control slides
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Humidified chamber
• Coplin jars or staining dishes
• Coverslips and mounting media
Equipment:
• Automated immunostainer (optional)
• Incubator
• Light microscope
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation: 4.1. Sectioning
• Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 4 µm thick sections using a
microtome.
• Place sections on positively charged microscope slides.
• Bake slides at 60°C for at least 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion.
4.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
• Rehydrate sections through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%, 50%) and finally into distilled water for 5 minutes each.
4.3. Antigen Retrieval
• Perform antigen retrieval by heating sections in a citrate buffer
solution (pH 6.0) in a microwave or pressure cooker for 10-20
minutes.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
Immunostaining: 4.4. Blocking
• Incubate sections with a blocking reagent for 10 minutes at room
temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
• Tap off excess blocking reagent.
4.5. Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply Myogenin primary antibody to the sections, ensuring
complete coverage.
• Incubate in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C.
4.6. Washing
• Wash slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) for 3x5 minutes.
4.7. Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply secondary antibody (e.g., anti-mouse IgG-biotin) to the
sections.
• Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
4.8. Washing
• Wash slides in PBS or TBS for 3x5 minutes.
4.9. Chromogenic Detection
• Apply DAB substrate to the sections.
• Incubate for 5-10 minutes, monitoring the development of the
brown color.
4.10. Counterstaining
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in tap water.
4.11. Dehydration and Mounting
• Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
• Mount coverslips using mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a positive and negative control with each batch of tests for
quality assurance.
• Ensure appropriate staining of positive control slide and no
staining on the negative control slide.
• Document all findings and any deviations from protocols.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inadequate staining: Check antibody concentrations, incubation
times, and antigen retrieval methods.
• Non-specific staining: Increase blocking incubation time or modify
primary or secondary antibody concentrations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results from stain interpretation are not required under the
technical component. Ensure slides are prepared and stained
properly before sending to the pathologist for diagnostic
interpretation.
• Record any notable observations and staining quality for each
batch.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's datasheet of the Myogenin antibody.
• Laboratory Immunohistochemistry guidelines and protocols.
• Relevant peer-reviewed publications.
All laboratory staff must ensure adherence to this SOP and report
any inconsistencies or issues to the supervisor immediately for
review and corrective action if necessary.
