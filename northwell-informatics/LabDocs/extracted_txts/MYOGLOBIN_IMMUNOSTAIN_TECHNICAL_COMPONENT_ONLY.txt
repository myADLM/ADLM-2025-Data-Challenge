Protocol for Myoglobin Immunostain - Technical Component
Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for performing the
immunohistochemical staining of myoglobin in tissue sections to
ensure consistent and accurate results. This standard operating
procedure should be followed for generating results for Myoglobin
Immunostain, Technical Component Only.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the technical aspect of myoglobin immunostaining, ensuring all steps
are followed according to this procedure. Supervisors must review
and ensure adherence to this SOP.
3. DEFINITIONS
Immunohistochemistry (IHC): A laboratory method used to visualize
the presence of specific antigens in tissues using labeled antibodies.
Myoglobin: A muscle protein that binds oxygen; its presence in
tissues can help diagnose muscle-related diseases.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Forceps
• Immunostaining workstation
• Microscope
• Coverslips
• Slides
• Antigen Retrieval Solution (Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0, or specified
buffer for myoglobin antibody)
• Blocking Solution (Normal Serum or Protein Block)
• Primary Antibody: Anti-Myoglobin
• Secondary Antibody (Biotinylated anti-IgG for the primary
antibody used)
• Detection Reagents (DAB Substrate Kit or equivalent)
• Counterstain (Hematoxylin)
• Mounting Medium
• Control Tissues: Positive and negative controls
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
cut at 4-5 microns.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Sectioning
◦ Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a 45ºC water bath and mount on positively
charged slides.
◦ Dry slides on a slide warmer at 37ºC overnight or at 60ºC for
1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 changes, 3 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 changes, 2 minutes each.
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 minute.
◦ 70% ethanol, 1 minute.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval in a microwave or pressure
cooker using Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0 for 15-20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) twice for 5 minutes each.
D. Blocking
1. Incubate slides with blocking solution for 10 minutes at room
temperature to block nonspecific binding sites.
2. Drain excess blocking solution.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply primary antibody (Anti-Myoglobin) diluted according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature or as recommended by
the antibody manufacturer.
3. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply biotinylated secondary antibody.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
G. Detection
1. Apply DAB substrate or equivalent chromogen.
2. Incubate until the desired stain intensity develops, monitoring
microscopically (typically 3-10 minutes).
3. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
H. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
2. Rinse immediately in running tap water.
I. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols:
◦ 70% ethanol, 1 minute.
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 minute.
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 changes, 1 minute each.
2. Clear in xylene, 2 changes, 3 minutes each.
3. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative control slides with each
batch of staining.
2. Ensure the positive control tissue shows appropriate reactivity,
and the negative control remains unstained.
3. Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
8. RESULTS REVIEW
1. Results generated must be reviewed by a qualified pathologist
for interpretation.
2. Ensure all staining is complete and consistent across all
specimens and controls before releasing results.
9. RECORD KEEPING
1. Maintain records of all reagents used, including lot numbers
and expiration dates.
2. Document details of specimen processing, staining runs, and
quality control outcomes.

11. REVISION HISTORY
Maintain documentation of any revisions to this SOP with dates and a
summary of changes made.
By ensuring adherence to this SOP, consistent and reliable results for
myoglobin immunostaining can be achieved, supporting accurate
diagnosis and treatment decisions.
