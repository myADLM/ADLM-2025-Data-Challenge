Standard Operating Procedure for Myoglobin, Plasma Analysis
1. PURPOSE This document outlines the procedure for the
analytical phase of myoglobin analysis in plasma to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists/technicians are responsible for
conducting myoglobin, plasma analysis according to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the implementation of
and adherence to this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected in a heparinized tube (green-top) or EDTA tube
(lavender-top).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL plasma.
• Specimen should be centrifuged within 1 hour of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or
any other anticoagulant other than heparin or EDTA.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient information and
collection date/time.
Storage and Stability:
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 24 hours.
• For longer storage, plasma should be aliquoted and frozen at
-20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Myoglobin assay kit (appropriate for the instrument in use)
• Laboratory Centrifuge
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer or compatible system
• Calibrators and Controls specific to the Myoglobin assay
• Pipettes and Tips
• Vortex Mixer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate plasma.
2. Carefully aspirate and transfer the plasma into a clean, labeled
polypropylene tube.
3. Proceed with the assay immediately or store the plasma at
2-8°C. If analysis cannot be done within 24 hours, freeze the
plasma at -20°C or colder for longer storage.
B. Pre-Run Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the Immunoassay Analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions using myoglobin-specific calibrators
provided with the assay kit.
2. Run the quality control samples at low, medium, and high
myoglobin concentrations:
◦ Assure that quality control results are within the defined
acceptable ranges.
◦ Document the results of the quality control in the QC log.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Load patient samples, calibrators, and quality control materials
onto the automated Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Enter the required data and operational parameters into the
instrument software.
3. Start the assay run and monitor the process for any anomalies
or errors.
4. Upon completion of the run, ensure that the system performs a
self-check procedure.
D. Result Analysis and Validation:
1. Review the generated results for each sample.
◦ Compare quality control values against expected ranges
before result validation.
2. Validate results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. If results fall outside of the reference range, verify the integrity
of the sample and re-run if necessary.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference Intervals for Myoglobin (plasma), may vary depending on
the patient population and assay in use. Consult the assay kit insert
and establishment’s guidelines for specific reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Refer to the specific Myoglobin assay kit insert for limitations.
3. Spurious results can be caused by hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus of the sample.
4. Cross-reactivity with other serum proteins can potentially
interfere with the myoglobin assay.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• All patient results, quality control, and calibrations should be
recorded in the appropriate logbooks and electronically in LIS.
• Critical results must be reviewed and, if necessary, verified by the
supervising technologist or the attending pathologist before being
reported to the physician.
