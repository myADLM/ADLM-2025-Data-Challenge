Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Myoglobin Results in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of myoglobin testing in random urine specimens,
ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists and technicians are
responsible for performing the myoglobin testing in random urine
samples according to this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are adequately trained
and that the procedures are followed correctly. Corrective actions
should be taken if discrepancies or issues arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Midstream, random urine sample collected
in a sterile container.
• Volume: At least 10 mL of urine is required.
• Specimen handling: Samples should be processed as soon as
possible after collection. If there is a delay, store the specimen at
2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens that are improperly
labeled, contaminated, or insufficient in volume. Also, samples
that have been stored at room temperature for more than 2 hours
or refrigerated for more than 24 hours are not acceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Myoglobin assay analyzer (e.g., Roche cobas c311)
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Reagent set specific to the analyzer
• Reagents:
◦ Myoglobin reagent kit
◦ QC materials (2 levels: normal and abnormal)
• Materials:
◦ Urine collection containers
◦ Urine cups for analysis
◦ Latex or nitrile gloves
◦ Absorbent bench pad
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Verify the specimen label against the test requisition form.
◦ Mix the urine sample well by gently inverting the container
several times.
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 RPM for 5 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean urine cup for analysis.
3. Quality Control (QC):
◦ Run quality control samples (Normal and Abnormal) at the
beginning of each shift, with each new reagent lot number,
and after any maintenance performed on the analyzers.
◦ Ensure the QC results are within the manufacturer’s
acceptable range. Document and take corrective actions if
QC results are outside the acceptable range.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Program the myoglobin analyzer with the appropriate assay
settings as per the equipment manual.
◦ Load the urine sample onto the analyzer.
◦ Input the sample identification and test information into the
analyzer system.
◦ Initiate the testing procedure according to the analyzer’s
instructions.
5. Result Generation:
◦ Await the completion of the test run as indicated by the
analyzer’s prompts.
◦ The system automatically generates and records the assay
results.
◦ Review the results for any flags or alerts that may indicate
analytical issues.
6. Verification and Documentation:
◦ Review the generated results to ensure they fall within the
reportable range.
◦ Compare patient results to QC results to ensure accuracy.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Flag and report any critical values to the responsible
healthcare provider.
7. Post-analytical Phase:
◦ Dispose of tested specimens and materials in accordance
with biohazard waste protocols.
◦ Clean and maintain the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Document any maintenance or issues encountered during
testing in the instrument logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are recorded and automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before being reported to the patient's healthcare provider.
• Results are reported quantitatively in units of ng/mL.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Daily checks must ensure that all instrument and reagent
calibration, QC, and maintenance are up-to-date.
• Any deviations, discrepancies, or equipment faults are to be
documented and immediately addressed as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Troubleshoot instrument issues by referring to the user manual or
contacting technical support if unresolved.

This concludes the SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for MYOGLOBIN, RANDOM, URINE. Compliance with this SOP will
ensure the reliability, accuracy, and timeliness of laboratory results.
