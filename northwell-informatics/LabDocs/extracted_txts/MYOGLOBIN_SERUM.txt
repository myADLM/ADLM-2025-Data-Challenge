Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Myoglobin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the accurate and timely
analysis of serum myoglobin levels using the laboratory's designated
equipment. This SOP will ensure consistency and reliability in test
results, as well as compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
myoglobin analysis according to this procedure. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP and
addressing any issues that arise during analysis.
2. DEFINITION
Myoglobin: A protein found in muscle tissue, released into the
bloodstream following muscle injury.
3. SPECIMEN
a) Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum specimen collected in a SST (Serum Separator Tube) or
red-top tube.
• Specimen must be allowed to clot and then centrifuged to obtain
serum.
b) Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 48 hours after
collection.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8 °C)
• Myoglobin assay kit (specific to laboratory's instrumentation)
• Calibration materials and controls for the specific myoglobin
assay
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, check the specimen for proper labeling and any
signs of hemolysis.
2. Centrifuge the SST or red-top tube at 1500-2000g for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
3. Transfer the serum into a properly labeled secondary tube for
analysis.
B) Myoglobin Assay Setup:
1. Refer to the specific assay kit instructions for detailed setup
procedures.
2. Perform calibration of the instrument using the provided
calibration materials.
3. Ensure quality control levels are within acceptable ranges
before processing patient samples.
C) Analysis:
1. Using the designated analyzer, load the prepared serum
samples.
2. Follow the analyzer’s instructions for running the myoglobin
assay.
3. Carefully monitor the assay process to ensure proper function
and avoid any technical errors.
D) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Validate assay results against the control data.
2. Report results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by the technologist.
3. Ensure that critical results are communicated following the
laboratory’s policy for handling critical values.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Perform QC on every new batch of reagents or assay kits as per
manufacturer's instructions. B) Analyze control materials at the start
of each shift and record results:
• Positive control: should fall within the high-value range.
• Negative control: should fall within the low-value range. C) If
controls fail, troubleshoot the cause and repeat the QC analysis.
Do not proceed with patient samples until controls pass.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Results are automatically transmitted to LIS. B) Technologists
review results for accuracy and completeness. C) Document any
reanalysis or troubleshooting steps taken during the analysis. D)
Notify the attending physician of critical results as per laboratory
policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Myoglobin, Serum: <70 ng/mL
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Assay interference: Hemolyzed samples can falsely elevate
myoglobin levels.
• Analytical sensitivity: Ensure the assay sensitivity meets clinical
requirements.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for 48 hours post-collection
when refrigerated at 2-8°C.
