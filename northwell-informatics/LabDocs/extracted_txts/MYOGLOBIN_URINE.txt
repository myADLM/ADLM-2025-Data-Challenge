Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Urine Myoglobin
Testing
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this procedure is to provide uniform
instructions for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of myoglobin
in urine specimens to ensure accurate and reliable test results, which
are essential for the diagnosis and management of conditions like
rhabdomyolysis and muscle injuries.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the laboratory
technologist to perform the urine myoglobin assay according to this
SOP. Laboratory supervisors must ensure that all testing personnel
are adequately trained and comply with this procedure.
3. DEFINITIONS: Myoglobin is a heme protein found in muscle
tissue. The presence of myoglobin in urine indicates muscle injury or
other myopathic conditions.
4. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING:
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 10 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a clean container.
◦ Preservatives should not be used.
◦ Specimens must be delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours
of collection; otherwise, refrigeration at 2-8°C is required for up
to 24 hours.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported.
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed or visibly contaminated.
◦ Specimens with no collection date and time indicated.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Immunoassay analyzer or ELISA kit for myoglobin.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Transfer pipettes.
• Urine containers.
• Quality control materials.
6. PROCEDURE: Sample Preparation:
1. Allow refrigerated specimens to come to room temperature.
2. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly.
3. Centrifuge the urine specimen at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
Testing Procedure:
1. For Immunoassay Analyzer:
◦ Consult the manufacturer's manual and prepare the
analyzer for testing. This includes running calibration and
quality control.
◦ Load the pre-processed urine samples into the sample
carousel.
◦ Follow the specific steps for your analyzer to run the
myoglobin test.
2. For ELISA:
◦ Prepare samples, standards, and controls according to the
kit manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Add the required amount of prepared urine sample (typically
50-100 μL) to each well as per the kit protocol.
◦ Complete the steps involved in the ELISA procedure (e.g.,
adding reagents, incubation times, washing steps).
◦ Measure absorbance using an ELISA reader set to the
appropriate wavelength specified in the kit's instructions.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run internal quality controls (positive and negative controls) with
each batch of patient tests.
• External quality controls, if available, should also be run
periodically.
• Review the QC results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range before reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• For quantitative tests, results are recorded in units specified by
the testing platform (e.g., ng/mL).
• Reference intervals:
◦ Normal Range: < 20 ng/mL (may vary based on the test kit or
analyzer used).
◦ Results above the reference range should be flagged
accordingly.
9. CRITICAL RESULTS:
• Myoglobin levels significantly above the reference interval are
critical and should be reported immediately to the requesting
physician or healthcare provider.
10. INTERPRETATION:
• Elevated myoglobin levels in urine indicate muscle injury and may
suggest conditions such as rhabdomyolysis, myocardial infarction,
or other myopathic conditions.
• Clinical correlation and further diagnostic workup are advised for
elevated results.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemoglobin can potentially interfere with myoglobin assays,
leading to falsely elevated results. Specimens should be checked
for hemolysis.
• Ensure proper sample collection and handling to avoid
contamination or degradation.
12. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific immunoassay
analyzer/ELISA kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on myoglobin testing.
13. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL:
• Handle all patient specimens and controls using appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of biohazardous waste, including unused urine samples,
used test kits, and any contaminated materials, according to
laboratory safety protocols and regulatory requirements.
This completes the SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for myoglobin in urine. Ensure all laboratory personnel are proficient
in this procedure and up-to-date with their training.
