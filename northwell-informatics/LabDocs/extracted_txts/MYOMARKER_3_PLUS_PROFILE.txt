Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MYOMARKER 3 PLUS
PROFILE Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the accurate and reliable
determination of MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE in patient
specimens using the designated analytical instruments and reagents
in the laboratory. Consistency in following this procedure ensures the
integrity of test results and their compliance with regulatory
standards.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE analysis. It is relevant for clinical
decision support, and all results must be generated, reviewed, and
documented according to the procedures outlined here.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to:
• Ensure proper handling and processing of specimens.
• Perform the analysis according to this SOP.
• Document all processes and findings accurately.
• Address any deviations and notify the supervisor promptly.
1. DEFINITION
MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE: A comprehensive panel of
biomarkers used to assess myocardial health, including but not
limited to specific cardiac proteins, enzymes, and peptides.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Requirements
• Preferred specimen type: Serum or plasma (EDTA or heparin).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
• Specimen handling: Specimens must be processed within 4 hours
of collection. If unable to process immediately, serum/plasma
should be separated and stored at -20°C to -80°C until analysis.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
5.2 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated analyzer specific to MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE
(e.g., MYOAnalyzer 5000).
• MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE reagent kit.
• Controls and calibrators specific to the MYOMARKER 3 PLUS
PROFILE.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Laboratory timer.
5.3 Calibration and Quality Control
• Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions before running patient specimens.
• Run high, medium, and low-quality control (QC) materials at the
beginning of each day or each shift when performing multiple
analyses in a day. Record results on the QC log.
• QC results must be within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples. If QC results fall outside of
limits, recalibrate the instrument, and rerun QC. Notify the
supervisor if the problem persists.
5.4 Analytical Procedure
1. Allow reagents and QC materials to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Set up the MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE reagent kit on the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Confirm the correct method settings on the analyzer for
MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE.
4. Pipette the required volume of patient serum or plasma into the
designated sample cups/tubes.
5. Load the samples on the analyzer as per the specific guidelines
provided by the instrument.
6. Start the analysis process. The analyzer will automatically mix,
incubate, and measure the specimens.
7. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts during the
run.
5.5 Result Interpretation
• The analyzer will directly display and print the test results after
completing the run.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
reporting.
• Ensure that control results fall within the acceptable range; if not,
troubleshoot and repeat the test.
• Reference intervals and action ranges established by the
laboratory must be applied to the interpretation of results.
Document any critical values and follow the laboratory's protocol
for reporting critical results to the attending physician.
5.6 Reporting Results
• Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure completeness and accuracy of the reported data.
• Critical results must be communicated immediately to the ordering
physician and documented as per standard protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the
MYOMARKER 3 PLUS PROFILE assay.
• Avoid using specimens with visible clots or significant particulate
matter.

PROFILE.
1. REVIEW AND AMENDMENT
This SOP must be reviewed annually and amended if there are
changes in methodology, equipment, or external regulations. Staff
must be trained on any updated protocols accordingly.
