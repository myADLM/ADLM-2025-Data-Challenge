Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for MYOMARKER 3 PROFILE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the process for the analytical phase of
generating results for the MYOMARKER 3 PROFILE. The procedure
covers reagent preparation, equipment setup, sample processing,
analytical measurement, quality control assessment, and result
documentation to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory scientists and technicians are responsible for
performing the steps outlined in this procedure, ensuring proper
handling and processing of samples, and adhering to quality control
measures. Supervisors are responsible for oversight and review of
the procedure and results.
1. DEFINITION
The MYOMARKER 3 PROFILE is a specific set of tests aimed at
detecting markers related to muscle health and disease conditions.
Testing includes measurement of Creatine Kinase (CK), Aspartate
Aminotransferase (AST), and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH).
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Automated analyzer capable of measuring CK, AST, and LDH.
• Calibrators and controls for CK, AST, and LDH.
• Pipettes and tips for specimen handling.
• Serum or plasma samples.
• Quality control materials.
• Temperature monitoring devices.
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and controls are within their expiry dates and
stored according to manufacturer instructions.
• Calibrate the automated analyzer using fresh calibrators.
• Set the room temperature between 20-26°C and humidity
between 15-85%.
Sample Processing:
1. Sample Acquisition:
◦ Approximately 2-5 mL of serum or plasma collected in
heparinized or plain tubes.
2. Pre-Analytical Handling:
◦ Verify sample integrity and identification. Samples should be
free of hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
◦ Allow samples to come to room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain
serum/plasma.
3. Analytical Measurement:
4. CK Measurement:
◦ Load samples into the analyzer.
◦ Use CK-specific reagents and run tests according to the
manufacturer’s protocols.
◦ Document CK values.
5. AST Measurement:
◦ Load samples into the analyzer.
◦ Use AST-specific reagents and run tests according to the
manufacturer’s protocols.
◦ Document AST values.
6. LDH Measurement:
◦ Load samples into the analyzer.
◦ Use LDH-specific reagents and run tests according to the
manufacturer’s protocols.
◦ Document LDH values.
Quality Control:
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of quality control for CK, AST, and LDH daily
before patient sample testing.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot and rerun until acceptable results
are obtained.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Perform proficiency testing as required, using blind samples
provided by an external agency.
◦ Document and submit results for evaluation.
Reporting Results:
• Review and verify results using laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Ensure results are within reference intervals:
◦ CK: 38–174 IU/L
◦ AST: 10–40 IU/L
◦ LDH: 140–280 IU/L
• Document results in patient’s electronic medical record.
• Call critical results to the requesting physician immediately,
following documentation protocol.
DATA INTEGRITY:
• For samples showing questionable results, conduct repeat
analysis or validate using secondary methods.
• Use best judgment for reporting based on sample integrity
checks.
• Note and document any significant deviations or anomalies.
References:
• Manufacturer's inserts for reagents and quality control materials
for CK, AST, and LDH.
• Laboratory guidelines and quality assurance protocols.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for muscle health biomarkers.
Review and Updates:
This protocol is reviewed quarterly to ensure compliance with latest
standards and methodologies. Updates will be made as necessary to
reflect changes in analytical technology or clinical requirements.
