Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Myositis Specific Antibody
Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the evaluation and
generation of results for Myositis Specific Antibody (MSA) Evaluation,
serum, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test results
to assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with myositis.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing MSA
evaluation according to this procedure. It is the responsibility of all
staff to identify any deficiencies in the evaluation process which may
affect test results and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: - Preferred: Serum collected in a red-top tube (without
anticoagulants). - Acceptable: Serum collected in a SST (serum
separator tube). - Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum. - Stability: Serum
samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C
for up to one month.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens collected in anticoagulant
tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin). - Specimens that are hemolyzed or
lipemic. - Specimens received outside the stability range or not
properly stored prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Reader
◦ ELISA kits specific for Myositis-specific antibodies (Mi-2,
TIF1-γ, MDA5, NXP-2, SAE, etc.)
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Calibrated serological pipettes
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Reagents and buffers specific to the ELISA kit
◦ Disposable gloves and other personal protective equipment
(PPE)
2. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION: - Ensure all reagents, equipment, and
supplies are available and prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. - Bring serum samples to room
temperature before analysis.
B. TEST SETUP: - Label microplates according to the number
of samples and controls being tested. - Follow the ELISA kit
instructions for preparing standards, controls, and samples.
C. SAMPLE PROCESSING: 1. Add the specified volume of
serum samples, standards, and controls to the appropriate
wells on the microplate. 2. Incubate the plate for the
recommended time at the specified temperature. 3. Wash the
plate according to the ELISA kit instructions using the
microplate washer. 4. Add the detection antibodies or conjugate
to each well, following the incubation and washing steps as
specified in the kit instructions. 5. Add the substrate solution to
each well and incubate for the recommended time in the dark.
6. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
D. READING RESULTS: - Read the absorbance of each well
using the ELISA reader. - Use the manufacturer's software or
manual methods to calculate results based on the calibration
curve generated from the standards.
E. QUALITY CONTROL: - Include positive and negative
controls in each run to validate the assay. - If controls do not
perform within expected ranges, investigate potential issues
with reagents, equipment, or technique.
3. INTERPRETING RESULTS
◦ Compare the absorbance values of the serum samples to
the standards to determine the presence and concentration
of myositis-specific antibodies.
◦ Report results according to established reference ranges
and site-specific guidelines.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify results generated by the ELISA reader.
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Communicate any critical or abnormal results to the
requesting physician according to laboratory protocol.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to
reagent pads and test procedures.
◦ Potential cross-reactivity and interference should be noted
as specified by the manufacturer.
6. REFERENCES
◦ ELISA kit insert and manufacturer's instructions for use.
◦ Current clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and assessment
of myositis.
7. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Document any deviations from protocol, corrective actions
taken, and the supervisor's notification.
This SOP must be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with CLIA regulations and advancements in
laboratory practices.
