Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) SOP Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Myxoid/Round Cell Liposarcoma, 12q13
(DDIT3 or CHOP) Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
accurate and reliable detection of DDIT3 (CHOP) gene
rearrangements in tissue samples using Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) as part of the diagnostic process for Myxoid/
Round Cell Liposarcoma.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff trained in FISH protocols are responsible for carrying
out this procedure. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
quality control and adherence to SOPs.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or
unstained slides.
• Sections should be 4-5 micrometers thick.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Poorly fixed or inadequately processed tissue samples.
• Tissue samples without proper labeling (patient ID, date of
collection).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters.
• Water bath.
• Thermometer.
• Humidity control chamber.
• FISH probe specific for DDIT3 (CHOP) 12q13.
• Pre-treatment reagents (e.g., paraffin removal solutions,
protease).
• Hybridization buffer.
• DAPI counterstain.
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%).
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Pre-Treatment:
• Cut 4-5 micrometer sections from the FFPE tissue and mount on
positively charged slides.
• Bake slides at 56°C for 1-2 hours.
• Deparaffinize the tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene for
10 minutes. Repeat once.
• Rehydrate the sections through a graded ethanol series (100%,
100%, 85%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
• Rinse in distilled water.
5.2. Protease Treatment:
• Preheat the protease pre-treatment solution to 37°C.
• Immerse slides in pre-warmed protease solution for the time
indicated by the manufacturer (typically 10-20 minutes).
• Wash slides in 2X SSC (Saline-Sodium Citrate) buffer for 5
minutes.
• Air dry the slides.
5.3. Hybridization:
• Apply 10 µL of DDIT3 (CHOP) FISH probe to the target area of
the slide.
• Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
• Co-denature the probe and target DNA by placing the slide on a
thermal cycler or a hybridizer at 75°C for 5 minutes.
• Transfer the slides to a humidity control chamber and incubate at
37°C overnight (12-18 hours) for hybridization.
5.4. Post-Hybridization Wash:
• Remove rubber cement and coverslip carefully.
• Immerse slides in pre-warmed 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 wash buffer
at 72°C for 2 minutes.
• Rinse in room temperature 1X PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline).
• Air dry the slides in the dark.
5.5. Counterstaining:
• Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to each slide.
• Coverslip the slides.
• Allow to dry in the dark.
5.6. Microscope Analysis:
• Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filters for DAPI and the fluorophores used (e.g.,
FITC or Texas Red).
• Capture images of representative areas.
• Evaluate at least 100 interphase nuclei to determine the presence
or absence of the 12q13 (DDIT3) rearrangement.
5.7. Interpretation and Reporting:
• Positive Result: Presence of split or rearranged signals indicating
a DDIT3 (CHOP) rearrangement.
• Negative Result: Absence of such rearrangements.
• Equivocal Result: Ambiguous pattern, may require additional
testing.
Record the results, including the percentage of cells with
rearrangements, and any notes on signal quality or observation
difficulties.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide with a known DDIT3 (CHOP)
rearrangement for each run.
• Ensure the negative control (healthy tissue) shows no
rearrangement signals.
• Document the performance of reagent lot numbers and expiration
dates.
• Maintain equipment calibration records and service logs.
• Conduct interlaboratory comparisons periodically.
1. SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including wearing
PPE (personal protective equipment).
• Handle and dispose of specimens according to biosafety
regulations.
• Manage and dispose of chemical and biological waste in
accordance with hazardous waste guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All FISH results must be documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS) with the date, time, technologist’s initials, and any
corrective actions taken during the procedure.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the FISH probes and reagents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and research articles on Myxoid/
Round Cell Liposarcoma and DDIT3 rearrangements.
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to
align with new research and technological advances.
