Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for N-Acetylaspartic Acid
(NAA) Testing for Canavan Disease in Random Urine
Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized protocol for the
analysis of N-Acetylaspartic Acid (NAA) levels in random urine
samples for the diagnosis of Canavan Disease.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP to ensure accurate and consistent results. Any deviations
from the procedure must be documented and reported to the
supervisor.
3. DEFINITION
N-Acetylaspartic Acid (NAA) is a brain-specific amino acid found in
elevated levels in the urine of patients with Canavan Disease, a
genetic disorder affecting the brain.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 10-15 mL of random urine, freshly voided.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected more than 6 hours prior to receipt in the
laboratory.
• Specimens without proper labeling including collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
equivalent analytical instrument.
• NAA standard calibration material.
• Reagent grade water.
• Appropriate HPLC columns.
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid).
• Urine sample containers.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Specimen Receipt:
◦ Verify specimen labeling, ensuring proper identification.
◦ Log the specimen into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Store the specimen at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed
immediately.
2. Preparation of Standards and Reagents:
◦ Prepare NAA standard solutions as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Prepare mobile phase reagents fresh daily.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the HPLC system and allow it to equilibrate with the
mobile phase.
◦ Check and calibrate the system using NAA standard
solutions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Transfer 1-2 mL of urine sample to a centrifuge tube.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Withdraw the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette an aliquot of the supernatant into an HPLC sample
vial.
◦ Load the sample vials into the HPLC autosampler.
◦ Set the HPLC method parameters specific for NAA
detection.
◦ Inject the sample and run the analysis according to the
instrument’s protocol.
4. Data Collection:
◦ Collect and analyze chromatographic data using the
instrument's software.
◦ Ensure peaks corresponding to NAA are identified properly
against the calibration standards.
C. Post-Analytical Procedure
1. Result Verification:
◦ Compare sample peaks and retention times to the NAA
standard.
◦ Ensure the values fall within the established calibration
range.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (both high and low) with each
batch of patient samples.
◦ Document any deviations from the expected values and
take corrective action if necessary.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the results into the LIS.
◦ Verify and release the results.
◦ Critical values or significantly elevated NAA levels must be
reported to the supervisor and the requesting physician
immediately as per the laboratory protocol.
4. Documentation:
◦ Maintain proper documentation of all steps, including
sample preparation, instrument setup, calibration, and
quality control.
◦ Save chromatographic data electronically for future
reference.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference intervals for urinary NAA levels should be
established based on literature and internal validation studies.
8. POSSIBLE INTERFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are free from contamination.
• Storage and handling of samples should be optimal to prevent
degradation.
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the HPLC system
to avoid analytical errors.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular instrument maintenance as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Run known standards and controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Record all quality control results and any actions taken in the QC
log.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's guidelines for preparing NAA standards.
• Instrument manual for operating and maintaining the HPLC
system.
This SOP ensures a consistent and standardized approach to the
analysis of N-Acetylaspartic Acid in urine for diagnosing Canavan
Disease, thereby ensuring accurate and reliable results.
