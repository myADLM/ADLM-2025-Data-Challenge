Standard Operating Procedure for Generating N-
Acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) Genotype Results
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for N-Acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2)
genotype. It ensures accurate, reliable, and timely detection of NAT2
genetic polymorphisms to identify enzyme activity variation which
may affect drug metabolism and susceptibility to certain diseases.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the testing and reporting of NAT2 genotype results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for conducting NAT2 genotyping analysis, documenting
results, and managing data. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
that testing personnel adhere to the protocols outlined in this
procedure.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• NAT2 Genotyping Kit (e.g., TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays)
• PCR tubes and consumables
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus (if applicable)
• Ethidium bromide or other DNA stain (if applicable)
• UV transilluminator (if applicable)
• Positive and negative controls
5. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle reagents and samples according to the manufacturer’s
safety data sheets.
• Dispose of waste according to laboratory protocols and
regulations.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
• Use an appropriate DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic DNA
from the patient's sample (e.g., blood, saliva, or tissue).
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction.
• Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
• Ensure DNA is stored properly until ready for use (e.g., at -20°C).
6.2 PCR Amplification
• Prepare the PCR reaction mix: combine the NAT2 Genotyping
Assay reagents, extracted DNA, and nuclease-free water.
• Set up the PCR tubes or plates according to the required format.
• Load the PCR reaction mix into the thermal cycler.
• Run the PCR program according to the genotyping kit
manufacturer’s instructions, typically including initial denaturation,
amplification cycles, and final extension steps.
6.3 Analysis of PCR Products
• If gel electrophoresis is used:
◦ Prepare an agarose gel and run the PCR products.
◦ Stain the gel with a DNA-specific stain (e.g., ethidium
bromide).
◦ Visualize the PCR products using a UV transilluminator.
◦ Document the results.
• If using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays or another
fluorescence-based method:
◦ Analyze the amplification curves and endpoint fluorescence
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure the PCR reactions include appropriate controls.
◦ Use the software to determine the genotypes based on the
fluorescence data.
6.4 Interpretation of Results
• Compare the results with positive and negative controls to ensure
assay validity.
• Assign NAT2 genotypes based on the identified polymorphisms.
• Perform quality control checks and repeat the assay if any
discrepancies or issues arise.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and verify all results.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review the results for accuracy and clinical relevance.
• Generate reports and communicate the findings to the requesting
clinician.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
reliability.
• Document and track all quality control measures.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as available.
• Troubleshoot any issues promptly and document corrective
actions.
9. REFERENCES
