Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of N-
METHYLHISTAMINE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable quantification of N-
Methylhistamine in 24-hour urine samples using appropriate
analytical techniques and quality control measures.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the quantification of N-Methylhistamine in
24-hour urine samples received in the Clinical Laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform the
analysis as outlined in this SOP and to ensure quality control
measures are adhered to. The supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the process and addressing any issues or deviations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Collection:
◦ Urine specimens must be collected over a 24-hour period in a
provided collection container.
◦ The total volume of the urine collected should be measured
and recorded.
◦ The specimen should be stored at 2-8°C during collection and
prior to analysis.
• Transport and Storage:
◦ Specimens should be transported to the laboratory
immediately after the 24-hour collection period.
◦ Upon receipt in the laboratory, specimens should be aliquoted
and stored at -20°C or lower until the time of analysis.
• Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Specimens must have a recorded total volume and be free
from contamination.
◦ Containers must be labeled with the patient’s information,
date, and time of collection start and end.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Sample vials and caps
• Standards and control materials for N-Methylhistamine
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid)
• Calibration curve materials
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw urine samples to room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 4000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
4. Aliquot a specified volume of the clear supernatant into a
sample vial.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards for N-Methylhistamine at known
concentrations.
2. Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the expected range of patient samples.
3. Ensure all standards and QC samples are stored and handled
according to manufacturer instructions.
C. Chromatographic Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Ensure all system components, including the
column, are in proper working condition.
2. Use the mobile phase solvents to equilibrate the HPLC column.
3. Load the calibration standards, QC samples, and patient urine
samples onto the HPLC system.
4. Program the HPLC to the appropriate method for N-
Methylhistamine analysis, including the gradient, flow rate, and
detection parameters.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the run, review chromatograms for peak
identification and integration.
2. Generate a calibration curve using the standards and determine
the concentration of N-Methylhistamine in the patient samples.
3. Ensure that QC samples meet the acceptance criteria. If any
QC results are out of range, investigate and resolve the issue
before reporting patient results.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Transmit the validated results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results in the LIS.
3. Report the final results to the patient's electronic medical record
(EMR).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform quality control checks with each analytical run.
2. Use internal controls and ensure their values are within
specified limits.
3. Document all QC data in accordance with laboratory guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert and guidelines for specific
limitations of the HPLC method used for N-Methylhistamine analysis.
Ensure that any potential interferences or cross-reactivity are noted
and understood.
