STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for N-Methylhistamine,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical
procedures for generating reliable and accurate results for N-
Methylhistamine in random urine samples received in the laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to
follow this protocol and ensure that all steps are performed
accurately and efficiently to guarantee the reliability of the results.
3. DEFINITIONS: N-Methylhistamine (NMH): A metabolite of
histamine which can be measured in urine as a marker for certain
medical conditions such as mastocytosis and other allergy-related
disorders.
4. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean, leak-proof container.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples with visible contamination.
• Urine samples that are not collected in a clean, leak-proof
container.
• Urine samples that are not properly labeled with collection date
and time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system.
• N-Methylhistamine standard and calibration solutions.
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated N-Methylhistamine).
• Mobile phase reagents: Water, acetonitrile, formic acid.
• Solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges.
• Urine sample containers.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Glass or polypropylene vials for HPLC analysis.
• Analytical balance.
6. PROCEDURE:
Preparation of Reagents:
1. Prepare calibration standards of N-Methylhistamine at
concentrations ranging from 0.1 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.
2. Prepare internal standard solution at a fixed concentration
suitable for quantification.
3. Prepare mobile phase by mixing water, acetonitrile, and formic
acid in the appropriate ratio (e.g., 95:5:0.1 v/v/v).
Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify that urine samples are properly labeled and
meet the acceptance criteria.
2. Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a clean labeled container.
3. Add a fixed volume of internal standard solution to the urine
sample and mix thoroughly.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
particulates.
5. Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE) on the supernatant to
isolate N-Methylhistamine: a. Condition the SPE cartridge with
1 mL of methanol followed by 1 mL of water. b. Load the urine
supernatant onto the SPE cartridge. c. Wash the cartridge with
1 mL of water. d. Elute N-Methylhistamine with 1 mL of
methanol.
6. Evaporate the eluted solvent under a gentle stream of nitrogen
at room temperature.
7. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 μL of mobile phase.
8. Transfer the reconstituted sample to a glass or polypropylene
vial for HPLC analysis.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system with the following parameters: a.
Column: C18 reverse-phase column. b. Mobile phase: Water/
Acetonitrile/Formic Acid (95:5:0.1 v/v/v). c. Flow rate: 0.5 mL/
min. d. Injection volume: 25 μL. e. Detection wavelength: 254
nm or according to optimized method.
2. Perform system suitability testing using calibration standards to
ensure proper chromatographic separation and detector
response.
3. Inject calibration standards, quality control samples, and urine
samples in sequence.
4. Analyze the chromatograms to quantify N-Methylhistamine
concentrations based on calibration curves.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include quality control samples (low, mid, high concentration)
with each batch of samples analyzed.
2. Ensure QC samples fall within the acceptable range (±15% of
the target value).
3. Document all QC results, calibration curves, and any deviations
observed.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Review all chromatograms and generate a report for each urine
sample.
2. Verify that internal standard recovery is within acceptable limits
(e.g., 85-115%).
3. Calculate the concentration of N-Methylhistamine in each urine
sample using the calibration curve.
4. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify the accuracy of data entry.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Provide reference intervals or clinical decision thresholds as
determined by the laboratory and clinical guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• The presence of interfering substances in urine that co-elute with
N-Methylhistamine may affect the accuracy of results.
• High concentration samples may require dilution prior to analysis.

• Refer to relevant literature or manufacturer's guidelines for HPLC
method and SPE procedures.
