Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for NABFERON (IFNB-1)
Neutralizing Antibody Test
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
NABFERON (IFNB-1) Neutralizing Antibody Test, including sample
preparation, analytical and reporting phases. This ensures accurate,
reproducible, and timely results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform the IFNB-1 Neutralizing Antibody Test following
the procedures outlined herein. All laboratory staff must identify any
deficiencies in the testing process that may affect results and notify
the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
NABFERON (IFNB-1) Neutralizing Antibody Test is used to measure
the presence and levels of neutralizing antibodies against Interferon
Beta-1. The test detects whether antibodies in patient samples
neutralize the biological activity of the therapeutic IFNB-1.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• NABFERON Test Kit (includes reagents and controls)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory glassware (tubes, beakers)
• Personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves, goggles)
b. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma samples collected in anticoagulant-
free tubes or tubes containing EDTA, respectively.
• Unacceptable: Specimens with severe hemolysis or
contamination.
c. Sample Preparation:
1. Collect 10 mL freshly drawn blood in appropriate collection
tubes.
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
3. Aliquot the serum/plasma into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
4. Store samples at 2-8°C if analysis is done within 48 hours;
otherwise freeze at -20°C or lower.
d. Test Procedure:
1. Setup:
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature
before testing.
◦ Calibrate pipettes and ensure the microplate reader is
functioning properly.
2. Assay Protocol:
1. Add 50 µL of the negative control, positive control, and
patient serum/plasma samples to designated wells in the
microplate.
2. Add 50 µL of the IFNB-1 solution to each well, ensuring
consistent pipetting.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1-2 hours as specified by
the kit instructions.
4. Wash the wells thoroughly with washing solution provided
with the kit for effective removal of unbound substances.
5. Add 50 µL of detection reagent to each well.
6. Incubate at room temperature for the period indicated in
the package insert (usually around 30 minutes).
7. Read the plate using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength (e.g., 450 nm if using colorimetric detection).
e. Quality Control:
1. Ensure each run includes a negative and positive control to
validate the assay.
2. Document the lot numbers and expiry dates of all reagents
used.
3. If control values are outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
according to the kit's package insert before proceeding with
patient samples.
4. Reporting Results:
5. Analyze the data according to the standard curve created from
the controls.
6. Positive results indicate the presence of neutralizing antibodies
against IFNB-1, while negative results indicate their absence.
7. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by laboratory personnel.
8. Any critical results should be immediately communicated to the
ordering physician following standard notification procedures.
9. Sample Integrity:
10. Inspect each sample for signs of hemolysis and contamination
before testing.
11. Any sample integrity issues should be documented and the
sample rejected if necessary, followed by requesting another
specimen from the patient.
12. Method Limitations:
13. Refer to the NABFERON kit insert for specific reagent
limitations and interferences.
