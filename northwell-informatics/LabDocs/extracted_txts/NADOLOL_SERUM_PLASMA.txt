Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Nadolol, Serum/Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analysis of Nadolol
levels in serum or plasma samples using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection in a CLIA-certified
laboratory setting.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all trained personnel performing Nadolol level
testing on serum or plasma samples in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure the accuracy, quality, and integrity of the results. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this
procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Nadolol: A beta-adrenergic blocking agent used to handle
hypertension and angina.
• Serum/Plasma: The liquid component of blood after the removal
of cells. Serum is obtained after clotting whereas plasma is
obtained using anticoagulants.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in an SST
(Serum Seperator Tube) or PST (Plasma Seperator Tube) tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum or plasma is required.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at -20°C if not analyzed
within 24 hours. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 30 days at -20°C.
Specimen Rejection Criteria:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with evident contamination
• Incorrectly labeled or unlabelled samples
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• HPLC system with UV detector
• C18 Column (5 μm, 4.6 x 250 mm)
• Mobile Phase: Methanol:Water (70:30, v/v)
• Nadolol standard solutions
• Internal standard (e.g., Propranolol)
• Sample vials and caps
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents and Standards:
1. Prepare the mobile phase by mixing methanol and water in a
ratio of 70:30 (v/v). Filter the mobile phase through a 0.45 μm
filter and degas by sonication.
2. Prepare Nadolol stock solutions at known concentrations by
diluting in methanol.
3. Prepare a series of calibration standards by further dilutions of
the stock solutions in a matrix similar to the sample matrix
(serum/plasma).
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the patient serum/plasma samples at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes to remove any particulates.
2. Transfer 100 μL of the supernatant to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
3. Add 200 μL of methanol containing the internal standard (e.g., 1
μg/mL of Propranolol) to the sample.
4. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the clear supernatant to an HPLC vial and cap it.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system:
◦ Column: C18, 5 μm, 4.6 x 250 mm
◦ Mobile Phase: Methanol: Water (70:30, v/v)
◦ Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Injection Volume: 20 μL
◦ UV Detection: 226 nm
◦ Run Time: 15 minutes
2. Inject the calibration standards, quality controls, and patient
samples sequentially.
3. The retention time for Nadolol typically appears around 10
minutes, and the internal standard at approximately 12 minutes.
Verify the retention times with standard solutions.
4. Calculate the Nadolol concentrations in patient samples by
integrating peak areas and comparing them to the calibration
curve.
5. Verify the results of quality control samples to ensure they fall
within acceptable ranges before validating patient results.
6. CALCULATIONS
Use the following linear regression formula derived from the
calibration curve to calculate Nadolol concentrations in patient
samples:
Concentration (ng/mL) = (Peak Area of Nadolol / Peak Area of Internal Standard) * Slope (from Calibration Curve) + Intercept
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform quality control procedures as follows:
• Include at least two quality control samples (one low, one high)
with every analytical batch.
• Ensure calibration curves are prepared fresh daily and have a
coefficient of determination (R²) of at least 0.99.
• Evaluate the internal standard recovery in each sample to ensure
consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Record the patient results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Verify that internal and external quality control results are within
acceptable ranges before finalizing and releasing patient reports.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic Range: 20-200 ng/mL
• Toxic Range: >400 ng/mL
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples may interfere with
accurate detection and quantification.
• Ensure proper storage and handling of standards and reagents to
maintain the integrity of the results.

Note: This SOP is aligned with GLP and CLIA standards; changes
and updates should be disseminated to all relevant personnel and
documented thoroughly.
