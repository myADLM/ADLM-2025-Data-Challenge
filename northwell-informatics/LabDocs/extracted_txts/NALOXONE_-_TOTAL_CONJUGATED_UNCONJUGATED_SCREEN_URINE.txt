Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Urine Naloxone – Total
(Conjugated/Unconjugated) Screen
1. PURPOSE
• This SOP details the procedure for screening urine samples for
total naloxone (conjugated and unconjugated forms) in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. The procedures ensure accurate and reliable
results are obtained and reported.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory staff involved in the testing are responsible for
adhering to this SOP.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and for addressing any non-compliance issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable: 30 mL freshly voided urine collected in a
sterile container. Ensure collection time is recorded.
◦ Specimen should arrive in the laboratory within 24 hours if
kept at room temperature, and within 72 hours if refrigerated at
2-8°C.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 72 hours after
collection.
◦ Specimens without a recorded collection date/time.
◦ Specimens showing signs of contamination or improper
handling.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system.
• Naloxone calibration standards and control materials.
• Internal standards (e.g., deuterated naloxone).
• Urine collection cups.
• Pipettes and appropriate tips.
• Mobile phase solvents and reagents for HPLC or LC-MS/MS.
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
2. Verify that the specimen ID matches the requisition form and
that the collection date/time is within acceptable limits.
3. Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gently inverting the
collection container several times.
4. Aliquot a sufficient volume of urine (usually 1-2 mL) into a
labeled centrifuge tube.
5. Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
B. Hydrolysis (if applicable for conjugated naloxone)
1. Add the appropriate hydrolysis reagent to the urine aliquot
based on the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Incubate the samples at 37°C for the prescribed time to ensure
complete hydrolysis of conjugated naloxone.
C. Sample Extraction
1. Add a known quantity of an internal standard (e.g., deuterated
naloxone) to each sample and control.
2. Follow the extraction procedure recommended for the HPLC or
LC-MS/MS system, which typically includes solid-phase
extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) techniques.
D. Analytical Procedure
1. Prepare and calibrate the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
2. Load the samples, calibration standards, and quality control
materials onto the autosampler.
3. Run the samples according to the parameters set for naloxone
detection. Ensure that the runtime, flow rate, and column
conditions follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.
E. Data Analysis
1. Analyze the chromatograms or mass spectra for the naloxone
peak and internal standard.
2. Calculate the naloxone concentration in each urine sample by
comparing the sample peak area to the calibration curve.
F. Quality Control
1. Run quality control materials (both high and low controls) with
each batch of patient samples to ensure assay performance.
2. Acceptable results for quality controls must fall within the
predetermined acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results are out-of-range, perform troubleshooting and
repeat the analysis if necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and approve the generated results.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
testing process.
• Report the total naloxone concentration in urine in ng/mL,
including both conjugated and unconjugated forms, according to
site-specific guidelines.
• Note any comments on the sample integrity or analysis process.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that the analytical method has been validated for
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for naloxone.
• Interferences from other substances in urine can affect naloxone
detection and quantification. Confirm the absence of
interferences.
