Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Protocol for Napsin A Immunostain (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures carried out for the technical component of
Napsin A immunostain in the laboratory, ensuring accurate and
reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to perform the
Napsin A immunostain procedure accurately and document all steps
taken according to this SOP. The designated supervisor is
responsible for overseeing that all immunostain procedures are
performed correctly and for addressing any issues that arise.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Napsin A primary antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated with appropriate detection
enzyme (e.g., HRP)
• Automated stainer or manual staining equipment
• Positive and negative control tissue slides
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Microscope
• Appropriate buffers and substrates (DAB)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens received for Napsin A immunostain should be formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, adequately prepared and
cut to thickness of 3-5 microns.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Ensure tissue sections are pre-cut to 3-5 microns thickness and
mounted on positively charged slides.
2. Dry slides at 60°C for at least 1 hour.
3. Deparaffinize and rehydrate tissue sections using xylene and
graded alcohols.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using citric acid or EDTA buffer as
specified by the primary antibody manufacturer.
2. Heat in appropriate retrieval solution in a microwave, pressure
cooker, or water bath according to manufacturer's
recommendations.
3. Cool slides to room temperature and rinse in wash buffer.
C. Staining Procedure
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse in wash buffer.
3. Apply primary antibody (Napsin A) diluted according to
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Incubate slides in a humid chamber at appropriate temperature
and duration recommended.
5. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
6. Apply secondary antibody conjugated with detection enzyme
(e.g., HRP).
7. Incubate slides in a humid chamber for recommended duration.
8. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
D. Visualization
1. Apply DAB substrate to slides and monitor color development
under microscope.
2. Once optimal staining is achieved, rinse slides thoroughly in
wash buffer to stop the reaction.
3. Counterstain with hematoxylin for contrast, if desired.
4. Rinse slides in tap water and dehydrate through graded
alcohols to xylene.
5. Apply mounting medium and coverslips.
E. Quality Control
1. Include a positive control slide to ensure staining procedure
worked correctly.
2. Include negative control slide to ensure there is no non-specific
staining.
6. DOCUMENTATION
1. Record all reagent lot numbers and expiration dates used
during staining.
2. Document any deviations from the protocol and troubleshooting
measures taken.
3. Verify results by reviewing under a microscope and comparing
to control slides.
4. Record the date, time, and initials of the technologist
performing the procedure.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's package insert for both primary and secondary
antibodies
• Relevant literature and guidelines on immunohistochemistry
staining techniques
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reviewed microscopically and documented both in
the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and in manual record
logs where necessary.
2. Technicians are to report any discrepancies or unusual findings
directly to pathologists for further analysis.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
If staining results are unsatisfactory (e.g., weak or nonspecific
staining), steps to troubleshoot may include verifying the antigen
retrieval process, checking antibody concentrations, ensuring
adequate incubation times, and reviewing buffer solutions.
10. MAINTENANCE
All equipment used in the procedure should be regularly maintained,
cleaned, and calibrated according to standard laboratory protocols to
ensure consistent performance.

• SOPs for immunohistochemical staining procedures
• Napsin A antibody manufacturer guidelines and recommendations
End of Document
Laboratory staff implementing this protocol should follow each step
meticulously to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the Napsin A
immunostaining procedure.
