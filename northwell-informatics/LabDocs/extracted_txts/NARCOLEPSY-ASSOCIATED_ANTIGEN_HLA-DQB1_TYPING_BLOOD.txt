Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for NARCOLEPSY-
ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN (HLA-DQB1 TYPING, BLOOD)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide detailed instruction for the
analytical phase of generating results for Narcolepsy-Associated
Antigen (HLA-DQB1 Typing) using blood specimens. This ensures
accuracy, reliability, and validity of laboratory results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff involved to follow these
procedures thoroughly. The laboratory supervisor or designated
personnel are responsible for ensuring compliance with this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Peripheral blood collected in an EDTA
(purple top) tube.
• Minimum Volume: 5 mL of whole blood.
• Stability: Blood samples should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately and should not exceed 72 hours from
collection to processing.
• Handling: Ensure proper mixing of blood with anticoagulant by
gentle inversion of the tube.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Thermocycler (PCR machine)
• Primers specific for HLA-DQB1 alleles
• Nucleotides, Taq polymerase
• PCR reagents and Master mix
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Ethidium bromide or other gel stain
• DNA ladder
• Gel documentation system
• Sterile pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes
• Gloves, lab coats, and other necessary PPE
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 DNA Extraction
• Begin by labeling all sample tubes and necessary documentation.
• Perform DNA extraction from peripheral blood using the DNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer's protocol.
• Measure the concentration and purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
• Store DNA at -20°C until further use.
4.2 PCR Amplification
• Prepare the PCR master mix containing Taq polymerase,
nucleotides, primers specific for HLA-DQB1 alleles, and extracted
DNA according to the kit or laboratory's standard protocol.
• Pipette the master mix into PCR tubes and load into the
thermocycler.
• Use the following PCR cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 58°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Total number of cycles: 35
4.3 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
• Prepare a 2% agarose gel and pour it into the gel casting tray.
Allow it to solidify.
• Load DNA ladder and PCR products into the wells of the agarose
gel.
• Run the electrophoresis at 120V until the dye front has moved
approximately 2/3 down the gel.
• Stain the gel using ethidium bromide (or alternative) and observe
under UV light to visualize DNA bands.
• Capture an image of the gel using the gel documentation system.
4.4 Interpretation of Results
• Compare the bands from the sample DNA to the control and DNA
ladder to determine the presence or absence of specific HLA-
DQB1 alleles.
• Identify the genotype by comparing the PCR product sizes to
known HLA-DQB1 allele sizes.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Incorporate positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
amplifications.
• Repeat the PCR and gel electrophoresis if controls do not show
expected results.
• Record all findings, including controls, in a designated log book.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the presence or absence of HLA-DQB1 alleles in the
patient's report.
• Include interpreter’s comments, if necessary, regarding the
association of specific alleles with narcolepsy.
• Verify and sign the results before transmittal to the clinician or the
requesting department.
1. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all PCR amplification logs, gel photographs,
results interpretation, and reporting in accordance with laboratory
policies and regulatory requirements.
• Store DNA samples and PCR products according to laboratory
protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• HLA-DQB1 Typing Kit manufacturer's instructions.
• Relevant literature on HLA-DQB1 and its association with
narcolepsy.
By adhering to these procedures, laboratory staff can ensure the
accurate and reliable detection of HLA-DQB1 alleles associated with
narcolepsy, providing valuable information for patient diagnosis and
management.
