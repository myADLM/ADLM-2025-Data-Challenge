Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Natural Killer (NK)/Natural
Killer T-Cell Subsets, Quantitative, Blood
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
quantitative analysis of Natural Killer (NK) cells and Natural
Killer T (NKT) cells in blood samples. This SOP ensures
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the
analysis of NK/NKT cell subsets in the designated laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory staff to follow this procedure, ensure quality control
measures are adhered to, and report any deviations or issues
to the supervisor. Supervisors are responsible for the
implementation of this SOP and ensuring that all staff are
adequately trained.
4. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PROCESSING 4.1 Specimen
Type
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (Lavender-top tube) or heparin
(Green-top tube).
4.2 Specimen Handling
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24
hours of collection.
• If there is a delay, store the specimen at 2-8°C and ensure
analysis is conducted within the stability period specified by the
manufacturer of the reagents/kits used.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II)
• Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific to CD16, CD56,
CD3 markers for NK/NKT cell identification.
• Lysing solution (e.g., BD FACS Lysing Solution)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Sample preparation tubes (e.g., FACS tubes)
• Pipettes and tips
• Appropriate quality control materials (e.g., BD MultiCheck control
cells)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Daily Instrument Check
• Turn on the flow cytometer and perform daily startup procedures
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform quality control checks using standard control cells to
ensure the instrument is functioning correctly.
6.2 Preparation of Working Reagents
• Prepare fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare lysing solution and PBS.
6.3 Staining Protocol
1. Label three FACS tubes: Tube A (single stain control), Tube B
(compensation control), Tube C (sample tube).
2. Add 100 µL of well-mixed blood sample to each tube.
3. Add the appropriate volume of conjugated antibodies to each
tube:
◦ Tube A: Add one antibody to each tube for single stain
control.
◦ Tube B: Mix antibodies to create compensation controls.
◦ Tube C: Add a cocktail of antibodies (CD16, CD56, CD3)
specific for NK/NKT cell identification.
4. Vortex each tube gently and incubate in the dark at room
temperature for 15 minutes.
5. Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube to lyse red blood cells.
Mix gently and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10
minutes.
6. Centrifuge samples at 500 x g for 5 minutes. Carefully discard
the supernatant.
7. Wash the samples twice with PBS. Centrifuge as above after
each wash and discard the supernatant.
8. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of PBS for flow cytometry
analysis.
6.4 Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Perform instrument setup and compensation using the single
stain and compensation control tubes.
2. Analyze the sample tube with the fluorochrome-labeled
antibodies.
3. Gate on lymphocytes based on forward and side scatter
properties.
4. Gate NK cells as CD3- CD16+ CD56+ and NKT cells as CD3+
CD16+ CD56+.
5. Record and analyze the data, ensuring appropriate gating and
quality of results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Run quality control samples with each assay batch to ensure
accuracy and reliability of test results.
8. Review quality control results and follow troubleshooting
procedures for any deviations outside acceptable limits.
9. Ensure proper maintenance and calibration records for the flow
cytometer.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Review and validate the data generated from the flow cytometry
analysis.
12. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
13. Report calculated percentages and absolute counts of NK and
NKT cells.
14. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly collected specimens may yield
inaccurate results.
• Sample handling and storage conditions are critical to preserving
cell viability and accurate results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for antibodies and reagents.
• Flow cytometer user manual.
• Relevant scientific literature on NK and NKT cell analysis.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all specimens processed, daily instrument QC
checks, and any deviations noted.
• Retain results and quality control records as specified by
laboratory protocol.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Maintain documentation of any revisions to this SOP along with
dates and details of changes made.
