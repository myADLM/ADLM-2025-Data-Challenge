STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF NECROTIZING MYOPATHY
EVALUATION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed and standardized
protocol for the analytical phase of Necrotizing Myopathy Evaluation,
Serum. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable results,
maintaining the integrity of the testing process while adhering to CLIA
regulations.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document all analytical testing procedures as described in this
SOP. Technologists must ensure that all equipment is calibrated and
functioning properly. It is the responsibility of the supervisory staff to
ensure compliance and to address any discrepancies or issues
during the analytical phase.
1. SCOPE
This SOP covers all steps in the analytical phase of testing for
Necrotizing Myopathy Evaluation, Serum, including equipment setup,
reagent preparation, sample analysis, quality control, and result
documentation.
1. DEFINITION
Necrotizing Myopathy Evaluation, Serum involves the detection and
quantification of various antibodies associated with necrotizing
myopathy, an autoimmune muscle disease characterized by muscle
weakness and necrosis.
1. PROCEDURE
A. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Autoimmune-specific immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate washer
• Absorbent wipes
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Distilled water
• Anti-HMGCR, Anti-SRP, and other related antibody specific ELISA
kits or equivalent
B. REAGENT PREPARATION
• Use only reagents supplied with the testing kits.
• Store reagents as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
C. SAMPLE PREPARATION
• Serum specimens must be properly collected, labeled, and stored
as per pre-analytical procedures.
• Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature and mix
gently by inversion prior to analysis.
• Inspect specimens for any hemolysis or clotting. Reject and
request a new sample if necessary.
D. ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
1. Preparation of ELISA Plate:
◦ Remove the ELISA plate from the packaging.
◦ Ensure each well is clean and free from contaminants.
2. Adding Samples and Controls:
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and test specimens.
◦ Use pipette to add 100 μL of standard, control, and patient
sample to appropriate wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover plate with adhesive seal or lid.
◦ Incubate at the temperature and duration specified in the kit
insert, typically at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash plate using an automated plate washer or manually
with a wash bottle. Typically, wash 3-5 times with wash
buffer provided in the kit.
5. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add specified amount of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate plate as described in the insert, usually at 37°C for
30-60 minutes.
6. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add enzyme substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for required time, typically 15-30 minutes in the
dark.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
◦ Mix by gently tapping the side of the plate.
8. Reading Results:
◦ Measure absorbance using an ELISA plate reader at the
wavelength specified in the kit (commonly 450 nm).
◦ Record absorbance values.
E. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that positive and negative controls are run with each
assay batch.
• Results for controls should be within the manufacturer's specified
range.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken if controls fall outside expected ranges.
F. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Compare sample absorbance readings to the standard curve to
determine antibody concentrations.
• Interpret and categorize results following the criteria outlined in
the kit instructions.
• Document and review results before reporting.
G. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are transcribed into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Each result must be verified by a qualified technologist.
• Critical values or anomalies should be flagged and discussed with
the supervising pathologist.
1. REFERENCES
• Relevant ELISA Kit Manufacturers’ Inserts (e.g., HMGCR ELISA
kit, SRP ELISA kit)
• CLIA regulations and guidelines
• Internal laboratory quality control manuals
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any revisions made to this protocol including dates and
a summary of changes.
1. APPROVAL
• This SOP is approved by the Laboratory Director and the Quality
Assurance Officer on [date].
1. APPENDICES
• Any additional forms, charts, or templates used in the analytical
phase process.
By following this detailed SOP, the laboratory ensures the
accuracy and reliability of Necrotizing Myopathy Evaluation,
Serum results, supporting quality patient care and diagnostics.
