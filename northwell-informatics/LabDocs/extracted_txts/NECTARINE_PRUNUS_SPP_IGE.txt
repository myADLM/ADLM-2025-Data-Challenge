Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generating
Results for NECTARINE (PRUNUS SPP) IGE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Nectarine (Prunus spp) IgE in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This includes preparation, processing, analysis,
and interpretation of results, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
the test outcomes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
procedures defined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all personnel are trained and competent in these procedures.
1. DEFINITION
The Nectarine (Prunus spp) IgE test is an in vitro assay to measure
the level of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against the
allergen from the Prunus species (Nectarine).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimens: - Preferred: Serum - Acceptable: Plasma (heparin or
EDTA anticoagulated)
Specimen Collection: - Collect blood specimen in a serum separator
tube (SST) or a plasma tube. - Allow the blood specimen to clot at
room temperature. - Centrifuge and separate serum or plasma from
cells within 2 hours of collection. - Specimens should be stored at
2-8°C if analyzed within 72 hours, or frozen at -20°C or below for
longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. - Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 2
hours. - Specimens that have been subjected to repeated freeze/
thaw cycles.
Specimen Stability: - Serum/plasma at 2-8°C: Stable for 72 hours. -
Serum/plasma frozen at -20°C: Stable for up to 3 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - Centrifuge - Serum/plasma separator tubes - IgE
analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP or equivalent)
Reagents: - Specific IgE reagent kits for Nectarine (Prunus spp) -
Quality control materials (low, medium, high IgE levels)
Supplies: - Pipettes and pipette tips - Sample tubes - Gloves and
PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation: 1. Verify the identity of the specimens and
ensure proper labeling. 2. Allow frozen samples to thaw at room
temperature and mix thoroughly. 3. Centrifuge specimens if needed
to remove any particulate matter. 4. Transfer aliquots of serum/
plasma to appropriately labeled sample tubes for analysis.
B. Assay Setup: 1. Turn on the IgE analyzer and allow it to initialize
according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2. Load the specific IgE
reagent kits and quality control materials onto the analyzer. 3.
Program the analyzer with the appropriate test parameters for
Nectarine (Prunus spp) IgE.
C. Running the Assay: 1. Load the prepared serum/plasma samples
into the designated sample tray of the analyzer. 2. Start the assay run
following the analyzer's operating procedures. 3. Monitor the analyzer
for any errors or alerts during the run.
D. Quality Control: 1. Run quality control materials at the beginning of
each batch and verify that results are within acceptable ranges. 2.
Document all quality control results. 3. If QC results are out of range,
troubleshoot and resolve issues before proceeding with patient
samples.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Review the IgE analyzer output for each sample.
• Interpret the results based on the reference values provided by
the reagent kit manufacturer.
• Document the results according to laboratory reporting guidelines.
Reference Values: - Negative: <0.35 kU/L - Positive: ≥0.35 kU/L
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the accuracy of the results and ensure all quality control
criteria have been met.
• Report results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical results should be reviewed by a senior technologist or
supervisor before final reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Maintain detailed records of all QC runs, calibration, and
maintenance activities for the IgE analyzer.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability of IgE assays.
