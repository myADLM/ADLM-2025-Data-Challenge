Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Negative Control, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a comprehensive procedure
for the use of negative controls in analytical techniques to ensure
accuracy, validate testing processes, and identify any potential
sources of contamination or procedural errors.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow these
procedures, document findings, and resolve any issues identified with
negative control results, in collaboration with the laboratory
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Negative Control: A sample that does not contain the target
analyte(s) or any reactive components, meant to verify that the
results are not influenced by external or procedural contaminants.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of the Negative Control:
1. Use a commercially available or laboratory-prepared control
material known to be free of the analyte(s) of interest.
2. Store negative control materials as per manufacturer’s
instructions and laboratory SOPs to maintain stability until use.
B. Running the Negative Control:
1. Label the negative control appropriately with identification
details such as date and time.
2. Process the negative control sample exactly as test samples,
adhering strictly to the established protocols for the specific test
method employed.
3. Include the negative control in each batch or run of tests to
monitor each procedure's validity.
C. Analysis of Negative Control:
1. Run the negative control through the applicable analytical
instrument following standard testing procedures.
2. Log the negative control results according to the laboratory’s
documentation requirements.
D. Evaluation of Negative Control Results:
1. The negative control should show no reaction or result
indicative of the presence of the analyte.
2. Record results in the Negative Control Monitoring Log, ensuring
details such as date, time, and technician initials are included.
3. If any reactivity or unexpected results are observed, consider
the control as failed.
E. Quality Control and Corrective Actions:
1. If the negative control shows any positive result or anomaly: i)
Halt testing and re-examine the test procedures and
environment for potential contamination sources. ii) Re-run the
negative control to confirm results. iii) If contamination issues
persist, expand the investigation to adjacent testing areas,
reagents, and equipment. iv) Document all corrective actions
taken in the Negative Control Monitoring Log.
2. Notify the designated supervisor of persistent failures and work
collaboratively to resolve issues.
3. Maintain records of all actions and resolutions.
F. Documentation:
1. Ensure that log entries for negative controls include: i)
Temperature and condition of storage. ii) Date and time. iii)
Technician’s initials. iv) Observations.
2. Archive Negative Control Monitoring Logs according to
laboratory retention policies.
3. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Designated staff will review all Negative Control Monitoring Logs
regularly for completeness, consistency, and any unresolved issues.
Negative control results shall be part of the regular auditing process
by the Quality Assurance team to ensure adherence to protocols and
documentation practices. Any trends in negative control failures will
be analyzed, with appropriate preventive actions implemented.

Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for negative control
preparations and handling. Internal laboratory SOPs relevant to
specific test methods. CLIA regulations and guidelines regarding
quality assurance and control measures in clinical laboratories.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVALS
This protocol will be reviewed annually and updated as needed.
Document changes, enhance clarity, or improve laboratory practices
in the Negative Control Monitoring Log, tracking amendments
correspondingly.
