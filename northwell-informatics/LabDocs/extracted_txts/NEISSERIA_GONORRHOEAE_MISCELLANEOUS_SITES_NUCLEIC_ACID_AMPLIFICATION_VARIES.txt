Standard Operating Procedure
for Analytical Phase: Detection
of Neisseria Gonorrhoeae from
Miscellaneous Sites using
Nucleic Acid Amplification
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae from specimens collected from
various sites using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing NAAT for Neisseria gonorrhoeae
detection are responsible for following this SOP. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring the adherence to this SOP
and maintaining the quality control and training of staff.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Swabs from the urogenital tract, rectum,
pharynx, and conjunctiva.
• Specimen Collection: Specimens should be collected using
appropriate collection kits as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
Ensure proper labeling with patient information, collection site,
and date.
• Specimen Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately and processed within 72 hours of
collection to ensure optimal results.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Nucleic Acid Amplification Test Kit specific for Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
• Real-time PCR Instrument
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab
coat
• Sterile, nuclease-free tubes and reagents
• Calibration and quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 PRE-ANALYTICAL PREPARATION
1. Specimen Handling: Ensure specimens are adequately mixed
and transferred according to the safety and handling guidelines.
Maintain chain of custody.
2. Reagent Preparation: Thaw all reagents and prepare the
master mix according to the NAAT kit instructions. Include
controls as specified.
5.2 NUCLEIC ACID EXTRACTION
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Vortex the specimen briefly.
◦ Transfer an aliquot of the specimen to a sterile, nuclease-
free tube.
2. Lysis:
◦ Add lysis buffer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Vortex the mix and incubate at room temperature or 55°C as
indicated in the protocol.
3. Purification:
◦ Use the NAAT kit extraction system to purify nucleic acids.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for each step, ensuring
all centrifugation steps are performed at the recommended
speeds and times.
5.3 PCR AMPLIFICATION
1. Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Include negative, positive, and internal controls to validate
the run.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Add a specific volume of extracted nucleic acid to the PCR
master mix in each reaction well.
◦ Seal the reaction tubes or plate properly.
3. Thermocycling:
◦ Place prepared tubes on the Real-Time PCR instrument.
◦ Run the programmed thermal profile for amplification which
typically involves:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Cycling: (e.g., 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute)
repeated for 40 cycles
4. Detection:
◦ Monitor the amplification in real-time. Software will record
and analyze the fluorescent signals.
5.4 POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the amplification plots and determine the cycle
threshold (Ct) values.
◦ Compare Ct values of patient specimens with those of the
controls.
2. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Positive Result: Specimens with a Ct value below or equal
to the threshold set by the manufacturer (usually compared
to the positive control).
◦ Negative Result: Specimens without amplification or with a
Ct value above the threshold indicating no detectable
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
◦ Inconclusive Result: If internal/negative controls fail,
results should be considered inconclusive, and repeat
testing should be performed.
3. Reporting:
◦ Record and validate results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure results conform to the interpretation guidelines and
include any necessary comments for non-standard results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform routine quality control checks using internal and
external standards.
2. Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of analytical
instruments as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
3. Document all QC activities, deviations, and corrective actions
throughout the process.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Amplification Failure:
◦ Ensure all reagents are within the expiry date and stored
correctly.
◦ Verify the integrity and proper preparation of the master mix.
◦ Check the functionality of the thermocycler.
2. Erroneous Controls:
◦ Re-extract and re-test the controls and patient samples in a
fresh batch.
◦ Review all steps for potential contamination or handling
errors.
