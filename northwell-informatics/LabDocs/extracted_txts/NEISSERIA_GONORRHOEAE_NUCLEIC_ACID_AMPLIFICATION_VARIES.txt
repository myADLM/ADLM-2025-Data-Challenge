NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION
TEST (NAAT) SOP
1. PURPOSE
The Neisseria gonorrhoeae Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is
used to detect the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in clinical
specimens. This procedure outlines the steps required for the
accurate and efficient detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae using
NAAT.
1. DEFINITION
Neisseria gonorrhoeae: A bacterium that causes gonorrhea, a
common sexually transmitted infection. Nucleic Acid Amplification
Test (NAAT): A highly sensitive method used to detect and amplify the
genetic material of the target organism.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
NAAT according to this protocol, documenting all actions, and
reporting results. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
ensuring compliance with this protocol and addressing any issues
that arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen Types:
• Urine (first catch)
• Urethral swabs in males and endocervical swabs in females
• Rectal and oropharyngeal swabs
• Vaginal swabs
Specimen Storage:
• Store at 2-8°C if not tested immediately
Specimen Stability:
• Urine specimens: Stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature
and up to 7 days when refrigerated.
• Swab specimens: Stable for up to 5 days at room temperature.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• NAAT instrument (e.g., Cepheid GeneXpert, Hologic Panther,
Roche Cobas 4800)
• NAAT reagent kits specific for Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(manufacturer-specific)
• Microcentrifuge (if required by protocol)
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Verify specimen identity and suitability for testing (e.g.,
adequate volume, proper labeling, time of collection).
2. Record specimen details in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
B) Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare reagents and consumables according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been properly stored.
C) Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. If the NAAT instrument requires nucleic acid extraction, follow
the manufacturer’s instructions to extract nucleic acid from the
specimen.
D) Amplification and Detection
1. Load the extracted nucleic acid or primary specimens into the
NAAT instrument as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Program the instrument using the appropriate settings and
assay parameters for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
3. Start the amplification process and ensure that no errors are
flagged by the instrument.
4. Upon completion of the run, review the results provided by the
instrument.
E) Quality Control
1. Run appropriate positive and negative control specimens with
each run to ensure assay validity.
2. Document and analyze control results. If controls fail, do not
report patient results, and initiate troubleshooting.
3. Use external quality control programs periodically to ensure
accuracy of test results.
F) Interpretation of Results
1. Positive results indicate the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae
nucleic acids in the specimen.
2. Negative results indicate the absence of detectable Neisseria
gonorrhoeae nucleic acids in the specimen.
3. Indeterminate results must be retested with a new aliquot of the
specimen or a new specimen if possible.
4. Inconclusive results require further clinical correlation and may
need repeat testing or alternative diagnostic methods.
G) Reporting Results
1. Enter the test results into the LIS.
2. Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results, ensuring
that critical values are communicated promptly.
3. Verify that all laboratory data fields have been completed and
ensure accurate transcription of results.
4. Provide the final report to the requesting clinician with a
comment if additional testing is recommended.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Assay performance may be affected by inhibitors present in
clinical specimens.
• Inappropriate specimen collection or handling can lead to false-
negative results.
• Cross-contamination can lead to false-positive results; exercise
caution and use appropriate techniques.

This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or as needed
based on new technologies and practices. Any deviations or
adjustments to this procedure require approval from the laboratory
supervisor.
