STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Protocol for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Self-Collect,
Amplified RNA, Vaginal
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP describes the procedure for the detection of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae RNA in self-collected vaginal swabs using nucleic acid
amplification testing (NAAT). This process includes the preparation,
analysis, and documentation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting the
testing.
• Supervisors ensure all steps are followed according to the
procedure and validate results
• All staff must report any irregularities or issues to their
supervisors.
1. SPECIMEN:
• Self-collected vaginal swabs in provided collection kits,
transported to the laboratory within the stability timeframe outlined
by the kit manufacturer.
• Unacceptable specimens: Samples that are not properly labeled,
not collected within the kit instructions, or are damaged.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• NAAT testing kits specific for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (RNATestR)
• Sterile pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Thermal cycler/amplification system
• Positive and negative controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify specimen adequacy and labeling. Discard unacceptable
specimens.
2. Wear PPE including gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
3. Use the vortex to mix the specimen for 10-15 seconds.
4. Prepare the workspace and reagents as per kit instructions.
5. In a sterile manner, transfer the required volume of the sample
to the reaction tube containing lysis buffer. Vortex briefly and
incubate as per the manufacturer's instructions.
B) NAAT Steps:
1. Place the reaction tubes in the thermal cycler. Ensure a
balanced configuration.
2. Load the reagents into the reagent reservoirs without
contaminating them.
3. Program the thermal cycler with the temperatures and cycle
times as specified in the NAAT kit manual.
4. Begin the amplification cycle.
5. Once completed, remove the reaction tubes.
C) Post-Analytical Processing:
1. Read the amplification results following the thermal cycler
instructions.
2. Document the results clearly noting the interpretation per the kit
instructions.
3. Ensure the integrity of controls:
◦ Positive control: Must show amplification.
◦ Negative control: Must show no amplification.
4. If controls are invalid, repeat the test.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Positive: Indication of Neisseria gonorrhoeae RNA detected.
• Negative: No Neisseria gonorrhoeae RNA detected.
• Indeterminate: Re-test for clarification if results are inconclusive or
controls fail.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control using positive and negative controls with
each run.
• Document control results and validate against expected
outcomes.
• Report any deviations or discrepancies to the supervisor
immediately.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure result verification by a supervisor or authorized personnel
before release.
• For positive results, follow the procedure for notification and
patient follow-up.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Not applicable for qualitative test.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL:
• Dispose of all biological samples and materials in accordance
with biohazard waste disposal protocols.
• Decontaminate surfaces and equipment after use.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Non-specific RNA may cause false-positive results.
• The test is limited to correctly collected and stored samples.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instruction manuals for RNA amplification kit and
thermal cycler used.
• CLIA guidelines for handling and processing specimens.
This SOP is effective immediately and must be followed in all
laboratory settings conducting Neisseria gonorrhoeae RNA amplified
testing. Updated October 2023.
