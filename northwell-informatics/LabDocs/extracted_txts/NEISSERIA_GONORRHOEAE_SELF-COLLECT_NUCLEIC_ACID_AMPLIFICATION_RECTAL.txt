Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for detecting Neisseria
gonorrhoeae in self-collected rectal samples using nucleic acid
amplification (NAA). This ensures the timely and accurate
identification of the pathogen for appropriate treatment.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff members are responsible for performing the
nucleic acid amplification procedure, documenting results, and
ensuring quality control.
• Supervisors must ensure adherence to SOP, evaluate performed
procedures, and address any deviations or issues.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in NAA
procedures specific to Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
1. DEFINITION
Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) tests are highly specific molecular
methods for detecting genetic material of pathogens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable Source: Self-collected rectal swabs.
• Specimen Transport: Swabs should be transported in the
appropriate transport media and delivered to the laboratory
promptly. Store at 2-8°C if processing is delayed.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Dry swabs, swabs not in transport
media, improperly labeled specimens, and specimens received
after 48 hours without proper refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• NAA test kit specific for Neisseria gonorrhoeae
• NAA-compatible thermal cycler
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and sterile filter tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Clean benches and workstations
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Negative Control: Ensure no contamination in each run.
• Positive Control: Verify the efficiency of the amplification process.
This includes a known positive sample.
• Internal Control: Endogenous internal control to confirm nucleic
acid extraction efficiency.
1. PROCEDURE
Step A: Sample Preparation
1. Don appropriate PPE and work within a clean bench to prevent
contamination.
2. Vortex the specimens for 10-15 seconds.
3. Transfer 200 μL of the sample into a labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
4. Add the appropriate volume of nucleic acid extraction buffer (as
specified by the kit's manufacturer). Follow the manufacturer's
instructions for the incubation step.
5. Centrifuge the sample briefly to remove bubbles.
6. Proceed with nucleic acid extraction as per the kit instructions.
Step B: Nucleic Acid Amplification
1. Prepare the master mix, including the polymerase, primers,
probes, dNTPs, magnesium chloride, and water, as specified by
the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Aliquot the master mix into the PCR tubes or wells.
3. Add the extracted nucleic acid into the appropriate wells/tubes.
◦ Negative Control: Add nuclease-free water.
◦ Positive Control: Add the known positive sample.
4. Seal the PCR tubes or plate and place it in the thermal cycler.
Step C: Amplification and Detection
1. Run the thermal cycler following the optimised cycling
conditions: denaturation, annealing, extension based on the
manufacturer's protocol.
2. Once the run is completed, transfer the plate or tubes to the
detection system.
3. Record and analyze the fluorescence readings.
Step D: Interpretation of Results
1. Verify that the amplification curves for the positive controls and
internal controls meet their expected values.
2. Check that the negative control shows no amplification.
3. Interpret patient sample results based on the threshold cycle
(Ct) values:
◦ Positive: Ct value below the designated threshold.
◦ Negative: No Ct value or Ct value above the threshold.
◦ Inhibitory: Internal control fails to amplify; re-extraction may
be required.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Document all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
6. Verify and validate each result before submission.
7. Report results to the requesting clinician or department
following site-specific guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Indicates the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae nucleic
acid.
• Negative: Indicates the absence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae nucleic
acid.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If amplification fails for controls, repeat the procedure or consult
the supervisor.
• If the internal control fails, re-extract the samples using a different
batch of reagents.
