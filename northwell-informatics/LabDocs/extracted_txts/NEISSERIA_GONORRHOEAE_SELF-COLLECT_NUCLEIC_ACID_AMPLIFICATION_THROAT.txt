Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, Self-Collect, Nucleic Acid Amplification,
Throat
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for performing
the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for the detection of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae from self-collected throat specimens. This
procedure ensures accurate and consistent results for the presence
of Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in patient samples.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel who perform NAAT
testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae using throat swab specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this protocol to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Self-collected throat swabs
• Collection Device: Approved collection kit containing sterile swab
and transport media
• Transport: Specimens must be transported to the laboratory at
2-8°C and processed within 72 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) kit specifically for Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
• Thermocycler or real-time PCR machine
• Sterile, nuclease-free tubes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, face
shield/safety goggles
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Verify the specimen:
◦ Confirm that the specimen is appropriately labeled with
patient information and collection date.
◦ Ensure that the specimen is accompanied by a correctly
filled requisition form.
2. Inspect the specimen:
◦ Check for any leakage or contamination.
◦ Ensure that the specimen is consistent with the expected
appearance (e.g., proper collection kit, appropriate transport
media).
B. Specimen Processing
1. Perform specimen preparation in a biosafety cabinet (Class II):
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Vortex the specimen for 10 seconds to ensure thorough
mixing.
◦ Using a sterile, nuclease-free pipette tip, transfer the
recommended volume of transport media containing the
specimen to a sterile nuclease-free tube.
2. NAAT Preparation:
◦ Prepare the reaction mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions provided with the NAAT kit.
◦ Aliquot the reaction mix into the appropriate number of PCR
tubes or plates, as specified in the kit instructions.
3. Add Specimen to Reaction Mix:
◦ Add the specified volume of the prepared specimen to each
NAAT reaction tube or well.
◦ Ensure that specimens are handled to avoid contamination
between samples.
4. Negative and Positive Controls:
◦ Include negative and positive controls with each batch of
tests.
▪ Negative control: Nuclease-free water or provided
control.
▪ Positive control: Provided NAAT kit control for Neisseria
gonorrhoeae.
C. Amplification and Detection
1. Load the PCR tubes or plate into the thermocycler or real-time
PCR machine.
2. Program the thermocycler according to the NAAT kit
specifications:
◦ Initial denaturation step
◦ Amplification cycles (denaturation, annealing, extension)
3. Start the amplification process and monitor for completion.
D. Post-Amplification Analysis
1. Review the amplification curves:
◦ Positive result: Presence of exponential amplification curve
indicating Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA.
◦ Negative result: Absence of amplification curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that the negative and positive controls have produced
the expected results.
◦ If controls do not meet expected outcomes, invalidate the
run and repeat.
E. Result Interpretation
1. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS):
◦ Positive: Detected Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
◦ Negative: Not detected.
◦ Invalid: If controls failed or specimen showed inhibition,
recommend recollection.
2. Update patient records and prepare the report for clinician
review.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of thermocyclers
and other equipment.
• Run periodic proficiency testing and validation checks to ensure
assay performance.
• Document all the QC activities in the QC log.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA detected
• Negative: Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA not detected
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This assay is not intended to be used as a primary diagnostic
assay for other pathogens.
• Detection is limited to the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae
DNA, false negatives can occur due to inhibitors or suboptimal
specimen collection.
