Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Assessing Neisseria meningitidis IgG Vaccine Response
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical procedures
involved in assessing the Neisseria meningitidis IgG vaccine
response. The purpose is to ensure accurate and consistent results
in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing the Neisseria meningitidis IgG vaccine response assay in
a CLIA-certified laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Personnel: Conduct the assay as per the defined
protocol and document proceedings.
• Supervisors: Ensure the training of staff, availability of reagents
and supplies, and address any issues arising during the analytical
phase.
• Quality Control Supervisors: Review and verify documented
results, including quality controls and assay calibrations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect venous blood using appropriate venipuncture technique.
• Centrifuge blood samples to separate the serum within 2 hours of
collection.
• Specimen should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately
and can be stored at -20°C for longer durations.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Samples with insufficient volume or improperly labeled samples.
• Samples received beyond the stability period without proper
storage.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA plate reader
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• Neisseria meningitidis IgG ELISA kit (including antigen-coated
plates, calibrators, controls, wash buffer, and substrate solution)
• Blocking buffer
• Stop solution
• Distilled water
Supplies:
• ELISA plates
• Plate seals
• Centrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature.
◦ Prepare wash buffer according to the kit instructions.
◦ Label your plate, calibrators, and controls clearly.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw stored specimens and vortex to mix.
◦ Dilute serum samples as recommended by the ELISA kit
instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Add provided antigen-specific capture antibody to each well.
◦ Add blocking buffer and wash after incubation as per kit
protocol to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add appropriate volumes of diluted samples, calibrators,
and controls to the respective wells.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for the specified time
(usually 1-2 hours).
3. Washing Procedure:
◦ Wash the plate multiple times with wash buffer to remove
unbound components.
4. Detection Antibody:
◦ Add detection antibody to each well
◦ Seal and incubate at room temperature as specified in the
kit instructions.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate the plate for the
recommended time while avoiding exposure to light.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the plate at the specified wavelength using an ELISA
plate reader.
◦ Save and document the optical density (OD) readings.
C. Results Calculation
1. Generate Standard Curve:
◦ Plot OD values of calibrators against their known
concentrations to create a standard curve.
2. Calculate Sample Concentrations:
◦ Compare the OD values of the samples to the standard
curve to calculate the Neisseria meningitidis IgG
concentrations in the patient samples.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
◦ Ensure controls are within the specified range.
◦ Repeat the assay if controls are out of range.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external quality assurance programs bi-
annually.
◦ Document all results and corrective actions if discrepancies
are found.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document assay results clearly in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Verify results by a second technologist or supervisor prior to
releasing them.
• Flag any abnormal or critical values for further review.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of calibrators, controls, and patient results.
• Keep logs of any deviations, corrective actions, and equipment
maintenance.
• Store completed assay data and quality control records for
traceability and audits.

Ensure all laboratory personnel are trained on this SOP and
understand the key steps and responsibilities. Regular audits and
reviews should be conducted to maintain adherence to this protocol.
