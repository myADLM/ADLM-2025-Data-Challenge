Neonatal Bilirubin, Serum Analysis (NBSA) Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for the analysis of neonatal serum
bilirubin levels to ensure accuracy, consistency, and compliance with
regulatory guidelines.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document all activities involved in the analysis of neonatal
bilirubin, including sample handling, testing, quality control, and result
reporting. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
staff are trained and adhere to this protocol.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all neonatal bilirubin assays conducted
within the laboratory using serum samples.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using a standard venipuncture technique in a serum
separator tube (SST). If using a capillary blood collection system,
ensure collection in appropriate microhematocrit tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• Preferred: 0.5 mL serum
• Minimum: 0.3 mL serum
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 1 month
Specimen Handling:
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for a minimum of 30
minutes before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge samples within 2 hours of collection.
• Carefully transfer the serum into a labeled, secondary container if
required.
• Avoid hemolysis as it may interfere with the assay.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens with insufficient volume
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Total bilirubin reagent kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Calibrators and controls for total bilirubin
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Optical density reading equipment or automated bilirubin analyzer
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Quality control material at two levels (Normal and High)
Procedure:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each day of
testing, after maintenance procedures, and with each new lot of
reagents.
• Record the results in the quality control log.
• Analyte measurements should fall within the established
acceptable range.
Corrective Actions:
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, do not
proceed with patient testing until the issue is resolved.
• Recalibrate the instrument and repeat quality control testing.
• Document all corrective actions taken.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the total bilirubin reagent kit.
• Laboratory's quality control policy.
8. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Allow the serum sample to reach room temperature if previously
refrigerated.
• Gently mix the serum sample by inversion.
Daily Instrument Preparation:
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Run and record quality control materials to ensure the instrument
is functioning correctly.
Testing Procedure:
1. Load the serum sample onto the designated sample site on the
analyzer.
2. Input required patient information (e.g., patient ID, date of birth).
3. Select the specific neonatal bilirubin assay from the analyzer's
menu.
4. Initiate the analysis process and allow the instrument to
complete the assay.
Result Interpretation:
• Review the bilirubin concentration provided by the analyzer.
• Ensure the result falls within the expected neonatal reference
range (normally 0-1.2 mg/dL for neonates, but may be higher
initially as the liver matures).
• Validate the result according to laboratory guidelines.
Reporting Results:
• Verify and document test results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Ensure results are communicated promptly to the requesting
clinician, especially if the bilirubin level is critically high, according
to the laboratory’s critical reporting guidelines.
Critical Values:
• Communicate any critical results as per laboratory protocol.
• Document the notification process, including the date, time, and
the person notified.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with assay results.
• Presence of contaminants or prolonged exposure to light can
degrade bilirubin in the sample.
10. REFERENCES
• Bilirubin analysis protocol from the reagent manufacturer.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs for sample processing, quality control, calibration,
maintenance, and corrective actions.
• Keep records for a minimum of two years or as per the
institutional policy.
End of Protocol
This protocol provides comprehensive guidelines for the analytical
phase of neonatal bilirubin testing in serum samples, ensuring
consistent, accurate, and reliable results in compliance with clinical
and laboratory standards.
