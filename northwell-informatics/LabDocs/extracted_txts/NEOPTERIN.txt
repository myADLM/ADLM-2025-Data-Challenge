Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Neopterin Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The aim of this SOP is to outline the procedures for analyzing
neopterin levels in human specimens in order to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for following this procedure
to ensure accurate measurement of neopterin in specimens. It is the
responsibility of the supervisors to ensure that the technologists are
properly trained and that the equipment is adequately maintained and
calibrated.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Specimen Type:
• Plasma or serum samples are acceptable.
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood samples using standard venipuncture techniques.
Transfer the collected blood into an appropriate container (e.g.,
vacuum tubes with appropriate anticoagulant for plasma or serum
separator tubes for serum).
• Ensure the tube is correctly labeled with patient information and
time of collection.
• Gently invert the plasma tubes 8-10 times to mix anticoagulant.
• Centrifuge blood samples to separate plasma or serum according
to laboratory protocols.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples in tubes containing inappropriate anticoagulants (e.g.,
sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA).
• Specimens not properly labeled or that lack essential information.
Storage and Stability:
• Plasma or serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if they will be
analyzed within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower
and are stable for up to 6 months.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with
Fluorescence Detector
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Neopterin standards
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., phosphate buffer, methanol)
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Standards and Quality Control Materials:
1. Prepare neopterin stock solutions according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare working standards by serial dilutions of the stock
solutions.
3. Prepare quality control materials at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and vortex to mix.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
3. Pipette 100 µL of the clear plasma or serum into a clean
microcentrifuge tube.
HPLC Method:
1. Turn on the HPLC system and allow it to equilibrate according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase and degas if necessary.
3. Set up the HPLC system parameters as follows:
◦ Column: C18 reversed-phase column
◦ Mobile phase: Phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and methanol
mixture (90:10 v/v)
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Fluorescence detector excitation: 353 nm
◦ Fluorescence detector emission: 438 nm
4. Inject 20 µL of calibration standards, quality controls, and
samples in sequence.
5. Record the retention times and peak areas for neopterin in
standards, quality controls, and samples.
6. Construct a calibration curve by plotting peak areas versus
concentration for standards.
7. Calculate neopterin concentrations in samples using the
calibration curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each
batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable limits. If
not, troubleshoot and resolve before proceeding with sample
analysis.
3. Calibrate the HPLC system regularly according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify the calculated neopterin concentrations.
2. Report results in designated units (e.g., nmol/L) on the
laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Ensure critical results are communicated to the appropriate
clinical team according to laboratory protocol.
8. MAINTAINING RECORDS
1. Maintain records of all calibration, quality control, and patient
results.
2. Document any deviations or issues encountered and the
corrective actions taken.
