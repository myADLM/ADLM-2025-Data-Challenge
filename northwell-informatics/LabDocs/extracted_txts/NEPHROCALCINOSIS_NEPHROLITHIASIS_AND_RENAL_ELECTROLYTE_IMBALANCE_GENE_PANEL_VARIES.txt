Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Nephrocalcinosis, Nephrolithiasis, and Renal Electrolyte
Imbalance Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a comprehensive guide for evaluating and generating
results for the Nephrocalcinosis, Nephrolithiasis, and Renal
Electrolyte Imbalance Gene Panel analysis.
Responsibility: Designated staff trained in molecular genetics and
sequencing techniques will perform the analysis, interpret results,
and document findings as defined in this procedure. Supervisors
ensure adherence to protocols, proper documentation, and resolution
of any deviations.
1. DEFINITION:
Nephrocalcinosis, Nephrolithiasis, and Renal Electrolyte Imbalance
Gene Panel encompasses the analysis of genes commonly
implicated in renal calcium deposition, kidney stone formation, and
disturbances in renal electrolyte balance.
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Preparation:
a. DNA Extraction:
• Extract genomic DNA from collected blood or tissue samples
using an approved extraction kit.
• Quantify DNA using spectrophotometry (e.g., Nanodrop) and
evaluate quality using gel electrophoresis.
b. DNA Quality Control:
• Ensure DNA concentration is ≥ 20 ng/μl with a total of ≥ 1 μg
DNA.
• Quality check: A260/280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0.
B. Library Preparation:
a. Target Enrichment:
• Perform target enrichment using a validated capture method
specific for the genes in the panel.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for hybridization, washing,
and capturing the target DNA.
b. Library Construction:
• Construct libraries using a validated library preparation kit.
• Amplify target-enriched libraries using PCR and validate library
size distribution using capillary electrophoresis or bioanalyzer.
C. Sequencing:
a. Sequencing Platform:
• Use a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g.,
Illumina, Ion Torrent) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
b. Sequencing Run:
• Load the library onto the sequencing platform and initiate the run.
• Monitor the sequencing run, ensuring optimal cluster density and
sequencing quality metrics.
D. Data Analysis & Interpretation:
a. Raw Data Processing:
• Convert raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) to aligned sequences
(BAM files) using the validated alignment algorithm.
• Perform variant calling using a validated variant caller, generating
a variant call format (VCF) file.
b. Variant Filtering and Annotation:
• Apply quality filters to eliminate low-quality variants.
• Annotate variants using a validated annotation pipeline, matching
obtained variants with databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
c. Interpretation:
• Review annotated variants, focusing on pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variants related to nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis,
and renal electrolyte imbalance.
• If necessary, consult literature and databases for variant
pathogenicity assessment.
E. Reporting Results:
a. Documentation:
• Generate a detailed report including patient information,
methodology, findings, interpretation, and clinical
recommendations.
• Review and sign off by a qualified molecular genetics specialist.
b. Release:
• Results will be reviewed by a supervisor before release.
• Release results to the ordering physician and retain a copy in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
F. Quality Control Measures:
• Include positive and negative controls in all steps from extraction
to sequencing.
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly comparisons and validation as per
standard internal quality control protocols.
G. Troubleshooting:
• In case of any deviations or issues, inform the supervisor
immediately.
• Document any discrepancies and take corrective actions.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Not applicable. Interpretation will be customized based on clinical
correlation and variant pathogenicity.
1. REFERENCES:
Refer to the gene panel manufacturer's manual, relevant scientific
literature, and laboratory guidelines for gene-specific
recommendations.
1. RECORDS:
Maintain all records including DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing run logs, data analysis reports, QC records, and final
reports as per laboratory guidelines.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including appropriate
PPE.
• Handle chemicals and specimens following biosafety guidelines.
