Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating NETTLE, IgE, Serum (Total Immunoglobulin E) Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and procedures for
the accurate and consistent analysis and reporting of Total
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples to detect potential
allergies, including nettle (urticaria) sensitivity.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the
analytical steps as defined in this procedure, ensuring accurate and
reliable results. Supervisors shall oversee the process, ensuring
compliance with this SOP, and address any deviations or issues as
they arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days when
stored at 2-8°C. For extended storage, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may
interfere with results and should be avoided. Samples stored
beyond the stability period.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Total IgE assay kit (e.g., ELISA or chemiluminescence-based kits
as per laboratory standard)
• Microplate reader (for ELISA)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, if using
chemiluminescence)
• Reagent-grade water and diluents as specified in the assay kit
• Calibrators and controls provided in the assay kit
• Pipettes and tips (10-1000 µL)
• Centrifuge suitable for serum sample processing
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C and -20°C freezers)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each assay run using low,
medium, and high controls.
• Verify that control results fall within the manufacturer’s specified
range before proceeding with sample analysis.
• Document all quality control results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples and controls to reach room temperature
before analysis.
2. Gently mix the samples by inverting the tubes several times.
B. Assay Procedure (Example: ELISA Method):
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Add 100 µL of assay buffer to each well.
◦ Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and patient serum
specimen to the designated wells.
◦ Seal the plate with an adhesive cover.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature according to the kit
instructions (e.g., 1 hour).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash each well 4 times with the provided wash buffer using
an automated plate washer or manually with a multi-channel
pipette.
◦ Ensure that residual liquid is completely removed after the
last wash.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time
specified in the kit.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the
time specified in the kit.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
7. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength
(e.g., 450 nm) using a microplate reader within 30 minutes
of adding the stop solution.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Generate the calibration curve using the absorbance values
of the calibrators.
◦ Ensure the curve meets the manufacturer's specifications
for linearity.
2. Sample Calculation:
◦ Calculate the IgE concentration in each patient specimen
using the calibration curve and the sample absorbance
values.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the IgE concentrations into the LIS.
• Review and verify all results. Flag any abnormal results as per
laboratory protocol.
• Report to the requesting healthcare provider following site-specific
reporting guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Reference the assay kit insert for specific limitations regarding
interfering substances.
• Ensure that the assay meets sensitivity and specificity
requirements.
• Recognize that results from different manufacturer's kits or
methods may not be directly comparable.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference range for total IgE in serum: Varies by age and
manufacturer specifications. (e.g., 0-100 IU/mL)
• Consult manufacturer’s instructions and correlate with specific
population data.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s kit insert and guidelines for Total IgE assay (e.g.,
ELISA kit insert or ImmunoCAP manual)
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Laboratory-specific protocol documents
This protocol aims to ensure high standards for the accuracy and
reliability of Total IgE measurements in serum samples. All personnel
must be trained on and adhere to this SOP to maintain the
laboratory's high-quality standards.
