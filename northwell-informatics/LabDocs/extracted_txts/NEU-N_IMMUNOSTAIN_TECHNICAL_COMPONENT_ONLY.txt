Standard Operating Procedure for NEU-N Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical phase
procedures for performing Neu-N immunostaining, ensuring accurate
and reproducible results in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained and qualified laboratory personnel to
perform Neu-N immunostaining procedures with strict adherence to
this SOP. It is also their responsibility to maintain equipment, manage
reagents, and ensure quality control during the process.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
Fixation: Specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 12-24 hours.
Storage: FFPE blocks should be stored at room temperature and
can be used for prolonged periods.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath (adjusted to 40-45°C)
• Slide-drying oven (adjusted to 50-60°C)
• Staining racks and slide holders
• Ventilated laboratory hood
• Positive control tissue slides
• Neu-N primary antibody
• Secondary antibody and detection system (e.g., EnVision+
System-HRP)
• Mounting medium (e.g., DPX)
• Cover slips
5. REAGENTS
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., Citrate buffer pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution
• Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate
• Hematoxylin
6. PREPARATION
6.1 Slide Preparation
• Cut 4-5 μm thick sections from FFPE blocks using a microtome.
• Place sections on positively charged microscope slides.
• Dry slides in a slide-drying oven for 45-60 minutes at 50-60°C to
ensure proper adhesion.
**6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 10 minutes, twice.
• Rehydrate through graded ethanol series: 100% ethanol for 5
minutes, 95% ethanol for 5 minutes, 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
• Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
7. IMMUNOSTAINING PROCEDURE
7.1 Antigen Retrieval
• Place slides in a pressure cooker with antigen retrieval buffer
(Citrate Buffer pH 6.0).
• Heat at high pressure for 3 minutes or follow manufacturer's
recommendations for optimal retrieval conditions.
• Allow slides to cool for 15-20 minutes in the buffer.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
7.2 Blocking Step
• Apply blocking solution to cover the entire tissue section.
• Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
7.3 Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply Neu-N primary antibody diluted in antibody diluent (dilution
factor as per manufacturer’s recommendations) to cover the
tissue section.
• Incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature in a humidified
chamber.
7.4 Secondary Antibody and Detection System
• Rinse slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes,
twice.
• Apply secondary antibody from the detection system to cover the
tissue section.
• Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, twice.
• Apply DAB substrate solution to cover the tissue section and
incubate until adequate color development is observed under a
microscope (typically 2-5 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
8. COUNTERSTAINING
• Counterstain tissue with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
9. DEHYDRATION AND MOUNTING
• Dehydrate slides through ethanol series: 70% ethanol, 95%
ethanol, and 100% ethanol, each for 1 minute.
• Clear in xylene for 5 minutes, twice.
• Mount coverslips using a mounting medium (e.g., DPX).
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive control slides with each staining run to ensure
reagent integrity and procedural consistency.
• Review slides under a microscope to evaluate staining quality; the
positive control must show appropriate staining for the run to be
valid.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document staining results, noting any discrepancies or staining
issues.
• The stained slides are forwarded to a pathologist for review and
interpretation.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure all equipment and reagents are functioning and not
expired.
• If staining is inconsistent or weak, verify antigen retrieval
conditions, antibody dilutions, and incubation times.
• Address any technical issues identified during quality control and
rectify before the next staining run.
