Protocol for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Neural
Epidermal Growth Factor-Like 1
Protein Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedural steps for analyzing and
generating results for Neural Epidermal Growth Factor-like 1
(NELL-1) Protein Immunostain. The protocol ensures adherence to
quality standards and consistency in result generation, focusing on
the technical component only.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the immunostain procedure, documentation, and
troubleshooting any issues. Supervisors must ensure that protocols
are followed and any discrepancies are addressed promptly.
2. DEFINITIONS
• NELL-1 Protein Immunostain: A specialized staining technique
used to detect the presence of Neural Epidermal Growth Factor-
like 1 Protein in tissue samples.
• Technical Component Only: Refers exclusively to the laboratory
processing and staining of samples, excluding pathological
interpretation.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Pre-Analytical Check
1. Sample Receipt:
◦ Ensure samples are received in appropriate containers.
◦ Confirm that samples are correctly labelled with patient
information, collection date and time.
◦ Record sample details in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Sample Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Adequately prepared tissue samples fixed in formalin and
embedded in paraffin.
◦ Blocks or slides should be intact and free from any obvious
contamination or degradation.
3. Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Primary antibody specific for NELL-1
◦ Detection system appropriate for the NELL-1 antibody used.
◦ Positive and negative control tissue samples.
◦ Automatic slide stainer or manual immunostaining
equipment.
◦ Microscope for result evaluation.
◦ Humidified chamber for manual staining.
B. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-6 micron sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks using a microtome.
◦ Mount sections on positively charged slides and incubate at
60°C for 15-30 minutes to ensure adhesion.
2. Deparaffinization:
◦ Deparaffinize sections by immersion in xylene for 2 x 5
minutes.
◦ Rehydrate sections through a graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 70%) each for 2-3 minutes.
◦ Rinse in deionized water.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or
other specified buffer.
◦ Heat tissue sections in a microwave or water bath for 15-20
minutes.
◦ Cool sections to room temperature and rinse with deionized
water.
4. Blocking Endogenous Activity:
◦ Incubate sections with a blocking agent (e.g., hydrogen
peroxide) to quench endogenous peroxidase activity for 10
minutes.
◦ Wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or similar buffer.
5. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the primary antibody specific for NELL-1 to the tissue
section.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature or
per manufacturer’s instructions (typically 1-2 hours).
◦ Wash sections in PBS.
6. Detection System Application:
◦ Apply a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme (e.g.,
HRP) or other detection system appropriate for the primary
antibody.
◦ Incubate and then wash as per manufacturer’s instructions.
7. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) to visualize the
antibody-antigen interaction.
◦ Monitor color development under a microscope until the
desired intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin and rinse thoroughly.
8. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate sections in graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
◦ Apply cover slips using a mounting medium.
C. Quality Control
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative control sections with each
batch of stains.
◦ Document performance and ensure control sections exhibit
expected staining patterns.
2. Reagent Validation:
◦ Validate all reagents and new lots prior to use following
appropriate validation protocols.
3. Equipment Calibration:
◦ Confirm the calibration and maintenance of all equipment
(e.g., microtome, stainer, microscope) used in the
procedure.
D. Result Evaluation and Documentation
1. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Examine stained slides under a microscope.
◦ Document staining intensity, localization (membranous,
cytoplasmic, nuclear), and consistency with control slides.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all observations, any deviations from the protocol,
and confirmation of quality control assessments in the LIS.
◦ Maintain a record of all batch runs and associated quality
control results.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Report the results of the immunostaining (staining pattern
and intensity) using standard laboratory terminology.
◦ Ensure results are communicated to the appropriate
pathologist for interpretation.
