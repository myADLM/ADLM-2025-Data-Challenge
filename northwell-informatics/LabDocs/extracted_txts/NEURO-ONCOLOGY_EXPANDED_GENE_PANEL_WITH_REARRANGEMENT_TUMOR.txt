Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for NEURO-ONCOLOGY
EXPANDED GENE PANEL WITH REARRANGEMENT, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and
interpretation of the Neuro-Oncology Expanded Gene Panel with
Rearrangement in tumor samples, ensuring accurate and reliable
results for patient care.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel and technologists are
responsible for following and documenting the analytical
procedures.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
the protocol, addressing any procedural discrepancies, and
implementing corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Neuro-Oncology Expanded Gene Panel: A comprehensive
assay designed to detect mutations, rearrangements, and other
genetic alterations in tumor DNA linked to neuro-oncological
conditions.
• Rearrangement: Structural alterations in chromosomes resulting
in oncogenic gene fusions relevant to neuro-oncology.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type & Handling:
◦ Fresh or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor
tissue.
◦ Ensure the specimen is collected using standard surgical
techniques and transported in appropriate conditions to
preserve nucleic acids.
◦ Specimen requirements and stability information are as
follows:
▪ Tissue: Stored at 2-8ºC, preferably analyzed within 24
hours if fresh, or within 6 months if FFPE.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Equipment:
◦ Nucleic acid extraction instruments.
◦ Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina,
Ion Torrent).
◦ Thermal cycler for PCR amplification.
◦ Microplate readers or fluorescence readers for quality control
purposes.
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ DNA extraction kits specific for tumor tissues.
◦ PCR reagents for target amplification.
◦ Library preparation kits for NGS.
◦ Sequencing reagents compatible with the NGS platform.
◦ Control samples (positive and negative controls).
◦ QC (Quality Control) materials for validation.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE:
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Deparaffinize FFPE sections if applicable.
◦ Employ mechanical/enzymatic digestion as per extraction kit
instructions.
◦ Extract DNA using the recommended extraction kit.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure DNA purity (A260/A280 ratio) is within acceptable
limits (1.8-2.0).
◦ Determine DNA integrity by running an aliquot on an
agarose gel or using a bioanalyzer.
B. Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Perform target-specific amplification using PCR reagents
tailored for the Neuro-Oncology Expanded Gene Panel.
◦ Ensure proper thermal cycler settings as provided in the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Prepare NGS libraries following the sequencing platform-
specific kit instructions.
◦ Ligate adapters and indexes to the amplified DNA
fragments.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Load prepared libraries onto the sequencer.
◦ Input run parameters specific to the assay and platform.
◦ Initiate the sequencing run and monitor progress.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Primary Data Analysis:
◦ Utilize sequencing platform software for initial base calling
and quality filtering.
◦ Remove low-quality reads and adapter sequences.
2. Secondary Data Analysis:
◦ Align sequencing reads to the reference genome using
bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, Bowtie).
◦ Identify mutations and gene rearrangements using variant
calling software (e.g., GATK, MuTect).
3. Tertiary Data Analysis:
◦ Annotate variants using databases (e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar).
◦ Prioritize clinically relevant mutations and gene fusions.
◦ Generate a comprehensive report including identified
variants and their clinical significance.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Review and Interpretation:
◦ Technologists review the analyzed data for quality and
accuracy.
◦ Confirm significant findings with additional bioinformatics
review if necessary.
◦ Compile findings into a standardized report format.
6. Verification and Sign-off:
◦ A designated pathologist or molecular geneticist verifies
results.
◦ Upon verification, finalize and sign the report.
◦ Upload results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for electronic medical record integration.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
A. Internal Quality Control: - Include positive and negative controls
in each run. - Perform regular instrument calibration and
maintenance. - Repeat assays showing any discrepancy or falling
outside acceptable control limits.
B. Proficiency Testing: - Participate regularly in external proficiency
testing programs. - Implement corrective actions for any deficiencies
identified during proficiency testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain detailed records of all steps, deviations, and corrective
actions taken.
• Store all raw and processed data per institutional guidelines
ensuring confidentiality and regulatory compliance.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Establish reference intervals for normal and pathological findings
based on assay validation results.
• Identify and document any method limitations, including
sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences.
1. REFERENCES:
• Refer to the manufacturer's manual and kit inserts for detailed
technical guidelines.
• Keep current with scientific literature and updates on
bioinformatics tools, gene panel content, and disease relevance.
