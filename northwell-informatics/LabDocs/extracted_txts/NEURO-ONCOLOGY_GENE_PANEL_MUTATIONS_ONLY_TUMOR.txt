Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Neuro-Oncology Gene
Panel, Mutations Only, Tumor
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
detection of mutations in genes included in the Neuro-Oncology
Gene Panel in tumor samples. This SOP ensures standardized and
accurate detection and reporting of genetic mutations, which is
critical for patient diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment
strategies for neuro-oncological conditions.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the molecular diagnostics laboratory for
processing and analyzing tumor samples for the Neuro-Oncology
Gene Panel. The procedures are to be strictly followed by laboratory
staff trained in molecular biology and genetic testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to:
• Follow the detailed procedures accurately.
• Maintain and validate all required equipment and instruments.
• Document all testing steps and findings.
• Conduct and document Quality Control (QC) measures.
• Report any deviations or issues encountered during the process
to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Preferred Specimen: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tumor tissue.
◦ Minimum Specimen Requirement: One scroll of FFPE tissue
at least 5 microns thick or corresponding unstained slide.
◦ Specimen Stability: Room temperature; FFPE blocks are
stable for several years.
2. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
◦ DNA Extraction kit suitable for FFPE tissues.
◦ Quantitative PCR (qPCR) purification and quantification
instruments.
◦ NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) library preparation kit.
◦ Gene panel sequencing reagents and consumables.
◦ Sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent).
◦ Computer with bioinformatics software for sequence
analysis.
3. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
• Deparaffinization: Using xylene and ethanol, deparaffinize the
tumor tissue.
• DNA isolation: Utilize a validated DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s protocols. Document the extracted DNA
concentration and purity using a spectrophotometer (e.g.,
Nanodrop) or fluorometer (e.g., Qubit).
6.2 DNA Quantification and Quality Control
• Measure DNA concentration and assess purity using the
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
• Ensure that the minimum DNA concentration for library
preparation is met.
• Document yields and any dilution steps taken.
6.3 Library Preparation and Enrichment
• Use the NGS library preparation kit as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Perform target enrichment for the neuro-oncology gene panel
using the specified probe sets.
• Validate library integrity and size using a bioanalyzer or similar.
6.4 Sequencing
• Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure correct instrument settings and run parameters.
• Run a control sample with known mutations for QC.
• Monitor run progress and address any alerts or failures.
6.5 Data Analysis and Interpretation
• Transfer raw data to a bioinformatics pipeline for processing.
• Align sequencing reads to a reference genome.
• Identify mutations using variant calling software.
• Annotate and classify mutations.
• Validate identified mutations using internal data and comparison
with databases (e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar).
6.6 Reporting
• Generate a report for each sample that includes:
◦ Patient identification and sample details.
◦ Methodology.
◦ List of detected mutations including gene, nucleotide change,
and amino acid change.
◦ Clinical relevance and potential actionability of identified
mutations.
• Review and verify the report by a qualified laboratory director or
designee before release.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform routine checks and calibrations of all instruments
used.
◦ Include and document the testing of positive and negative
controls in each batch.
◦ Re-run samples if QC checks fail or if there are significant
deviations from expected outcomes.
◦ Maintain logs of all QC activities and any corrective actions
taken.
2. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If anomalies or failures occur:
▪ Re-extract DNA if initial extraction is of poor quality.
▪ Re-sequence failed runs or re-run problematic samples.
▪ Consult manufacturer's troubleshooting guidelines or
technical support if needed.
▪ Notify a supervisor and document all troubleshooting
actions.
3. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain records of all specimens, extraction logs, library
preparation notes, sequencing run records, data analysis
results, QC activities, and final reports.
◦ Ensure records are complete, accurate, and securely
stored.
