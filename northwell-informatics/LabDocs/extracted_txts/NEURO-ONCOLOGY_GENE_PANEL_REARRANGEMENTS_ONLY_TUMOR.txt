Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of the
Neuro-Oncology Gene Panel, Rearrangements Only, Tumor
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for the Neuro-Oncology
Gene Panel, Rearrangements Only, Tumor. This procedure ensures
accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability in detecting gene
rearrangements associated with neuro-oncology tumors.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform the analysis according to this SOP. All results
must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist or
supervisor before reporting.
1. DEFINITIONS
Gene Rearrangement: A structural alteration in the genome involving
the rearrangement of regions within a gene or between genes, often
resulting in oncogenic fusion proteins.
Tumor Specimen: A tissue sample from a neuro-oncology patient that
has been confirmed to be appropriate for genetic testing.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Preparation
a. Ensure the tumor specimen has been appropriately collected,
transported, and stored according to the relevant specimen handling
SOP. b. Verify that the specimen has been accessioned and labeled
correctly. c. Extract genomic DNA or RNA from the tumor tissue using
an approved extraction method (i.e., commercial extraction kit
following the manufacturer's protocol). d. Quantify and assess the
quality of the extracted nucleic acids using a spectrophotometer and
electrophoresis as needed.
3.2 Library Preparation
a. Prepare the library using a targeted enrichment method specific for
neuro-oncology gene rearrangements (e.g., hybrid capture or
amplicon-based approach). b. Follow the manufacturer's instructions
for library preparation, ensuring all reagents are within their expiration
dates and stored correctly. c. Index libraries with unique barcodes to
enable multiplex sequencing. d. Assess the quality and concentration
of the libraries using a fluorometer and electrophoresis.
3.3 Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
a. Set up the NGS run following the sequencer manufacturer's
protocol. b. Pool the indexed libraries at equimolar concentrations
and load them onto the sequencing instrument. c. Initiate the
sequencing run, ensuring proper calibration and maintenance checks
have been completed on the instrument.
3.4 Data Analysis
a. Perform primary data analysis using the instrument’s onboard
software to generate FASTQ files. b. Use appropriate bioinformatics
tools and pipelines for secondary analysis, including alignment to the
reference genome, identification of gene rearrangements, and quality
control checks. c. Annotate the detected gene rearrangements with
relevant clinical information using a curated database or
bioinformatics software.
3.5 Results Verification
a. Review the analysis results, including quality metrics and detected
rearrangements. b. Confirm the validity of detected gene
rearrangements by cross-referencing with in-house or external
databases. c. Verify the findings independently by a qualified
technologist or supervisor.
3.6 Reporting
a. Prepare the final report including detailed findings of the gene
rearrangements, their clinical significance, and implications for
patient treatment and prognosis. b. Ensure the report is clear,
concise, and includes all necessary patient and specimen
information. c. Submit the report for final review and authorization by
a qualified supervisor or pathologist. d. Communicate the validated
report to the requesting physician or medical team, adhering to
confidentiality and data protection policies.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
ensure the reliability and accuracy of the assay. b. Perform regular
instrument maintenance and calibration procedures as recommended
by the manufacturer. c. Participate in external proficiency testing and
inter-laboratory comparison programs to maintain high standards of
test performance.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
a. If any issues arise during specimen preparation, library
preparation, sequencing, or data analysis, document the issue and
perform troubleshooting steps as outlined in the respective
instrument or kit manuals. b. Consult with a supervisor or technical
support if the problem persists or cannot be resolved.
1. REFERENCES
a. Manufacturer’s instructions for the extraction kit, library preparation
kit, and sequencing instrument. b. Bioinformatics pipeline and
annotation software manuals. c. Relevant clinical guidelines and
peer-reviewed literature on neuro-oncology gene rearrangements.
1. DOCUMENTATION
a. Maintain all records of specimen receipt, processing, and results in
accordance with laboratory policy and regulatory requirements. b.
Ensure that all documentation is accurate, complete, and readily
accessible for review.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate
and consistent generation of results for the Neuro-Oncology Gene
Panel, Rearrangements Only, Tumor, thereby aiding in the effective
management and treatment of neuro-oncology patients.
