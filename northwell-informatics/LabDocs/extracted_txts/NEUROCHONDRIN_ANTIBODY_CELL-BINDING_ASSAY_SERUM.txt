Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
NEUROCHONDRIN ANTIBODY CELL-BINDING ASSAY,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to accurately measure Neurochondrin
antibodies in patient serum samples using a cell-binding assay. This
SOP ensures that results generated are reliable, reproducible, and
timely by following standardized procedures.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood in a red-top tube (no gel).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 48 hours.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 1 month. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• T75 cell culture flasks
• Sterile PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Cell culture medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS)
• Trypsin-EDTA solution
• CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2)
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• 96-well plates
• Neurochondrin-expressing cells suspension
• Primary Neurochondrin antibody reagents
• Secondary antibody (anti-human IgG) conjugated with a detection
enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase)
• Substrate solution for detection enzyme (e.g., TMB for HRP)
• Plate reader
4. PROCEDURE
A) Cell Preparation:
1. Cell Culture Maintenance:
◦ Grow Neurochondrin-expressing cells in T75 flasks using
the recommended culture medium.
◦ Maintain cells at 37°C with 5% CO2.
2. Cell Harvesting:
◦ Once cells reach 80-90% confluency, wash with PBS.
◦ Add trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate at 37°C for 3-5
minutes to detach cells.
◦ Neutralize trypsin with culture medium containing FBS.
◦ Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes, discard
supernatant and resuspend cells in PBS.
B) Cell Binding Assay:
1. Cell Seeding:
◦ Seed approximately 1x10^5 Neurochondrin-expressing cells
per well in a 96-well plate.
◦ Incubate for 24 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2.
2. Binding Assay:
◦ Wash the wells with sterile PBS.
◦ Incubate each well with patient serum (1:50 dilution in PBS)
for 1 hour at room temperature.
◦ Wash wells 3 times with PBS.
◦ Add secondary antibody (anti-human IgG conjugated with
HRP) diluted according to manufacturer’s instructions and
incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.
◦ Wash wells again 3 times with PBS.
3. Detection:
◦ Add TMB substrate solution to each well and incubate until a
visible reaction occurs (approximately 10-15 minutes).
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided with
the substrate kit.
◦ Read the wells at appropriate wavelength (450 nm) using a
plate reader.
C) Data Collection:
1. Record absorbance readings.
2. Compare patient sample readings against control to determine
presence and levels of Neurochondrin antibodies.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Positive Control:
• Include a positive control serum with known Neurochondrin
antibodies in each assay run.
Negative Control:
• Include a negative control serum without Neurochondrin
antibodies in each assay run.
Reagent and Equipment Validations:
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are within their validation
period and functioning correctly before use.
Review Results Criteria:
• Ensure absorbance values of positive controls are within
expected range.
• If controls fail, repeat the entire assay process.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results will be reported in accordance with site-specific guidelines:
• Negative: Absorbance values similar to negative control.
• Positive: Absorbance significantly higher than negative control
indicating presence of Neurochondrin antibodies.
Refer to site-specific critical result protocols for reporting
urgent findings.
7. REFERENCES
References for assay methodology and reagent details will be
maintained in the laboratory as needed. Refer to [Neurochondrin Cell
Binding Assay Manufacturer’s Product Insert] for specific reagent
handling and limitations.
8. DOCUMENTATION
Complete documentation of all assay conditions, observations, and
results is mandatory. Ensure logs are properly filled with:
• Date, time, and initials of the scientist conducting the assay.
• Any anomalies or deviations from SOP.
• All test results and controls.
This SOP is effective as of [Date] and is to be reviewed annually or
as required by changes in protocol or equipment.
