Standard Operating Procedure for NEUROCHONDRIN
ANTIBODY, CELL-BINDING ASSAY, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase for
generating results for Neurochondrin Antibody, Cell-Binding Assay
(CBA) in spinal fluid specimens. The aim is to ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of the Neurochondrin
Antibody, Cell-Binding Assay performed on spinal fluid specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay, ensuring all procedural steps are followed, and
documenting results.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for confirming that staff
are adequately trained and that the assay is performed and
documented according to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Fresh or previously frozen spinal fluid
collected in sterile tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
samples.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Cell-culture treated plates
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Microscope
• Fixed cells expressing Neurochondrin antigen
• Fluorescent or chromogenic secondary antibody
• Washing buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20)
• Blocking solution
• Detection reagent
• Calibration controls (positive and negative controls)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Thaw spinal fluid specimens if previously frozen and mix gently by
inverting the tube. Bring all reagents to room temperature.
• Label all reagents, samples, and controls clearly.
6.2 Assay Procedure
1. Add fixed cells expressing Neurochondrin antigen into each
well of the cell-culture plate.
2. Block non-specific binding sites by adding blocking solution to
each well and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Wash the wells three times with washing buffer to remove
excess blocking solution.
4. Add 50-100 µL of spinal fluid specimen and positive/negative
controls to the designated wells. Incubate for 1-2 hours at room
temperature.
5. Wash the wells three times with washing buffer to remove
unbound antibodies.
6. Add 50-100 µL of fluorescent or chromogenic secondary
antibody to each well. Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature
in the dark (if using a fluorescent secondary antibody).
7. Wash the wells three times with washing buffer to remove
unbound secondary antibody.
8. Add the appropriate detection reagent to develop the signal
(e.g., substrate for chromogenic reactions).
6.3 Detection and Analysis
• Examine the plate under a suitable microscope. Document
observation of cell-binding antibody presence as indicated by the
fluorescent or chromogenic signal.
• Include images or detailed written observations for quality control
and documentation purposes.
6.4 Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of tests to
ensure assay reliability.
• Document control results and verify they fall within expected
ranges before validating sample results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the presence or absence of Neurochondrin Antibodies in
each sample.
• Utilize specific reporting guidelines as defined in the laboratory's
reporting system.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive Control: Clear visualization of signal corresponding to
Neurochondrin antibody binding.
• Negative Control: No signal, indicating absence of Neurochondrin
antibody binding.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure that cell cultures are not contaminated and antibodies
used are within their expiration dates.
• Evaluate signal without bias and contextually, considering
potential non-specific binding.
10. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Follow all laboratory biosafety and chemical safety regulations.
• Dispose of biological materials and chemicals using appropriate
biohazard waste containers.
