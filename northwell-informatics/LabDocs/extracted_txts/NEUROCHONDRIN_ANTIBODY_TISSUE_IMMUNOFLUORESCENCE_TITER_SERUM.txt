Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generation of Results for Neurochondrin Antibody, Tissue
Immunofluorescence Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures to be followed for
generating results for the Neurochondrin Antibody, Tissue
Immunofluorescence Titer in serum samples. Adherence to these
procedures ensures accurate, reproducible, and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure accurately and to notify their supervisor of any
deviations or issues encountered during the process.
3. DEFINITION
Neurochondrin Antibody, Tissue Immunofluorescence Titer, Serum:
Testing aimed at detecting and titrating neurochondrin autoantibodies
using indirect immunofluorescence on tissue sections to aid in the
diagnosis of neurologic autoimmune disorders.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
1. Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum collected in a serum separator tube or red-top tube.
◦ Minimum of 500 µL of serum required.
◦ Specimen must be centrifuged and separated from the clot
within 2 hours of collection.
◦ Transport and store serum aliquots at 2-8°C (short term) or
≤ -20°C (long term).
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
◦ Samples collected in non-serum tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate).
◦ Specimens that are contaminated or not properly labeled.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Pre-prepared tissue substrate slides.
• Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) reagents:
◦ Primary antibody diluent.
◦ Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary
antibody.
◦ Mounting media.
• Wash buffers (PBS or equivalent).
• Positive and negative control serum samples.
• Equipment: Fluorescence microscope, microtiter well plate
shaker, and pipettes.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents are at the appropriate temperature and
have not exceeded their expiration date.
2. Prepare dilutions of patient sera, starting at 1:10 and doubling
dilutions up to 1:1280, in primary antibody diluent.
3. Label all tubes with appropriate patient information and dilution
factors.
B. Immunofluorescence Staining:
1. Apply 50 µL of diluted patient sera and controls to the
appropriate wells on the tissue substrate slide.
2. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes in a humid
environment.
3. Wash the slides 3 times for 5 minutes each in wash buffer with
gentle agitation.
4. Apply 50 µL of FITC-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
5. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes in a humid
environment.
6. Wash the slides 3 times for 5 minutes each in wash buffer with
gentle agitation.
C. Mounting and Viewing:
1. Drain excess wash buffer from the slides. Avoid letting the
slides dry out.
2. Apply 1-2 drops of mounting media to each well and cover with
a coverslip.
3. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope using the
appropriate filters. Record the endpoint titer as the highest
dilution showing specific fluorescence.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative control sera with each batch of tests
to validate assay performance.
2. Confirm the specific fluorescence pattern according to
predefined criteria.
3. Document and address any deviations or unusual findings
immediately.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the fluorescing endpoint titer for each patient's serum
sample.
2. Verify results through a second technologist or supervisor if
required.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Ensure that critical results are communicated promptly to the
ordering clinician in accordance with established protocols.
9. CLEANING UP
1. Dispose of all used slides and reagents according to biohazard
waste disposal guidelines.
2. Clean and store equipment properly to maintain their function
and longevity.
3. Document the completion of assays and any issues
encountered in the laboratory logbook.
