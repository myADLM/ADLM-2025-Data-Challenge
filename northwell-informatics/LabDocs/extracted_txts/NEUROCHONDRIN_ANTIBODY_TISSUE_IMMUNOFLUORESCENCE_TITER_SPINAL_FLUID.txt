Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Neurochondrin Antibody Immunofluorescence Titer in
Spinal Fluid Effective Date: [Insert Date] Review Date: [Insert Date]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE This SOP is established to provide detailed instructions
for the analytical phase of generating results for Neurochondrin
Antibody, Tissue Immunofluorescence Titer, in spinal fluid samples.
This includes the preparation, staining, examination, and
interpretation of results to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
immunofluorescence titer assays for Neurochondrin antibodies on
spinal fluid specimens in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologist: Perform the assay, ensure all
procedures are followed, and document all findings accurately.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Review the assay results, ensure quality
control, and validate data before reporting.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Neurochondrin Antibody: An antibody targeting the protein
Neurochondrin, associated with various neurological disorders.
• Immunofluorescence Titer: A laboratory technique to detect and
quantify specific antibodies in a sample by using fluorescence-
labeled antigens.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Fluorescence microscope
• Immunofluorescence slides pre-coated with Neurochondrin
antigens
• Fluorescently-labeled anti-human IgG
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Mounting medium with DAPI
• Positive and negative control samples
• Spinal fluid samples
• Coverslips
• Humidified chamber
6. PROCEDURE 6.1. Sample Preparation:
• Ensure spinal fluid specimens are properly labeled and stored at
2-8°C. If stored frozen, allow samples to thaw to room
temperature.
• Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
cellular debris.
6.2. Incubation with Antigen:
• Place pre-coated immunofluorescence slides in a humidified
chamber.
• Apply 50 µL of spinal fluid sample to each well on the slide.
• Include positive and negative control samples in the assay.
• Incubate slides for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6.3. Washing:
• Gently rinse each slide with PBS to remove unbound antibodies.
• Perform three wash cycles, each lasting 5 minutes, in PBS.
6.4. Staining with Secondary Antibody:
• Apply 50 µL of fluorescently-labeled anti-human IgG to each well.
• Incubate slides for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
• Wash slides three times with PBS to remove unbound secondary
antibodies.
6.5. Mounting:
• Apply a small drop of mounting medium with DAPI on each slide.
• Place a coverslip over the sample and avoid air bubbles
formation.
• Allow the slides to dry for 10 minutes in the dark.
6.6. Microscopy:
• Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope using
appropriate filters for detecting DAPI and the fluorescent label.
• Assess the presence and intensity of fluorescence in each well.
6.7. Titer Determination:
• Record the highest dilution of the spinal fluid sample where
specific fluorescence is still visible.
• Compare the fluorescence intensity with positive and negative
controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control sera in each batch and
record their results.
• Ensure calibration of the fluorescence microscope is current.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and report them to the
supervisor.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are recorded in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report the Neurochondrin antibody titer as the highest dilution
showing specific fluorescence.
• Include any relevant observations or issues with sample integrity
in the report.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for immunofluorescence slides and
secondary antibodies.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed studies on anti-
Neurochondrin antibodies.

This protocol is developed for clarity and adherence to laboratory
standards, ensuring every step is articulated systematically for
technicians. Ensure that any modifications follow proper validation
and documentation within the laboratory's quality management
system.
