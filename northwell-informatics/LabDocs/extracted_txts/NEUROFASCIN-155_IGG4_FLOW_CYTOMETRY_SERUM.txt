Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Neurofascin-155 IgG4, Flow Cytometry,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate, reliable, and timely generation of results for
Neurofascin-155 IgG4 using flow cytometry on serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps of the procedure as outlined. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify and report any issues or deviations
that may affect the quality of test results to a supervisor immediately.
Supervisors must ensure that annual competency assessments are
completed for all designated laboratory staff and that staff follow the
SOPs.
3. DEFINITIONS
Neurofascin-155 IgG4 - An immunoglobulin subtype associated with
neurological disorders targeting Neurofascin-155. Flow Cytometry - A
technique for counting and examining microscopic particles, such as
cells and biomolecules, by suspending them in a stream of fluid and
passing them by an electronic detection apparatus.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II) Calibration beads and
internal controls for flow cytometer Primary antibody: Anti-
Neurofascin-155 IgG4 Secondary antibody: Fluorophore-conjugated
anti-human IgG4 Serum samples from patients Control serum
samples (positive and negative controls) Appropriate buffers and
solutions (e.g., PBS, FACS buffer, fixation buffer) Pipettes and tips,
microcentrifuge tubes, and other standard lab consumables
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Ensure patient serum samples have been collected, labeled,
and documented in accordance with standard procedures.
2. Review patient information and clinical history as needed.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature if frozen.
2. Prepare a label for each sample and control.
3. Aliquot 50 μL of each serum sample and control into labeled
microcentrifuge tubes.
C. Antibody Staining:
1. Add 5 μL of primary Anti-Neurofascin-155 IgG4 antibody to
each tube.
2. Incubate tubes for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
3. Wash samples:
◦ Add 200 μL of FACS buffer to each tube.
◦ Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes and discard
supernatant.
◦ Repeat wash step twice more for a total of three washes.
4. Add 5 μL of secondary fluorophore-conjugated anti-human IgG4
antibody to each tube.
5. Incubate tubes for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
6. Wash samples:
◦ Add 200 μL of FACS buffer to each tube.
◦ Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes and discard
supernatant.
◦ Repeat wash step twice more for a total of three washes.
D. Data Acquisition:
1. Resuspend cells in 500 μL of FACS buffer before acquisition.
2. Use calibration beads and internal controls to set up the flow
cytometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Acquire data using the flow cytometer, ensuring at least 10,000
events are recorded for each sample.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Use flow cytometry software (e.g., FlowJo) to analyze the data.
2. Gate on the appropriate cell population.
3. Determine the percentage and mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) of Neurofascin-155 positive cells.
4. Compare with control samples to validate the results.
F. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Document any deviations or issues in the assay and inform the
supervisor.
3. Repeat assay for any samples or controls which fall outside of
acceptable control limits.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Document results in the laboratory information system.
2. Flag any critical results and follow the protocol for informing the
appropriate healthcare provider.
3. Results should include percentage and MFI of Neurofascin-155
positive cells in the sample.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform routine maintenance and calibration on the flow
cytometer.
2. Schedule preventative maintenance and servicing as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
3. Maintain a log of all quality control and maintenance activities.
4. Review results from internal and external quality assessment
schemes.
7. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s user manual for the flow cytometer and
antibody data sheets for detailed guidance on usage, limitations, and
troubleshooting specific to the instruments and reagents.
8. DOCUMENTATION
All staff performing the procedure must sign and date the
acknowledgment section in the SOP. Amendments or procedural
changes should be documented and reviewed. Each performed
assay should be documented, including steps taken, control results,
and final patient results. This documentation should be stored as per
regulatory requirements and laboratory policy.
9. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
In case of equipment malfunction or failure, cease testing procedures
immediately and notify a supervisor. Follow established protocols for
re-routing samples to an alternative setup or an affiliated laboratory if
necessary.
