Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analytical phase of NF1
full gene analysis in order to ensure accurate and timely results. This
includes DNA extraction, gene amplification via PCR, sequencing,
data interpretation, and reporting.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing NF1 full gene analyses. It includes guidelines from
sample preparation through to data reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel assigned to NF1 full gene analysis must:
• Follow the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Report any deviations or issues that arise during processing to
the designated supervisor.
• Ensure quality control measures are strictly followed.
The supervisors are responsible for:
• Ensuring staff are properly trained on the SOP.
• Reviewing quality control and maintenance logs.
• Addressing and troubleshooting any issues associated with the
procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
NF1 Full Gene Analysis: A comprehensive analysis of the NF1 gene
to detect mutations, deletions, or duplications that may indicate
Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Whole blood (preferred)
• Volume: 5-10 mL in EDTA tube
• Storage: Store at 2-8°C if not processed immediately; must be
processed within 72 hours of collection.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (validated for NF1 analysis)
• PCR reagents and primers specific to NF1 gene
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• DNA sequencing reagents (Sanger or Next-Generation
Sequencing)
• Sequencer (e.g., ABI 3730xl, MiSeq)
• Computer software for data analysis (e.g., Sequencher, VarSeq)
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
7. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Ensure specimen (whole blood) is correctly labeled.
2. Follow the DNA extraction kit’s protocol to isolate genomic
DNA.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using
Nanodrop or Qubit.
4. Store isolated DNA at -20°C or proceed to PCR amplification.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix including primers specific for NF1
gene exons.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes/plates.
3. Add extracted DNA to each tube/plate well.
4. Place tubes/plate in thermal cycler and run the appropriate
PCR program.
5. Confirm amplification by running an aliquot on an agarose gel.
C. Sequencing:
1. Clean up PCR products by using a suitable purification kit.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the purified PCR products.
3. Set up sequencing reactions according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
4. Load the sequencer and initiate the sequencing run (Sanger or
NGS).
5. Monitor the run and review raw data output for quality.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Import sequencing data into analysis software.
2. Align sequences to the NF1 reference genome.
3. Identify and annotate variants.
4. Evaluate clinical significance of detected variants using
database resources (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
5. Generate an interpretation report summarizing the findings.
E. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in PCR and sequencing
runs.
2. Perform regular instrument maintenance and calibration
according to SOP.
3. Document any deviations or issues, and implement corrective
actions as necessary.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify all data for accuracy and completeness.
2. Prepare a result report including patient details, methodologies,
findings, and interpretations.
3. Submit the report to the designated pathologist or clinician for
final review.
4. Transmit the verified report to the requesting physician.

• Temperature and maintenance logs for all equipment used.
• DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing run logs.
• Variant interpretation records and databases consulted.
• QC and validation records.
9. REFERENCES
• Current literature on NF1 genetic analysis and variant
interpretation.
