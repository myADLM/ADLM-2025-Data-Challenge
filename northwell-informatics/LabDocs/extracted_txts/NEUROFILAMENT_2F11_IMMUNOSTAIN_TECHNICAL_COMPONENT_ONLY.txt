Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Neurofilament (2F11)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
immunohistochemistry staining for Neurofilament (2F11) in
pathological tissue sections. This procedural guide ensures
consistent and accurate results in the detection of Neurofilament
expression.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to perform this protocol. The laboratory supervisor will ensure that all
staff are trained and that the protocol is followed correctly.

1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 3-5 µm thick sections from the FFPE tissue block using
a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C, then mount onto
positively charged glass slides.
◦ Allow slides to dry overnight at room temperature or place in
a 60°C oven for 1 hour to ensure tissue adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by incubating in xylene for 2x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol solutions:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2x 3 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) buffer
(e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0).
2. Heat the solution to approximately 95-100°C using a steamer or
water bath and incubate slides for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
4. Rinse in distilled water, followed by wash buffer.
D. Blocking
1. Incubate slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide in wash buffer for
10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
3. Apply normal serum blocking solution and incubate for 20
minutes to block non-specific binding sites.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Dilute the Neurofilament (2F11) primary antibody according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply the primary antibody to the tissue sections and incubate
in a humidified chamber for 60 minutes at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C.
3. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Apply the biotinylated or enzyme-conjugated secondary
antibody specific to the primary antibody species.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse in wash buffer.
4. Apply the enzyme/substrate chromogen solution (e.g., DAB)
and incubate for 5-10 minutes, monitoring closely for
appropriate color development.
5. Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in wash buffer.
G. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions:
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 100% ethanol for 2x 2 minutes
4. Clear in xylene for 2x 3 minutes.
5. Mount coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
H. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative control slides in each staining batch.
• Positive control: Tissue known to express Neurofilament.
• Negative control: Tissue processed without the primary antibody.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are to be reviewed by a pathologist using a light microscope.
The pathologist will evaluate staining intensity and localization to
determine Neurofilament expression levels.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the primary antibody datasheet and detection kit instructions
for any specific limitations and troubleshooting tips. Variability may
occur due to differences in tissue preparation and staining
techniques.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Record all observations, deviations, and corrective actions taken
during the assay in the laboratory log. Maintain detailed records of
reagent lot numbers and expiration dates in the quality control
documents.
