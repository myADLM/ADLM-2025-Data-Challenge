Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Neurofilament
Antibody Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
processing and generating results for Neurofilament Antibody (NfAb)
analysis in a clinical laboratory. This document ensures that the
procedures are consistent, accurate, and performed in compliance
with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to
perform, monitor, and document the neurofilament antibody
analysis.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this SOP and for addressing any issues that may arise during the
analysis.
2. SPECIMEN Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum: Collect in a clot activator tube (e.g., red-top or SST)
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): Collect in a sterile container
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
heparin)
Specimen Transportation and Stability:
• Serum: Store at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 24 hours;
otherwise, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• CSF: Store at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 24 hours;
otherwise, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Ensure proper labeling of specimens with collection date and
time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Plate Reader
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Neurofilament Antibody ELISA Kit (with reagents for control and
calibration)
• Microplate Washer
• Vortex mixer
• Reagent reservoirs
• Calibrated incubator
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Verify specimen integrity following guidelines above.
2. Ensure all reagents and equipment are at the appropriate
operating temperature.
3. Calibrate the ELISA Plate Reader and Microplate Washer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
B) ELISA Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum or CSF samples completely and mix
well by gentle inversion.
◦ Centrifuge all samples and controls at 1,500 x g for 10
minutes at room temperature. Use the supernatant for
testing.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare wash buffer and any other required reagents
according to the manufacturer’s instructions included with
the ELISA kit.
3. Plate Preparation:
◦ Follow the ELISA kit instructions for coating the microplate
with capture antibody.
◦ Incubate the plate as specified (typically 1 hour at 37°C or
overnight at 4°C).
4. Sample Application:
◦ Add samples, controls, and standards to the appropriate
wells.
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive film and incubate as directed in
the kit’s protocol (e.g., 2 hours at room temperature).
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly using the Microplate Washer,
making sure to follow the recommended number of washes
and volume of wash buffer.
6. Detection:
◦ Add the detection antibody to each well and incubate the
plate as specified.
◦ Perform additional wash steps as required.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate the
plate in the dark for the time specified until color
development.
8. Reaction Termination:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
9. Plate Reading:
◦ Read the optical density of each well using the calibrated
ELISA Plate Reader at the appropriate wavelength as
specified in the kit’s protocol.
5. QUALITY CONTROL Material:
• Use positive and negative controls provided in the ELISA kit.
• Use internal quality control sera (with known concentrations) for
validation.
Procedure:
• Run controls with each batch of tests to ensure accuracy and
reliability.
• Verify that the results for the controls fall within the acceptable
range specified by the manufacturer.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the concentration of neurofilament antibodies in patient
samples using the standard curve generated from the known
standards.
• Review and verify the results before reporting.
• Document any unusual findings and critical values for follow-up
with the physician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for limitations regarding
potential interferences and performance characteristics of the
ELISA kit.
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored samples may yield inaccurate
results.

ensure compliance with regulatory standards and up-to-date
practices.
