Standard Operating Procedure for
Measurement of Neurofilament Light Chain
in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the measurement of
Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) in plasma samples using
immunoassay techniques to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
Neurofilament Light Chain analysis and involves the analytical phase
of generating results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel will perform the assay following
this protocol and document all necessary information.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff are trained and
competent in performing this assay.
• Lab personnel are responsible for equipment maintenance and
quality control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Plasma samples collected in EDTA tubes.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have been thawed and refrozen more than once.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) assay kit (as per manufacturer's
guidelines)
• Calibrators and controls defined by the assay manufacturer
• Diluent and wash solutions
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Plate washer (if applicable)
• Refrigerated storage
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Calibration:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw and prepare reagents as instructed in the assay kit
insert.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Mix calibrators and controls by gentle inversion or vortexing.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify calibration using provided calibrators and log results
in the Calibration Log.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Thaw plasma samples at 4°C overnight or at room
temperature for 1-2 hours.
◦ Mix samples by gentle inversion after thawing.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 2000-3000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
remove any particulates.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube without disturbing
the pellet.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Loading Samples and Reagents:
◦ Pipette the required volume of each sample, calibrator, and
control into designated wells of the assay plate.
◦ Add assay-specific reagents, including antibodies and
substrates, following the sequence outlined by the
manufacturer.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration
as per the assay instructions.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as instructed using the plate washer or
manually using appropriate washing solution.
4. Detection:
◦ Add detection reagent and incubate as specified.
◦ Read the plate using the immunoassay analyzer at the
recommended wavelength.
D) Quality Control:
1. QC Validation:
◦ Include both high and low-level controls in each assay run.
◦ Perform internal quality control according to lab standards;
analyze results to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective actions if
controls fall outside of the predefined limits.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Review:
◦ Review results generated by the analyzer.
◦ Verify that controls are within specified ranges.
◦ Investigate and document any discrepancies or outliers.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure results flagged for any critical values or out-of-range
findings are rechecked and verified.
◦ Notify relevant healthcare providers if results fall within
critical ranges.
8. PERFORMANCE QUALIFICATION AND
MAINTENANCE
1. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in periodic proficiency testing as scheduled by
the laboratory quality assurance program.
◦ Record and evaluate results from proficiency testing.
2. Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration checks on the
immunoassay analyzer, recording these actions in the
maintenance log.
◦ Follow manufacturer's recommendations for periodic
cleaning and inspection of the analyzer.
