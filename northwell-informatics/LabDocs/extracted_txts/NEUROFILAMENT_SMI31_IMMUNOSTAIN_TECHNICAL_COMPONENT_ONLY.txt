Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
SOP Title: Neurofilament (SMI31) Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps involved in the analytical phase for
generating results for Neurofilament (SMI31) immunostain, technical
component only. This SOP focuses on ensuring consistent and
accurate staining, minimizing variability, and complying with assay
requirements.
Responsibility:
• Designated lab personnel (histotechnologists) are responsible for
performing and documenting the procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Section Thickness: 4-5 micrometers.
• Slide Preparation: Use positively charged slides to ensure
proper tissue adhesion.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody: Neurofilament (SMI31) antibody.
• Secondary Antibody: Compatible with the primary antibody
(e.g., anti-mouse IgG for a mouse-derived primary antibody).
• Detection System: HRP-conjugated streptavidin or polymer-
based detection system.
• Chromogen: Diaminobenzidine (DAB) or another suitable
chromogen.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin.
• Buffers: Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS).
• Antigen Retrieval Solution: Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA
buffer (pH 8.0).
• Mounting Media: Aqueous or non-aqueous media suitable for
preserving chromogen.
• Control Tissue: Known positive and negative control slides.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Xylene: 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 3 minutes each.
◦ 95% ethanol: 1 change, 3 minutes.
◦ 70% ethanol: 1 change, 3 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Heat slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0)
using a pressure cooker, microwave, or steamer for 20
minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in TBS or PBS.
3. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse in TBS or PBS.
B. Immunostaining:
1. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply Neurofilament (SMI31) primary antibody diluted
according to manufacturer specifications.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
◦ Rinse in TBS or PBS.
2. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody compatible with the primary
antibody.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in TBS or PBS.
3. Detection and Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply detection reagent (e.g., HRP-conjugated streptavidin).
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in TBS or PBS.
◦ Apply DAB or another suitable chromogen.
◦ Develop color for 5-10 minutes, monitoring under a
microscope.
4. Counterstain:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
◦ Blot excess water.
5. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%).
◦ Clear in xylene.
◦ Mount coverslip using mounting media.
C. Quality Control:
• Ensure positive and negative control slides are included in each
staining run.
• Verify staining quality under a microscope and document any
discrepancies.
• Resolve issues and repeat staining if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Documentation: Record the staining quality, observations, and
any deviations in the laboratory log.
• Verification: Stained slides must be reviewed by a qualified
pathologist for evaluation.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Neurofilament (SMI31) primary
antibody and detection reagents.
• Laboratory-specific immunohistochemistry manuals and
guidelines.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regular calibration and maintenance of equipment.
• Periodic review of staining protocols.
• Address deviations promptly.
• Continuous training and competency assessment of laboratory
personnel.
