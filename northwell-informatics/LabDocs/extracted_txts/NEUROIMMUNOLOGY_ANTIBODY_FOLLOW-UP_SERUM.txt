Standard Operating Procedure for
NEUROIMMUNOLOGY ANTIBODY FOLLOW-UP,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide standard operating procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Neuroimmunology Antibody Follow-Up, Serum
testing. This document outlines the procedure to ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
ensure that testing conditions are optimal and to address any
deficiencies that may affect the results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum separated from a properly collected venous blood
specimen.
• Serum aliquot should be free of hemolysis and lipemia.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples collected in incorrect tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate).
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
• Specimens without proper labeling (i.e., missing patient
identification, collection date/time).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Neuroimmunology test kits specific to the antibodies being tested.
• Calibration and control materials.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Automated or manual immunoassay analyzers.
• Refrigerators/freezers.
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
• Incubator (as specified by the test kit manufacturer).
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Review the test requisition and patient details to ensure
correctness.
2. Retrieve the serum specimen from storage. Bring to room
temperature if previously refrigerated.
3. Check the specimen for integrity and suitability (i.e., no
hemolysis or lipemia).
B. Calibration (if applicable):
1. Ensure all instruments are calibrated according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Document calibration details in the appropriate log.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials as per site-specific guidelines to
verify instrument performance.
2. Document QC results. Ensure all controls fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding.
3. If QC fails, troubleshoot as per manufacturer guidelines and
repeat QC.
D. Analysis:
1. Set up the analyzers according to the specific test kit
instructions.
2. Prepare reagent mixtures and calibrator/control solutions if
required.
3. Pipette serum specimens into appropriate wells or tubes as
dictated by the test protocol.
4. Incubate samples as required, following specific timing and
temperature guidelines.
5. Perform the immunoassay as per the test kit protocol.
E. Result Generation and Validation:
1. Review the raw data generated from the analyzer for
consistency and accuracy.
2. Verify results by comparing them with the control and
calibration data.
3. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If an issue arises during testing (e.g., unexpected QC failure or
unusual sample behavior), consult the supervisor immediately.
• Refer to troubleshooting guides in the test kit insert or instrument
manual.
• Repeat testing on a new aliquot if necessary, after addressing the
issue.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter verified results into the LIS.
• Review results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Ensure that any comments on sample integrity or testing
challenges are documented.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
For specific reference intervals, consult the manufacturer’s kit insert.
Neuroimmunology antibodies typically require specific reference
values provided by the test kit.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for limitations regarding each
neuroimmunology test. Limitations may include the influence of
interfering substances or specimen handling issues.
10. DOCUMENTATION & ARCHIVING
• Maintain all documentation, including QC logs, calibration logs,
and troubleshooting reports, in accordance with lab policy.
• Archive test result data and related documentation as per
regulatory requirements.
