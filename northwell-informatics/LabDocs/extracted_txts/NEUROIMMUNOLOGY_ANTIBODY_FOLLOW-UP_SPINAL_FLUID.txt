STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Neuroimmunology Antibody Follow-Up, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides standardized procedures for the analytical phase
of generating results for neuroimmunology antibody follow-up tests
using spinal fluid (CSF) in order to ensure accuracy, consistency, and
reliability of test results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all certified laboratory personnel analyzing
CSF for neuroimmunology antibodies.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated personnel to perform each
step of this procedure according to the guidelines provided. All
personnel involved in the testing process must be trained and
competent to execute these procedures. Supervisors must ensure
adherence to this SOP and address any deviations or issues that
arise during the analytical phase.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CSF samples
• Antibody-specific reagent kits: Include all necessary reagents,
positive and negative controls, and calibrators specific for the
neuroimmunology antibodies being tested.
• Automated or manual assay equipment (based on the nature of
the assay)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated)
• Microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge
• Incubator and fridge
• Laboratory timer
• Recording logs and reporting software (LIS)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify the integrity and proper labeling of the received CSF
sample.
2. Allow any refrigerated samples to come to room temperature
prior to analysis (unless immediate analysis is required).
3. Prepare the workbench and ensure that all equipment,
reagents, and supplies are available and calibrated as needed.
4. Wear appropriate PPE.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Utilize the specific antibody assay kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Thaw reagent reagents from the kit as necessary and
equilibrate to room temperature.
3. Label microcentrifuge tubes or assay plate wells as required for
sample and controls.
4. Aliquot required volumes of CSF, calibrators, and controls into
appropriate wells/tubes.
5. Add specified reagents in the order described by the kit
instructions.
6. Mix thoroughly and incubate for the recommended duration and
temperature settings.
C. Detection and Measurement
1. After completion of the incubation period, perform any required
wash steps as specified.
2. Add detection reagent(s) and incubate as specified in the kit
protocol.
3. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence with the specified
equipment (e.g., plate reader or fluorometer).
4. Record raw data and calculate concentrations based on the
standard/calibrator curve provided.
D. Quality Control
1. Run each test with both positive and negative control samples
to validate the assay reliability.
2. Document control results and evaluate session performance
before reporting patient results.
E. Data Interpretation
1. Assess results using the standard/calibrator curve; ensure
control values are within defined limits.
2. Interpret the patient results according to the reference intervals
and clinical significance provided in the assay kit insert or
laboratory guidelines.
3. Flag any results that fall outside acceptable limits (e.g., high/low
antibodies).
F. Reporting Results
1. Input the test results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
3. Notify the ordering physician or relevant clinical staff of any
critical or unexpected results as per laboratory policy.
4. DOCUMENTATION
5. Record all data, including raw readouts, calculated values,
control results, and any deviations from the procedure.
6. Maintain records of all reagents and lots used, calibration data,
and equipment maintenance logs.
7. Ensure that all documentation is accurate, thorough, and
archived securely.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
9. If controls fall outside acceptable ranges, repeat the assay with
new samples and reagents.
10. If assay performance issues cannot be resolved, notify the
supervisor and consult technical support for the specific assay
kit used.
