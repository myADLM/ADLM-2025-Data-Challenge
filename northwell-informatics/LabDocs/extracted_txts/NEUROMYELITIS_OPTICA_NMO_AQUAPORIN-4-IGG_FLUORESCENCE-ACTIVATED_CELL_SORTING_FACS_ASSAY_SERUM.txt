Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for NEUROMYELITIS
OPTICA (NMO)/AQUAPORIN-4-IGG FLUORESCENCE-
ACTIVATED CELL SORTING (FACS) ASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of the
NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA (NMO)/AQUAPORIN-4-IGG
FLUORESCENCE-ACTIVATED CELL SORTING (FACS) assay for
serum samples. This assay is designed to detect the presence of
Aquaporin-4-IgG antibodies in patient serum, which aids in the
diagnosis of Neuromyelitis Optica.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay,
monitoring the results, documenting, and executing corrective actions
when necessary.
2. DEFINITION
The FACS assay utilizes fluorescence-labeled antibodies to identify
and quantify Aquaporin-4-IgG in serum samples. FACS is a
specialized type of flow cytometry that detects and measures the
presence of specific cell surface or intracellular molecules in particles
within a fluid stream.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum from a properly collected and processed blood
sample
• Acceptable: Serum stored at 2-8°C and tested within 48 hours
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens stored for more than 48 hours
◦ Specimens exhibiting hemolysis or contamination
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Flow Cytometer (FACSCalibur or equivalent)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
Reagents:
• Fluorescence-labeled Aquaporin-4-IgG antibodies
• Appropriate buffers (e.g., PBS)
• Fixative solution (e.g., paraformaldehyde)
• Flow cytometry-grade serum samples
Supplies:
• 5 mL tubes
• Flexible Cassettes
• Disposable gloves
• Sample racks
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Prepare all necessary reagents according to manufacturer
instructions.
3. Retrieve the serum sample from the refrigerator and allow it to
equilibrate to room temperature.
4. Vortex the sample briefly to ensure uniformity.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Transfer 100 µL of serum to a 5 mL
tube. b. Add 10 µL of fluorescent-labeled Aquaporin-4-IgG
antibodies to the tube. c. Incubate the mixture in the dark for 30
minutes at room temperature. d. Add 1 mL of PBS to the tube
and mix thoroughly.
2. Cell Sorting: a. Load the prepared sample onto the flow
cytometer. b. Run the sample through the flow cytometer
following the manufacturer’s instructions. c. Collect and analyze
data using the software provided with the flow cytometer.
3. Data Analysis: a. Ensure all controls and calibrations have
been run properly. b. Use fluorescence intensity data to
determine the presence and quantification of Aquaporin-4-IgG.
c. Compare sample results to established reference ranges.
4. Quality Control: a. Run positive and negative controls with
each batch of samples. b. Document control results and sample
results. c. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat
the assay.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
reporting. Automated results transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) should be checked for accuracy.
Reference Intervals:
• Absence of Aquaporin-4-IgG: Negative
• Presence of Aquaporin-4-IgG: Positive (quantitative values
provided)
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations. Factors such as
improper sample handling, expired reagents, and equipment
malfunction may affect the results.
