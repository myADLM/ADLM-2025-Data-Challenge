Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide clear, step-by-step instructions
for performing the NMO/Aquaporin-4-IgG Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorting (FACS) Assay on spinal fluid specimens in order to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory technologists who are trained
and authorized to perform the NMO/Aquaporin-4-IgG FACS assay in
the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow this
procedure accurately and to ensure proper documentation of all
steps taken. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to monitor
adherence to this protocol and to provide necessary training.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh spinal fluid (CSF) collected aseptically.
• Volume required: Minimum of 1 mL
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory and processed
as soon as possible.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or clotting.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or lack collection date/
time.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Flow cytometer (equipped for FACS analysis)
• Centrifuge (refrigerated)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated incubator
Reagents and Supplies:
• Aquaporin-4-IgG FACS Reagent kit
• Fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies
• Flow cytometry sheath fluid
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline), sterile
• FACS tubes
• CSF stabilization buffer (if applicable)
• 1% BSA solution in PBS
Quality Control Materials:
• Positive control (CSF known to be positive for Aquaporin-4-IgG)
• Negative control (CSF known to be negative for Aquaporin-4-IgG)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE),
including lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
2. Gather all required reagents, equipment, and controls. Allow
reagents and specimens to reach room temperature before
beginning the assay.
6.2. Sample Preparation:
1. Aliquot 1 mL of spinal fluid into a FACS tube.
2. If the sample has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature before processing.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
remove cellular debris.
4. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new FACS tube.
6.3. Assay Setup:
1. Add 100 μL of Aquaporin-4-IgG FACS reagent to the spinal fluid
sample and mix gently.
2. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 30 minutes in the
dark.
3. Add 1 mL of PBS to the tube and centrifuge at 1500 x g for 5
minutes at 4°C.
4. Carefully decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in
100 μL of 1% BSA in PBS.
5. Add 10 μL of fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody and mix
gently.
6. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
7. Wash the cells with 1 mL of PBS, centrifuge at 1500 x g for 5
minutes at 4°C.
8. Resuspend the final pellet in 200 μL of PBS for FACS analysis.
6.4. FACS Analysis:
1. Calibrate the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using appropriate calibration beads.
2. Set up the flow cytometer with the necessary parameters (e.g.,
fluorescence channels for the antibodies used).
3. Run the controls first to ensure the system is functioning
correctly:
◦ Run the negative control and set the background
fluorescence.
◦ Run the positive control and ensure the signal is within
expected limits.
4. Analyze the patient sample:
◦ Acquire a minimum of 10,000 events.
◦ Gate the population of interest (e.g., lymphocytes) and
analyze Aquaporin-4-IgG expression.
6.5. Data Analysis and Result Interpretation:
1. Compare the patient sample fluorescence with the negative and
positive controls.
2. Determine if the sample is positive or negative for Aquaporin-4-
IgG based on the gating and fluorescence intensity.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily quality control checks on the flow cytometer.
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Document all QC results and actions taken if controls are out of
range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify FACS data.
• Report results to the clinician using the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Include a detailed interpretation of the findings in the report.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Negative: No detectable Aquaporin-4-IgG.
• Positive: Detectable Aquaporin-4-IgG above the threshold
established by the laboratory.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Sensitivity and specificity are dependent on the quality of
reagents and proper instrument calibration.
• Hemolysis, contamination, or improper sample handling may
affect the integrity of the results.
