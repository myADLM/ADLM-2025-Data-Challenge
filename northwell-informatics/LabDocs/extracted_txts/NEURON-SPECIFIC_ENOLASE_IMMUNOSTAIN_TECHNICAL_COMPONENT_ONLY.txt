Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Neuron-Specific
Enolase Immunostain (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a detailed and
standardized protocol for the preparation, staining, and
documentation of Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) immunostain for
the technical component only. This procedure ensures the accuracy,
reproducibility, and reliability of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
Neuron-Specific Enolase immunostain procedure as outlined. This
includes preparation, staining, documentation, and appropriate
handling of specimens and reagents.
3. DEFINITION
Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) is an enzyme found in the cytoplasm
of neurons and cells of neuroendocrine origin. Immunohistochemical
staining for NSE is used to identify and differentiate neuronal and
neuroendocrine cells in tissue sections.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks (FFPE) or unstained tissue sections mounted on positively
charged microscope slides.
• Unacceptable specimens: Insufficient, damaged, or improperly
fixed tissue.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Incubator (37°C and 60°C)
• Coplin jars or staining racks
• Humidity chamber
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• 3% Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in methanol
• Heat-induced antigen retrieval solution (e.g., Citrate buffer, pH 6.0
or Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0)
• Primary antibody for NSE
• Secondary antibody (biotinylated or HRP-conjugated)
• Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB, AEC)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Positively charged slides
• Coverslips
• Forceps
• Dropper bottles
• Pipettes and tips
6. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks and mount
on positively charged slides.
2. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour.
3. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
4. Rehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (100%, 95%, 70%)
for 2 minutes each.
5. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval by placing slides in a
heat-resistant container containing the antigen retrieval solution
(citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0).
2. Heat the solution to 95-100°C using a water bath or microwave
for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 3 minutes.
C. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 3 minutes.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the primary NSE antibody to each slide. Incubate in a
humidity chamber at room temperature for 1 hour or overnight
at 4°C.
2. Rinse slides briefly in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
E. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the secondary antibody (biotinylated or HRP-conjugated)
to each slide. Incubate in a humidity chamber at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
2. Rinse slides briefly in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
F. Chromogen Development:
1. Apply the chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) to each slide and
incubate for 5-10 minutes, monitoring the development of color.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes to stop the reaction.
G. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water thoroughly.
3. Dehydrate slides rapidly through graded ethanol (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
H. Mounting:
1. Mount slides with a coverslip using a suitable mounting
medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control should include positive and negative control slides
with each run. Positive control: Known positive tissue for NSE.
Negative control: Same tissue with the omission of the primary
antibody.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
The technical results of the immunostain procedure will be
documented. It is the responsibility of the pathologist to review and
interpret the stained slides.
9. REFERENCES AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Refer to the primary antibody datasheet and reagent manufacturers’
instructions for detailed technical information.
Note: Always practice standard laboratory safety precautions and
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during all
steps of the procedure.
