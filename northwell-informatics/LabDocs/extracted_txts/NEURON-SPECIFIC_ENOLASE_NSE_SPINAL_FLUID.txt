Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) in Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and consistent analysis of Neuron-Specific
Enolase (NSE) in spinal fluid specimens, following defined protocols
to maintain the integrity of the results, the safety of laboratory
personnel, and compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure accurate and timely processing of NSE
tests. All personnel should report any deviations from procedures or
equipment malfunctions to the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: Spinal fluid, CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid),
collected in sterile containers.
• Volume required: Minimum 1-2 mL.
Handling:
• Spinal fluid specimens should be processed as soon as possible
after collection.
• If transport is needed, specimens should be kept at 4°C and
delivered to the laboratory within 24 hours.
• Specimens should be free of blood contamination. Any specimens
with visible blood or particulate matter should be rejected.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens with visible blood contamination.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory beyond the recommended
24-hour window from time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA kit: NSE ELISA kit (supplier details, catalog number)
◦ Calibrators and controls provided with the kit
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Multichannel pipette
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
◦ Plate shaker (if recommended in the kit insert)
◦ Sterile containers for specimen collection
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation: - Ensure all reagents and equipment are at room
temperature before testing - Calibrate micropipettes as per laboratory
protocol - Prepare all reagents as instructed in the ELISA kit insert -
Arrange calibrators, controls, and spinal fluid specimens on the
ELISA plate
Assay Steps: 1. Add 50 µl of standard, control, specimen, and blank
into respective wells ensuring no cross-contamination. 2. Add 50 µl of
detection antibody to each well. 3. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at
room temperature (22-25°C) on a plate shaker set to 300 rpm. 4.
Wash the wells 3 times with the provided wash buffer (as per kit
instructions). 5. Add 100 µl of enzyme conjugate solution to each
well. 6. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature. 7.
Wash the wells 3 times with the provided wash buffer. 8. Add 100 µl
of substrate solution to each well. 9. Incubate the plate for 15 minutes
in the dark. 10. Add 100 µl of stop solution to each well to halt the
reaction. 11. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate
reader.
Calculation and Interpretation: - Construct the standard curve by
plotting the mean absorbance of each calibrator against the known
concentration of NSE. - Calculate the NSE concentration in each
specimen and control using the standard curve. - Ensure that the
assay controls fall within the established ranges to validate the assay.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run controls included in the kit with each batch of
specimens.
◦ Verify that controls fall within the acceptable ranges
provided in the kit insert.
◦ Document all control results in the Quality Control log.
◦ Repeat assay if controls are out of range and document
corrective actions.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Recording: - Enter results into Laboratory Information System
(LIS) as per laboratory protocol. - Review and verify results before
releasing.
Critical Results: - Report any critically high or low NSE results
immediately to the requesting physician as per laboratory protocol.

2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for limitations specific to the NSE assay,
including factors that may affect accuracy and precision.
1. SAFETY
Laboratory personnel must adhere to safety protocols, including the
use of PPE and proper waste disposal methods, for handling spinal
fluid specimens and chemicals involved in the assay.
