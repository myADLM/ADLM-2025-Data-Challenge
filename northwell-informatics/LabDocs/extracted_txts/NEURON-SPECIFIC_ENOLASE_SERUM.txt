STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase Procedures for Determination of Neuron-
Specific Enolase (NSE) Levels in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and responsibilities for the accurate and precise
measurement of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in serum
samples to support clinical diagnosis and monitoring.
2. SCOPE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) applies to all personnel
involved in the analytical phase of measuring NSE levels using the
laboratory's designated analyzer.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the assay in
accordance with this SOP, performing quality control (QC) checks,
and troubleshooting.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for ensuring the SOP is
followed, maintaining proper documentation, and addressing any
issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection Procedure: Blood should be collected by
venipuncture into a clot activator tube (e.g., gold-top serum
separator tube).
• Handling: Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes but no
more than 1 hour before centrifugation. Centrifuge at 1,300-1,800
x g for 10 minutes. If serum is not analyzed immediately, it should
be aliquoted and stored at -20°C or lower.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C,
30 days at -20°C, or 3 months at -80°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) assay kit (e.g., ELISA or
chemiluminescent immunoassay)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Sample tubes
• Quality control materials (high and low control sera)
• Refrigerator/freezer
• Incubator/shaker (if required by the assay)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Turn on the analyzer and allow the system to perform self-
checks.
2. Review the NSE reagent kit insert for specific preparation
instructions and any lot-specific information.
3. Thaw serum samples, controls, and calibrators to room
temperature and vortex mix gently.
B. Assay Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibrators and controls as specified by the reagent
kit, and load them onto the analyzer.
2. Run the assay calibration according to the manufacturer's
guidelines. Ensure the calibration curve meets acceptance
criteria.
3. Run quality control samples at both high and low levels
before testing patient samples. Verify that QC results fall within
acceptable ranges as defined by the lab's QC policy.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Label test tubes or sample containers with appropriate
identifiers.
2. Load patient serum samples into the analyzer.
3. Initiate the assay run following the analyzer's operational
manual.
4. After the run is complete, review raw data and calculated
results.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference Intervals: Refer to laboratory-specific reference
intervals for NSE which are determined based on the patient
population and assay methodology.
• Flag any critical or out-of-range values, and follow the laboratory's
policy for critical value notification.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Daily Quality Control: Perform daily QC checks using predefined
high and low controls. Document and review the results.
• Troubleshooting: If QC results are out of range, do not proceed
with sample analysis until the issue is resolved. Document all
corrective actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data Entry: Enter results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) promptly.
• Verification: Technologist reviews all results for accuracy and
signs off before results are released.
• Documentation: Maintain all instrument printouts, calibration
curves, quality control results, and patient result logs in
accordance with the laboratory’s record-keeping policy.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect NSE
results. Verify sample quality and document any observed
interferences.
• Cross-reactivity: Refer to the reagent kit insert for any known
cross-reactivity with other serum components.
