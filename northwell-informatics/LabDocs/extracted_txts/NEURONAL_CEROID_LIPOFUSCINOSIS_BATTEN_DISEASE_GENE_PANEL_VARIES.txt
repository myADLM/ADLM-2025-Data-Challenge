Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten Disease) Gene Panel
Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical process for generating results for the Neuronal
Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten Disease) Gene Panel in order to
ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP to perform the testing, interpretation, and verification of results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this protocol and addressing any deficiencies in the testing process.
1. DEFINITION
The Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) Gene Panel uses next-
generation sequencing (NGS) to identify mutations in genes known to
be associated with Batten Disease, a group of inherited
neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of
lipopigments in neural and other tissues.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion
Torrent)
• DNA extraction kits (validated for use with blood or tissue
samples)
• Library preparation kits for the specific NGS platform
• Quantification and quality control kits (e.g., Qubit, Bioanalyzer)
• Thermocycler
• Magnetic beads for purification
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• PCR plates and tubes
• PCR reagents
• Nuclease-free water
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from whole blood or tissue samples using
validated DNA extraction kits following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA concentration and assess purity using a Qubit
fluorometer and spectrophotometer (e.g., Nanodrop).
3. Determine DNA integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis or a
Bioanalyzer system.
B) Library Preparation
1. Shear the extracted DNA to the desired fragment size as per
the NGS platform requirements.
2. Prepare libraries using the selected library preparation kit,
including end-repair, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification
steps.
3. Clean up reactions using magnetic beads to remove unwanted
fragments and reagents.
C) Library Quantification and Quality Control
1. Quantify the prepared libraries using a fluorometer and perform
size assessment using a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation system.
2. Normalize library concentrations and pool libraries as
necessary.
D) Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencer following the
platform-specific protocols.
2. Set up the sequencing run with appropriate parameters (e.g.,
read length, multiplexing indices).
3. Monitor the sequencing run. Verify that the sequencing quality
metrics meet acceptable criteria.
E) Data Analysis
1. Perform initial data processing (base calling and
demultiplexing) on the sequencer.
2. Align sequence reads to the reference genome using
appropriate bioinformatics tools.
3. Perform variant calling to identify potential pathogenic
mutations.
4. Annotate variants using variant databases and clinical
interpretation tools.
F) Interpretation and Reporting Results
1. Review the identified variants for quality and clinical relevance.
2. Document and interpret the variants in the context of Neuronal
Ceroid Lipofuscinosis.
3. Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the results, including
identified mutations, their potential impact, and relevant
references/citations.
4. Store raw data, analyzed data, and final reports securely in the
laboratory information system (LIS) for record-keeping and
review.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of DNA
extraction and library preparation to monitor assay
performance.
2. Run internal quality control samples with known mutations
during each sequencing run.
3. Discrepant results should be investigated, and corrective
actions taken as necessary.
4. Regularly participate in external quality assurance programs for
genetic testing.
B) Sequencer Maintenance and Calibration
1. Perform routine maintenance of the sequencing platform
following the manufacturer's recommended schedule.
2. Calibrate and validate sequencers periodically to ensure
accurate performance.
3. Maintain logs of all maintenance activities and any corrective
actions taken.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Transmit results to the LIS where they can be reviewed and
verified by a qualified molecular pathologist or geneticist.
6. Ensure timely communication of critical findings to the ordering
physician or relevant clinical team members.
7. Retain records of all results for a period defined by regulatory
and institutional requirements.
