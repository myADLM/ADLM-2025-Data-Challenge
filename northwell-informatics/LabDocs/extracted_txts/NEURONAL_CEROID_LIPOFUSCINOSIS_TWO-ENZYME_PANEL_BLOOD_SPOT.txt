Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Neuronal Ceroid
Lipofuscinosis, Two-Enzyme Panel, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
To detail the analytical procedures involved in generating results for
Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL), with emphasis on the two-
enzyme panel from blood spot specimens.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the steps outlined in this procedure. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the protocol
and addressing any deficiencies in the analytic procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: Blood spots collected on appropriate filter
paper and allowed to air dry completely.
• Unacceptable: Blood spots that are insufficient in quantity, dried
improperly, or contaminated.
Stability:
• Blood spots are stable for up to 30 days at room temperature
(20-25°C). Store blood spots in a cool, dry place, away from direct
sunlight.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Filter paper for blood spot collection
• Enzyme assay kits specific for NCL enzymes (e.g., Palmitoyl-
protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT1) and Tripeptidyl Peptidase 1
(TPP1))
• Microplate reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Pipettes
• Pipette tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Clinical laboratory reagents specific for the assay
• Required laboratory glassware and plasticware
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Ensure that blood spot specimens are completely dried and
properly labeled. • Prepare reagents as per manufacturer’s
instructions. • Set up microplate reader, pipettes, and other
equipment needed for the assay.
B) Assay Procedure:
• Punch out a specified diameter of the blood spot from the filter
paper and place it into a pre-labeled microplate well. • Add the assay
buffer to each well according to the assay kit’s directions. • Incubate
the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the assay kit’s instructions.
• Add the substrates specific for PPT1 and TPP1 enzymes to the
designated wells. • Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified
by the manufacturer. • Read the enzyme reaction absorbance at the
specified wavelength using the microplate reader. • Calculate enzyme
activities for PPT1 and TPP1 using the provided reference standards
and controls.
C) Quality Control:
• Conduct the assay with control specimens (both negative and
positive) to validate the results. • Repeat testing if control values fall
outside acceptable limits. • Document all quality control findings and
corrective actions, if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation:
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). • Verify
and confirm results according to laboratory policies. • Alert
supervising staff in case of abnormal results or assay errors for
further review.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals specific for PPT1 and TPP1 enzyme activities
should be established and verified based on historical data and
manufacturer recommendations.
Critical Values:
• Immediately report critical values to the appropriate medical
personnel. • Follow established protocols for documenting and
addressing critical values.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations
regarding enzyme substrate specificity, potential interferences, and
any other assay limitations.
