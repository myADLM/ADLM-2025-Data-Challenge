Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Neuronal Ceroid
Lipofuscinosis, Two-Enzyme Panel in Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedures for the
analysis of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) using a two-
enzyme panel in leukocytes. This procedure ensures the accurate
and reliable generation of results crucial for diagnosing and
monitoring patients with NCL.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated laboratory personnel performing
the two-enzyme panel testing for Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis on
leukocyte samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
testing, ensure compliance with the SOP, and maintain the accuracy
and reliability of the analytical results. Supervisors are responsible for
verifying and documenting corrective actions when necessary.
4. DEFINITIONS
Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) - A group of inherited
neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive
accumulation of lipopigments in the brain, retina, and other tissues.
Two-Enzyme Panel - A diagnostic test involving the measurement of
specific enzyme activity levels in leukocytes to identify abnormal
metabolic profiles associated with NCL.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and freezer
• Heating block
• Assay kit for enzyme testing (Commercially available kits
validated for NCL enzyme activity measurement)
• Leukocyte isolation kit
• Calibrated pipettes
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer
• Quality control material (Commercial reference standards)
• Data analysis software
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Leukocyte isolation from whole blood or buffy
coat from anticoagulated blood (EDTA or heparin).
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 5 mL of whole blood.
• Specimen Stability: Store isolated leukocytes at 2-8°C for a
maximum of 24 hours or freeze at -80°C if not tested within 24
hours.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Isolate leukocytes from whole blood using a leukocyte isolation
kit following manufacturer's instructions.
2. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 400xg at room temperature.
3. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.
4. Resuspend the leukocyte pellet in a suitable buffer for enzyme
assay.
B. Enzyme Assay
1. Set up the assay plate and prepare reagents as per the
instructions provided in the commercial assay kit.
2. Add isolated leukocytes to wells according to the kit protocol.
3. Incubate samples at the specific temperatures and durations
defined in the kit instructions.
4. Measure enzyme activity using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens to
ensure assay integrity.
2. Validate each new lot number of enzyme assay kits using
known reference standards.
3. Document any deviations or corrective actions in the
appropriate logs.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Analyze raw enzyme activity data using data analysis software.
2. Compare patient enzyme activity levels against established
reference ranges.
3. Review results for any outliers or inconsistencies.
4. Report final results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) after technologist verification.
8. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
If enzyme activity levels are outside acceptable limits or if there are
technical difficulties:
1. Verify the integrity of the leukocyte isolation and assay
procedures.
2. Repeat the enzyme assay on the same or new specimen if
necessary.
3. Document all corrective actions and notify the supervisor
immediately.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control is performed to ensure the reliability of results:
1. Include internal quality control samples with each assay run.
2. Follow the established quality control material protocols and
validity criteria.
3. Record and analyze quality control results monthly to ensure
consistency and accuracy.
