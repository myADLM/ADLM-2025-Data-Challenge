Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Neuronal Differentiation 1 (NEUROD1),
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the step-by-step procedure for
the accurate and reliable analysis of Neuronal Differentiation 1
(NEUROD1) in the laboratory. This includes preparation, processing,
and quality control measures necessary to ensure the integrity and
validity of the resulting data.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform the
analytical phase of NEUROD1 testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis according to this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for ensuring that all personnel are trained and competent
in performing the procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
NEUROD1: Neuronal Differentiation 1, a gene involved in the
regulation of neuronal differentiation.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Labeled 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Master Mix (contains dNTPs, Taq polymerase, MgCl2)
• NEUROD1 specific primers
• DNA template
• Nuclease-free water
• Agarose gel electrophoresis system
• Ethidium bromide or safe DNA stain
• UV gel documentation system
• Thermometer and timer
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection).
2. Turn on the PCR thermocycler and set it to the appropriate
cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
6.2 PCR Mix Preparation
1. On ice, prepare the PCR Master Mix for each sample as follow:
◦ 10 µL of Master Mix
◦ 1 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of DNA template (typically 50 ng/µL)
◦ X µL of nuclease-free water to bring the total volume to 20
µL
2. Mix gently by pipetting up and down or by gentle vortexing.
3. Briefly centrifuge the mix to ensure all components are at the
bottom of the tube.
6.3 PCR Amplification
1. Aliquot 20 µL of the PCR mix into labeled PCR tubes.
2. Load the tubes into the PCR thermocycler.
3. Start the thermocycler with the pre-set conditions mentioned
above.
6.4 Post-PCR Procedures
1. After amplification, remove the PCR tubes from the
thermocycler.
2. Load 5 µL of the PCR product mixed with 1 µL of loading dye
into an agarose gel (2% agarose) prepared with ethidium
bromide or another safe DNA stain.
3. Run the gel at 100V for 30 minutes or until the dye front has
adequately migrated.
6.5 Visualization and Documentation
1. Carefully remove the gel and place it on the UV transilluminator.
2. Visualize the bands under UV light and capture an image using
the gel documentation system.
3. Compare band size with an appropriate DNA ladder to ensure
correct NEUROD1 product size.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
2. Verify the size and presence of bands in positive controls.
3. Ensure no bands are present in negative controls.
4. Repeat the PCR if controls do not show expected results.
8. REPORTING AND RECORDING RESULTS
1. Record the sample IDs and corresponding gel results in the
laboratory notebook or electronic data sheet.
2. Verify and review results before recording them in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Store images of the gels and ensure they are properly labeled
with date and batch ID.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If no bands or unexpected band sizes:
◦ Check the DNA template quality and concentration.
◦ Verify the primers are specific to NEUROD1.
◦ Review the PCR cycling conditions.
2. If multiple bands appear:
◦ Optimize annealing temperature.
◦ Use gradient PCR to determine the optimal conditions.
