STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYSIS OF NEUROTENSIN
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedures for
the analysis of Neurotensin in clinical specimens using the
appropriate instrumentation and methodologies, ensuring accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of Neurotensin in biological specimens, particularly plasma
or serum.
3. DEFINITIONS
Neurotensin: A peptide hormone involved in the regulation of various
physiological processes including modulation of dopamine signaling,
smooth muscle contraction, and cancer cell growth.
4. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this protocol to
ensure consistency and accuracy in Neurotensin measurements. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all
personnel are adequately trained and competent in these
procedures.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma (preferred), Serum
• Collection:
◦ Collect blood in EDTA or sodium heparin vacutainer tubes for
plasma
◦ Allow blood to clot and then centrifuge for serum
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of plasma or serum is required.
• Handling: Specimens should be processed within 1 hour of
collection to prevent degradation of Neurotensin. Plasma or
serum should be kept at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Neurotensin assay kit (e.g., ELISA or RIA specific for
Neurotensin)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader (for ELISA) or gamma counter (for RIA)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated storage (-20°C or -80°C)
• Deionized water
• Calibrated scales and balances
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use control samples provided with the assay kit to ensure assay
performance.
• Include at least two levels of controls (low, high) in each run.
• Document any deviations from the expected control results and
undertake corrective action if required.
8. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (18-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare diluents, wash buffers, standard solutions, and control
samples according to the assay kit instructions.
Step 2: Sample Prep and Assay Setup 3. Centrifuge plasma or
serum samples at 2,000-3,000 x g for 10-20 minutes to remove any
particulate matter. 4. Transfer the clear supernatant to clean tubes for
analysis. 5. If high levels of lipemia or hemolysis are noted, reject the
specimen and request a new sample.
Step 3: Assay Procedure 6. Follow the specific steps outlined in the
assay kit insert. Typically, this includes:
• Adding samples, standards, and controls into designated wells.
• Adding conjugate/hormone detection reagents.
• Incubating for specified periods, often with shaking.
• Performing wash steps between incubations.
• Adding substrate solutions and measuring absorbance (for
ELISA) or gamma emissions (for RIA).
Step 4: Data Collection 7. Read the assay plate/substrate solution
on the appropriate instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions (e.g., plate reader for ELISA at 450 nm with reference at
620 nm).
Step 5: Calculation and Validation 8. Generate a standard curve
using the measured absorbance/emission values of the standards. 9.
Derive concentrations of test samples by interpolating from the
standard curve. 10. Validate results against control samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data generated will be reviewed by the technologist to ensure QC
parameters are within acceptable limits.
• Results will be recorded in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring all patient data and test results are correctly
associated and verified before final reporting.
• Critical values should be communicated directly to the physician
in charge or brought to the supervisor’s attention immediately.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Neurotensin, fasting plasma: < 15 pg/mL (thresholds may vary
based on assay)
• Neurotensin, post-prandial: Reference values will depend on the
clinical question/assay used.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia or improper storage can affect results.
• Cross-reactivity with similar peptides can lead to inaccuracies;
thorough validation for your patient population is recommended.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for the employed
Neurotensin assay kits.
• Current literature on Neurotensin clinical chemistry and
physiology.
13. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• This document will require reviewing and approving by the
laboratory director prior to implementation.
• Regular review and updates must follow changes in assay
protocols or instrumentations.
This protocol aims to guide laboratory personnel on the standardized
method for reliable analysis of Neurotensin levels, ensuring quality
and consistency in patient testing.
