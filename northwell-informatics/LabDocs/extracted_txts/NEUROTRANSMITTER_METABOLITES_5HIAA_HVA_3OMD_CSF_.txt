Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Neurotransmitter Metabolites (5HIAA, HVA, 3OMD) in CSF
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the measurement of
neurotransmitter metabolites, namely 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3-methoxy-4-
hydroxyphenylglycol (3OMD) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens.
This protocol ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability in the
generation of test results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites using the designated
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) instrumentation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analyses as outlined in this SOP. The laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this protocol and maintaining
quality control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimens: CSF collected in a sterile tube without any
additives.
• Volume: A minimum volume of 0.5 mL of CSF is required for
analysis.
• Storage: CSF specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C
immediately after collection and stored at -80°C if not analyzed
within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, turbid, or visibly
contaminated specimens are not acceptable for analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or LC-MS/MS
system
• Analytical balance
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigeration unit (2-8°C) and a freezer (-80°C)
• Graduated pipettes and pipette tips
• Autopipettes (single-channel and multi-channel)
• Certified standards for 5HIAA, HVA, and 3OMD
• Internal standard solution
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid)
• Safety equipment (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
• CSF calibrators and appropriate quality control materials
• LC vials and caps
• Sample preparation tubes
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Calibration Standard Preparation:
• Prepare calibration standards for 5HIAA, HVA, and 3OMD in
appropriate concentrations according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Store calibration standards at -20°C, properly labeled, and
document expiration dates.
6.2. Quality Control:
• Use QC materials to verify the performance of the analytical
method.
• Run at least two levels of QC samples (low and high) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Document and review QC results for each analytical run.
6.3. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw CSF samples at room temperature if previously frozen.
• Vortex-mix the samples for 15 seconds.
• In a clean preparation area, aliquot 200 µL of the CSF sample into
a labeled preparation tube.
• Add 20 µL of the internal standard solution to each sample.
• Vortex-mix the sample tubes for 30 seconds.
• Centrifuge the samples at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Transfer the clear supernatant to labeled LC vials.
6.4. Chromatographic Conditions (example for LC-MS/MS):
• Column: C18 column, 100 x 4.6 mm, 3 µm particle size.
• Mobile Phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid.
• Mobile Phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
• Flow rate: 0.3 mL/min.
• Injection volume: 20 µL.
• Run time: Approximately 15 minutes.
• Ion mode: Positive electrospray ionization (ESI+).
6.5. Instrument Calibration and Sample Analysis:
• Calibrate the instrument using the prepared calibration standards.
• Analyze QC samples and verify their acceptability before
proceeding.
• Inject the patient CSF samples and run the chromatographic
analysis using the determined conditions.
• Document retention times and peak areas of analytes and internal
standard.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze chromatograms to quantify 5HIAA, HVA, and 3OMD
concentrations by comparing them with the calibration curve.
• Review and verify that all QC criteria are met before reporting
patient results.
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) ensuring
patient confidentiality and data integrity.
• Include reference intervals for each analyte:
◦ 5HIAA: 5-50 ng/mL
◦ HVA: 15-45 ng/mL
◦ 3OMD: 0.5-5 ng/mL
• Flag any results that fall outside the reference intervals for review.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL
• Adherence to the internal and external QC measures is
paramount.
• Perform instrument calibration and maintenance as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document and review all QC activities and corrective actions
taken.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instrument and reagent manuals.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Published peer-reviewed literature on the quantification of CSF
neurotransmitter metabolites.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibration, QC, sample preparation,
instrument run data, and results.
• Make records accessible for review by internal and external
auditors.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures high standards for
accuracy and reliability in the measurement of neurotransmitter
metabolites in CSF, contributing to quality patient care and clinical
decision-making.
