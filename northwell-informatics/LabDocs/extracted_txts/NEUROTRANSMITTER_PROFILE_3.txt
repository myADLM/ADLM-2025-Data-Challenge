Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Neurotransmitter Profile 3
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for the analysis,
documentation, and generation of results for Neurotransmitter Profile
3 in a CLIA-certified laboratory to ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible test results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of specimens for Neurotransmitter Profile 3.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the analysis as described in this SOP.
• Documenting all steps accurately and completely.
• Notifying the supervisor of any deviations from the procedure or
abnormal results.
• Conducting maintenance and calibration of equipment according
to specified schedules.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for:
• Ensuring staff are adequately trained and competent.
• Reviewing and verifying test results.
• Implementing corrective actions when necessary.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
electrochemical detector.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Analytical balance.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Neurotransmitter Profile 3 reagent kit.
• Mobile phase (as per manufacturer's instructions).
• Standard reference materials for neurotransmitters (dopamine,
serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.).
1. REAGENTS AND STANDARDS
• Neurotransmitter standards.
• Calibration solutions.
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high concentration).
• Mobile phase solvents (specified in the reagent kit).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen type: Plasma or urine.
• Minimum volume required: 5 mL.
• Stability: Specimens must be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) and
analyzed within 48 hours of collection or frozen at -20°C for
extended storage (up to 1 month).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Verify the specimen identity and adequacy as per the
requisition form.
2. Centrifuge the plasma/urine specimen at 1500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C.
3. Aliquot the supernatant into labeled tubes.
4. If specimens are not immediately analyzed, store aliquots at
-20°C.
B. Instrument Preparation
1. Power on the HPLC system and allow it to equilibrate with the
mobile phase.
2. Perform system checks and purge the lines as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Load the standard reference materials and quality control
samples to calibrate the instrument.
4. Set the method parameters according to the reagent kit insert.
C. Analysis
1. Thaw specimens at room temperature if previously frozen and
vortex to mix.
2. Dilute specimen with the provided diluent, if required, as per
reagent kit insert.
3. Load prepared specimens onto the HPLC system.
4. Run the samples in accordance with the established HPLC
protocol.
5. Ensure the sequence includes blanks, standards, quality
controls, and patient specimens.
6. Continuously monitor the analysis to ensure there are no errors
or instrument malfunctions.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Upon completion of the run, review chromatograms for each
specimen.
2. Quantify neurotransmitters using the calibration curve
generated from the standards.
3. Validate the results using quality control samples. If controls are
outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and rerun affected
samples.
4. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
5. Review results to identify any inconsistencies or abnormalities.
6. Verify and authorize results for reporting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
A. Quality Control
1. Analyze quality control samples at the beginning and end of
each run.
2. Document results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges.
3. Investigate and resolve any control failures before reporting
patient results.
B. Maintenance
1. Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Document all maintenance activities and any troubleshooting
actions taken.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Dopamine: 0-50 pg/mL (plasma), 0-500 µg/g creatinine (urine)
• Serotonin: 0-200 ng/mL (plasma), 0-250 µg/g creatinine (urine)
• Norepinephrine: 0-600 pg/mL (plasma), 0-1000 µg/g creatinine
(urine)
Refer to the latest clinical guidelines or reagent kit inserts for specific
reference intervals.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed by a
technologist. Critical results must be communicated promptly to the
clinician.
