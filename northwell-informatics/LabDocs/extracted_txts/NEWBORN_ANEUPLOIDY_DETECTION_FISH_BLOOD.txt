Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Newborn
Aneuploidy Detection via Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for detecting aneuploidy in
newborn blood samples using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the laboratory technologists and staff
responsible for processing and analyzing samples for newborn
aneuploidy detection through FISH in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to:
• Follow this procedure for consistent and accurate detection of
aneuploidy.
• Document all steps and results accurately.
• Handle specimens and reagents properly to maintain sample
integrity.
• Report results to the designated medical personnel.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Aneuploidy: The presence of an abnormal number of
chromosomes in a cell.
• FISH: A molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent
probes binding to specific chromosome regions.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Peripheral blood collected in a heparin-coated
vacutainer.
• Volume: Minimum 1-2 mL of whole blood.
• Handling and Storage: Specimen must be kept at room
temperature and analyzed within 48 hours of collection. Avoid
freezing.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Probe mix for detection of specific chromosomes (e.g., 13, 18, 21,
X, Y)
• Fixatives (Carnoy’s solution)
• Washing solutions (PBS, SSC buffer, etc.)
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Fluorescent microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets
• Hybridization chamber
• Thermocycler or hybridization oven
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
7. PROCEDURE
Day 1: Sample Preparation
1. Preparation of Cell Suspension:
◦ Mix blood sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Transfer 500 µL of blood to a centrifuge tube.
2. Fixation:
◦ Add 3 mL of hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl) to the blood
sample.
◦ Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
◦ Add 5 mL of fixative (3:1 Methanol:Acetic Acid) to the pellet.
◦ Repeat the fixation step twice more to ensure proper
fixation.
3. Slide Preparation:
◦ Drop 10 µL of the fixed cell suspension onto clean glass
slides.
◦ Allow to air dry completely.
Day 2: FISH Hybridization
1. Preparation of Probes:
◦ Denature the chromosome-specific probe mix by placing in
a preheated thermocycler at 75°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Immediately place the mix on ice.
2. Denaturation of Chromosomal DNA:
◦ Pre-treat slides in a hybridization pre-treatment solution.
◦ Denature the chromosomal DNA on the slides by heating at
75°C for 2 minutes in a hybridization chamber or
thermocycler.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Apply 10 µL of denatured probe mix to each slide.
◦ Cover the slides with coverslips and seal edges with rubber
cement.
◦ Incubate the slides at 37°C overnight in a humidified
chamber.
Day 3: Post-Hybridization Wash and Microscopy
1. Post-Hybridization Wash:
◦ Remove the coverslips carefully and wash slides in 50%
formamide/2× SSC at 45°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in 2× SSC at 45°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 0.1× SSC at 45°C for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS at room temperature for 2 minutes.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply DAPI stain (or equivalent) to each slide to
counterstain the nuclei.
◦ Apply a coverslip and seal edges.
3. Microscopic Analysis:
◦ Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filter sets.
◦ Identify and quantify fluorescent signal patterns
corresponding to the targeted chromosomes (e.g., dual-
color signals for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y).
◦ Capture images and document results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a positive control (known aneuploid sample) and a negative
control (normal karyotype sample) alongside patient samples.
• Verify proper functioning of fluorescent microscope and
calibration.
• Document all controls and results on the appropriate log sheets.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Generate a detailed report including the detected aneuploidies,
image capture, and interpretation.
• Results are reviewed and verified by a senior technologist or
supervisor.
• Communicate results to the designated medical personnel
following site-specific reporting protocols.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Consult the probe manufacturer’s insert for limitations specific to
each reagent. The results are subject to the quality of specimen,
hybridization conditions, and proper handling procedures.
