Standard Operating Procedure: Analysis of NICKEL in 24-Hour
Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the method for analytical measurement of
Nickel (Ni) in 24-hour urine samples. The purpose is to ensure
accurate and precise determination of urinary Nickel concentrations
using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out the
analysis as outlined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff
to follow the procedure to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• 24-hour urine collection
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum 10 mL of well-mixed 24-hour urine
Collection Containers:
• Specimen should be collected in a clean, plastic 24-hour urine
collection container with no metal cap or other metal components,
as metallic components can contaminate the specimen.
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Specimens are stable for up to 7 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Specimens can be stored for up to 1
month.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ICP-MS instrument
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Volumetric flasks
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• High purity Nitric acid (HNO₃)
• Deionized water
• Nickel standard solution
Supplies:
• Plastic sample cups
• Disposable gloves
• 24-hour urine collection containers
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
2. Measure and record the total volume of the urine collection.
3. Aliquot a 10 mL sample into a plastic sample cup.
4. Add 1 mL of concentrated nitric acid (ensure clean, metal-free handling) to each urine sample and mix well using a vortex mixer.
5. If necessary, centrifuge samples at approximately 3000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove particulate matter.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a new clean container if centrifugation was performed.
ICP-MS Analysis:
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS instrument using Nickel standard solutions.
- Prepare a series of Nickel standards in a range that includes expected urine concentrations (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 µg/L).
2. Run quality control samples alongside each batch of patient samples.
3. Program the ICP-MS with method parameters for Nickel analysis:
- Ensure the correct isotopes for Nickel are monitored.
4. Introduce each processed urine sample into the ICP-MS and record the Nickel concentrations.
5. Perform rinse cycles with deionized water between samples to prevent cross-contamination.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control measures must be carried out to ensure the reliability
of the results. Quality controls include:
1. Daily instrument calibration checks using Nickel standards.
2. Analysis of blank samples to check for contamination.
3. Inclusion of both high and low Nickel control samples in each run.
4. Review of internal standard recovery to ensure consistent performance.
5. If QC samples fail, troubleshoot the ICP-MS and recalibrate as necessary before proceeding.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Range:
• Typical reference range for Nickel in urine: < 5 µg/L
• Abnormal result thresholds should be established based on
clinical guidelines and consultation.
Result Reporting:
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report Nickel concentration in µg/L and flag any results outside of
the reference range.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE
Documentation:
• Maintain accurate logs of all calibration, quality control, and
patient samples.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
• Archive printouts from the ICP-MS instrument for traceability.
Maintenance:
• The ICP-MS must be maintained as per manufacturer's
instructions.
• Regular cleaning and maintenance schedules should be adhered
to, ensuring the instrument's optimal performance.
