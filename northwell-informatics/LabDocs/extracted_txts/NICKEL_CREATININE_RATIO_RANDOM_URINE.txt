Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for Measuring Nickel/Creatinine Ratio in
Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized protocol
for the measurement of the Nickel/Creatinine ratio in random urine
specimens. This ensures consistency in the procedure, accuracy of
results, and adherence to the laboratory’s quality management
system.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained technologist to follow the
procedures outlined below and ensure that all steps are completed
accurately.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean, dry container
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Urine samples that are less than 5 mL
• Urine samples received after 24 hours of collection
• Specimen containers that are leaking or contaminated
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for
nickel measurement
• Automated analyzer or spectrophotometer for creatinine
measurement
Reagents:
• Calibration standards for Nickel
• Calibration standards for Creatinine
• Quality control materials for Nickel and Creatinine
• Deionized water
• Acid to digest specimens (e.g., HNO3)
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips
• Vials and caps
• Centrifuges
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Mix urine sample thoroughly before analysis.
2. Pipette an appropriate volume of urine (e.g., 1 mL) into clean
digestion vials.
3. Add a pre-determined volume of acid (e.g., 3 mL of HNO3) to
each vial for sample digestion.
4. Heat the vials to digest the samples, following lab-specific
digestion protocols.
5. Cool the samples to room temperature and dilute to the
appropriate volume using deionized water.
B. Analysis for Nickel
1. Set up the ICP-MS and calibrate with appropriate Nickel
standards.
2. Run quality control samples and check for accuracy and
precision.
3. Introduce the prepared urine samples into the ICP-MS.
4. Record Nickel concentrations from ICP-MS output.
C. Analysis for Creatinine
1. Set up the automated analyzer or spectrophotometer and
calibrate with appropriate Creatinine standards.
2. Run quality control samples and check for accuracy and
precision.
3. Pipette the prepared urine samples into the analyzer.
4. Record Creatinine concentrations from the output of the
analyzer.
D. Calculation of Nickel/Creatinine Ratio
1. Divide the concentration of Nickel (μg/L) by the concentration of
Creatinine (mg/dL).
2. Express the final Nickel/Creatinine ratio in terms of μg/mg.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify calibration of both the ICP-MS and the automated analyzer/
spectrophotometer daily.
• Run quality control samples for Nickel and Creatinine with each
batch to ensure accuracy of results.
• Document all quality control results and corrective actions in the
QC log.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, repeat the analysis and
notify the supervisor for further troubleshooting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
• Technologists must verify that the Nickel/Creatinine ratio fits within
the expected physiological range.
• Critical values must be communicated promptly to the
corresponding healthcare provider according to lab policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Nickel: Refer to analyte reference ranges provided by equipment
manufacturer.
• Creatinine: 30-300 mg/Dl in random urine
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the inserts provided by the ICP-MS and creatinine
measurement equipment for method limitations and performance
characteristics, including sensitivity, specificity, and interference.
