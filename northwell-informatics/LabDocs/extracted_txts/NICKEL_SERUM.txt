STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for the Determination of Nickel in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical steps required to measure
nickel concentration in serum samples accurately and reliably.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical and research laboratories
performing nickel determinations in serum that are compliant with
CLIA certification.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP to generate accurate and reproducible results. The
laboratory supervisor must ensure all staff are adequately trained and
comply with this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) with Graphite
Furnace
• Trace-metal free collection tubes
• Specialized nickel calibration standards
• Quality control samples (low, medium, high concentrations)
• Deionized water
• High-purity acids for sample preparation (e.g., nitric acid)
• Sample preparation equipment (e.g., centrifuge, digestion block,
pipettes)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
1. Specimen Type: Serum.
2. Collection: Blood must be collected in trace-metal free tubes.
3. Handling and Stability:
◦ Centrifuge and separate serum from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Store serum aliquots at -20°C until analysis.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum samples completely at room temperature.
2. Mix samples gently but thoroughly before analysis.
3. Digest the serum samples using appropriate volumes of high-
purity nitric acid in a digestion block according to laboratory-
specific protocols.
4. Dilute digested samples with deionized water to a final
appropriate volume for the ICP-MS or AAS system.
5. Filter the diluted samples if necessary to remove any
particulates.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare calibration standards by diluting stock nickel
standard solutions to the required concentrations using
matrix-matched solutions.
2. Internal Standards (if applicable):
◦ Prepare and add internal standards to both calibration
standards and samples to account for matrix effects and
instrument variations.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Use independent quality control samples (low, medium,
high) purchased from commercial sources or in-house
prepared.
◦ Include QC samples in each run to verify instrument
performance.
D. Instrument Setup and Analysis
1. ICP-MS Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for setting up the ICP-
MS.
◦ Verify the instrument calibration with calibration standards
before analysis.
◦ Run a blank, calibration standards, quality control samples,
and unknown samples.
2. AAS Setup (if ICP-MS is not available):
◦ Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for AAS setup with a
graphite furnace.
◦ Ensure proper calibration using nickel standards.
◦ Operate the instrument according to parameters defined for
nickel detection.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Record the signal intensities for all calibration standards,
quality control samples, and specimens.
◦ Digitally store all raw data for post-run analysis.
E. Data Analysis and Verification
1. Calculate nickel concentrations in serum samples using the
calibration curve generated from the calibration standards.
2. Review QC results to ensure they fall within acceptable ranges
before validating the sample data.
3. Re-analyze samples if QC samples do not meet the required
criteria. Troubleshoot the analytical process if necessary.
4. Document all results including any deviations from the
protocol and corrective actions taken.
F. Reporting Results
1. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
2. Ensure that results are entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS) accurately.
3. Any critical values or results outside the reference range should
be reviewed by a supervisor and reported to the healthcare
provider immediately according to the laboratory’s critical
results policy.
6. REFERENCE INTERVAL
Reference interval for nickel in serum (define based on laboratory
validation and standard literature):
• Typical: < 5 µg/L (varies by population and instrumentation
sensitivity)
• Reference ranges should be validated and clearly stated in lab
reporting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Performance of daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance checks
on the analytical instruments.
2. Keep detailed logs of calibration and maintenance activities.
3. Operator must be proficient with the instrument and
demonstrate competency regularly.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific operation manuals of ICP-MS or AAS for the
limitations specific to the technique:
• Possible matrix interference
• Sensitivity and specificity considerations
• Instrument detection limits
