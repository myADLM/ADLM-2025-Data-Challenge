Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Generating Results for
NICOTINE AND METABOLITES, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analysis of nicotine
and its metabolites in randomly collected urine samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the determination of nicotine and its
principal metabolites (cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine) in urine
using a validated analytical method. It is intended for use by
laboratory personnel trained in performing these analyses.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to
perform this procedure accurately and ensure that all data
generated meets the quality standards of the laboratory.
Supervisors should ensure that this procedure is followed and
proper documentation is maintained.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Specimen Type:
◦ Random urine sample
Collection and Handling:
◦ Collect a minimum of 10 mL of urine in a sterile container.
◦ Ensure the container is properly labeled with patient
identification, date, and time of collection.
◦ Specimens should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) if there is a
delay in transportation to the laboratory.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are not properly labeled.
◦ Specimens contaminated with feces or other foreign matter.
◦ Specimens that have leaked or are in cracked containers.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or
Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) system
◦ Urine sample vials
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated storage units
◦ Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify the specimen label against the
requisition and log the sample into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
3. Transfer 1 mL of the supernatant to a clean sample vial.
Extraction Procedure:
1. Add internal standards (e.g., deuterated nicotine and
metabolites) to the urine sample.
2. Perform a liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction
as per the validated method protocol.
3. Evaporate the organic solvent under a stream of nitrogen
gas and reconstitute the residue in a suitable solvent
(e.g., mobile phase) for analysis.
Instrumentation:
1. Set up and calibrate the GC/MS or LC-MS/MS system
according to manufacturer instructions and laboratory
protocols.
2. Inject the prepared sample into the instrument.
3. Use validated chromatographic and mass spectrometric
conditions to separate and detect nicotine, cotinine, and
3-hydroxycotinine.
Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatographic data to identify and quantify
nicotine and its metabolites.
2. Integrate the peak areas and compare them to the
calibration curve generated using known standards.
3. Validate the results by ensuring that the internal standards
and quality controls are within acceptable limits.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter the concentrations of nicotine and its metabolites into
the LIS.
◦ Ensure that the results are reviewed by a qualified
technologist before release.
◦ Report results following the specific laboratory reporting
guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Since there may be no established reference intervals for
nicotine and its metabolites in random urine samples, provide
interpretive comments based on clinical context or established
cut-off values in the scientific literature.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run internal standards and quality control samples (low,
medium, high) with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Document and review quality control results to ensure they
fall within acceptable ranges.
◦ Perform proficiency testing as required.
10. LIMITATIONS
◦ The accuracy of the results may be affected by improper
sample handling or preparation.
◦ Hemolysis or contamination may interfere with the analysis.
◦ The method's sensitivity and specificity must be periodically
validated.
11. REFERENCES
Provide a list of scientific references and instrument manuals
you consulted when developing this SOP, as appropriate.
12. REVISIONS
Document any changes to this SOP using appropriate version
control methods and ensure laboratory staff are trained on new
procedures.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate and consistent analysis of nicotine and its metabolites in
randomly collected urine specimens.
