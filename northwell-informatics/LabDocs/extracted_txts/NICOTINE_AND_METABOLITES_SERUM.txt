Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Nicotine and Metabolites, Serum
1. Purpose: To provide standardized procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for nicotine and its metabolites in
serum samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
2. Scope: This procedure applies to the quantitative determination
of nicotine and its metabolites (cotinine and trans-3'-
hydroxycotinine) in human serum samples in the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities:
• Designated Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for
performing the analysis, including sample preparation, instrument
operation, and data analysis.
• Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol, reviewing results, performing technical validation, and
addressing any discrepancies or issues identified during the
analytical process.
1. Definitions:
• LC-MS/MS: Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tubes: Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL of serum
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at -20°C until analysis.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• LC-MS/MS system
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine standards
• Internal standards (e.g., nicotine-D4, cotinine-D3)
• Methanol, acetonitrile, formic acid, water (HPLC grade)
• Sample preparation supplies (pipettes, centrifuge tubes, etc.)
1. Quality Control:
• QC Material: Biorad Liquichek Level 1 and Level 2
• Preparation: Thaw and mix QC samples thoroughly. Ensure they
are within their expiration dates.
• Run QC: Analyze QC samples at the beginning and end of each
analytical run and after every 20 patient samples.
• Acceptance Criteria: Ensure QC results fall within the
established control limits.
1. Stock Solutions and Calibration Standards:
• Stock Solutions: Prepare nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'-
hydroxycotinine stock solutions at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in
methanol.
• Calibration Standards: Prepare calibration standards at
concentrations ranging from 1 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL by serial
dilution of stock solutions in drug-free serum.
• Internal Standards: Prepare internal standards in methanol at
appropriate concentrations.
1. Procedure: A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex samples thoroughly.
3. Pipette 200 µL serum sample into a clean centrifuge tube.
4. Add 20 µL of internal standard solution.
5. Add 0.5 mL of methanol and vortex-mix for 30 seconds.
6. Centrifuge the mixture at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to an HPLC vial for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Create a sequence table including calibration standards,
QC samples, and patient samples.
3. Inject 20 µL of each prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS.
4. Monitor transitions for nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'-
hydroxycotinine.
5. Set appropriate retention times and mass transitions for
each compound.
2. Data Processing:
• Peak Identification: Identify nicotine and its metabolites based
on retention time and mass transitions.
• Quantitation: Use calibration curves generated from calibration
standards to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'-
hydroxycotinine concentrations in serum samples.
• Quality Control: Ensure QC samples fall within acceptable limits.
Re-run if QC fails.
1. Reporting Results:
• Result Review: Supervisor to review and validate results for
accuracy and consistency.
• Critical Results: Any nicotine level > 50 ng/mL should be
reviewed and flagged for possible nicotine toxicity.
• Result Documentation: Document results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and verify before release.
• Interference Notes: Report any sample anomalies (e.g.,
hemolysis, lipemia) and include comments in the LIS.
