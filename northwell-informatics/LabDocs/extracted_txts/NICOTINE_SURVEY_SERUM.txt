Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Nicotine Survey, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analysis of
nicotine levels in serum samples. This ensures accuracy, precision,
and reliability of the test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained laboratory staff members are responsible for
carrying out the procedural steps of nicotine analysis. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring the adherence to SOPs and correcting
any deviations from the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Specimen Collection and Stability:
• Preferred specimen: 4 mL serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Alternate specimen: 4 mL serum collected in a red-top tube
without anticoagulant.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed serum, specimens with
insufficient volume, and specimens not properly labeled with
collection date and time.
• Storage requirements: Serum should be separated from the clot
within 2 hours post-collection. Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or
colder.
3.2. Handling and Transportation:
• Transport the serum samples at 2-8°C using ice packs. Avoid
freezing and thawing cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
4.1. Equipment:
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• -20°C Freezer
4.2. Reagents and Supplies:
• Nicotine standard solutions
• Internal standard solutions (e.g., D3-Nicotine)
• HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Mobile phase additives (e.g., formic acid)
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes
• Sample preparation kits (e.g., protein precipitation reagents)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1. Controls:
• Utilize nicotine control samples (low, medium, high) for each
batch of analyses.
• Quality control samples must be included in each run to ensure
the accuracy and precision of the assay.
5.2. Calibration:
• Prepare and run a calibration curve for nicotine analysis with at
least six calibrators across the expected concentration range.
• Include an internal standard to correct for any variability in sample
preparation and instrumentation.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature (if
applicable).
2. Vortex the samples to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
4. Aliquot 200 µL serum into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
5. Add 20 µL internal standard to each aliquot and vortex briefly.
6. Add 400 µL of protein precipitation reagent (e.g., acetonitrile) to
precipitate proteins.
7. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
8. Centrifuge the mixture at 15,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
9. Carefully transfer the supernatant to clean microcentrifuge
tubes for analysis.
6.2. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Equilibrate the column with mobile phase.
3. Inject a calibration curve set, quality controls, and prepared
serum samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
4. Check system suitability criteria and ensure the instrument is
properly calibrated.
5. Run the samples through the LC-MS/MS system as per the
validated method parameters.
6.3. Data Analysis and Result Reporting:
1. Analyze the data using the LC-MS/MS software.
2. Ensure that the calibration curve meets the acceptance criteria
(e.g., R^2 > 0.99).
3. Quantify nicotine levels in the serum samples based on the
calibration curve.
4. Review the quality control results to ensure that they are within
acceptable limits.
5. Review chromatograms for any potential interferences or
abnormalities.
6. Report nicotine levels in appropriate units (e.g., ng/mL).
7. LIMITATIONS
7.1. Interferences:
• Ensure that other substances present in serum do not interfere
with nicotine detection.
• Assess potential cross-reactivity and matrix effects.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). Flag
any values outside the reference ranges per laboratory policy.
Review and verify results with designated personnel.
Reference Range: To be determined based on the specific patient
population.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the relevant manufacturer's instructions for the LC-MS/MS
system, control material data sheets, and clinical guidelines for
nicotine testing.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed on an annual basis or as required
(e.g., procedural or equipment changes).
