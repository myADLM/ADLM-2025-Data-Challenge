Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Total Nitrogen Analysis in
24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required to
analyze Total Nitrogen (N) in 24-hour urine samples accurately and
efficiently. This SOP ensures that Total Nitrogen results are
generated in a manner that is reproducible, reliable, and aligned with
CLIA regulations and best laboratory practices.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Total Nitrogen analysis according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the lab supervisor to ensure that staff are
adequately trained in the procedures, and to monitor adherence
to the protocol.
• Quality control personnel are responsible for validating the
analytical instrumentation and reagents used in the procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Total Nitrogen analysis involves the quantification of nitrogen
compounds in a 24-hour urine collection. Nitrogen is an essential
element that serves as a key indicator of metabolic function and
nutritional status.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
Specimen Collection:
• The patient should collect all urine produced over a 24-hour
period in a clean, appropriately labeled 3-liter container.
• The collection starts with emptying the bladder in the morning
(discard this initial void). All subsequent urine is collected until the
same time the next morning.
• The container should be kept refrigerated during the collection
period.
Specimen Transport:
• Transport the complete 24-hour urine sample to the lab promptly.
• Ensure the container is securely closed and labeled with patient
identification, date, and time collection started/finished.
Specimen Preparation:
• Mix the 24-hour urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
• An aliquot of the mixed sample should be taken for analysis.
• Aliquots should be stored at 2-8 °C if immediate analysis is not
possible.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
Equipment:
• Total Nitrogen analyzer, preferably using the Kjeldahl method or a
similar validated technique.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Analytical balance.
• Nitrogen-free glassware and containers.
Reagents:
• Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), concentrated.
• Catalyst tablets (e.g., copper, selenium).
• NaOH solution.
• Distilled deionized water.
• Calibration standard solutions with known nitrogen
concentrations.
Supplies:
• Pipettes, tubes, safety goggles, and gloves.
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the nitrogen analyzer per manufacturer
instructions using standard nitrogen solutions.
◦ Record calibration results in the lab's instrument
maintenance log.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Weigh a correctly prepared aliquot of the 24-hour urine
sample.
◦ Place the sample in a Kjeldahl digestion flask.
◦ Add sulfuric acid and catalyst tablet to the flask.
3. Digestion:
◦ Heat the flask gently until the sample digests entirely and
becomes clear.
◦ Cool the sample to room temperature.
4. Distillation:
◦ Add distilled water and NaOH solution to the digested
sample.
◦ Transfer the digested sample to the distillation apparatus.
◦ Distill the sample to separate ammonia and transfer it into a
receiving flask containing boric acid.
5. Titration:
◦ Titrate the ammonia with hydrochloric acid (HCl) until the
endpoint is reached.
◦ Calculate the nitrogen concentration using the titration
volumes.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control tests using commercially available
nitrogen standards alongside patient samples.
◦ Record QC results in the instrument log and ensure results
fall within predefined acceptable ranges.
D) Reporting Results:
• Calculate the total nitrogen concentration in the urine sample
accordingly.
• Verify calculations and double-check the results.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review by laboratory personnel.
• Send results and flag any critical values for direct communication
to the requesting physician if applicable.
E) Reference Intervals:
• Normal reference interval for Total Nitrogen in 24-hour urine: 4-18
g/24 hours (dependant on laboratory-specific validated ranges).
F) Method Limitations:
• Ensure all glassware used in the preparation and analysis is
nitrogen-free to avoid contamination.
• Refer to equipment manufacturer instructions or method insert for
limitations specific to the analytical technique utilized.
G) Quality Control:
• Regularly perform instrument maintenance and calibration
checks.
• Utilize control materials bi-weekly for in-lab meeting quality
standards.
• Validate all results through review mechanisms and troubleshoot
any inconsistencies.
References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the nitrogen analyzer and relevant
materials.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines.
• Relevant laboratory procedure manuals and calibration
certificates.
This SOP remains valid unless until revised or updated in line with
new guidelines, findings, or equipment changes.
