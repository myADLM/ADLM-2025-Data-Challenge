Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Nitrogen, Total, Feces
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the method for the analysis of total nitrogen
in feces samples. The purpose is to provide standard guidelines to
ensure reliable and accurate test results for clinical and research
applications.
Responsibility:
Designated staff is responsible for performing total nitrogen analysis
on feces samples. It is the responsibility of all staff members to
adhere to the guidelines defined in this SOP and to report any
discrepancies or issues to the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Freshly collected feces samples sent to the laboratory within 6
hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Feces samples received more than 6 hours after collection.
• Samples with no collection date/time indicated on the container or
requisition.
• Samples inappropriately labeled or contaminated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Analytical balance
• Homogenizer
• Kjeldahl digestion apparatus or block digestor
• Distillation unit
• Titration apparatus
Reagents:
• Sulfuric acid (concentrated)
• Copper catalyst tablets or mercury-free catalyst
• Sodium hydroxide solution (40%)
• Boric acid solution
• Titrant (Standardized hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide)
Supplies:
• Glassware (beakers, flasks, pipettes, burettes)
• Safety equipment (gloves, goggles, lab coat)
• Disposable sample containers
1. PROCEDURE
a. DIGESTION AND DISTILLATION
1. Weigh out 1 gram of homogenized feces sample into a Kjeldahl
digestion flask.
2. Add 15 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and one copper
catalyst tablet to the flask.
3. Place the flask on the digestion apparatus and heat until the
sample fully digests (clear or light green color), typically for 2-3
hours.
4. Allow the samples to cool to room temperature.
5. Transfer the digested sample to the distillation unit.
6. Add an equal volume (to the digestion solution) of sodium
hydroxide solution to the unit to neutralize the acid.
b. TITRATION
1. Distill the ammonia into a receiver containing a boric acid
solution.
2. Conduct the titration using standardized hydrochloric acid or
sodium hydroxide solution until the endpoint is reached (color
change indicated by the boric acid solution).
3. Record the volume of titrant used.
c. CALCULATION
Calculate the total nitrogen content using the formula:
( \text{Total Nitrogen} = \frac{\text{Volume of titrant (mL)} \times
\text{Normality of titrant} \times 14.007}{\text{Sample weight (g)}} )
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Controls:
• Run blank samples and nitrogen standards with each batch of
samples.
• Perform periodic calibration of equipment and validation of
reagents.
b. Documentation:
• Record all procedural steps, initial readings, and final results in
the appropriate lab logbook.
• Include date, time, and initials of staff who performed each step.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS), ensuring
all calculations are double-checked for accuracy. b. Review and verify
results before releasing them to ensure there are no discrepancies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
This method is subject to potential interferences from highly
contaminated or improperly preserved samples. Ensure samples are
collected and stored according to the guidelines to avoid
compromised results.

1. SAFETY AND NOTES
• Follow all standard safety guidelines, including the use of PPE
(personal protective equipment).
• Handle all chemicals with care and dispose of waste according to
proper laboratory procedures.
End of Procedure
The above protocol outlines the essential steps and measures for the
accurate analysis of total nitrogen in feces samples within a CLIA-
certified laboratory. Ensure that all staff are properly trained and
adhere strictly to this SOP to maintain the integrity and reliability of
the results.
