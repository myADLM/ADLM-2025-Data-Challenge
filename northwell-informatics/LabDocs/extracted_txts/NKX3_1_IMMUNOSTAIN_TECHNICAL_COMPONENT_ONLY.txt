STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR NKX3.1
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE: To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for
the technical component of generating results for NKX3.1
immunostain.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all qualified lab
personnel to follow this SOP for NKX3.1 immunostaining to
ensure consistent and accurate results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: a. Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
◦ Tissue sections should be of 3-4 microns thickness.
◦ Ensure the identification label on the specimen matches the
requisition form.
b. Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimens inadequately fixed or
processed. - Damaged or improperly labeled slides. - Incomplete or
missing requisition forms.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES: a. Equipment:
◦ Microtome for sectioning.
◦ Water bath at 42°C to 45°C.
◦ Slide drying oven/incubator set at 60°C.
◦ Automated or manual immunostaining equipment.
◦ Light microscope.
b. Reagents: - Primary antibody: Anti-NKX3.1. - Secondary antibody:
Biotinylated or polymer-conjugated secondary antibody. - Detection
system: HRP with DAB or comparable chromogen substrate. -
Counterstain: Hematoxylin. - Mounting medium.
c. Supplies: - Positively charged glass slides. - Cover slips. -
Forceps. - Multichannel pipettes and tips. - Absorbent disposable
tissues.
1. PROCEDURE: a. Tissue Preparation:
1. Cut 3-4 micron sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float the sections on a water bath and mount on
positively charged glass slides.
3. Dry the slides in a drying oven at 60°C for at least 60
minutes.
b. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 1. Deparaffinize the sections by
immersing slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each. 2.
Rehydrate the sections through a graded series of alcohol (100%,
95%, 70%) to distilled water.
c. Antigen Retrieval: 1. Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer,
pH 6.0, or EDTA buffer, pH 9.0, by heating the slides in a microwave
or a pressure cooker. 2. Allow the slides to cool to room temperature
and rinse in distilled water.
d. Immunostaining: 1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by
incubating the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. 2.
Apply blocking solution (e.g., serum-free protein block) to reduce
non-specific binding. 3. Incubate the slides with primary antibody
(anti-NKX3.1) in a humidified chamber as per the antibody
manufacturer's recommended dilution and incubation time. 4. Rinse
the slides in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20). 5. Apply the
appropriate secondary antibody and incubate for the time specified
by the manufacturer. 6. Rinse in TBST followed by application of the
detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated polymer) and incubate. 7.
Develop the chromogen (e.g., DAB) until the desired intensity is
achieved. 8. Counterstain the slides with hematoxylin, rinse in
running water, and blue in weak ammonia water. 9. Dehydrate the
sections through graded alcohol, clear in xylene, and mount with a
permanent mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL: a. Include positive and negative control
slides with each staining run. b. Review control slides for
appropriate staining before evaluating patient slides. c.
Document any deviations and corrective actions in the Quality
Control Log.
2. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: a. Examine the stained
slides under a light microscope. b. Ensure specific nuclear
staining for NKX3.1 is present in positive controls. c. Report any
non-specific staining or technical issues identified during
microscopy.
3. REPORTING RESULTS: a. Document findings in the laboratory
information system, ensuring proper identification of the
technical component only. b. Relay any issues or observations
to the attending pathologist for further evaluation, if necessary.
4. REFERENCES: a. Primary antibody manufacturer's insert and
protocol for anti-NKX3.1. b. Internal laboratory guidelines and
SOPs for immunohistochemistry.
5. NOTES: a. This protocol focuses solely on the technical
performance of the NKX3.1 immunostain. b. It assumes prior
laboratory processing and preparation procedures have been
adhered to correctly.
