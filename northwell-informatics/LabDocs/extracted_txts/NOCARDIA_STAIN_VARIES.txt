Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for NOCARDIA STAIN
ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase procedures
for generating results using the Nocardia Stain in a clinical laboratory.
This stain is used for the identification of Nocardia species in various
clinical specimens. The procedure is intended to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• All trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
Nocardia Stain according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff members are
properly trained in this procedure and that quality control
measures are implemented and documented.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical specimens where the presence
of Nocardia is suspected, including, but not limited to:
• Sputum
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
• Tissue biopsies
• Wound swabs
• Fluid samples
1. DEFINITIONS
Nocardia: A genus of aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria that form
branching filaments and can be partially acid-fast.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microscope
• Glass slides
• Staining rack
• Bunsen burner
• Forceps
• Immersion oil
Reagents:
• Carbol Fuchsin
• Acid-Alcohol (3% HCl in 95% Ethanol)
• Methylene Blue or Brilliant Green
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
a. Accession the specimen according to laboratory protocol. b.
Prepare a smear of the clinical specimen on a clean glass slide: i. If
using a swab, roll the swab across the slide. ii. For liquid specimens,
use a sterile pipette to place a drop onto the slide. Use a sterile
applicator stick to spread thinly. c. Allow the smear to air dry
completely.
Staining Procedure:
a. Heat-fix the smear by passing the slide quickly through the flame
of a Bunsen burner three times or by using a slide warmer. b. Place
the slide on a staining rack. c. Flood the slide with Carbol Fuchsin
stain. Allow it to sit for 5 minutes. d. Gently rinse the slide with tap
water to remove excess stain. e. Decolorize the slide by covering it
with Acid-Alcohol for 1-3 minutes or until the slide appears faintly
pink. f. Rinse the slide gently with tap water immediately after
decolorizing. g. Counterstain the slide by flooding it with Methylene
Blue or Brilliant Green for 1 minute. h. Rinse the slide gently with tap
water and let it air dry completely.
Microscopic Examination:
a. Place the slide on the microscope stage. b. Focus the smear using
the 10x objective lens and then switch to the 100x oil immersion
objective lens. c. Examine for the presence of acid-fast branching
filamentous bacteria, which should appear red against a blue or
green background.
Documentation and Reporting:
a. Document the findings in the laboratory information system (LIS)
with the technologist's initials, date, and time of analysis. b. Report
positive results as "Nocardia species detected" and negative results
as "No Nocardia species detected." c. If the slide is suboptimal,
repeat the staining procedure or prepare a new slide.
Quality Control:
a. Run a known positive and negative control slide with each batch of
specimens stained. b. Document control results in the quality control
log. c. Any deviations from expected control results must be
investigated, documented and corrective actions taken before
reporting patient results.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious and use
appropriate PPE.
• Dispose of staining reagents and biological waste according to
hazardous waste protocols.
• Avoid inhalation and direct contact with Carbol Fuchsin and Acid-
Alcohol.
