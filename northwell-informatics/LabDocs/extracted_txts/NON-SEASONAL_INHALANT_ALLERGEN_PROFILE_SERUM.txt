STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Non-
Seasonal Inhalant Allergen Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed procedures for the analytical phase of testing for
non-seasonal inhalant allergen profiles using patient serum samples.
This SOP ensures accurate, consistent, and reproducible results
essential for patient diagnosis and treatment.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform laboratory tests related to the non-seasonal
inhalant allergen profile on serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to comply with this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff receive
appropriate training and that the procedures are followed accurately.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Serum samples
• Allergen-specific IgE reagents and controls
• Laboratory automation equipment (ImmunoCAP Analyzer or
equivalent)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Pre-Analysis Preparation
5.1.1. Ensure that all reagents and controls are within the expiration
date and have been stored properly according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 5.1.2. Verify that the ImmunoCAP Analyzer is calibrated
and maintenance checks have been completed. 5.1.3. Confirm that
serum samples have been received and appropriately accessioned
according to the laboratory's guidelines. 5.1.4. Allow refrigerated
serum samples to come to room temperature before analysis.
5.2. Sample Preparation
5.2.1. Ensure all samples are properly labeled with the patient’s
identification and accession number. 5.2.2. Visually inspect serum
samples for hemolysis, lipemia, or other contaminants. Record and
notify the supervisor if any issues are identified. 5.2.3. Vortex the
serum sample gently to ensure homogeneity. 5.2.4. If required,
aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled secondary containers.
5.3. Assay Procedure
5.3.1. Load the allergen-specific IgE reagents, serum samples,
controls, and other consumables onto the ImmunoCAP Analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5.3.2. Input the
necessary information into the Analyzer, including sample IDs, test
codes, and specific allergens to be tested (e.g., dust mites, animal
dander, molds). 5.3.3. Run the assay following the step-by-step
protocol provided by the manufacturer. 5.3.4. Monitor the assay
progress on the ImmunoCAP Analyzer and ensure that there are no
errors or irregularities during the run.
5.4. Quality Control
5.4.1. Include both positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests performed. 5.4.2. Record quality control data, including lot
numbers and expiration dates of reagents and controls. 5.4.3.
Validate the results of the controls before proceeding with sample
analysis. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer's guidelines and do not release patient results until the
issue is resolved.
5.5. Data Analysis and Result Interpretation
5.5.1. Review the software-generated results for each serum sample.
5.5.2. Assess for any flags or alert messages produced by the
Analyzer, which may indicate potential issues. 5.5.3. Refer to the
reference ranges provided by the manufacturer for interpreting
allergen-specific IgE levels.
5.6. Reporting Results
5.6.1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for further review. 5.6.2. Verify and validate
the results in the LIS ensuring there are no discrepancies. 5.6.3.
Release the results to the ordering physician or clinician for patient
review.
5.7. Post-Analysis
5.7.1. Properly dispose of all used consumables and biohazard waste
according to laboratory safety policies. 5.7.2. Perform any required
maintenance on the ImmunoCAP Analyzer. 5.7.3. Document the
completion of the assay run, including any deviations from protocol
and corrective actions taken.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Ensure all Quality Control measures are strictly followed. Conduct
routine proficiency testing and record all maintenance and calibration
activities. Maintain a log of any incidents and their resolutions.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
For troubleshooting any issues encountered during the assay
procedure, refer to the ImmunoCAP Analyzer user manual and
manufacturer’s guidelines. Contact technical support if necessary.
Document all troubleshooting steps and resolutions.
