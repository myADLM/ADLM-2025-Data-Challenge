Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Non-Specific
Esterase-Alpha Naphthyl Butyrate (NBE) Stain
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required to
perform the Non-Specific Esterase-Alpha Naphthyl Butyrate staining
method. This procedure is utilized to differentiate monocytes from
other leukocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow smears by their
esterase enzyme activity.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the NBE
staining procedure according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and competent in this
procedure and for addressing any issues or errors that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood smear: Freshly prepared peripheral blood
smears, properly labeled with the patient's identification
information.
• Bone marrow smear: Freshly prepared bone marrow smears,
properly labeled with the patient's identification information.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Alpha-Naphthyl Butyrate solution
• Diazo Solution
• Acetate Buffer (pH 6.0)
• Sodium Nitrite Solution
• Hematoxylin Stain
• Xylene
• Coverslips
• Mounting Medium
• Staining jars and coplin jars
• Laboratory Timer
• Gloves and Other Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Light Microscope
• Centrifuge (if cytocentrifuged samples are used)
• Fume Hood (for handling xylene and other volatile chemicals)
• Slide Warmer (optional)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents:
1. Alpha-Naphthyl Butyrate Solution:
◦ Prepare according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Diazo Solution:
◦ Prepare a working diazo solution by mixing: a) Filtered
Sodium Nitrite Solution (0.1% w/v in distilled water) b)
Alpha-Naphthyl Butyrate solution
◦ Prepare fresh as needed.
3. Buffer:
◦ Prepare Acetate Buffer at pH 6.0 according to the following:
a) Mix acetic acid and sodium acetate to adjust pH.
4. Counterstain (Hematoxylin):
◦ Prepare as per manufacturer's instructions.
Staining Procedure:
1. Fixation:
◦ Fix the smears in freshly prepared cold acetone for 30
seconds and air dry.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the fixed smears in the Alpha-Naphthyl Butyrate
solution for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse:
◦ Rinse the slides briefly in distilled water to remove excess
stain.
4. Counterstain:
◦ Counterstain the slides by immersing them in the
hematoxylin solution for 1-2 minutes.
5. Rinse and Dry:
◦ Rinse the counterstained slides in running tap water until
water runs clear.
◦ Air dry or use a slide warmer.
6. Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols, clear in xylene, and
mount coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
7. Viewing and Interpretation:
◦ Examine the slides under a light microscope.
◦ Monocytes will stain positive, showing dark brown to black
granules in the cytoplasm, while other leukocytes will
generally show negative or pale staining.
Quality Control:
• Include known positive and negative control slides with each
staining batch.
• Record control results and ensure they fall within expected
ranges. Troubleshoot if controls are out of range.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results manually or report results directly into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) following appropriate
guidelines.
• Ensure slides are labeled and stored appropriately for future
reference or review.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions
taken.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Monocytes: Positive NBE staining, dark brown to black granules.
• Other leukocytes: Negative or pale staining.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are adequately fixed to avoid false-negative
results.
• Fresh reagents must be used to avoid degradation which could
affect staining quality.
• High levels of background staining may obscure results; ensure
thorough rinsing and appropriate drying techniques.
