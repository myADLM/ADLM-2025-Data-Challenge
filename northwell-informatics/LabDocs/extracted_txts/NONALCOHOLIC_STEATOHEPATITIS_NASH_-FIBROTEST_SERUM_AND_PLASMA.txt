Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS
(NASH)-FIBROTEST, SERUM AND PLASMA
1. Purpose:
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)-FibroTest
using serum and plasma specimens. The aim is to ensure accurate,
precise, and repeatable results while maintaining high standards of
quality and safety.
2. Scope:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in conducting
NASH-FibroTest assays on serum and plasma specimens.
3. Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technicians are responsible for performing
the test according to the procedures detailed in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, reviewing
results, and ensuring compliance with the SOP.
4. Specimen Requirements:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Serum: 5 mL collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Plasma: 5 mL collected in an EDTA or heparinized plasma tube.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection if stored at 2-8°C, or more than 6 hours if stored at
room temperature.
• Specimens with no patient identification or collection date/time on
the label.
5. Equipment and Reagents:
• NASH-FibroTest assay kit (lot-specific details and expiry date
must be recorded).
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Calibrated microplate reader compatible with the assay.
• Deionized water.
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high controls).
• Calibrators provided with the assay kit.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and lab
coats.
6. Quality Control:
Materials:
• Control materials specific to the NASH-FibroTest assay should be
used at the beginning of each analytical run, and after any
significant procedural changes.
Storage and Stability:
• Store quality control materials as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
Follow the stability instructions on the product insert.
Procedure:
• Run low, medium, and high controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range specified
by the manufacturer. Document any deviations and take
corrective actions before proceeding with patient samples.
7. Procedure:
A. Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room temperature
before starting the assay.
• Vortex samples gently to mix. Centrifuge serum/plasma
specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove any particulates.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the working solutions of reagents as specified in the
NASH-FibroTest assay kit instructions.
2. Sample and Standard Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for calibrators, controls, and patient samples
on the microplate. Typically, use duplicate wells for each
standard/control/sample.
3. Addition of Samples and Reagents:
◦ Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient serum/plasma into the designated wells.
◦ Add the specific reagents to each well according to the kit
protocol (e.g., enzyme conjugates, detection antibodies).
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and
duration as recommended by the assay kit protocol.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells as instructed in the kit protocol to remove
unbound substances.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Allow the
colorimetric reaction to proceed in the dark for the time
specified by the assay kit.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using a calibrated microplate reader.
C. Calculations and Result Interpretation:
1. Generate Calibration Curve:
◦ Use the absorbance values of the calibrators to generate a
standard curve.
◦ Apply the standard curve to determine the concentration of
analytes in the patient samples and controls.
2. Result Validation:
◦ Validate the results by ensuring that control values are
within the acceptable range.
◦ Flag and troubleshoot any outlier results or quality control
failures.
8. Reporting Results:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Reports should include patient identification, specimen type,
collection date/time, test results, and reference ranges.
• Critical values that may suggest acute liver conditions should be
communicated immediately to the relevant healthcare provider as
per the critical values policy.
9. Method Limitations:
• Refer to the NASH-FibroTest kit insert for specific limitations
related to interferences, sample quality, and assay-specific
factors.
• Significant hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect results.
