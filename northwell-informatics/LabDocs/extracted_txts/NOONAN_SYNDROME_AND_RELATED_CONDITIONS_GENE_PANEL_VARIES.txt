NOONAN SYNDROME AND RELATED CONDITIONS
GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase involved in testing and generating results for the
Noonan Syndrome and related conditions gene panel. This includes
the preparation of the sample, nucleic acid extraction, library
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and interpretation of results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
genetic testing and analysis for the Noonan Syndrome gene panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technician: Responsible for sample preparation,
nucleic acid extraction, library preparation, and initial sequencing
setup.
• Molecular Biologist/Geneticist: In charge of overseeing the
sequencing process, data analysis, and interpretation of results.
• Quality Control Officer: Ensures all procedures comply with
regulatory standards, verifies all quality control measures, and
assesses the integrity of the results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes
(minimum of 3 mL) or saliva sample collected in an Oragene
saliva collection kit.
• Specimen Stability: Blood samples should be processed within
72 hours of collection. Saliva samples can be stored at room
temperature until processing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• Library preparation kits (e.g., Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep)
• Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq)
• Thermal cycler
• Pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Buffers and reagents as specified in the kit protocols
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Preparation:
◦ Label all tubes and reagents appropriately.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for processing the
blood or saliva samples using the DNA extraction kit.
2. Extraction:
◦ Ensure that the extracted DNA is of high purity and
concentration using a Nanodrop or similar
spectrophotometer. Acceptable concentration is >20 ng/µL
and purity (A260/280 ratio) should be 1.8-2.0.
B) Library Preparation
1. Preparation:
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA, and normalize the
concentrations of all samples.
2. Library Preparation:
◦ Follow the instructions provided in the library preparation kit
to construct the DNA library. This involves enzymatic
fragmentation, adapter ligation, and amplification.
◦ Validate the library size and concentration using a
Bioanalyzer or TapeStation system.
C) Sequencing
1. Preparation:
◦ Load the prepared DNA library onto the sequencing platform
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls to monitor
run performance.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Initiate the sequencing run and monitor for any deviations or
alerts from the predefined parameters.
◦ Sequencing control metrics should fall within acceptable
ranges outlined by the platform manufacturer.
D) Data Analysis
1. Data Processing:
◦ Base calling and demultiplexing should be performed using
the sequencing platform’s software.
◦ Align reads to the human reference genome (hg19 or hg38)
using a bioinformatics pipeline (e.g., BWA, GATK).
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Identify variants (single nucleotide variants, insertions,
deletions) using variant calling software (e.g., FreeBayes,
GATK).
◦ Annotate the variants using databases such as dbSNP,
ClinVar, and HGMD.
E) Result Interpretation
1. Interpretation:
◦ Evaluate identified variants in the context of Noonan
Syndrome and related conditions.
◦ Assign clinical significance based on ACMG guidelines and
available literature.
2. Reporting:
◦ Verify and document results.
◦ Generate a detailed report including the patient's identifying
information, sample details, methods used, and an
interpretation of significant variants.
F) Quality Control and Validation
1. Quality Control:
◦ Include and review internal and external quality controls in
each run.
◦ Perform periodic proficiency testing to assure accuracy and
reliability of results.
2. Validation:
◦ Validate new batches of reagents and kits according to
laboratory validation procedures.
◦ Ensure continuous training and competency assessment of
all laboratory personnel.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be reviewed by a senior molecular biologist or
geneticist.
• Reports will be generated and sent to the ordering physician or
genetic counselor, ensuring patient confidentiality is maintained.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Variants will be annotated with their potential clinical significance
(e.g., pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain
significance, likely benign, benign).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The sensitivity and specificity of the assay depend on the quality
and integrity of the extracted DNA.
• Certain regions of the genome with high GC content or repetitive
sequences may be difficult to sequence accurately.
