Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
NOROVIRUS PCR, MOLECULAR DETECTION, FECES
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized protocol for the detection of
Norovirus in fecal specimens using PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction) molecular techniques.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to the molecular diagnostic
laboratory performing Norovirus PCR testing on fecal samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to ensure the accurate and reliable execution of this
protocol. Personnel must follow all steps as outlined and report any
deviations or issues to their supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING:
4.1 ACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN:
• Fresh fecal sample collected in a sterile container.
4.2 UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN:
• Specimens that are:
◦ Leaking or improperly sealed.
◦ Contaminated with urine or other substances.
◦ Collected more than 48 hours previously without proper
refrigeration.
4.3 SPECIMEN STORAGE:
• Store the collected sample at 2-8°C if testing will be delayed by
more than 2 hours but less than 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze the specimen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Norovirus PCR Kit
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• PCR tubes or plates
• Thermal cycler
• Nucleic acid purification system
• Gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1 DNA EXTRACTION:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Homogenize the fecal sample thoroughly.
◦ Transfer a defined aliquot (e.g., 0.1-0.2g) to a lysis buffer as
outlined in the DNA Extraction Kit instructions.
2. Lysis and Binding:
◦ Incubate the sample with lysis buffer at the recommended
temperature (typically room temperature or 56°C for 10-30
minutes).
◦ Add ethanol and continue as per the manufacturer's
instruction for binding nucleic acids to the provided column
or beads.
3. Washing:
◦ Follow the DNA Extraction Kit protocols for washing away
impurities.
4. Elution:
◦ Elute the purified DNA in an appropriate volume of elution
buffer.
6.2 PCR AMPLIFICATION:
1. PCR Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the Norovirus
PCR Kit instructions. Include:
▪ Norovirus primers and probes.
▪ DNA polymerase.
▪ dNTPs.
▪ Buffer.
◦ Pipette the required volume of Master Mix into each PCR
tube or plate well.
2. Template DNA Addition:
◦ Add an aliquot of the extracted DNA to each tube or well
containing the Master Mix.
3. Negative and Positive Controls:
◦ Include a negative control (nuclease-free water) and a
positive control (Norovirus target DNA) in each PCR run to
validate the results.
4. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the conditions specified in
the Norovirus PCR Kit instruction manual. Typical conditions
include:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes.
▪ Amplification: 45 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds.
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute.
◦ Ensure proper ramp rates and temperature hold times.
6.3 DETECTION AND ANALYSIS:
1. PCR Product Analysis:
◦ Analyze the amplified PCR products using real-time PCR
detection systems.
◦ The presence of Norovirus RNA will be indicated by the
amplification curve crossing the threshold line within the
defined cycle number.
2. Interpreting Results:
◦ Positive Result: Cycle threshold (Ct) value falling within the
defined range for a positive sample.
◦ Negative Result: Absence of amplification curve crossing
the threshold or Ct value exceeding the negative control’s
cutoff.
◦ Invalid Result: No amplification in the positive control or
amplification in the negative control indicates an invalid test
run requiring repetition.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run negative and positive controls with each batch of specimens.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of the thermal cycler
and real-time PCR detection systems.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Notify the appropriate medical personnel of the results promptly,
particularly in case of positive detections.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Potential for false positives or negatives due to contamination,
improper specimen handling, or inhibitors present in the sample.
• Presence of mutations in the viral genome that may affect primer/
probe binding and thus detection.
