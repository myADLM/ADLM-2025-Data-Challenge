NOROVIRUS RNA DETECTION BY PCR
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the
procedures for the detection of Norovirus RNA by PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction) in patient specimens. The
procedures must ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results in
compliance with laboratory standards and regulations.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedures as outlined in this protocol, including
specimen preparation, RNA extraction, PCR amplification, and result
analysis. The laboratory supervisor must ensure adherence to the
protocol and address any discrepancies or issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Acceptable Specimens:
• Stool samples: Freshly collected stool should be transferred to a
sterile, leak-proof container.
• Vomitus samples: Freshly collected vomitus should be transferred
to a sterile, leak-proof container.
• Rectal swabs: Collected using a sterile swab and placed in a
transport medium.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected or stored according to laboratory
guidelines.
• Specimens leaking or cross-contaminated during transport.
Specimen Storage:
• Fresh specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 72
hours.
• If testing is delayed, specimens should be frozen at -70°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• RNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents including master mix, primers, and probes specific
for Norovirus
• PCR thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge, vortex mixer, and pipettes
• Sterile, nuclease-free water and buffers
• DNA-free workstations and equipment for RNA handling
1. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Preparation:
2. Homogenize stool or vomitus samples in PBS (phosphate-
buffered saline) to ensure even consistency.
3. For rectal swabs, vortex the swab in the transport medium for
10-15 seconds to release the specimens.
4. Transfer 500 µL of the prepared specimen into a 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
B. RNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the RNA extraction
kit.
2. Ensure that all reagents are brought to room temperature
before use.
3. Perform RNA extraction in a DNA/RNA-free environment to
prevent contamination.
4. Elute the RNA in 50 µL of elution buffer provided by the kit.
5. Store RNA at -70°C if not used immediately.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Set up the PCR reaction in a DNA/RNA-free environment.
2. Thaw PCR reagents and samples on ice and keep cold
throughout the procedure.
3. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the following
components for each reaction:
◦ 10 µL of 2X PCR master mix
◦ 1 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of probe (10 µM) specific for Norovirus
◦ 5 µL of nuclease-free water
◦ 2 µL of extracted RNA sample (total 20 µL per reaction)
4. Include positive and negative controls in each run: Positive
control (known Norovirus RNA) and negative control (nuclease-
free water).
5. Seal the PCR tubes or plate and place them into the thermal
cycler.
6. Run the PCR program according to the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 45 cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
D. Result Analysis:
1. After amplification, review the PCR results using the thermal
cycler software.
2. Evaluate the amplification plots of the samples and controls:
◦ Positive control must demonstrate an expected amplification
curve.
◦ Negative control must show no amplification.
◦ Patient samples are positive if the amplification curve
crosses the threshold line (Ct value < 40 cycles).
3. Verify and document all results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
4. Report any positive results to the requesting physician and
document the result in the patient's medical record.
5. Negative results are released after verification by the
technologist.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Run positive and negative controls with every batch of tests to
ensure assay validity.
8. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for kit quality control
procedures.
9. Document any deviations, issues, or corrective actions taken in
the quality control log.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive for Norovirus RNA: Detected (Ct value <40 cycles)
• Negative for Norovirus RNA: Not Detected (No amplification)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The analytical sensitivity of the assay is dependent on the quality
of RNA extraction and the amplification efficiency.
• False negatives may occur if the RNA concentration is below the
detection limit or if there is RNA degradation.
• Proper specimen handling, storage, and processing are crucial for
reliable results.
