Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Northeast Regional Allergen Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, precise, and timely testing of the Northeast
Regional Allergen Profile in serum samples. This SOP will guide
laboratory personnel through the analytical phase, from receipt of
serum samples to generation of final test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing allergen
testing in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure quality and reliability of test results. The laboratory supervisor
is responsible for monitoring adherence to this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
Northeast Regional Allergen Profile: A panel of tests designed to
detect specific IgE antibodies to common allergens prevalent in the
Northeast region of the United States.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP System)
• Calibration and quality control materials specific to the allergen
profile
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum sample tubes
• Allergen reagent kits
• Control serums (positive and negative)
• Laboratory timer
• Logbooks and laboratory information system (LIS)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum
• Stability: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if tests are performed
within 48 hours; for longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or microbially
contaminated specimens
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation
1. Verify the identity of the sample with the test requisition.
2. Inspect the sample for acceptability; ensure that it is not
hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
3. Allow the serum specimens to reach room temperature if
previously refrigerated or frozen.
7.2. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform instrument calibration per manufacturer’s guidelines
using the appropriate calibrators.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples (positive and negative
controls) before testing patient samples.
3. Document QC results in the logbook or LIS. Ensure that QC
results meet the predefined acceptance criteria.
7.3. Testing Procedure
1. Load the serum samples and allergen reagent kits on the
immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Initiate the test run. Monitor the assay to ensure it processes
without error.
3. Upon completion, review the raw data for each allergen test
component.
7.4. Analysis and Interpretation
1. Compare patient test results with reference ranges provided by
the manufacturer’s product insert.
2. Evaluate any unexpected or atypical results using additional
controls and repeated testing if necessary.
7.5. Documentation
1. Document all results, QC outcomes, and any deviations from
the standard process in the LIS.
2. Enter detailed observations if deviating from typical results and
log corrective measures taken.
8. POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
1. Review and validate the test results in combination with QC
outcomes.
2. For critical or unexpected results, initiate appropriate
confirmation and notification protocols.
3. Release results to the relevant medical personnel via the LIS
and other authorized reporting channels.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Regularly perform routine maintenance and calibration as per
the manufacturer’s protocols.
2. Analyze trends in QC performance and troubleshoot with
recalibration or equipment servicing if issues persist.
3. Follow proper corrective action protocols for inconsistent or
erroneous results.
