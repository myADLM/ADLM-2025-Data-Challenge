Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analysis of Nortriptyline in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Nortriptyline in serum specimens. The
measurement of Nortriptyline levels is critical for therapeutic drug
monitoring and for ensuring patient safety.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting
the assay as per this SOP, ensuring quality control, and reporting
accurate results. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify and
report any deficiencies in the procedure that may affect test results to
the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Nortriptyline: A tricyclic antidepressant used in the treatment of major
depressive disorder and certain other conditions. Monitoring serum
levels of Nortriptyline is necessary to ensure effective and safe
dosing.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Collection Container: Serum
separator tube (SST, gold top) or plain red-top tube. Collection
Volume: Minimum required volume is 1.0 mL of serum. Stability:
Serum samples are stable for 7 days at refrigerated temperatures
(2-8°C), and for 3 months when frozen (-20°C). Unacceptable
Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens. Preparation:
Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuge to separate
serum.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or equivalent
analytical instrument. Certified reference standards for Nortriptyline.
Calibrators and high-quality control materials specific for Nortriptyline.
Appropriate HPLC columns. Mobile phase solvents and reagents.
Procedure:
Calibration and Quality Control: Prepare calibration standards using
certified reference materials. Prepare quality control samples (Low,
Medium, High) according to the established guidelines. Run
calibration standards and QC samples at the beginning of each
analytical batch.
Sample Analysis:
1. Confirm the identification and integrity of the serum specimens,
checking for proper labeling and suitable anticoagulant.
2. Load the serum samples onto the HPLC system according to
the instrument's operating manual.
3. Set the instrument parameters based on validated and
standardized settings (e.g., column temperature, flow rate,
injection volume).
4. Activate the analysis sequence, ensuring proper operation of
the instrument and monitoring real-time data.
Data Acquisition and Processing:
1. Record the chromatograms and peak areas for Nortriptyline
and internal standards.
2. Calculate the Nortriptyline concentration in serum using
established calibration curves.
3. Ensure all results fall within the acceptable range of calibration
standards and QC materials.
4. Verify and cross-check calculated concentrations for quality
assurance before reporting.
Reporting Results: Results must be reviewed and verified by the
technologist based on established criteria. Ensure proper
documentation of all analysis data. Transmit verified results to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for patient records.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Therapeutic Range for Nortriptyline:
• Optimal therapeutic range: 50-150 ng/mL
• Toxic levels: >500 ng/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material: Certified reference standards for Nortriptyline. Internal and
external quality control materials. Storage: Store reagents,
calibrators, and controls at recommended storage conditions,
typically 2-8°C. Ensure all materials are within their expiry date.
Procedure: Run quality controls with each batch of samples and
document results. Apply quality control procedures for each new lot
of reagents and calibrators. Follow corrective actions in case of
quality control failure, including re-running controls or repeating
sample analysis.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Hemolysis, lipemia, and icteric specimens can interfere with the
accurate measurement of Nortriptyline. Incorrect calibration and QC
procedures can lead to inaccurate results. Ensure all equipment is
regularly maintained and calibrated.

1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
In the event of inconclusive or unexpected results, notify the
supervisor immediately. Ensure proper disposal of all biohazardous
materials according to laboratory safety guidelines.
