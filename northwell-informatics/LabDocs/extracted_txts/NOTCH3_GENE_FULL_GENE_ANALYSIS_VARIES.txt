Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for NOTCH3
Gene, Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of the NOTCH3
gene, ensuring reliable and accurate test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained molecular biology technologist to
perform the NOTCH3 gene analysis. All actions must be thoroughly
documented, and any deviations from this protocol must be reported
to the supervising geneticist.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) reagents and consumables
• Thermal cycler
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• DNA sequencing platform (e.g., Sanger Sequencer or Next-
Generation Sequencer)
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for data entry and result
reporting
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Nitrile gloves
• Ethanol and other cleaning agents
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative controls (known NOTCH3 gene sequence)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 DNA Extraction
1. Use the DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic DNA from the
patient's specimen with special attention to avoiding cross-
contamination.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer (A260/A280 ratio should be
between 1.8-2.0).
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
4.2 PCR Amplification
1. Design specific primers to amplify exons and flanking intronic
regions of the NOTCH3 gene.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, adjusting volume for the total number of reactions
including controls.
3. Add the patient DNA to the PCR tubes containing the master
mix.
4. Run the PCR on the thermal cycler using the appropriate
cycling conditions.
4.3 Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare and cast an agarose gel with an appropriate
concentration (typically 1-2%).
2. Load a 5 µL aliquot of PCR product and a DNA ladder into the
wells of the gel.
3. Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
4. Visualize the PCR products under UV light and document the
results using a gel imaging system.
4.4 DNA Sequencing
1. Purify the PCR products using cleanup kits or enzymatic
methods.
2. Quantify the purified PCR products.
3. Set up sequencing reactions using the purified PCR products,
sequencing primers, and sequencing reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Load the sequencing reactions onto the sequencing platform
and run the sequencing protocol.
5. Analyze the sequencing data using bioinformatics software.
4.5 Data Analysis & Interpretation
1. Analyze the raw sequence data to identify variants/mutations in
the NOTCH3 gene using appropriate software tools.
2. Compare the patient's sequence to the reference sequence to
identify any deviations.
3. Annotate the identified variants with respect to their
pathogenicity, referring to established databases (e.g., ClinVar,
HGMD).
4.6 Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls for each set of reactions
to ensure the validity of results.
2. Check the integrity of the sequencing data by verifying the
sequence quality scores and examining aligning peaks.
3. Any failed runs should be repeated to confirm results or identify
potential technical issues.
4.7 Reporting Results
1. Interpret the results in the context of the patient's clinical
information.
2. Generate a comprehensive report that includes identified
variants, their predicted pathogenicity, and possible implications
for the patient.
3. Review the report with a supervising geneticist before releasing
the results.
4. Enter the final validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
5. REFERENCE RANGES
Reference ranges and mutations of clinical significance are based on
established guidelines and literature specific to the NOTCH3 gene.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Potential limitations include DNA quality/quantity issues, PCR
inefficiencies, sequencing errors, and limitations of bioinformatics
tools used in data analysis.
