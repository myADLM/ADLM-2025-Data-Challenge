Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Novel
Psychoactives in Umbilical Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for detecting and
quantifying novel psychoactive substances (NPS) in umbilical cord
tissue. These procedures ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
carrying out these procedures and interpreting results. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol, overseeing
quality control measures, and addressing any analytical issues.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Minimum 2 grams of fresh, uncontaminated umbilical cord tissue,
collected at birth.
Specimen Handling:
• Store specimens at -20°C immediately after collection.
• Transport to the laboratory on dry ice.
• Thaw specimens at room temperature prior to analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Automated homogenizer
• Analytical balance
• Freezer (-20°C and -80°C)
Reagents:
• Certified reference standards for target NPS
• Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Deionized water
• Internal standard solutions
• Buffer solutions (e.g., phosphate buffer)
Supplies:
• Homogenization tubes
• Centrifuge tubes
• Sample containers
• Protective gloves and lab coats
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control
Samples:
• Prepare calibration standards by diluting certified reference
standards in appropriate solvents.
• Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the calibration range.
4.2 Homogenization of Umbilical Cord Tissue:
• Weigh 1 gram of umbilical cord tissue and place into a
homogenization tube.
• Add 3 mL of phosphate buffer and homogenize until a uniform
mixture is obtained.
4.3 Extraction of NPS from Tissue Samples:
• Add 2 mL of methanol to the homogenized tissue to precipitate
proteins.
• Vortex thoroughly for 5 minutes.
• Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube.
4.4 Sample Cleanup:
• Add 2 mL of acetonitrile to the supernatant.
• Vortex and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
• Transfer the clear supernatant to a new container, avoiding the
pellet.
4.5 LC-MS/MS Analysis:
• Inject 10 µL of the cleaned extract into the LC-MS/MS.
• Utilize a gradient elution program with appropriate mobile phases
(e.g., water with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.1%
formic acid).
• Detect and quantify target NPS using multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) mode with appropriate transitions.
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibrate the LC-MS/MS at the beginning of each analytical run
using calibration standards.
• Analyze QC samples at the beginning and end of each batch to
ensure the system is performing correctly.
• The results of QC samples should be within ±20% of their nominal
values.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Review chromatograms and ensure all peaks are correctly
integrated.
• Compare sample results to calibration standards to quantify NPS
levels.
• Report results in ng/g of tissue.
• Document and review any anomalies or deviations.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Interferences from endogenous substances may affect the
accuracy of NPS quantification. Employ appropriate internal
standards to correct for matrix effects.
• In the case of instrument malfunction, follow manufacturer
troubleshooting guidelines and consult the supervisor if
necessary.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Maintain a log of all instruments and reagents used, including
calibration records.
• Periodically review procedures and results to ensure adherence
to this SOP.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to validate
analytical performance.
9. SAFETY
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Handle all solvents and chemicals in a fume hood.
• Dispose of waste materials following laboratory biosafety and
chemical waste disposal procedures.
