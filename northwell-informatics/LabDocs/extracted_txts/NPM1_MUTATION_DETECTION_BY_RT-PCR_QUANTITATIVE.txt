Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to detail the process
for conducting and reporting results for NPM1 Mutation
Detection by RT-PCR, Quantitative, ensuring accuracy and
reproducibility of the assay.
RESPONSIBILITY: All designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing steps in the protocol, ensuring all
equipment and reagents are in working condition prior to
commencing the test, documenting results, and adhering to all quality
control measures. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
compliance with the SOP and address any issues that arise during
the assay process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type: EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood or bone marrow
aspirate.
Specimen Handling:
• Collect 3-5 mL of whole blood in sterile EDTA tubes.
• Properly label each specimen with the patient’s identification
information, collection date and time.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C until processing. Specimens should be
processed within 24 hours of collection to ensure RNA integrity.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes.
• Specimens not properly labeled or with missing information.
• Specimens that have been clotted or hemolyzed.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Real-Time PCR Instrument with fluorescence detection
capabilities.
• Class II Biological Safety Cabinet.
• Refrigerated Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and sterile filters.
• RNA extraction kit.
• PCR workstations.
Reagents:
• NPM1 Mutation Detection RT-PCR Kit containing:
◦ Master Mix
◦ NPM1 specific primers and probes
◦ Positive and negative controls
• RNA extraction reagents
• Nuclease-free water
• RNase inhibitors
• High quality, certified PCR plastic ware
Storage Conditions:
• Store NPM1 RT-PCR Kit and other reagents at -20°C.
• Store extracted RNA at -80°C.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for all reagents.
1. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction:
1. Perform RNA extraction using the specified kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify and assess RNA quality using a spectrophotometer
(A260/280 ratio should be between 1.8-2.0).
B. RT-PCR Setup:
1. Prepare a PCR master mix in a PCR clean area by combining
the required reagent volumes according to the kit instructions.
2. Add appropriate volumes of extracted RNA to each reaction
tube containing the master mix.
3. Include negative control (nuclease-free water) and positive
control (NPM1 mutation RNA) in each PCR run.
4. Aliquot the samples, negative control, and positive control into
the PCR plate.
C. Real-Time PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Load the PCR plate into the Real-Time PCR instrument.
2. Program the cycling conditions as follows: - Initial denaturation:
95°C for 5 minutes - 45 cycles of: - Denaturation: 95°C for 15
seconds - Annealing/extension: 60°C for 60 seconds (collect
fluorescence data at this step)
D. Detection and Interpretation:
1. Monitor and verify amplification curves.
2. Threshold cycle (Ct) values should be analyzed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantify the NPM1 mutant allele expression by comparing
patient sample Ct values to standard curve data.
4. Positive control should generate amplification within specified
Ct range.
5. Negative control should show no amplification.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality controls with each batch of samples (positive
and negative controls).
• Include external quality assessments following laboratory
schedules.
• Record all control data and patient sample data accurately in
appropriate logs.
• Out-of-range control results must be investigated immediately,
and assays need re-running after resolving any issues.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the quantity of NPM1 mutation in patient samples using
the standard curve.
• Interpret the results according to validated clinical criteria.
• Ensure the result entry into Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and cross-verify for transcriptions error.
• Report any critical results to the attending physician as per
laboratory policy.
