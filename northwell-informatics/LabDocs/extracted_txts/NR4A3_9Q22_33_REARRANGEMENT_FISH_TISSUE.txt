Standard Operating Procedure
NR4A3 (9Q22.33) Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of NR4A3
(9Q22.33) gene rearrangement in tissue samples using Fluorescence
In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This procedure ensures accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in generating results.
2. Definition
NR4A3 (9Q22.33) rearrangement refers to structural alterations in
the NR4A3 gene located at chromosomal position 9q22.33. FISH
involves the use of fluorescent probes that bind specifically to these
regions to detect and localize the rearrangements within the genetic
material of the tissue samples.
3. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Required Volume: Tissue sections must be 4-5 microns thick.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Tissue samples not adequately fixed,
overly thick sections, improperly stored specimens, or specimens
with ambiguous identification.
4. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies
• Fluorescent probes specific to NR4A3 (9Q22.33)
• FISH hybridization chamber
• Microscope (fluorescence-capable)
• xylene, ethanol, 10% neutral buffered formalin, and phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS)
• Pepsin solution, saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, and DAPI or
other nuclear counterstain
• Hybridization reagents (formamide, dextran sulfate, SSC buffer)
• Pap pen
• Coverslips and mounting medium
5. Procedure
Pre-Treatment of Tissue Slides
1. Deparaffinize FFPE tissue sections by immersing slides in
xylene for 10 minutes (repeat twice).
2. Hydrate slides in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
4. Apply 10% neutral buffered formalin and incubate slides at
room temperature for 10 minutes.
5. Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water and PBS.
6. Treat slides with pepsin solution at 37°C for 10 minutes to
digest proteins and expose target DNA.
7. Rinse slides in PBS, followed by SSC wash, and then air dry.
Probe Hybridization
1. Apply approximately 10 µL of NR4A3 (9Q22.33) specific probe
to each tissue section within the marked area with a Pap pen.
2. Cover with a coverslip, sealing edges firmly.
3. Place slides in a hybridization chamber and denature at 72°C
for 5 minutes.
4. Hybridize at 37°C overnight (approximately 16-20 hours).
Post-Hybridization Wash
1. Remove coverslips carefully and immerse slides in 2x SSC at
72°C for 2 minutes.
2. Wash slides in 0.5x SSC at room temperature for 5 minutes
with gentle agitation.
3. Rinse slides in PBS and air dry.
Counterstaining and Visualization
1. Apply DAPI or other nuclear counterstain and cover tissue
sections with a coverslip and mounting medium.
2. Allow slides to dry completely.
3. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope.
4. Capture images and analyze rearrangement using appropriate
software.
6. Quality Control
• Negative and Positive Controls: Include both NR4A3
rearrangement-positive and normal tissue samples in each batch
to ensure probe specificity and hybridization efficiency.
• Blinded Analysis: Have a second qualified technologist review
results in a blinded fashion for quality assurance.
7. Interpretation of Results
• Positive Result: Presence of split signals indicating NR4A3 gene
rearrangement.
• Negative Result: Absence of split signals, confirming no
rearrangement detected.
• Inconclusive Results: Ambiguous signals or technical errors
requiring repeat testing.
8. Reporting Results
Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before transmission to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Include detailed images and written descriptions of findings.
• Reference Ranges: Reference ranges are not applicable; each
result should be compared against the positive and negative
control samples.
9. Method Limitations
• FFPE tissue samples can have variable quality impacting probe
efficiency.
• Presence of technical artifacts that may interfere with signal
interpretation.
• Genetic heterogeneity potentially affecting the detection of
rearrangements.
