Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for NT-pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-
proBNP), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for NT-pro B-Type Natriuretic
Peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in serum using an automated
immunoassay analyzer, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable
results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure that the analytical procedures are performed
accurately and all steps are documented properly. The procedure
should be carried out by a trained and certified Medical Laboratory
Scientist.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
▪ Serum samples collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or red-top tube without anticoagulant.
▪ Blood should be collected by venipuncture, allowed to
clot, and then centrifuged to separate serum.
▪ Sample should be free of hemolysis and lipemia.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen:
▪ Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
▪ Specimens in tubes other than SST or red-top tubes.
▪ Specimens collected in sodium citrate or any
anticoagulant other than plain serum.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (specific model, e.g.,
Roche Cobas, Abbott Architect)
◦ NT-proBNP reagent kits specific to the analyzer model.
◦ Control materials for NT-proBNP (low, normal, high).
◦ Calibrators specific to NT-proBNP assay.
◦ Pipettes and tips (if required for manual steps).
◦ Centrifuge.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality control (QC) with each batch of samples
analyzed.
◦ Use two levels of control material each day patient testing is
performed: low and high.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they fall within the
established acceptable range before proceeding with patient
sample analysis. If QC results fall outside the acceptable
range, do not proceed with patient testing and troubleshoot
according to the instrument and reagent manufacturer's
guidelines.
4. CALIBRATION
◦ Calibration should be performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Perform calibration with each new reagent lot or when
indicated by the instrument.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation: - Verify that the equipment has been calibrated
and is operating correctly. - Ensure that the serum samples
have been properly centrifuged and separated. - Allow reagent
kits, controls, and calibrators to come to room temperature
before use.
B. Sample and Reagent Loading: - Load the NT-proBNP
reagent pack into the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. - Load the quality controls and patient specimens
into the designated sample racks or sample cups. - Program
the analyzer with patient identification, sample identification
numbers, and required tests.
C. Running the Assay: - Initiate the run sequence on the
immunoassay analyzer as per the operator’s manual. - Monitor
the analyzer to ensure there are no errors or deviations during
the process. - Record the start and end times of analysis and
document any anomalies or deviations observed during the run.
D. Result Generation and Verification: - Upon completion of
the run, retrieve the final results from the analyzer. - Verify
results against QC data to ensure reliability; only release results
if QC data are within acceptable limits. - Use LIS (Laboratory
Information System) to report patient results ensuring proper
linkage between specimen and results. - Manually verify critical
results as per the laboratory's policy before releasing to
electronic medical records.
E. Troubleshooting: - If results are flagged by the analyzer or
fall outside established ranges, refer to the instrument’s
operation manual for troubleshooting steps. - Repeat analysis if
necessary and document any corrective actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
◦ Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for critical results
and the need for follow-up or confirmation testing.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for NT-proBNP vary by age, sex, and
clinical setting; refer to the manufacturer's insert or
established laboratory-specific reference ranges.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the reagent package insert for specific limitations of
the assay.
◦ Potential interferences include hemolysis, lipemia, and
improper sample handling.

By adhering to these procedures, lab personnel can accurately
measure NT-proBNP levels in serum, providing crucial information for
the diagnosis and management of heart failure and other related
conditions.
