SOP for NT-PRO BNP Testing
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is established to
ensure accurate and precise measurement of NT-proBNP
levels in blood specimens. NT-proBNP testing is used to assist
in the diagnosis and management of heart failure and other
cardiac-related conditions.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory staff trained to
perform NT-proBNP testing and includes the handling,
processing, analyzing, and reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to ensure
that NT-proBNP testing is performed according to this SOP and
that the results are accurate and reliable.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Specimen Type: Serum or plasma (EDTA, Heparin). b.
Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum/plasma. c. Specimen
Handling: Specimens should be collected using standard
venipuncture techniques. Ensure that samples are free from
hemolysis. d. Stability:
◦ Serum/Plasma: Stable for up to 24 hours at room
temperature, up to 48 hours when refrigerated (2-8°C), and
up to 6 months when frozen (-20°C or lower).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment: NT-proBNP Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Siemens Advia Centaur, or equivalent). b. Reagents: NT-
proBNP assay kits as recommended by the analyzer
manufacturer. c. Controls: Two levels of control material -
Negative and Positive controls. d. Calibrators: NT-proBNP
calibrators as provided by the assay manufacturer.
6. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation and Calibration:
1. Turn on the NT-proBNP analyzer and allow it to warm up
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform calibration of the analyzer using provided
calibrators, following the manufacturer's recommended
calibration procedure.
3. Documentation of calibration must include date, time,
calibrator lot numbers, and initials of the technologist.
b. Quality Control:
1. Run two levels of control material (Negative and Positive)
before patient specimens and at the start of each shift.
2. Ensure controls fall within the acceptable range provided
by the control package insert.
3. Document control results in the NT-proBNP Quality
Control Log. If controls fall outside the acceptable range,
investigate and resolve the issue before processing
patient specimens.
c. Specimen Processing:
1. Centrifuge blood specimens to obtain serum or plasma.
2. Load the sample tube(s) onto the NT-proBNP analyzer,
ensuring proper identification and barcoding.
d. Analysis:
1. Follow the analyzer-specific protocol to run NT-proBNP
tests.
2. Review and verify the results generated by the analyzer
for accuracy.
e. Recording and Reporting Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and
verified by the technologist.
2. Abnormal or critical values should be verified and
reported immediately to the requesting physician/clinical
team as per laboratory critical value policy.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal range: <125 pg/mL for patients under 75 years of
age.
◦ For patients 75 years and older: <450 pg/mL.
◦ Note: Reference ranges may vary by manufacturer and
should be adjusted based on the analyzer used.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with NT-
proBNP measurements. Avoid grossly hemolyzed, lipemic,
or icteric specimens.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Refer to the analyzer manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide
for resolving instrument or assay-related issues.
◦ Document any troubleshooting steps taken and results in
the corresponding log.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Internal quality control: Maintain records of control runs,
calibration, and maintenance logs.
• External quality assurance: Participate in proficiency testing as
required by regulatory bodies for NT-proBNP assays.

analyzer.
