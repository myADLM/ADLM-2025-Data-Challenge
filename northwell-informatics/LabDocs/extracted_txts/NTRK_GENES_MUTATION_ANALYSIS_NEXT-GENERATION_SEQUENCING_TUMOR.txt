Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for NTRK Genes
Mutation Analysis, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), Tumor
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the analysis of NTRK gene
mutations in tumor samples using next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technology.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of NTRK genes mutation
analysis for all tumor samples received in the laboratory for NGS
testing. Specimen collection, receipt, and accessioning are assumed
to be completed prior to this phase.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• NTRK genes: Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase genes
(NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3)
• NGS: Next-generation sequencing
• QC: Quality Control
• SNP: Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
1. Sample Verification:
◦ Verify that the tumor sample has been properly accessioned
and labeled.
◦ Confirm that the sample meets the volume and quality
requirements for NGS (e.g., minimum DNA concentration
and purity).
2. DNA Extraction and Quantification:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from the tumor sample using a
validated extraction kit.
◦ Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
◦ Document DNA quantity and purity in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
3. Library Preparation:
◦ Normalize DNA concentration to the required input for library
preparation.
◦ Perform library preparation using a validated kit, following
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Assess library quality and quantity using a bioanalyzer or
equivalent instrument.
◦ Document library preparation batch and QC results.
5.2 Sequencing Run
1. Pool Libraries:
◦ Pool normalized libraries ensuring equimolar representation
for each sample.
2. Prepare Sequencing Platform:
◦ Load the pooled libraries onto the sequencing platform (e.g.,
Illumina, Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
◦ Perform necessary instrument QC checks.
3. Run Sequencing:
◦ Start sequencing run and monitor progress according to the
instrument's operational protocols.
◦ Ensure that all sequencing runs are labeled and traceable.
5.3 Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Quality Check:
◦ Assess the quality of raw sequencing data using appropriate
software.
◦ Check metrics such as read length, cluster density, Q30
scores, etc.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align raw sequencing reads to a reference genome using
validated alignment software (e.g., BWA, Bowtie).
◦ Identify mutations in NTRK genes using variant calling
software (e.g., GATK, MuTect).
◦ Annotate identified variants using an appropriate database
(e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar).
3. Data Filtering and Interpretation:
◦ Filter variants based on predefined criteria (e.g., read depth,
frequency).
◦ Interpret clinically relevant variants in the NTRK genes.
◦ Document all identified variants and their interpretations in
the LIS.
5.4 Quality Control
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Run internal controls (positive and negative) with each batch
of samples.
◦ Document control results and ensure they are within
acceptable limits.
2. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
validate NTRK mutation analysis accuracy.
5.5 Reporting Results
1. Verification:
◦ Review all results and their interpretations for accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Consult with a molecular pathologist or other qualified
personnel for final result verification.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Enter verified results into the LIS.
◦ Ensure reports are generated according to the laboratory's
reporting guidelines, including interpretation remarks and
clinical relevance of identified NTRK mutations.
3. Release Results:
◦ Release the final report to the healthcare provider or
requesting entity.
◦ Maintain a copy of the report in the patient's laboratory
records.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS

limitations regarding depth of coverage, sensitivity, and specificity of
detection of NTRK gene mutations.
