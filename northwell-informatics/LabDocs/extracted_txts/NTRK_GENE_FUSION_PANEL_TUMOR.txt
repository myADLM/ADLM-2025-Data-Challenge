1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Sample Preparation
1. FFPE Tissue Samples:
◦ Deparaffinize 5-10 µm FFPE tissue sections using xylene
and ethanol washes.
◦ Perform RNA extraction using an RNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Quantify RNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
2. Fresh/Frozen Tumor Samples:
◦ Homogenize fresh or frozen tumor samples in lysis buffer.
◦ Perform RNA extraction using an RNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Quantify RNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
4.2. cDNA Synthesis
1. Prepare the reverse transcription reaction mix according to the
RT-PCR reagent kit instructions.
2. Add the appropriate amount of RNA to the reaction mix and
incubate in the thermocycler as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Store the synthesized cDNA at -20°C until further use, if not
proceeding immediately to the next step.
4.3. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix using the NTRK Gene Fusion
Panel kit reagents. Include positive and negative controls.
2. Add synthesized cDNA to the reaction mix.
3. Run the PCR program as recommended by the NTRK Gene
Fusion Panel kit instructions.
4.4. NGS Library Preparation
1. Perform library preparation following the NGS library
preparation kit instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the prepared libraries using a
Bioanalyzer or equivalent instrument.
3. Normalize the libraries to the appropriate concentration for
NGS.
4.5. Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS instrument.
2. Run the sequencing protocol according to the NGS instrument
and manufacturer's instructions.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality and performance.
4.6. Data Analysis
1. Use bioinformatics tools and software provided with the NTRK
Gene Fusion Panel kit to analyze the sequencing data.
2. Identify and report detected NTRK gene fusions and their
corresponding breakpoints.
3. Validate findings using additional bioinformatics pipelines if
necessary.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
reliability of results.
6. Monitor quality metrics from sequencing runs, such as read
depth and mapping rates, to ensure data validity.
7. Document and address any deviations or failures according to
laboratory protocol.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Review the analyzed data and verify results.
10. Generate a comprehensive report detailing NTRK gene fusion
status.
11. Report results to the clinician or authorized requester promptly.

1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow all institutional and regulatory guidelines for the handling
and processing of tumor samples.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
throughout the procedure.
This protocol is reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to
reflect advancements in technology and methodology, and to ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Laboratory personnel must document each step of the process,
including sample preparation, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification,
library preparation, sequencing run, and data analysis in the
laboratory information management system (LIMS) or appropriate
laboratory logbooks.
Validation and quality control results must be recorded and reviewed
by a supervisor before reporting final results. Any corrective actions
taken in response to deviations or quality control failures should also
be documented.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accurate
and reliable detection of NTRK gene fusions in tumor samples, aiding
in the clinical management and treatment decision-making for
patients with cancer.
