Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Lipoprotein Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for performing
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Lipoprotein Profile testing on
serum specimens. This testing will provide detailed information on
lipoprotein particle numbers and sizes, which are used for assessing
cardiovascular risk.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the procedures as outlined in this SOP. Any
inconsistencies or issues that may affect test results should be
promptly reported to a supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: 1-2 mL collected in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-serum tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens with significant hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
• Specimens not stored or transported under specified conditions.
Specimen Stability:
• At room temperature (15-25°C): 24 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days.
• Frozen (< -15°C): 30 days (avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• NMR Spectrometer
• Serum tubes (Red-top or SST)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample cups
• NMR Lipoprotein Panel reagents and calibrators
• Quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Allow the serum sample to clot fully at room temperature for at
least 30 minutes.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
3. Carefully pipette the serum into a clean, appropriately labeled
sample cup, avoiding the transfer of cells.
B) Instrument Preparation:
1. Turn on the NMR spectrometer and allow it to warm up as per
manufacturer instructions.
2. Verify that the instrument is calibrated using manufacturer-
provided calibrators. Document calibration results.
3. Ensure that quality control measures are in place and perform
daily quality control checks using control materials at different
concentration levels. Document the QC results.
4. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, follow internal
troubleshooting procedures and do not proceed with patient
samples until the QC results are acceptable.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Place the prepared sample cup in the sample holder of the
NMR spectrometer.
2. Input the patient information and assign the sample to the
appropriate test protocol for the NMR Lipoprotein Panel.
3. Start the analysis as per the manufacturer's operating manual.
4. Monitor the analysis process and ensure the instrument is
performing as expected.
5. Upon completion, review the results for any flags or error
messages. If necessary, rerun the sample to confirm results.
D) Result Interpretation:
1. The NMR spectrometer will automatically generate a
comprehensive lipoprotein profile including particle
concentrations and sizes.
2. Review the results to ensure they fall within the expected
reference ranges. If results are abnormal or unexpected,
perform additional verification or consult with a supervisor.
3. Document the final results, including any necessary comments
or notes about the sample quality or testing process.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control checks each day of use, using
commercially available control sera.
• Results of QC specimens must be within established limits prior to
reporting patient results. Document all QC data.
• Follow manufacturer's recommendations for instrument calibration
and maintenance.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to guarantee
the accuracy and reliability of the NMR Lipoprotein Profile results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Abnormal or critical results must be communicated promptly to
the appropriate healthcare provider as per laboratory protocol.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for specific limitations
regarding sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences (e.g.,
high triglycerides levels may affect the accuracy of the lipoprotein
particle concentration measurements).
