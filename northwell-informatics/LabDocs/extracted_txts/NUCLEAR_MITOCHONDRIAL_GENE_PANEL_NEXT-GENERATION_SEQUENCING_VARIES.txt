Procedure:
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Accept only well-identified and correctly labeled specimens
with accompanying requisition forms.
◦ Check specimen integrity and match with patient information
before proceeding.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction protocol as specified in the DNA
Extraction Kit manual.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using
Qubit Fluorometer and NanoDrop Spectrophotometer.
◦ Proceed only with samples having an adequate amount and
quality of DNA (A260/280 ratio ≈ 1.8).
B) Library Preparation:
1. Fragmentation and End Repair:
◦ Perform fragmentation of DNA using mechanical shearing or
enzymatic methods.
◦ Follow with end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation as per
the Library Preparation Kit instructions.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Enrich target DNA fragments through PCR.
◦ Quantify and assess the size distribution of the amplified
libraries using the Agilent Bioanalyzer.
3. Normalization:
◦ Normalize the concentration of library samples for uniform
sequencing output.
C) Target Capture:
1. Hybridization:
◦ Perform target capture using probes specific to the Nuclear
Mitochondrial Gene Panel.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for hybridization and
washing steps.
2. Amplification Post-Capture:
◦ Amplify captured DNA fragments using PCR.
◦ Assess quantity and quality post-capture by using
Bioanalyzer.
D) Sequencing:
1. Load Libraries:
◦ Load the captured libraries onto the NGS sequencer
following manufacturer instructions.
2. Sequencing Run:
◦ Initiate sequencing run and monitor quality parameters
throughout the process.
◦ The run parameters should cover required depth and
coverage ensuring sufficient data for variant detection.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Primary Analysis:
◦ Perform base calling, demultiplexing, and generation of raw
sequencing reads using sequencer software.
2. Secondary Analysis:
◦ Align sequences to the reference genome using alignment
software (e.g., BWA).
◦ Perform variant calling to identify SNPs, indels, and other
mutations (e.g., using GATK).
3. Tertiary Analysis:
◦ Annotate variants using databases (e.g., ANNOVAR) and
assess their clinical significance.
◦ Generate comprehensive variant reports including
interpretation based on established guidelines.
F) Quality Control:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
the process.
◦ Examine QC metrics such as read depth, quality scores,
and mapping efficiency.
2. Review:
◦ Document any deviations from expected performance and
troubleshooting steps.
◦ Review variant reports thoroughly by clinical experts or
bioinformaticians for accuracy.
G) Result Reporting:
1. Verification:
◦ Cross-verify results with quality control outcomes and initial
input DNA parameters.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Compile comprehensive reports that include variant
interpretations and recommendations.
◦ Use the Laboratory Information System (LIS) to record and
transmit reports to the respective healthcare providers.
H) Documentation:
1. Record Keeping:
◦ Maintain detailed records of the complete procedural
workflow, including reagent lot numbers, sequencing run
IDs, quality controls, and final reports.
◦ Ensure all entries are dated, signed, and reviewed by
designated personnel.
Review and Approval:
• All staff members must undergo training and periodic re-
evaluation on this SOP.
• Regular SOP review must be conducted to incorporate
technological updates and procedural improvements.
References:
• Manufacturer's manuals for DNA extraction kits, library
preparation kits, and target capture kits.
• Software manuals for bioinformatics tools used in secondary and
tertiary data analysis.
• Peer-reviewed guidelines on the interpretation of genetic variants.
This SOP is effective as of [Start Date] and shall be reviewed and
updated as necessary.
