SOP for Nucleophosmin (NPM1) Mutation Analysis
1. PURPOSE To ensure the accurate, reliable, and timely
detection and reporting of the Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutation
in patient samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing and documenting each step of the NPM1 mutation
analysis procedure according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for monitoring adherence to this SOP and addressing
any issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITION Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutation analysis
involves detecting changes in the NPM1 gene, which is crucial
for diagnosing and managing certain hematological
malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
2. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV transilluminator
• PCR reagents (primers, nucleotides, Taq polymerase, buffer)
• DNA extraction kit
• Agarose gel
• Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
• NPM1 mutation-specific probe or sequencing reagents
• Positive and negative control samples
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerators/freezers for reagent storage
B. Specimen Requirements:
• Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate
• Ensure the samples are collected in EDTA tubes and properly
labeled with patient information and collection date/time.
• Specimens should be maintained at 2-8°C if delay in processing
is expected.
C. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from the patient's peripheral blood or bone marrow
aspirate according to the manufacturer’s protocol of the DNA
extraction kit.
2. Confirm DNA concentration and purity using spectrophotometry
(e.g., NanoDrop).
D. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR reactions by adding the following components to
each reaction tube: a) DNA template (100-250 ng) b) NPM1-
specific primers (forward and reverse) c) dNTP mix d) Taq
polymerase e) PCR buffer
2. Mix reagents thoroughly either manually or by using vortex
mixer.
3. Place reaction tubes in a thermal cycler and run the PCR
program specific for NPM1 mutation analysis: a) Initial
denaturation: X°C for X minutes b) Denaturation: X°C for X
seconds c) Annealing: X°C for X seconds d) Extension: X°C for
X minutes e) Final extension: X°C for X minutes
E. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare 1-2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (or
alternative DNA stain).
2. Load PCR products (including controls) into the wells of the
agarose gel.
3. Run electrophoresis at appropriate voltage (70-150V) for X
minutes until separation is adequate.
4. Visualize DNA bands using a UV transilluminator and document
results by taking photographs.
F. Mutation Detection:
• Use a mutation-specific probe or sequencing method to identify
the NPM1 mutation.
• If sequencing is applied, follow the manufacturer's protocol for
next-generation sequencing or Sanger sequencing.
• Compare patient results with positive and negative controls.
G. Interpretation of Results:
• NPM1 mutation detected: Mutation-positive and consistent with
diagnosis of AML.
• No NPM1 mutation detected: Mutation-negative.
• Indeterminate: Repeat testing or consult supervisor.
H. Reporting Results:
1. Label the final report with patient identification, date, test
performed, and results.
2. Include interpretation and comments about the clinical
significance of the findings.
3. Verify and review results before entering them into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for clinician access.
I. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control checks for each batch of PCR analysis:
a) Run known positive and negative controls. b) Ensure all
reagents and equipment are within calibration and expiry dates.
2. Document all QC measures and address any deviations or
errors.
3. Perform proficiency tests periodically as required by CLIA
regulations.
J. Troubleshooting:
• If controls fail or results are ambiguous, troubleshoot by checking
equipment, reagents, and procedure steps.
• Repeat PCR and electrophoresis if necessary.
• Document and report any persistent issues to the supervisor.
