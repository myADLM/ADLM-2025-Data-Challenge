Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
NUTM1 (15q14) Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for performing Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect NUTM1 (15q14)
rearrangement in tissue samples. The aim is to ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable identification of NUTM1 gene rearrangements
in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing FISH
analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisors to ensure adherence to this protocol and to address any
deviations or issues promptly.
1. DEFINITION
NUTM1 (15q14) rearrangement refers to the chromosomal alteration
involving the NUTM1 gene, detectable using FISH technology in
tissue samples.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• FISH probe specific for NUTM1 (15q14) rearrangement
• DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for nuclear staining
• FFPE tissue sections (4-5 µm thick)
• Xylene, ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Deparaffinization reagents
• Protease treatment solution
• Denaturation and hybridization buffer
• Coverslips and hybridization chamber
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Place tissue sections on positively charged slides.
◦ Incubate slides in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes.
◦ Hydrate through a graded ethanol series: 100% ethanol for
2 x 5 minutes, 95% ethanol for 5 minutes, 70% ethanol for 5
minutes, then rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
2. Protease Treatment
◦ Treat slides with protease solution at 37°C for 20-30 minutes
(optimal time to be determined during validation).
3. Rinsing and Drying
◦ Rinse slides in 2x saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, then
air dry.
B) Probe Hybridization
1. Denaturation
◦ Denature probe solution at 75°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Apply 10 µL of probe mixture to the target area of the slide.
2. Co-denaturation on the slide
◦ Place a coverslip over the probe solution and seal with
rubber cement.
◦ Denature slides at 80°C for 5 minutes on a hot plate.
3. Hybridization
◦ Transfer slides to a humidified hybridization chamber and
incubate overnight (approximately 16-20 hours) at 37°C.
C) Post-Hybridization Washing
1. Washing
◦ Remove coverslips carefully.
◦ Wash slides in 0.4x SSC at 73°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 2x SSC / 0.1% NP-40 at room temperature
for 1 minute.
2. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain with DAPI solution for 5 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Mounting
◦ Rinse in distilled water, air dry, and mount with an
appropriate antifade solution.
D) Microscopy and Analysis
1. Slide Examination
◦ Use a fluorescence microscope to analyze the slides.
◦ Examine at least 200 interphase nuclei per case for FISH
signals.
2. Interpretation
◦ NUTM1 rearrangement is identified by the separation of
orange and green signals.
◦ Count cells showing a split signal, indicative of gene
rearrangement.
◦ Ensure proper signal scoring and document findings clearly.
3. Quality Control
◦ Validate signal patterns using known positive and negative
control slides.
◦ If controls do not show expected patterns, repeat the
procedure and consult with the supervisor.
4. Reporting Results
5. Documentation
◦ Record the number of cells scored, the number of cells
showing NUTM1 rearrangement, and the percentage of
positive cells.
6. Results Interpretation
◦ Report the percentage of cells with NUTM1 rearrangement.
◦ Provide a detailed written report summarizing the findings,
including any relevant clinical correlations.
7. Review and Verification
◦ A second trained technologist should review and verify the
results.
◦ Ensure that results are correctly entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
8. Critical Findings
◦ Immediately notify the requesting physician or clinical team
of critical findings according to laboratory protocols.
