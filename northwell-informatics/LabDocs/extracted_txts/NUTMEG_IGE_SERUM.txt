Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase - NUTMEG,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical phase of generating results for
NUTMEG, IGE, and SERUM assays. This includes testing
methodology, quality control, and result interpretation to ensure
accurate and consistent patient test results.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps of this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to this
SOP and address any issues or deviations.
1. DEFINITION
NUTMEG, IGE, and SERUM assays are specific tests performed to
measure the serum levels of nutmeg allergen, immunoglobulin E
(IgE), and other serum components, respectively. These tests are
crucial for diagnosing allergic reactions and monitoring immune
response.
1. SPECIMENS
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Serum collected in a red-top or gold-top (serum separator)
tube.
◦ Minimum volume required: 1 mL of serum (recommended to
collect 3-5 mL of whole blood).
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Samples in blood collection tubes with anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin, citrate).
◦ Samples without proper patient identification or labeling.
◦ Samples received beyond 72 hours from collection without
refrigeration or 7 days if stored at 2-8°C.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-assay Preparation
• Ensure all equipment, reagents, and controls are prepared and
calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Verify that the specimens meet the acceptance criteria listed
above.
• Record patient information, sample ID, and test parameters in the
laboratory’s information system (LIS).
B. NUTMEG Assay
• Using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit:
1. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
2. Prepare standards, controls, and test samples according to
the kit instructions.
3. Add the appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and test
samples to the wells of the ELISA plate.
4. Add detection antibody, incubate the plate, and wash as
specified.
5. Add a substrate solution to each well, incubate, then add
stop solution.
6. Measure absorbance with a microplate reader at the
specified wavelength.
• Record results and interpret based on reference ranges provided
in the kit.
C. IGE Assay
• Using a fluorometric immunoassay (FIA) or chemiluminescent
immunoassay (CLIA):
1. Calibrate the instrument according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Prepare reagents and samples as directed.
3. Load the prepared reagents, controls, standards, and
samples onto the instrument.
4. Perform the assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Record and interpret results using the provided reference
intervals for total IgE.
D. SERUM Assay
• Using an automated analyzer for general serum components
(e.g., electrolytes, proteins):
1. Calibrate the analyzer and perform quality control checks.
2. Load the serum samples, reagents, and control materials
onto the analyzer.
3. Select the appropriate assay panel for serum analysis.
4. Run the samples and review the results generated by the
analyzer.
• Document and interpret results, comparing them against
reference ranges for each component.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run appropriate control samples with each assay batch.
◦ Utilize both positive and negative controls within acceptable
ranges.
◦ Document all quality control results; if results fall outside the
acceptable limits, investigate, troubleshoot, and rerun the
tests as needed.
◦ Maintain records of all calibrations, controls, and any
deviations from the protocol.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record the results in the LIS.
◦ Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing.
◦ Document any critical results and follow the laboratory’s
critical value reporting procedure.
3. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Assess sample integrity (e.g., evidence of hemolysis or
contamination) before analysis.
◦ Interpret results in the context of clinical correlation provided
by the healthcare provider.
4. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the ELISA, FIA, or CLIA kits.
◦ Analyzer operator's manuals and guidelines.
◦ Relevant clinical practice guidelines and literature.
5. REVISION HISTORY
◦ The protocol should be reviewed annually or whenever
there is a change in methodology, regulations, or equipment.
This SOP is effective immediately upon approval and must be
adhered to strictly to ensure accurate and consistent reporting of
NUTMEG, IGE, and SERUM results.
