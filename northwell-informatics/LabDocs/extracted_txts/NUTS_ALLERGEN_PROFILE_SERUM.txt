Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for NUTS ALLERGEN
PROFILE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure consistent, reliable, and
accurate testing for a NUTS ALLERGEN PROFILE, SERUM. This
protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for the test and ensuring quality control during the
process.
Responsibility: All laboratory technologists performing the test are
responsible for following this SOP and ensuring accuracy,
consistency, and reliability of the results. Supervisors are responsible
for reviewing the test procedures, results, and quality control
measures.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis phase of the NUTS ALLERGEN
PROFILE, SERUM test within the laboratory setting.
1. DEFINITION
The NUTS ALLERGEN PROFILE assesses the patient's serum
sample for specific IgE antibodies against various common nuts. It
helps diagnose nut allergies.
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred sample: 3-5mL of serum collected in a serum-
separation tube (SST).
• Stability: Samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-
term storage, the serum can be frozen at -20°C for up to 3
months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA or ImmunoCAP instrument for allergen-specific IgE
detection
• Serum-separation tubes (SST)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Disposable pipette tips and micropipettes
• Allergy-specific IgE test kit for nuts (including calibration
standards and controls)
• Computer with Laboratory Information System (LIS) software
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the SST tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to separate serum from blood cells.
2. Aliquot the serum into labeled sample tubes and store at 4°C
until analysis if testing is to be done within 7 days, or freeze at
-20°C for long-term storage.
B) System Preparation
1. Power on the ELISA/ImmunoCAP instrument and allow it to
warm up according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform daily checks on the equipment including temperature
validation, if applicable, and verify that all maintenance logs are
up-to-date.
C) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Run the calibration standards provided in the allergen-specific
IgE kit according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Analyze quality control samples (low-level, mid-level, and high-
level controls) to ensure the instrument and reagents are
functioning properly.
3. Document the calibration and quality control results in the
appropriate logs.
D) Test Procedure
1. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and controls
into the instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Follow the assay protocol detailed in the kit insert for
performing the test, including incubation times and
temperatures.
3. Run the assay and monitor the instrument for any error
messages. Troubleshoot as needed.
4. After the assay is complete, the instrument will analyze the
samples and generate results.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. The results will automatically be transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
7. Review the results for each sample. Verify that the controls are
within the acceptable range before validating patient results.
8. Any sample that displays an error or falls outside the
acceptable range for controls must be reanalyzed.
9. Report validated results through the LIS as per the laboratory
protocol.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Daily QC
1. Run low, mid, and high controls at the beginning of each day
and with each new lot of reagents.
2. Record the daily QC data. If any control falls outside the
specified range, investigate and perform corrective actions as
necessary before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
B) Monthly QC
1. Perform a monthly review of QC data to identify any trends or
shifts that may indicate issues with assay performance.
2. LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific allergen kit insert for individual test limitations and
cross-reactivity concerns.
