NUTS AND GRAINS PANEL IGG ANALYSIS SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of IgG
antibodies against nuts and grains using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to ensure consistent, accurate, and
reproducible results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all analyses of nuts and grains IgG antibodies in
patient serum samples performed in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
Nuts and Grains Panel IgG tests according to this procedure.
Supervisors must ensure that all personnel performing this test are
adequately trained and competent.
1. DEFINITIONS
• IgG: Immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody that plays a critical role
in immune response.
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a test that uses
antibodies and color change to identify the presence of a
substance.
1. SPECIMENS
◦ Preferred: Serum samples, collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST), centrifuged to separate the
serum, and stored at 2-8°C if tested within 72 hours or
frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples as
they can interfere with assay results. Samples that have
been stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
◦ ELISA washer
◦ Nuts and Grains Panel IgG ELISA kit
◦ Precision pipettes and tips
◦ Multichannel pipettes
◦ Deionized/distilled water
◦ Timer
◦ Microplate shaker (optional)
◦ Calibrated thermometers
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare all required reagents and controls according to the kit instructions. This includes preparing wash buffer, substrate solution, and stopping solution if not already provided in ready-to-use form.
3. Label the microplate wells clearly according to the plate layout provided in the kit instructions, designating wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette the designated amount of standards, controls, and patient samples into their corresponding wells as per the ELISA kit instructions.
2. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well containing samples, standards, and controls. Mix by gently tapping the side of the plate or using a microplate shaker.
3. Incubate the plate for the specified time at room temperature.
4. After incubation, wash the wells as indicated in the kit instructions using the ELISA washer.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark for the specified time.
6. Add the stop solution to each well in the same order that the substrate was added.
7. Read the absorbance of the wells using the ELISA reader set to 450 nm within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C) Calculation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance for each standard concentration on the y-axis against the corresponding IgG concentration on the x-axis using a four-parameter logistic curve-fitting software.
2. Determine the IgG concentrations in patient samples by comparing their absorbance values to the standard curve.
3. Review the results for any inconsistencies or outliers and repeat the assay if necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each assay to
ensure proper assay performance.
2. Review quality control results before reporting patient
results. Results are valid only if the controls are within the
specified ranges.
3. Document all quality control data in the logbook and
report any deviations to the supervisor.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reported in U/mL.
2. Enter the results into the laboratory information system
(LIS) for review and verification.
3. Notify the clinician if any critical values are identified.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Cross-reactivity with IgG antibodies from other foods may
occur.
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may lead to
erroneous results.
◦ The assay is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.
