Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for NUT Immunostain (Technical Component
Only)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for
performing the analytical phase of generating results for NUT
immunostaining in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure will
ensure the accurate and consistent performance of the NUT
immunostain test, including proper handling and staining of
specimens, and documentation of results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
the NUT immunostain procedure in accordance with this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol and for addressing any issues that arise during the
procedure.
1. DEFINITION
NUT Immunostain: An immunohistochemical technique used to
detect the presence of NUT protein in tissue samples, aiding in the
diagnosis of NUT midline carcinoma and other NUT-associated
conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a) Accepted Specimens: - Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks. - Unstained tissue sections mounted on positively
charged slides, with a thickness of 4-5 microns.
b) Unacceptable Specimens: - Tissue samples that are improperly
fixed or processed. - Tissue sections that are damaged or not
adequately prepared.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a) Equipment: - Microtome (for sectioning FFPE tissue blocks) -
Water bath - Incubator - Automated immunostainer or manual
staining setup
b) Reagents: - Primary antibody specific for NUT protein - Secondary
antibody conjugated with a detection enzyme (e.g., horseradish
peroxidase) - Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB - diaminobenzidine) -
Hematoxylin (counterstain) - Xylene and alcohols for deparaffinization
and rehydration - Appropriate antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate
buffer)
c) Supplies: - Positively charged microscope slides - Cover slips -
Staining jars or automated stainer trays - Gloves and protective
equipment
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at a thickness of 4-5 microns using
a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath and mount them onto positively
charged slides.
3. Allow slides to dry thoroughly at room temperature or in an
incubator at 37°C.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the slides by placing them in xylene, two
changes, 10 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate the tissue sections in graded alcohols (100%, 95%,
70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer) and
heat in a microwave or pressure cooker according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature and then rinse in
distilled water.
D) Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS).
3. Apply primary antibody specific for NUT protein and incubate
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.
4. Wash slides in PBS or TBS.
5. Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Wash slides in PBS or TBS.
7. Apply chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) and monitor color
development under a microscope.
8. Stop the reaction by rinsing in distilled water.
E) Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in tap water and place slides in bluing solution if
necessary.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and
100%) and clear in xylene.
4. Apply coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control tissues with each
batch of staining to assess the performance of reagents and
technique.
◦ Document control results and any deviations from expected
outcomes. Notify the supervisor if any issues arise.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Label slides with patient identification and case number.
◦ Document staining results, including intensity and
distribution of NUT staining, in the laboratory information
system.
◦ Review slides and results with a pathologist for confirmation.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If staining quality is suboptimal, check reagent expiration
dates, antibody concentrations, and antigen retrieval
conditions.
◦ Repeat staining if necessary, and document corrective
actions taken.

immunostaining, contributing to reliable diagnostic results for patient
care.
