Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for N. GONORRHOEAE / C. TRACHOMATIS
AMPLIFICATION
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase involved in the
amplification and detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N.
gonorrhoeae) and Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) using
nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) methods. This process
ensures accurate, reliable, and timely results for clinical diagnosis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel trained in NAAT procedures are
responsible for performing this protocol.
• Laboratory supervisors oversee the procedure to ensure
compliance and proper documentation.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• N. gonorrhoeae/C. trachomatis NAAT kit (approved by regulatory
bodies such as FDA or CE)
• Nucleic acid extraction reagent kits
• PCR tubes or plates
• Micropipettes and tips (sterile, aerosol-resistant)
• PCR-grade water
• Positive and negative control samples
• DNA/RNA-free work environment and pipettes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. EQUIPMENT
• Real-time PCR thermocycler
• Automated nucleic acid extraction system (optional)
• Pipettes (variable volume)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge with compatible rotor
• Refrigerator and freezer for reagent storage
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Reagent Preparation
• Ensure all reagents are at the appropriate temperature before
use.
• Thaw reagents, controls, and extracted nucleic acid samples as
required.
• Mix reagents thoroughly by vortexing and briefly centrifuge to
collect liquid at the bottom of the tubes.
B) Nucleic Acid Extraction
• Perform nucleic acid extraction according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the designated extraction system or manual kit.
• Include both positive and negative extraction controls to monitor
the efficiency and any potential contamination.
• Label tubes/plates clearly to avoid cross-contamination.
C) Master Mix Preparation
• Prepare the PCR master mix in a clean area, free from DNA
contaminants.
• Calculate the volume of each reagent needed based on the
number of reactions (samples + controls).
• Mix components in the following order:
1. PCR-grade water
2. Buffer
3. dNTP mix
4. Primers and probes specific for N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis
5. Taq polymerase
D) PCR Setup
• Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
• Add extracted nucleic acid samples and controls to the respective
tubes/wells.
• Seal tubes/plates securely to prevent evaporation.
• Set up the real-time PCR cycler program according to the NAAT
kit instructions, typically including:
1. Initial denaturation
2. Cycling: denaturation, annealing, extension
3. Fluorescent detection during the extension phase
E) Amplification and Detection
• Place tubes/plates in the PCR thermocycler and run the
programmed cycle.
• Monitor the real-time amplification process ensuring all controls
perform as expected.
• Do not open PCR tubes/plates post-amplification to prevent
contamination.
F) Result Interpretation
• Analyze the amplification curves and cycle threshold (Ct) values.
• Compare the Ct values of samples to positive and negative
controls.
• A valid result requires proper amplification in positive controls and
no amplification in negative controls.
• Report samples as positive if Ct values fall within the kit’s defined
range for N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis.
• Report samples as negative if no amplification is observed and
controls are valid.
G) Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of samples.
• Document all control results and take appropriate action if control
results are out of range.
• Maintain a log of all reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
H) Documentation and Reporting
• Record all test conditions, reagent lot numbers, and observed
results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and validate results before reporting.
• Report findings to the requesting physician or clinician through the
LIS, including any necessary comments on test limitations or
retesting recommendations.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Wear appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
• Handle all clinical specimens and reagents as if they are
biohazardous.
• Follow standard laboratory biosafety guidelines during all phases
of the procedure.
• Decontaminate work surfaces before and after use with
appropriate disinfectants.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the N. gonorrhoeae/C. trachomatis
NAAT kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
molecular diagnostic methods.
• Institutional policies for molecular diagnostic certifications and
quality assurance.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If amplification is not observed in control reactions, repeat the test
starting from the extraction phase.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and stored
properly.
• Verify no reagent contamination or equipment malfunction is
present.
This SOP ensures high-quality and reliable detection of N.
gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis through rigorous adherence to
NAAT protocols. Regular review and updates of this SOP are
essential to incorporate advances in technology and regulatory
requirements.
