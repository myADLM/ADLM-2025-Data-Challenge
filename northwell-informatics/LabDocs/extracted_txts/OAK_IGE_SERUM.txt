Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing OAK, IGE,
SERUM
1. Purpose:
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analysis
and generation of results for OAK (Osteoarthritis Kinase), IGE
(Immunoglobulin E), and SERUM (Serum Protein) analysis.
1. Scope:
This SOP applies to all staff performing the analytical phase for the
OAK, IGE, and SERUM tests in the clinical laboratory.
1. Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate and reliable results. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance, addressing procedural
deviations, and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
1. Equipment and Reagents:
• OAK, IGE, SERUM Test Kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Water baths/incubators
• Analytical balance
• Microplates
• Plate readers/spectrophotometer
• Calibrators and controls
• Traceable thermometer
• Refractometer (for SERUM)
• Laboratory timer
• Laboratory gloves, lab coat, goggles
• Deionized water
• Disposable containers and tubes
1. Specimen Requirements:
• OAK, IGE, SERUM analysis requires serum samples collected in
serum separator tubes (SST).
• Specimens must be properly labeled with patient identification,
date, and time of collection.
• Unacceptable specimens include hemolyzed, lipemic, or
improperly stored/transported samples.
1. Procedure:
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
i. Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within the
expiration date and stored according to manufacturer's instructions. ii.
Allow specimens and reagents to reach room temperature prior to
analysis. iii. Inspect specimens for signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or
other issues. Reject unfit specimens according to specimen rejection
criteria. iv. Centrifuge serum separator tubes at 3500 rpm for 10
minutes to obtain clear serum.
B. Test Preparation:
i. Set up the test area, ensuring all necessary equipment and
supplies are available. ii. Prepare the microplates for the OAK, IGE,
and SERUM assays according to the kit instructions. iii. Label all
tubes, microplates, and control samples appropriately to avoid cross-
contamination. iv. Calibrate the equipment (pipettes,
spectrophotometers) before use according to standard laboratory
practices.
C. Analytical Phase:
i. OAK Analysis:
• Add test reagents and controls to the designated wells of the
microplate as per the OAK kit instructions.
• Add serum samples to the corresponding wells.
• Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and duration
as per the OAK assay procedure.
• After incubation, conduct necessary washing steps as per the kit
instructions.
• Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the requisite
time.
• Stop the reaction using stopping solution and read the optical
density at the specified wavelength using a plate reader.
ii. IGE Analysis:
• Follow similar steps as detailed for OAK analysis, using the IGE
test reagents and instructions.
• Ensure completion of each reagent addition, mixing, and
incubation step as per the kit instructions.
• Conduct the necessary washing and optical reading steps.
iii. SERUM Analysis:
• Specifically, for protein assays, the reagent addition and
incubation steps should be done as per the SERUM assay kit
instructions.
• Properly use the refractometer if specified in the SOP for protein
concentration determination.
• Wash, mix, and read the optical density at the designated
wavelength.
D. Post-Analytical Phase:
i. Data Analysis:
• Ensure all controls and calibrators fall within acceptable ranges.
• Analyze patient results against calibrators/standard curves.
• Verify the procedural integrity and quality control performance.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during analysis.
ii. Reporting Results:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Highlight and review any critical results as per laboratory policies.
• Ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines before releasing
results.
E. Quality Control:
i. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure assay integrity. ii. Maintain a record of all QC results,
analyzing for trends and inconsistencies. iii. Conduct inter-laboratory
comparisons periodically to ensure consistency and accuracy.
F. Troubleshooting:
i. If any step of the procedure fails, review and document the
potential source of error. ii. Consult manufacturer’s instructions and
troubleshooting guide. iii. Notify the supervisor immediately and take
appropriate corrective actions.
1. References:
Include relevant standard operating manuals for OAK, IGE, and
SERUM assays and equipment operating manuals.
1. Record Keeping:
Maintain records for all tests performed, including calibrations,
controls, testing logs, and maintenance reports, following laboratory
protocols and regulatory requirements.
1. Review:
This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in techniques, kits, equipment, or guidelines.
