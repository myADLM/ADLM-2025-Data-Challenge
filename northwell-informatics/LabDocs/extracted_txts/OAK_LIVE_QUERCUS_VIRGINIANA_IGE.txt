Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Oak Live (Quercus Virginiana) IgE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed
instructions on the analytical phase procedures for accurately
and efficiently generating results for Oak Live (Quercus
Virginiana) IgE testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to laboratory technologists and
personnel involved in the processing and analysis of specimens
for Oak Live (Quercus Virginiana) IgE testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all laboratory
technologists to follow this SOP accurately and ensure the
quality and reliability of Oak Live IgE test results. Supervisors
are responsible for training personnel, monitoring adherence to
the SOP, and taking corrective actions as necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
4.1. Specimen Types:
• Serum: Preferred specimen. Collect blood in a plain red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Plasma: Acceptable but not preferred. Collect in EDTA, heparin,
or citrate tubes.
4.2. Specimen Handling:
• Ensure proper labeling with patient identification and collection
date/time.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature before
centrifugation (for serum).
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum/plasma.
4.3. Specimen Stability:
• Serum/plasma should be stored at 2-8°C up to 7 days; for longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1. Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated Storage (2-8°C and -20°C)
• ELISA Reader or specified automated immunoassay analyzer
compatible with IgE testing
5.2. Reagents:
• Oak Live (Quercus Virginiana) IgE test kits, specified by the
manufacturer
◦ Store reagents according to manufacturer's instructions
5.3. Supplies:
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microtiter plates (if using ELISA)
• Sample dilution buffers
• Wash solutions
• Substrate and stop solutions
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
before use.
• Prepare workstation and ensure all necessary equipment,
reagents, and supplies are available.
6.2. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration of the ELISA Reader or immunoassay
analyzer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, high IgE levels) with
each batch of patient samples.
• Review and document QC results before proceeding with patient
sample analysis.
6.3. Sample Preparation:
• Dilute patient serum/plasma samples according to the test kit
instructions.
• Label microtiter plates/automated analyzer wells appropriately for
each patient sample and control.
6.4. Assay Procedure (ELISA Example):
1. Add the appropriate volume of diluted patient samples and
controls into designated wells.
2. Add critical reagents such as allergen-coated wells, enzyme-
labeled anti-IgE, and substrate solutions as directed by the
manufacturer.
3. Incubate for specified times at recommended temperatures.
4. Perform washes between each step to remove unbound
materials.
6.5. Development:
• Add stop solution to terminate the reaction (if required by test kit).
• Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using an ELISA
Reader, or follow the specific reading procedure for the
automated analyzer.
6.6. Calculation and Interpretation:
• Calculate Oak Live IgE concentrations using the standard curve
generated from control samples.
• Interpret results according to defined reference ranges and
clinical guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1. Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) with
appropriate patient identification.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing.
7.2. Critical Values:
• Follow laboratory policy for notification of critical values to the
appropriate healthcare providers.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
8.1. Common Issues:
• Review procedure to avoid common pitfalls such as improper
washing, incorrect incubation times.
• Refer to manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for assay-specific
issues.
8.2. Corrective Actions:
• Re-run samples if quality control fails.
• Notify supervisor and document any issues and corrective actions
taken.
