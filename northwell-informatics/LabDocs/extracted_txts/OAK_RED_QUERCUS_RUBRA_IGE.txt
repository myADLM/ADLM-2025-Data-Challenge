Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for OAK RED (QUERCUS
RUBRA) IgE Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a standardized method for
the analytical phase of testing Oak Red (Quercus rubra) specific IgE
in patient samples. The objective is to ensure accurate and reliable
testing and results generation using established laboratory
techniques.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP for Oak Red (Quercus rubra) IgE testing. It is the responsibility
of all staff to ensure correct and timely performance of the tests,
accurate documentation of results, and adherence to quality control
and safety procedures.
3. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum.
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood samples using a sterile technique and allow to clot
at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum from cells.
• Transfer serum into a labeled aliquot tube.
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 7 days. If longer
storage is needed, freeze at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA reader)
• Microplates
• Centrifuge (1500-2000 x g)
• Micropipettes and appropriate tips
• Plate washer (if using ELISA)
Reagents:
• Oak Red (Quercus rubra) specific IgE reagent pack
• Calibrators
• Controls (Positive and Negative)
• Wash buffer, substrate, stop solution (if using ELISA)
Supplies:
• Calibrated pipettes
• Tubes for serum aliquots
• Labeled microtubes/vials for reagents and samples
• Disposable gloves and laboratory coat
5. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify that the specimen is acceptable (properly labeled, within
acceptable collection time frame, etc.).
• Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls as per manufacturer
instructions.
Analytical Phase:
(Assuming use of an automated Immunoassay Analyzer)
1. Calibration:
◦ Load and run the calibrators according to the analyzer
instructions. Ensure the calibration curve is acceptable as
per manufacturer’s criteria.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (positive and negative) and
ensure they fall within the specified range. Document the
results.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Aliquot patient serum samples into appropriately labeled
microtubes.
4. Instrument Loading:
◦ Load required reagent packs, wash buffer, and reaction
vessels into the analyzer.
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and controls into
designated slots on the analyzer.
5. Running the Assay:
◦ Start the immunoassay run as per the manufacturer’s
standard operating procedure.
◦ Ensure the analyzer is running smoothly and attend to any
alerts or errors indicated by the analyzer.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Result Review:
◦ Once the run is finished, review the results generated by the
analyzer.
◦ Compare controls and calibrator results to predefined
acceptable criteria to validate the run.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify and, if necessary, confirm any critical or out-of-range
results.
3. Reporting:
◦ All verified results should be transmitted to the requesting
healthcare provider and documented securely.
◦ In case of any discrepancies, repeat testing and validation
must be performed.
4. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store remaining serum samples at 2-8°C for short term, or
at -20°C for long term storage, according to the laboratory’s
specimen retention policy.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Calibrators and quality control samples must be run at the start of
each testing day and with each new lot of reagents.
• Results must be within the manufacturer’s recommended range
before proceeding with patient samples.
External QC:
• Participate in a recognized external quality assessment scheme
for IgE testing to ensure accuracy and comparability of test
results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Range:
• Results for Oak Red (Quercus rubra) specific IgE should be
expressed in kUA/L and interpreted as follows:
◦ 0-0.10 kUA/L: Negative
◦ 0.11-0.34 kUA/L: Low
◦ 0.35-0.70 kUA/L: Moderate
◦ 0.71-3.50 kUA/L: High
◦ 3.50 kUA/L: Very High
Critical Results:
• Follow the laboratory's standard protocol for reporting critical or
significantly abnormal results to the healthcare provider
immediately.
8. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) practices while handling human
serum samples.
• Dispose of all biowaste and sharps according to the laboratory
safety and waste disposal guidelines.
