Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating OAT, IGE, and SERUM Test Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standard procedures for
analyzing and generating results for Organic Acid Tests (OAT),
Immunoglobulin E (IGE), and Serum analysis in the laboratory. This
protocol ensures quality, accuracy, and reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to adhere to
this SOP when performing tests and generating results for OAT, IGE,
and SERUM. This includes preparation, processing, quality control,
and reporting.
2. DEFINITIONS
OAT: Organic Acid Test, a diagnostic tool used for measuring organic
acids in the body that can help indicate metabolic imbalances and
nutrient deficiencies.
IGE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody that plays a significant role in
allergy and asthma.
SERUM: Refers to the clear liquid that can be separated from clotted
blood and contains dissolved substances including antibodies,
antigens, hormones, and any exogenous substances (e.g., drugs).
3. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Checks:
1. Verify Specimens: Ensure that the specimen has been
collected, received, and accessioned properly. The specimen
should be labeled correctly with the patient’s details.
2. Ensure Sample Integrity: Confirm that there are no hemolysis or
unusual visual characteristics that may affect the analysis.
A. Organic Acid Test (OAT):
Reagents and Supplies:
• Organic acid analysis reagents
• Calibration standards
• Control samples
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) system
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the serum sample at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the supernatant.
◦ Pipette the supernatant into a clean test vial.
2. Chemical Derivatization:
◦ Add reagents according to the OAT test kit instructions for
chemical derivatization.
◦ Allow the reaction to proceed as specified (typically involves
heating and incubation procedures).
3. GC-MS Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and
control samples into the GC-MS.
◦ Set the parameters as per the manufacturer's instructions
and inject samples.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Use the GC-MS software to analyze the peaks and identify
the organic acids.
◦ Compare with calibration standards to quantify the organic
acids present in the sample.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that the control samples are within acceptable
ranges before approving patient results.
B. Immunoglobulin E (IGE):
Reagents and Supplies:
• Immunoassay reagents
• IGE calibration standards
• Control sera
Equipment:
• Automated immunoanalyzer
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify that the serum is properly separated and stored at
2-8°C before analysis.
2. Load Samples:
◦ Load patient samples, calibration standards, and control
sera onto the immunoanalyzer.
3. Run the Assay:
◦ Follow the immunoassay kit protocol for IGE measurements.
◦ The automated immunoanalyzer will mix the reagents and
samples as per the protocol, incubate, and measure the
fluorescence/luminescence.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ The analyzer will provide a quantitative measurement of
IGE.
◦ Review the results against the calibration standards.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that control values fall within the expected range
before releasing patient results.
C. Serum Analysis:
Reagents and Supplies:
• Specific biochemical assay kits for desired tests (e.g.,
electrolytes, liver function tests)
• Calibration standards
• Control samples
Equipment:
• Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure the serum is free from cellular components and
stored correctly.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load the samples, calibration standards, and controls into
the clinical chemistry analyzer.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the appropriate assays on the analyzer.
◦ The analyzer performs the tests based on photometry or
other relevant measurement parameters.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Results for biochemical analytes will be reported by the
analyzer, which calculates concentrations based on
calibration curves.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Validate results using control samples and ensure they are
within the specified range.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results generated must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Critical results must be communicated to the attending physician
promptly following laboratory policy.
• Document all findings accurately in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and ensure proper sign-off.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Run quality control checks using control materials at the
beginning of each batch or daily (as per laboratory schedule).
• Ensure calibration of instruments, regular maintenance and
document appropriately.
• Re-run samples if quality control parameters are not met.
• Perform inter-sample comparisons and participate in external
quality assurance programs.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocol and package inserts for OAT, IGE assays,
and biochemical assays.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory quality assurance policy documents.
All personnel must receive adequate training on these procedures.
Any deviations from this SOP must be reported and documented.
