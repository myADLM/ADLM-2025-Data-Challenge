Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for OAT IgG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for the
analytical phase of generating accurate and reliable results for OAT
IgG (Oat IgG) testing in compliance with CLIA guidelines.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing OAT IgG
testing in the CLIA-certified clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the test
according to the protocol, ensuring proper documentation,
identifying and resolving any issues, and reporting the results.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to protocol, oversee the validity
of results, and perform regular audits to maintain standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum or Plasma
Specimen Volume: 3 mL preferred
Collection Method: Blood sample collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or a plasma separator tube (PST)
Stability:
• Room temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated: 48 hours
• Frozen: 2 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in incorrect tubes
• Specimens not properly labeled
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated automated microplate reader
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Multi-channel pipettes
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit for OAT IgG
detection
• Calibrators and controls
• Lint-free wipes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify that the ELISA kit reagents (including calibrators and
controls) are within their expiration date and have been brought
to room temperature (15-25°C) before use, as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Label all specimens, control, and calibrator wells on the
microplate.
Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood samples at 1000-1300 g for
10-15 minutes to separate serum/plasma from blood cells.
2. Pipette 100 μL of the diluted calibrators, controls, and patient
specimens into the appropriate wells in duplicate.
ELISA Protocol:
1. Adhere strictly to the ELISA kit manufacturer’s instructions for
incubation times, washing procedures, and reagent volumes.
2. Incubate the microplate as per the kit instructions, typically at
room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
3. Wash the plate 3-5 times with provided wash buffer to remove
unbound components. Ensure all wells are completely filled and
emptied with each wash step.
4. Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugated reagent to each well.
Incubate for the time specified.
5. Perform the final wash step, add substrate solution, and
incubate for the development of color as specified.
6. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution. Ensure the
addition of stop solution results in a color change indicating the
reaction has halted.
7. Read the microplate on a calibrated microplate reader at the
appropriate wavelength (often 450 nm with a 620 nm reference
filter).
Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Reject the assay and notify the supervisor if controls do not fall
within the specified ranges.
7. RESULT CALCULATION AND REPORTING
1. The optical density (OD) readings from the microplate reader
are used to construct a standard curve by plotting the OD
values of the calibrators against their concentrations.
2. Use the standard curve to interpolate the concentrations of OAT
IgG in patient samples.
3. Verify the calculated results against the control sample results:
◦ Acceptable range for controls
◦ Accept or reject runs based on criteria
4. Enter and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Any unusual results should be reported to the supervisor
for further investigation.
8. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal: Less than 20 Units/mL
• Equivocal: 20 to 30 Units/mL
• Elevated: Greater than 30 Units/mL
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Ensure all data, including raw instrument output, calibration data,
and control results, are logged accurately.
• Maintain the Temperature Monitoring Log for all equipment used.
• Record any deviations, maintenance actions, and corrective
actions in the appropriate logs.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the assay’s QC controls are out of range, check for potential
issues such as pipetting errors, reagent contamination, improper
incubation times, or equipment malfunction.
• Consult the ELISA kit insert for additional troubleshooting tips and
corrective action.
• Notify a supervisor for assistance with unresolved problems.
11. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow standard biohazard precautions.
• Dispose of all clinical and chemical waste according to laboratory
safety guidelines and OSHA standards.

information on reagent preparation, incubation times, and
troubleshooting.
