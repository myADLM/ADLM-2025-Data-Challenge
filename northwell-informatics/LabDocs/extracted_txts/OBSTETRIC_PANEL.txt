STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
OBSTETRIC PANEL
1. PURPOSE
To provide systematic instructions for the analysis, validation, and
reporting of the obstetric panel. The obstetric panel typically includes
tests that monitor the health of a pregnant patient and the status of
the pregnancy.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
obstetric panel tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol to ensure accurate and reliable results. The supervisor is
responsible for ensuring that all personnel are properly trained and
comply with the protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Primary Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in a red-top tube
or a gold-top serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 5 mL
• Transport/Storage: Specimens must be transported at 2-8°C if not
analyzed immediately. Do not store at room temperature for more
than 8 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Centrifuge
• Clinical chemistry analyzer
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Hematology analyzer
• Appropriate reagents and control materials for the specific
analyzers
• Pipettes and tips
6. PANEL COMPONENTS
The obstetric panel typically includes the following tests:
• Complete Blood Count (CBC)
• Blood Type and Rh Factor
• Antibody Screen
• Rubella Immunity
• Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)
• Syphilis Test (RPR)
• HIV Test
• Urinalysis
7. PROCEDURE
Step 1: CBC Analysis
1.1. Load the EDTA-anticoagulated blood specimen on the
hematology analyzer. 1.2. Perform a complete blood count (CBC)
with differential. 1.3. Validate and review the results.
Step 2: Blood Type and Rh Factor
2.1. Centrifuge the blood sample to separate the serum or plasma.
2.2. Perform ABO and Rh typing using the blood bank analyzer. 2.3.
Document and validate results.
Step 3: Antibody Screen
3.1. Test serum or plasma for unexpected antibodies using an indirect
antiglobulin test. 3.2. Record and validate results.
Step 4: Rubella Immunity
4.1. Use the immunoassay analyzer to test for Rubella IgG
antibodies. 4.2. Load the sample as per the instrument’s operational
manual. 4.3. Validate results for immune status indication.
Step 5: Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)
5.1. Utilize the designated immunoassay analyzer for HBsAg testing.
5.2. Follow the analyzer’s protocols to load the sample. 5.3. Review
and document results indicating presence or absence of the antigen.
Step 6: Syphilis Test (RPR)
6.1. Perform a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test or similar syphilis
screening test on the sample. 6.2. Confirm positive results with a
specific Treponema pallidum test (e.g., FTA-ABS). 6.3. Record all
results and ensure verification.
Step 7: HIV Test
7.1. Run the serum sample on the immunoassay analyzer for HIV
screening. 7.2. Follow up on any reactive results with confirmatory
testing (e.g., Western Blot or PCR). 7.3. Maintain accurate records
for review.
Step 8: Urinalysis
8.1. Use a fresh urine sample or aliquot from the collected specimen.
8.2. Perform the test using the urinalysis dipsticks and confirm
findings with microscopy if necessary. 8.3. Document all findings.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
8.1. Run appropriate quality control samples at the beginning of each
shift and with any new reagent lots. 8.2. Document all control results
in the quality control log. 8.3. If controls fall outside acceptable limits,
troubleshoot and re-perform tests until controls are within the range.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
9.1. Enter all validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). 9.2. Document any critical or abnormal results and follow up
with confirmatory re-tests if necessary. 9.3. Notify the appropriate
healthcare provider of critical test results immediately as per
laboratory policy.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the specific method’s kit insert or established laboratory
reference values for reporting. Common reference intervals include:
• CBC: Refer to analyzer-specific values.
• Blood Type and Rh Factor: ABO and Rh determination.
• Antibody Screen: Negative (or specify detected antibodies).
• Rubella IgG: Immune (usually > 10 IU/mL) or Non-immune
• HBsAg: Negative/Non-reactive
• Syphilis Test (RPR): Non-reactive
• HIV Test: Non-reactive
• Urinalysis: Negative for protein, glucose, ketones, blood, nitrite,
leukocytes - follow strip instructions for other parameters.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the kit inserts for each assay for detailed limitations. Ensure
cross-reference with each analyzer's user manual as certain
limitations could influence the interpretation of results.
