Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Obstetric Panel with HIV
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase procedures
for generating results from the Obstetric Panel with HIV testing to
ensure accuracy, reliability, and timely reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated medical laboratory technologists are responsible for
conducting the analyses, ensuring proper use of equipment and
reagents, documentation of results, and quality assurance of the
obtained data. Supervisors are responsible for verifying results,
addressing inconsistencies, and facilitating corrective actions as
needed.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all obstetric panel samples received in the
laboratory, ensuring all relevant tests including HIV are processed
according to established methodologies.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Obstetric Panel: A group of blood tests ordered during
pregnancy to assess the mother's health and identify any potential
risk factors.
• HIV Test: Human Immunodeficiency Virus screening performed
as part of the obstetric panel to detect HIV antibodies/antigens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 10 mL of venous blood collected in SST
(serum separator tube).
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens that could interfere with test results.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify all received specimens are correctly labeled with patient
identification, collection date, and time.
2. Ensure specimen integrity; reject hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. Document rejections appropriately.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Complete Blood Count (CBC):
◦ Reagents and Supplies: Hematology analyzer, appropriate
controls.
◦ Procedure:
▪ Mix the sample and load it into the hematology analyzer.
▪ Perform CBC as per the machine's operational
instructions.
▪ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Blood Type and Rh Factor:
◦ Reagents and Supplies: ABO/Rh typing kit, anti-A, anti-B,
anti-D reagents.
◦ Procedure:
▪ Label slides/tubes appropriately.
▪ Mix samples with typing reagents.
▪ Follow incubation and washing steps according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
▪ Read and record results in the LIS.
3. Antibody Screen:
◦ Reagents and Supplies: Panel cells, Coombs reagent.
◦ Procedure:
▪ Mix patient serum with panel cells.
▪ Incubate and perform Coombs testing as per established
guidelines.
▪ Document findings in the LIS.
4. Rubella IgG:
◦ Reagents and Supplies: Rubella IgG ELISA kit.
◦ Procedure:
▪ Run test according to the ELISA kit instructions.
▪ Read absorbance on a microplate reader.
▪ Calculate and document results based on the standard
curve.
5. Syphilis Test (RPR or Treponemal pallidum Antibody):
◦ Reagents and Supplies: RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) or
Treponemal antibody assay kit.
◦ Procedure:
▪ Follow specific test protocol (e.g., RPR card test or
ELISA).
▪ Document and record results in the LIS.
6. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg):
◦ Reagents and Supplies: HBsAg ELISA kit.
◦ Procedure:
▪ Execute according to the ELISA kit instructions.
▪ Document findings in the LIS.
*HIV Screening:
• Reagents and Supplies: HIV 1/2 Antigen/Antibody Combo assay
kit.
• Procedure:
◦ Perform assay according to the kit instructions, ensuring
reagents and specimens are brought to room temperature
before use.
◦ Analyze using an automated immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Record results in the LIS.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Review and validate results as per laboratory protocols.
2. Report critical results immediately to the ordering physician as
per established guidelines.
3. Ensure all results are accurately entered into the LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run appropriate controls with each batch of patient samples.
• Document and review all quality control data.
• Address control failures before processing patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Ensure all results are reviewed, verified, and appropriately
communicated to relevant healthcare providers.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS:
• Follow standard reference ranges as provided in each test kit’s
package insert.
• Refer to test-specific limitations as outlined in manufacturer
instructions.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for each test kit used.
• Laboratory policy and procedure manual.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and regulations.
