OCT-2 Immunostain Protocol - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standardized procedures
for the technical component of the OCT-2 immunostain, ensuring
accurate and reproducible test results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel responsible for
the preparation and staining of tissue slides for OCT-2
immunohistochemistry in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated histotechnologists and
laboratory staff to perform and document all procedures outlined in
this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this protocol and addressing any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Slide Preparation: Tissue sections should be 4-5 µm thick.
• Specimen Handling: Ensure proper identification of slides and
avoid cross-contamination.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
2. Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Slide warmer
◦ Immunostainer (automated or manual staining setup)
◦ Light microscope
3. Reagents:
◦ Primary antibody for OCT-2 (validated for
immunohistochemistry)
◦ Secondary antibody (conjugated with a detection system,
e.g., HRP)
◦ Detection kit (e.g., DAB substrate)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Hematoxylin for counterstaining
◦ Antigen retrieval solution (appropriate for the OCT-2
antibody)
◦ Buffer solutions (PBS or TBS)
◦ Blocking solution
4. Supplies:
◦ Glass slides
◦ Cover slips
◦ Absorbent materials
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Staining jars (if manual staining is performed)
5. PROCEDURE
6. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 µm tissue sections using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath and pick them up on glass
slides.
◦ Dry slides on a slide warmer at 60°C for at least 1 hour.
7. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene (2 changes, 5
minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%, and 50%) followed by rinsing in distilled water.
8. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using heat induction in an
appropriate antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH
6.0) for 20-30 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
9. Immunostaining:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity using 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 minutes.
◦ Apply a blocking solution for 10-20 minutes to prevent non-
specific binding.
◦ Incubate sections with the primary antibody for OCT-2 for
the time period and at the dilution recommended by the
manufacturer (typically 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C).
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
◦ Apply secondary antibody and incubate as per
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
◦ Apply the DAB substrate and incubate until the desired
intensity is observed (typically 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
10. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water and dehydrate through an ascending
alcohol series (50%, 70%, 95%, and 100%).
◦ Clear in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
11. Mounting:
◦ Mount coverslips onto the slides using a permanent
mounting medium.
12. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Ensure the positive control shows appropriate staining and the
negative control shows no staining.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS:
• Record all relevant details including date, time, reagent lot
numbers, and slide identifiers in the laboratory logbook.
• Document any deviations from the standard protocol and
corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• The stained slides will be reviewed by a pathologist.
• Pathology will be responsible for the interpretation and reporting
of the immunostaining results.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the primary and secondary
antibodies.
• Standard histopathology textbooks and guidelines.
This protocol ensures the consistent and reliable performance of
OCT-2 immunostain, aiding in the accurate diagnosis and research of
related diseases. Compliance with each step is critical for optimal
results.
