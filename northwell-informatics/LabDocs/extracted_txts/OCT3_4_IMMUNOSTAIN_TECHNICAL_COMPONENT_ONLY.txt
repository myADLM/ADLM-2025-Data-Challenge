Standard Operating Procedure
OCT3/4 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the technical component only
immunostain for OCT3/4 (OCTamer-binding transcription factor 3/4)
on tissue samples in a consistent, reliable, and validated manner
while ensuring quality control and accurate diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all trained laboratory personnel responsible for
performing OCT3/4 immunostaining within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
immunostaining procedure according to this SOP and maintaining
accurate documentation.
• Supervisors: Ensure technologists are properly trained, review
and approve staining results, and manage any deviations or
issues that arise during the process.
4. SPECIMENS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Specimen Storage:
◦ Store FFPE blocks at room temperature until ready for
sectioning and staining.
• Handling Time:
◦ Perform immunostain on freshly cut sections (within a week of
sectioning) to ensure optimal staining results.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• OCT3/4 primary antibody (ready-to-use or concentrate as per
vendor's recommendation)
• Secondary antibody polymer-HRP complex
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Counterstain (Hematoxylin)
• Positive control slide (tissue known to express OCT3/4)
• Negative control slide (tissue known to be negative for OCT3/4)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (absolute and graded series)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
6. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Staining racks
• Microscopic slides
• Hot plate or oven for slide drying
• Incubation chamber
• Light microscope
• Timer
• Staining jars
• Fume hood
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning:
1. Cut 4 µm thick sections from the FFPE tissue blocks using the
microtome.
2. Mount the sections onto positively charged glass slides.
3. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 30-60 minutes.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 4. Deparaffinize sections by
immersing slides in xylene for 5 minutes. Repeat this step twice. 5.
Rehydrate sections through graded ethanol concentrations:
• 100% ethanol for 5 minutes
• 95% ethanol for 5 minutes
• 70% ethanol for 5 minutes
1. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval: 7. Perform antigen retrieval using a citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for 20 minutes at 95-100°C in
a microwave or pressure cooker. 8. Allow slides to cool in the
retrieval buffer for 20 minutes at room temperature. 9. Rinse slides in
PBS for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining: 10. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by
incubating slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 minutes. 11.
Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes. 12. Apply primary antibody
(OCT3/4) to the sections and incubate for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C, as recommended by the antibody
manufacturer. 13. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes. 14. Apply
secondary antibody polymer-HRP complex and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature. 15. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
E. Detection and Counterstaining: 16. Apply DAB substrate to the
sections and monitor the color development under a microscope.
This typically takes 1-3 minutes. 17. Rinse slides in running tap
water. 18. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
19. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
F. Dehydration and Mounting: 20. Dehydrate sections through
graded ethanol concentrations: - 70% ethanol for 2 minutes - 95%
ethanol for 2 minutes - 100% ethanol for 2 minutes 21. Clear sections
in xylene, 2 changes for 5 minutes each. 22. Mount coverslips onto
the sections using a permanent mounting medium.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Ensure staining consistency by including a
known positive control tissue section.
• Negative Control: Verify specificity by including a known
negative control tissue section.
• Record all observations and deviations from the protocol.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps in the immunostaining process, including
sample ID, date, and initials of the technologist, in the
immunostain logbook.
• Record any issues encountered and corrective actions taken.
• Ensure QC results are recorded and reviewed by a supervisor.
10. REPORTING
• Only the technical component of the immunostain will be reported.
• Results are delivered to the pathologist for interpretation and
report generation.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for OCT3/4 antibody.
• Standard guidelines and literature on immunohistochemistry.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent
and reliable OCT3/4 immunostaining results, facilitating accurate
diagnostic interpretations by pathologists.
