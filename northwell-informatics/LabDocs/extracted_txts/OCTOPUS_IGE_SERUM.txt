Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: OCTOPUS, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results are generated for the
OCTOPUS, IgE, Serum tests by following a standardized procedure
from sample processing to result generation and reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP, performing the testing, and documenting results accurately.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and addressing any issues that may arise during the analytical
phase.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens Immulite)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Calibrated thermal cycler (if applicable)
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents:
◦ IgE Standards and Calibrators
◦ Control materials (positive and negative controls)
◦ Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
◦ Diluent
◦ Washing solutions
◦ Substrate solutions
◦ Reaction stop solution
◦ Deionized water
• Supplies:
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Laboratory notebooks or digital logs
◦ Labels and markers
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum collected in Serum Separator Tubes
(SST).
• Volume: 3-5 mL of serum is recommended.
• Stability: Serum must be analyzed within 48 hours if kept at
2-8°C or within 6 months if stored at -20°C or below.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps
1. Specimen Receipt:
◦ Verify the sample integrity, labeling, and requisition form
details.
◦ Log receipt date and time, and assign a unique identifier to
the sample.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the SST tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum into a labeled microcentrifuge
tube, avoiding contamination.
B. Analytical Steps
1. Instrument Set-Up
• Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the Immunoassay Analyzer using the manufacturer-
provided standards before running the test series.
◦ Ensure that all required reagents are loaded and within their
expiration dates.
• Quality Control:
◦ Run high and low control materials to verify assay
performance.
◦ Document control results and ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
2. Sample Analysis
• Pipetting:
◦ Add the required volume of serum sample to the designated
wells or cuvettes as per the analyzer’s protocol.
◦ Follow the analyzer's instructions for adding diluent, substrate
solutions, and other reagents.
• Incubation:
◦ Allow the reactions to incubate for the specified time at the
appropriate temperature according to the assay protocol.
• Detection:
◦ Measure the optical density or chemiluminescence signal
produced using the automated analyzer.
◦ The analyzer will process the signals and compute the IgE
concentration using the calibration curve.
C. Post-Analytical Steps
1. Result Verification:
◦ Verify all generated results for each patient sample.
◦ Compare results with quality control data to ensure
accuracy.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) or
laboratory notebook.
◦ Note any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure.
3. Result Reporting:
◦ Report results according to the established protocol.
◦ Critical results: Notify the physician or relevant medical
personnel immediately if critical values are observed.
4. Quality Assurance:
◦ Conduct monthly inter-laboratory comparisons and cross-
check results.
◦ Document and review any corrective actions taken for out-
of-range quality controls or calibration issues.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for the Immunoassay
Analyzer.
• Relevant Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are free from turbidity and hemolysis to prevent
interference.
• Accurate pipetting and timely processing are crucial for reliable
results.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, recalibrate the
analyzer and re-run controls.
• Check for proper maintenance and calibration of the analyzer and
other equipment regularly.
This SOP for the analytical phase of generating results for
OCTOPUS, IgE, and Serum helps ensure precision and consistency
in laboratory testing, maintaining high-quality standards and reliability.
