Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
OLANZAPINE (ZYPREXA)
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized protocol for the
quantification of Olanzapine (Zyprexa) in patient samples using
validated analytical methods. This protocol outlines the procedures
for sample preparation, analysis, and result reporting to ensure
consistent, accurate, and reliable analytical results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis according to this protocol.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to comply with these procedures
and alert a supervisor in case of any deviations or issues.
2. DEFINITIONS Olanzapine (Zyprexa) is an antipsychotic
medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is
quantified in patient samples such as serum/plasma to monitor
therapeutic levels and ensure patient safety.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in red-top tubes without gel
separators.
• Acceptable alternative: Plasma collected in EDTA or heparin-
containing tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum or plasma.
• Stability: Serum/plasma should be separated and frozen at -20°C
if not analyzed within 24 hours.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system.
• Olanzapine reference standard.
• Internal standard (if applicable).
• HPLC grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol).
• Mobile phase reagents.
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., centrifuge, pipettes, vials,
etc.).
• Calibration curves and quality control samples.
5. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum/plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Mix samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge samples at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
particulates.
4. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean vial for analysis.
B. Calibration Curve Preparation:
1. Prepare the olanzapine calibration standards by diluting the
reference standard in blank serum/plasma to achieve the
desired concentration range (e.g., 5 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL).
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentration levels within the calibration range.
3. Validate the calibration curve according to the laboratory’s
standard validation procedures.
C. HPLC/LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Condition the column with the mobile phase for 15-30 minutes.
3. Inject the calibration standards, QC samples, and patient
samples into the system.
4. Record the retention times and peak areas of olanzapine and
the internal standard.
5. Construct the calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratio
(olanzapine/internal standard) versus concentration.
6. Calculate the concentration of olanzapine in patient samples
using the calibration curve.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of the
analytical batch.
2. Accept the batch if the QC results are within acceptable limits.
3. If QC results are out of acceptable limits, investigate the cause,
and take corrective actions before reanalysis.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify and validate the analytical results using laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Report the concentration of olanzapine in ng/mL.
3. Include comments on the sample integrity if any issues were
observed during analysis (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: Typically between 20 to 80 ng/mL. Reference
ranges may vary depending on the clinical context.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to HPLC or LC-MS/MS method validation data for
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision.
• Note any potential interferences from other medications or
metabolites.

olanzapine in patient samples, contributing to effective patient
monitoring and management.
