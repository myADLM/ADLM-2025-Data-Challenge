Standard Operating Procedure: OLIG2 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for performing the technical component of
the OLIG2 immunostaining process, including preparation, staining,
and quality control, to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible for
following the OLIG2 immunostaining procedure as defined in this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the supervising pathologist to review
and interpret the stained slides.
2. DEFINITION:
OLIG2 is a marker used in immunohistochemistry to identify
oligodendrocytes and certain types of brain tumors. The
immunostaining process involves the application of specific
antibodies to tissue sections in order to visualize the presence of
OLIG2.
3. SPECIMEN:
Specimen type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections Specimen requirements: 4-5 micrometer thick sections
mounted on positively charged glass slides Unacceptable specimens:
Specimens that are improperly fixed, improperly processed, or have
tissue sections that are too thin or thick
4. PROCEDURE:
4.1. Reagents and Supplies:
• Primary antibody: OLIG2 antibody
• Secondary antibody: Biotinylated anti-rabbit/mouse IgG
• Detection system: DAB (Diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium: Aqueous or resin-based mounting media
• Buffer solutions: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS)
• Antigen retrieval solution: Citrate buffer or EDTA solution
• Reagent containers and appropriate pipettes
• Positive and negative control slides
4.2. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide stainer (automated or manual)
• Light microscope
• Incubator (37°C)
4.3. Preparation:
1. Prepare the required reagents and control slides.
2. Deparaffinize tissue sections in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes.
3. Rehydrate sections through graded alcohols (100%, 90%, 70%)
to distilled water.
4.4. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer or EDTA
solution).
2. Heat in a microwave or pressure cooker for 10-20 minutes,
depending on the buffer used.
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS or TBS.
4.5. Blocking:
1. Incubate sections with appropriate blocking solution (e.g.,
hydrogen peroxide) for 10 minutes to block endogenous
peroxidase activity.
2. Wash slides in PBS or TBS.
4.6. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply OLIG2 primary antibody to the tissue sections.
2. Incubate in a humidified chamber for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
3. Wash slides in PBS or TBS.
4.7. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the biotinylated secondary antibody.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Wash slides in PBS or TBS.
4.8. Detection:
1. Apply the DAB substrate solution and incubate for 5-10
minutes, monitoring the reaction closely.
2. Wash slides in distilled water.
4.9. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse sections in tap water and then blue in a weak ammonia
solution or running tap water.
4.10. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate tissue sections through graded alcohols to xylene.
2. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each staining run.
2. Evaluate the staining on control slides to ensure the assay is
working correctly.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. After staining, slides should be evaluated under a microscope
by a qualified pathologist.
2. Technical staff should record the staining run details including
reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and any observations.
