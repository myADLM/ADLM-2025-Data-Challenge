STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of oligoclonal bands
(OCBs) in serum using isoelectric focusing (IEF) and immunofixation
electrophoresis (IFE). The procedure is designed to identify the
presence of IgG OCBs indicative of certain neurological conditions,
including multiple sclerosis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the performance
of the procedure, quality control, and documentation of all relevant
data. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure adherence to this
procedure for the accuracy of test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Specimen handling: Centrifuge and separate serum from clot
within 2 hours of collection. Store serum at 2-8°C if testing will be
delayed beyond 48 hours. Specimens may be stored frozen at
-20°C or lower for extended periods.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Electrophoresis apparatus
• IEF gel plates
• Power supply for electrophoresis
• Incubator
• Refrigerator and freezer
Reagents:
• Isoelectric focusing gel (pH 3-10)
• Immunofixation reagents specific for IgG
• Staining and destaining solutions
• Control serum samples (positive and negative controls)
Supplies:
• Applicator strips
• Blotting paper
• Glass plates
• Plastic containers for immunofixation
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Gloves and lab coat for protection
1. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION OF SAMPLES AND CONTROLS
1. Thaw frozen serum samples, if applicable, and bring to room
temperature. Mix well.
2. Prepare control samples along with patient samples for
simultaneous analysis.
3. Load serum samples and controls (approximately 10 uL) onto
the isoelectric focusing gel using an applicator strip.
B) ISOELECTRIC FOCUSING (IEF) ELECTROPHORESIS
1. Place the loaded gel into the electrophoresis apparatus.
2. Set the power supply to the manufacturer's recommended
settings for IEF, typically 400-800 volts (~ 2 hours).
3. Once electrophoresis is complete, carefully remove the gel from
the apparatus.
C) IMMUNOFIXATION
1. Overlay the gel with nitrocellulose membrane or other suitable
transfer medium specific for proteins.
2. Allow antibodies to diffuse into the gel for a specified incubation
period (usually 1-2 hours at room temperature or as
recommended by the manufacturer).
3. Wash the blot to remove unbound antibodies and then apply
the immunofixation reagents to visualize the IgG bands.
D) STAINING AND DESTAINING
1. Stain the gel using appropriate staining solutions for protein
bands (e.g., Coomassie Blue or Silver Stain).
2. Destain to enhance contrast, ensuring clear visualization of the
oligoclonal bands.
E) READING AND INTERPRETATION
1. Examine the gel for the presence of OCBs in the patient serum.
Compare with the control samples.
2. Identify and quantify the presence of discrete bands, distinct
from the background pattern of polyclonal banding.
3. Document and interpret results in a laboratory information
system (LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of samples.
• Ensure the proper functioning of equipment and reagents by
appropriate calibration and validation.
• Document QC results and evaluate the acceptability of the
controls before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Validate and review results for completeness and accuracy.
3. Enter results into the LIS according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
4. Communicate clinically significant or critical findings to the
appropriate healthcare provider following standard protocols.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control samples do not produce expected results, repeat the
procedure.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and stored
correctly.
• Verify correct gel preparation and electrophoresis settings.
