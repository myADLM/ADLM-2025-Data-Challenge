Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Oligoclonal Banding, Serum, and Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE:
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for oligoclonal banding in serum and spinal fluid.
This procedure outlines the steps to ensure accurate and reliable
results, which are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring multiple
sclerosis and other neurological conditions.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform the oligoclonal banding analysis accurately and
in compliance with this SOP. This includes handling specimens,
performing assays, documenting results, and executing any
necessary troubleshooting.
1. DEFINITION:
Oligoclonal bands are immunoglobulin bands found in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and/or serum, often indicative of inflammation within the
central nervous system (CNS).
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Requirements and Handling:
• Serum: Collect a minimum of 1 mL of serum. Preferably use a
serum separator tube (SST). Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be
carried out within 48 hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C.
• Spinal Fluid (CSF): Collect a minimum of 1 mL of CSF in a sterile,
leak-proof container. Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be carried out
within 48 hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed serum or CSF samples.
• Specimens with visible contamination or particulate matter.
• Specimens not appropriately labeled with patient identification.
B. Equipment and Reagents:
• Isoelectric focusing (IEF) system with appropriate gel
electrophoresis apparatus.
• Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) reagents, including antisera
to IgG.
• Positive and negative control samples.
• Appropriate power supply for IEF and IFE procedures.
• Refrigerated centrifuge, micropipettes, and other standard
laboratory equipment.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Pre-Analysis Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum and CSF specimens at room temperature if
previously frozen.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any cellular debris.
2. Isoelectric Focusing (IEF):
◦ Load equal volumes (typically 10 μL) of serum and CSF
samples onto the IEF gel.
◦ Load positive and negative control samples as specified by
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform IEF according to the manufacturer's specifications
and recommended power settings.
3. Detection and Fixation:
◦ After IEF, perform immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) by
overlaying the gel with antisera to IgG.
◦ Incubate the gel as per the manufacturer's protocol ensuring
appropriate temperature and time conditions.
◦ Wash and stain the gel to visualize the bands.
4. Interpretation and Documentation:
◦ Examine the gel for the presence of oligoclonal bands.
Compare the banding patterns in the serum and CSF.
◦ Oligoclonal bands present in the CSF but absent in the
corresponding serum sample are indicative of an intrathecal
IgG synthesis.
◦ Document results on the appropriate report form, including
the number of bands and their intensity.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with every batch of tests
to ensure reliability and accuracy of results.
◦ Confirm the consistency of the results with the control
samples.
6. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
◦ Due to the clinical implications, ensure results are
communicated promptly to the requesting clinician.
◦ Negative results should be reported as "No oligoclonal
bands detected."
◦ Positive results should include the number of bands and a
comment regarding intrathecal IgG synthesis.
7. Troubleshooting:
◦ If artifacts or unexpected results occur, verify sample
integrity and repeat the assay with newly prepared samples.
◦ Consult the supervisor or a senior technologist in case of
persistent issues or inconsistencies.
D. Safety and Waste Disposal:
• Handle all specimens using appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) and under biosafety protocols.
• Dispose of biological waste and sharps in designated biohazard
containers according to institutional and regulatory guidelines.

• Instructions from the IEF and IFE kit manufacturers.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and monitoring of
neurological diseases involving intrathecal IgG synthesis.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
timely results for oligoclonal banding analysis, contributing to optimal
patient care and diagnostic accuracy.
