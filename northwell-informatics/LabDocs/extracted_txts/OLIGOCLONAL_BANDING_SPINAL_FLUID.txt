Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Oligoclonal Banding,
Spinal Fluid Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a standardized procedure for the detection of
oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum using
isoelectric focusing (IEF) followed by immunoblotting. The presence
of oligoclonal bands in CSF is an important diagnostic criterion for
diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).
Responsibility: All designated technical staff must follow this
protocol to ensure accurate and reliable test results. The supervisor
must ensure that the staff has the necessary training and that the
equipment is functioning correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Specimen Type:
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
• Serum
B. Collection and Handling:
• CSF: Collect 1-2 mL of CSF in a sterile container.
• Serum: Collect 3-5 mL of peripheral blood in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Both CSF and serum specimens should be collected
simultaneously or as closely in time as possible.
• Label specimens correctly with patient information and collection
dates/times.
• Transport specimens to the laboratory at 4°C immediately after
collection.
C. Storage:
• If analysis cannot be performed immediately, store specimens at
-20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) Gel System
• Immunoblotting apparatus
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagents for IEF and immunoblotting, including buffers and
staining solutions
• Gel electrophoresis chamber
• Transfer membrane (e.g., nitrocellulose or PVDF)
• Photodocumentation system
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Thaw CSF and serum specimens if frozen. Mix samples gently
to ensure homogeneity.
B. IEF Procedure:
1. Prepare the IEF gel according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Use an appropriate pH range gel for oligoclonal
banding (e.g., pH 5.0 to 8.0).
2. Load equal volumes (usually 5-10 µL) of CSF and serum into
separate wells.
3. Perform IEF according to the standard operating conditions
provided by the gel manufacturer. Monitor the progress of the
separation based on the expected duration and voltage.
C. Immunoblotting:
1. Prepare the blotting membrane and transfer buffers.
2. Transfer the proteins from the IEF gel to the blotting membrane
using the immunoblot apparatus according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Block the membrane with blocking buffer (e.g., 5% non-fat milk
in TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature.
4. Incubate the membrane with anti-human IgG (primary antibody)
diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hour.
5. Wash the membrane with TBST three times for 5 minutes each.
6. Incubate the membrane with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hour.
7. Wash the membrane with TBST three times for 5 minutes each.
8. Develop the blot using an appropriate chemiluminescent or
colorimetric substrate.
9. Visualize and document the bands using a photodocumentation
system.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the band patterns between the CSF and serum
samples:
◦ Oligoclonal bands present in the CSF but not in the serum:
positive for intrathecal IgG synthesis.
◦ Identical bands present in both CSF and serum: consider
systemic IgG production.
2. Record and interpret the results according to laboratory
reporting guidelines.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Include positive and negative control samples with each run:
• Positive control: A sample with known oligoclonal bands.
• Negative control: A sample devoid of oligoclonal bands.
B. Document QC results in the QC log and ensure they fall within
acceptable limits before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Document results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System). B.
Include findings such as the presence/absence of oligoclonal bands
and the pattern interpretation. C. Notify the attending physician
immediately if results are critical or unexpected.
