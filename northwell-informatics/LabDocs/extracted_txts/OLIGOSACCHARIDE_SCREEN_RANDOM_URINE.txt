Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for OLIGOSACCHARIDE
SCREEN, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of the
oligosaccharide screen in a random urine sample. This test is
performed to detect the presence of abnormal oligosaccharides,
which may indicate disorders such as lysosomal storage diseases.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out this
procedure. It is their responsibility to ensure all steps are followed
accurately and to report any anomalies or inconsistencies to a
supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Random urine sample.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 10 mL of urine.
• Specimen Collection:
◦ Patients must collect a random urine sample.
◦ The sample should be transported to the laboratory as quickly
as possible.
◦ If the sample arrival is expected to be delayed, it must be
refrigerated at 2-8°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Solvent extraction system
• Analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
system or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) setup
• Mobile phase solvents (acetonitrile, water, etc.)
• Reference standards for oligosaccharides
• Urine sample containers
• Centrifuge
• Vials and pipettes
• Calibration curves and control samples
• Logbook for recording results and incidents
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the random urine sample at 1500g for 10
minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean container using a
pipette.
2. Filtration and Dilution:
◦ Filter the supernatant using a 0.45 µm filter.
◦ If necessary, dilute the filtered sample with deionized water
to the required concentration for analysis.
B) Analysis Using HPLC:
1. System Setup:
◦ Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Calibrate the system using the reference standards for
oligosaccharides.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject an appropriate volume (typically 10-20 µL) of the
prepared urine sample into the HPLC system.
◦ Perform the injection in duplicate to ensure accuracy and
reliability.
3. Detection:
◦ Use a UV or RI detector to detect oligosaccharides.
◦ Record the chromatograms and identify peaks
corresponding to the oligosaccharides.
4. Comparison and Quantification:
◦ Compare the peaks against the reference standards to
identify the presence of specific oligosaccharides.
◦ Quantify the findings using a calibration curve.
C) Alternative TLC Method:
1. Plate Preparation and Sample Application:
◦ Prepare TLC plates by activating them in an oven at 100°C
for 30 minutes.
◦ Spot the prepared urine samples along with control and
standard samples on the TLC plate.
2. Development:
◦ Develop the plate in a suitable solvent system (e.g., butanol/
acetic acid/water).
◦ Allow the plate to develop until the solvent front reaches an
appropriate level.
3. Visualization and Identification:
◦ Dry the plate and visualize the spots using a suitable
staining method (e.g., naphthol/sulfuric acid).
◦ Compare the Rf values of the sample spots to those of the
standards to identify oligosaccharides.
6. RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings in the logbook.
◦ Include chromatograms, chromatographs, or TLC images as
appropriate.
2. Analysis:
◦ Flag any abnormal oligosaccharide patterns as indicative of
potential metabolic disorders.
◦ Verify the results with quality control samples to ensure
accuracy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the HPLC system or TLC setup using
reference standards at the start of each batch of samples.
2. Controls:
◦ Include blank and control samples with each run to validate
the procedure and results.
3. Maintenance:
◦ Follow routine maintenance procedures for the analytical
equipment.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Indicate any abnormalities and recommended follow-ups for the
physician.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a technologist before
being transmitted to the healthcare provider.
