Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for OLIVE-FOOD, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for conducting an analytical
test to determine the presence and concentration of
immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to olive-food allergens in serum
samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to
perform the testing according to this procedure, adhere to
quality control measures, document all steps, results, and any
deviations, and report significant findings to the supervising
authority.
3. DEFINITION:
IgE (Immunoglobulin E) is an antibody that plays a crucial role
in allergic reactions. The olive-food IgE test measures the
specific IgE antibodies to olive-food allergens in the patient's
serum.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum from venipuncture collected in
serum separator tubes (SST).
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
◦ Storage: Specimens should be processed and tested within
48 hours of collection; otherwise, they must be stored at
-20°C for long-term storage.
◦ Transport: Ensure samples are transported on ice packs or
dry ice as per specimen handling protocol.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Reader
◦ Calibrated micropipettes and tips
◦ IgE specific to olive-food allergen kit
◦ Wash buffers
◦ Incubators (37°C)
◦ Disposable gloves, lab coat, and appropriate PPE
◦ Timer
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw serum samples if previously frozen.
• Mix serum samples gently and centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulates.
• Aliquot required volume to clean, labelled tubes for testing.
B. ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Procedure:
Note: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions in the olive-food IgE
ELISA kit insert for detailed steps specific to the kit.
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Add 100 µL of each calibrated standard, control, and serum
samples into the designated wells of the coated microtiter
plate.
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive cover and incubate at 37°C for
30 minutes.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 4 times with the provided wash buffer to
remove unbound substances.
3. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-labeled anti-human IgE conjugate to
each well.
◦ Re-seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for another 30
minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step 4 times as outlined above.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Calculation and Interpretation:
• Generate a standard curve using the OD values of the calibration
standards.
• Calculate the concentration of olive-food specific IgE in the serum
samples based on the standard curve.
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Quality control samples (negative and positive controls)
must be included in each run.
◦ Review control results before validating patient results.
Results must be within predefined acceptance criteria
specified by the kit manufacturer.
2. RESULT REPORTING:
◦ Verify results in the LIS.
◦ Enter any necessary interpretation comments as per
laboratory directives.
◦ Generate reports and ensure they are communicated with
the supervising authority or clinical team according to
protocols.
3. REFERENCES:
◦ OLIVE-FOOD IgE ELISA Kit Manufacturer's instructions
◦ Current laboratory guidelines and policies on handling
Immunoassays and IgE testing.
4. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
◦ Follow all laboratory safety protocols including wearing
appropriate PPE.
◦ Handle all biological samples with care to prevent
contamination or exposure.
This SOP must be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to
accommodate any changes in technology, methodologies, or
laboratory policies.
