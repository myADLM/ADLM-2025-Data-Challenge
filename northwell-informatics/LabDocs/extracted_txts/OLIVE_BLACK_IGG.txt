Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for OLIVE BLACK IGG
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidelines for the processing, analysis, and
result generation of OLIVE BLACK IgG (Immunoglobulin G) samples
in the laboratory. The objective is to ensure accurate, reliable test
results while maintaining consistency and adhering to quality
standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the processing, analysis, and generation of OLIVE
BLACK IgG results as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of
all staff to identify any discrepancies or issues affecting test results
and notify the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum or plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized vacutainers.
• Ensure samples are labeled correctly with patient identification
and collection date/time.
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL of serum or plasma.
• Store samples at 2-8°C if analysis is within 72 hours. For longer
storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate or sodium fluoride tubes.
• Specimens with incomplete identification or without collection
date/time.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge blood samples to separate serum or plasma.
• Aliquot the separated serum/plasma into a new labeled tube if
required.
• Ensure samples are at room temperature prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated or manual IgG assay analyzer.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator and freezer for sample storage.
Reagents:
• OLIVE BLACK IgG assay kit, including all manufacturer-specified
controls and calibrators.
• Reagent storage conditions as indicated by the manufacturer.
Supplies:
• Microtubes, sample vials, and labels.
• Gloves and protective equipment.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform analyzer calibration using supplied calibrators according
to the manufacturer's protocol.
• Run quality control materials at least once per batch run or per
shift, and document control values.
• Ensure all QC results are within acceptance ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
B. Sample Analysis:
1. Prepare the analyzer by loading the OLIVE BLACK IgG assay
reagents and confirming the correct configuration.
2. Verify sample identification and prepare the samples for
analysis.
3. If using an automated analyzer:
◦ Load samples onto the analyzer as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Initiate the assay run and monitor the process.
4. If performing manual analysis:
◦ Use a pipette to transfer the required volume of sample and
reagents into labeled microtubes.
◦ Follow the assay instructions for incubation times and
temperatures.
◦ Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using a suitable
reader.
C. Interpretation and Result Generation:
• Calculate the OLIVE BLACK IgG concentration based on the
calibration curve and control values.
• Document all results appropriately in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results before reporting.
• Results must be cross-checked with quality control data to ensure
accuracy.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines and reference
intervals.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during analysis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals are specific to the test kit and should be
obtained from the manufacturer's insert.
• For OLIVE BLACK IgG: Refer to the assay kit documentation for
up-to-date reference ranges and interpretive criteria.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Maintain all QC logs, calibration records, and assay run reports
for audit purposes.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs as required.
• Review performance regularly to ensure continuous improvement.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If QC results are out of range, recheck calibrators and control
samples.
• Repeat the assay if necessary, or execute troubleshooting steps
as per the manufacturer’s manual.
• Notify the supervisor of persistent issues affecting test
performance and accuracy.
