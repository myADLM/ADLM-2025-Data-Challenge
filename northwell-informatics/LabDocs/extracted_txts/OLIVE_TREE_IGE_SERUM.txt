Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for OLIVE TREE, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the quantification of Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) specific to olive tree pollen allergens in serum samples.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of testing for Olive Tree-
specific IgE in serum samples using the specified instrumentation
and reagents.
3. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to ensure that
the tests are performed accurately, efficiently, and in compliance with
established procedures. Any deviations that may affect test results
should be immediately reported to the supervisor.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Serum
◦ Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL
◦ Specimens should be free from hemolysis and lipemia.
◦ Specimens must be properly labelled with patient identifiers.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens not properly labelled.
◦ Specimens with visible signs of contamination or physical
damage.
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulants such as EDTA or
citrate.
5. Reagents
• Commercially available Olive Tree (Ole e 1) IgE reagent kit.
• Calibrators and control materials supplied by the reagent
manufacturer.
• Deionized water for reconstitution as needed.
6. Instrumentation
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Alastat, or
equivalent).
• Refrigerator for storing reagents and samples at 2-8°C.
• Freezer for storing long-term serum samples at -20°C, if
necessary.
7. Calibrations and Controls
• Perform calibration with each new lot of reagents or as specified
by the manufacturer's instructions.
• Run appropriate controls (positive and negative) with each batch
of patient samples.
• Document and review control results to ensure they are within the
acceptable range.
8. Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature.
◦ Verify and record ambient temperature and humidity.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Centrifuge serum samples if not already separated to
remove any particulate matter.
◦ Aliquot the required volume of serum (usually 0.2 mL per
test) into appropriately labelled tubes.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated racks on the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument's procedure for loading reagents and
preparing the assay run.
4. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Monitor the assay process and the analyzer for any errors or
alerts.
5. Result Generation:
◦ At the completion of the assay run, the analyzer will display
the quantitative results in kU/L.
◦ Review the results for consistency with quality control and
calibrator values.
9. Interpretation of Results
• Results will be interpreted based on established reference ranges
and cut-off values provided by the reagent manufacturer.
• Common interpretation values:
◦ <0.35 kU/L: Negative (No significant allergen-specific IgE
detected)
◦ 0.35 - 0.69 kU/L: Borderline
◦ 0.70 - 3.49 kU/L: Low Level
◦ 3.50 - 17.49 kU/L: Moderate Level
◦ 17.50 - 49.99 kU/L: High Level
◦ ≥50 kU/L: Very High Level
10. Quality Control
• Review control results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range before reporting patient results.
• If controls fall outside the specified range, investigate and resolve
the issue before re-running samples.
11. Reporting Results
• Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and authorized by a certified
technologist.
• Note any deviations or unexpected findings in the patient's report
with appropriate comments.
12. Documentation
• Maintain records of all assay runs including calibrations, controls,
patient results, and any troubleshooting performed.
• Keep logs for equipment maintenance and environmental
conditions (temperature and humidity).
13. References
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) for the Olive Tree IgE
reagent kit.
• Laboratory's Quality Management System documentation.
14. Method Limitations
• Only serum should be used for this testing. Other specimens may
yield inaccurate results.
• Extremely high lipid levels or hemolysis can interfere with the
assay results.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s IFU for additional limitations and
specific details.
The adherence to this protocol ensures reliable and accurate results
for Olive Tree-specific IgE, supporting diagnostic and therapeutic
decisions related to allergies.
