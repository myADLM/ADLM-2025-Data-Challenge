Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
ONION, IgE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Onion Specific IgE (ONION) in serum
specimens. This includes detailed instructions on specimen handling,
equipment, reagents, testing procedures, quality control, and
reporting of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• The trained technologists are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any deviations or issues
encountered during the testing process to the supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the accuracy, reliability,
and timeliness of test results and for addressing any issues raised
by the staff.
3. DEFINITIONS
ONION – IgE specific to onion allergens. IgE – Immunoglobulin E, a
class of antibodies associated with allergic reactions.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: 5 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or a red stopper tube.
• Ensure the specimen is properly labeled with patient information
and collection time/date.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 1 year. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens with improper labeling or those stored beyond the
acceptable time frame.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators/Freezers
• IgE-specific ELISA analyzer
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• ONION-specific IgE ELISA kit
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, high)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Supplies:
• Microwell plates
• Plate seals
• Timer
• Sample diluents
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
2. Carefully transfer the serum into a clean secondary tube
without disturbing the clot.
3. Label the secondary tube with patient information.
B. ELISA Testing
1. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
beginning the assay.
2. Prepare the ELISA plate:
◦ Add the required amount of wash buffer to each well.
◦ Add appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into respective wells.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate as per the kit manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Wash the plate thoroughly with the wash buffer to remove any
unbound substances.
4. Add the enzyme-conjugated antibody specific for human IgE to
each well.
5. Incubate the plate for the specified time, ensuring it remains
covered and at the appropriate temperature.
6. After incubation, wash the plate again to remove unbound
conjugate.
7. Add substrate solution to each well and allow the color to
develop.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
9. Read the absorbance of each well using an ELISA plate reader
at the specified wavelength.
C. Result Calculation and Validation
1. Calculate the concentration of ONION-specific IgE in each
sample based on the absorbance values and the calibration
curve.
2. Validate the results by comparing them with the controls:
◦ Ensure control values fall within the established ranges.
◦ Flag and investigate any deviations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform quality control with each batch of assays using high,
medium, and low control samples.
• Review QC data to identify trends or shifts that may indicate
problems with the assay system or reagents.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure the accuracy
of results.
• Document and review proficiency testing results and take
corrective action if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the patient-specific ONION IgE results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
releasing them to the clinician.
• Critical results should be promptly communicated to the
requesting physician, following your laboratory's critical value
reporting policy.
