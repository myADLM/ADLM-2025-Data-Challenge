Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Onion IgG
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedures involved in the analytical phase of
generating results for Onion IgG testing in the laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the testing procedures, data analysis, and result reporting
accurately and efficiently according to the defined protocol. Staff and
supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all procedures are
followed correctly and for identifying any deficiencies that may affect
laboratory test results.
1. DEFINITION
Onion IgG is an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody test used to detect
an immune response to onion allergens. The purpose of the testing is
to identify patients who may have sensitivities or allergic reactions to
onion.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma samples collected in EDTA or SST tubes.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA or SST.
• Specimens without proper labeling or collection date/time.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, specimens must be frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit specific for Onion IgG (manufacturer-specific details)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microplate reader
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• SST or EDTA blood collection tubes
• Deionized water
• Absorbent paper
• Gloves and laboratory coat
1. PROCEDURE
a) Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen samples if applicable and centrifuge at 2000-2500
RPM for 10 minutes.
• Mark and label each sample accordingly for tracking during the
analysis.
b) ELISA Assay:
• Prepare reagents and microplate as per ELISA kit instructions.
• Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to
designated wells on the microplate.
• Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
• Incubate the microplate at room temperature for 60 minutes while
gently shaking.
• Wash the microplate three times with wash buffer provided in the
ELISA kit.
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate the microplate in the dark for 15 minutes.
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
• Read absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
c) Data Analysis:
• Calculate the Onion IgG concentrations using a standard curve.
• Perform data analysis and validation as per manufacturer's
instructions.
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative controls provided by the ELISA kit.
• Ensure that quality control readings fall within established ranges
before accepting patient results.
• Document all quality control data and any corrective actions
taken.
• Perform proficiency testing regularly to ensure accuracy and
precision of results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results for accuracy.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
• Critical results should be communicated promptly to the
requesting healthcare provider.
• Document all results and communications in the LIS.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific ELISA kit insert for limitations on sensitivity,
specificity and potential interferences.
