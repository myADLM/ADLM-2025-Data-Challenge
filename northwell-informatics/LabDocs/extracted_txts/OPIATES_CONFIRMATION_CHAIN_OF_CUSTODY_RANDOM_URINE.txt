Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Opiates Confirmation Results, Chain of Custody,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the confirmation of opiates in
urine samples under the requirements of Chain of Custody (CoC)
with random selection ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of urine samples that have
been collected for the purpose of confirming the presence of opiates
in a CoC random testing context.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP to ensure accurate and confirmed results for opiates in urine
samples. This includes sample preparation, analysis, and
documentation of results.
4. DEFINITIONS
Chain of Custody (CoC): A process used to maintain and document
the chronological history of the sample.
Opiates: Substances typically included in urine opiates confirmation
testing, such as morphine, codeine, heroin, and related metabolites.
Random Testing: Samples selected without a pre-identified pattern or
order, ensuring unbiased selection.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 30 mL freshly voided urine collected in a sterile container.
• Sample should be kept at a temperature of 2-8°C for preservation
and transported to the laboratory within 24 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples without proper identification or CoC forms.
• Samples that are not properly refrigerated or exceed 24-hour time
frame before testing.
6. EQUIPMENT & MATERIALS
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
• Sterile urine containers.
• Chain of Custody forms.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
• Refrigeration unit.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Receiving Samples:
◦ Upon receipt, verify each sample against the CoC
documentation to ensure integrity and proper labeling.
◦ Document the receipt of samples in the CoC logbook,
including date, time, and initials of the receiving staff
member.
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C if analysis is not to be performed
immediately.
2. Processing Samples:
◦ Assign a unique laboratory accession number to each
sample.
◦ Log the sample details into the Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS).
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow the urine samples to reach room temperature if
refrigerated.
◦ Pipette an aliquot of urine (usually 1-2 mL) into a labeled
sample preparation vial.
◦ Perform an initial immunoassay screening to identify
presumptive positives for opiates.
4. Confirmation Analysis:
◦ Confirm presumptive positive results using GC-MS or LC-
MS/MS:
1. Prepare samples according to the instrument-specific
protocol, which may include steps such as hydrolysis,
solid-phase extraction (SPE), or liquid-liquid
extraction.
2. Load sample aliquots onto the analytical instrument.
3. Run internal standards and controls alongside the
samples to ensure accurate quantification.
4. Analyze the chromatograms and mass spectrometry
data to identify and quantify specific opiates and their
metabolites.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Run known negative and positive control samples with each
batch of urine samples to ensure method accuracy and
precision.
◦ Document the results of control samples in the QC log.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS according to the
manufacturer’s instructions prior to analysis.
◦ Verify calibration by running calibration standards and
checking the calibration curve.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Review:
◦ Review all analytical data, checking for compliance with
quality control criteria.
◦ Interpret results based on retention times and mass spectra
matching with certified reference materials.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record final confirmed results in the LIMS.
◦ Ensure CoC documentation accompanies results throughout
the process.
3. Result Communication:
◦ Report confirmed opiate results to the appropriate authority
specified in the CoC documentation.
◦ Ensure confidentiality in the reporting process.
10. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to laboratory safety protocols and use PPE as necessary.
• Follow all regulatory guidelines for handling biological specimens
and controlled substances.
• Maintain documentation for audits and inspections.
