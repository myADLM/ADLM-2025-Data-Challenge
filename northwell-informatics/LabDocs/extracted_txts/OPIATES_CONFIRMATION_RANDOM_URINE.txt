Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Opiates Confirmation,
Random, Urine – Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for confirmation of opiates in
random urine specimens to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analysis as outlined in this
procedure and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the test
results. It is the responsibility of the supervisors to monitor
compliance with the procedure and address any issues that
may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Type: Random urine Preferred
Volume: Minimum 10 mL Stability: Specimens should be
refrigerated at 4-8°C if not analyzed immediately and analyzed
within 72 hours of collection. Unacceptable Specimens:
Specimens that are improperly labeled, have insufficient
volume, or are stored improperly.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Instrumentation:
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) Reagents: Calibration standards, internal standards,
extraction solvents, mobile phase solvents Supplies: Solid-
phase extraction cartridges, centrifuge tubes, pipettes, sample
vials, gloves
5. PROCEDURE A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and
Quality Controls • Prepare calibration standards and quality
control samples according to manufacturer’s instructions. •
Include at least one blank, low-level, mid-level, and high-level
control with each batch of specimens analyzed.
B. Sample Preparation • Confirm the identity and integrity of the
specimen. • Aliquot 1-5 mL of urine into a labeled centrifuge tube. •
Add internal standards to each specimen. • Precondition solid-phase
extraction cartridges according to manufacturer’s instructions. • Load
urine samples onto the cartridges. • Wash cartridges with appropriate
solvents. • Elute opiates from the cartridges using the designated
elution solvent. • Dry the eluate under nitrogen and reconstitute in
mobile phase solvent. • Transfer reconstituted sample to a labeled
LC-MS/MS vial.
C. Instrument Setup and Analysis • Follow manufacturer’s
instructions for instrument setup, including calibration of the LC-MS/
MS. • Load vials into the auto-sampler. • Perform the
chromatographic separation under the specified conditions. • Analyze
samples using LC-MS/MS. • Verify retention times and ion
fragmentation patterns are consistent with those in the calibration
standards.
D. Data Analysis and Result Reporting • Analyze chromatograms and
mass spectra of each sample. • Confirm the presence of opiates by
comparing sample mass spectra to those of the calibration
standards. • Quantify opiates based on the calibration curve. •
Review and verify the accuracy of the results. • Enter results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL • Analyze quality control samples with
each batch to ensure the accuracy and precision of the test. •
Review quality control results for compliance with defined limits.
• Implement corrective action in the event of quality control
failure.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for
specific limitations and interferences. Data generated outside of
the validated range should be interpreted with caution.

instrumentation and reagents.
This SOP for the confirmation of opiates in random urine specimens
using LC-MS/MS must be followed precisely to ensure reliable and
accurate test results. Staff must be trained in all procedures and
safety protocols related to the handling of specimens and operation
of analytical equipment.
