1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required for the quantitative
analysis of opiates in serum or plasma samples. The objective is to
ensure accurate and reliable test results in compliance with CLIA
regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel responsible for conducting serum or plasma
opiates quantification must be trained and demonstrate proficiency in
this procedure. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to this SOP and documenting corrective actions when
necessary.
3. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the quantification of opiates including
morphine, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other specific
opiates as requested, in serum or plasma samples.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in an EDTA or
heparin tube.
Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
Stability: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7
days. For extended storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate (grey-top tubes).
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
appropriate detection capability (e.g., mass spectrometry).
• Centrifuge for serum or plasma separation.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Calibration standards and quality control (QC) materials.
• HPLC-grade solvents and reagents.
• Column specific for opiate separation.
• Laboratory glassware and consumables (e.g., vials, syringes).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Reagents and Calibration Standards
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare a series of calibration standards at known
concentrations covering the expected range of analyte
concentrations.
◦ Utilize quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations to ensure accuracy and linearity.
2. Preparation of Mobile Phase and Reagents:
◦ Prepare the mobile phase according to the instrument's
protocol, using HPLC-grade solvents.
◦ Degas the mobile phase before use.
6.2 Sample Preparation
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge serum or plasma samples at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate cellular components.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean vial.
2. Protein Precipitation:
◦ To remove proteins, mix 200 µL of serum or plasma with 400
µL of acetonitrile.
◦ Vortex sample for 30 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC vial.
6.3 Instrument Setup and Analysis
1. HPLC Setup:
◦ Ensure the HPLC system is clean and functioning properly.
◦ Install the analytical column appropriate for opiate
separation.
2. Calibration and QC Check:
◦ Calibrate the instrument with prepared calibration standards.
◦ Run QC samples before analyzing patient samples to
ensure the system is within acceptable performance criteria.
3. Injection and Analysis:
◦ Inject a defined volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the prepared sample
into the HPLC system.
◦ Use gradient or isocratic elution as per the optimized
method for opiate separation.
◦ Monitor the detector output and record peak areas.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of opiates in the patient samples
using the calibration curve.
◦ Verify that the QC samples meet acceptance criteria.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Review the data for any inconsistencies or deviations.
◦ Results must be verified by a qualified individual before final
reporting.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples.
◦ Document and investigate any QC failures.
2. Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance on the HPLC system as per
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Document all maintenance activities in the instrument log.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may affect the accuracy
of results.
• Specimens outside the stability period may result in degradation
of target analytes.

11. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all specimens, calibration standards, QC samples, and
maintenance activities are properly documented.
