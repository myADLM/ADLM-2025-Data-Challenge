Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase: Generating Results for Opiates in Umbilical
Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for testing umbilical cord
tissue for opiates. It includes specimen handling, preparation,
processing, analysis, and generating results to ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out the
analytical procedures as described in this SOP. It is the responsibility
of laboratory supervisors to ensure adherence to the protocol and
address any issues that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh umbilical cord tissue, minimum of 10 cm in length, collected
at birth.
• Specimen must be placed in a sterile container without any
preservatives.
• Specimens should be refrigerated immediately and transported to
the laboratory within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection.
• Specimens with visible contamination or decomposition.
• Specimens received in containers with preservatives or other
additives.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile scalpel or scissors
• Weighing scale
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Thermo Fisher Scientific TSQ Quantis Triple Quadrupole Mass
Spectrometer
• Methanol, acetonitrile, and water (HPLC grade)
• Deuterated internal standards for opiates
• Calibration standards for opiates
• SPE (Solid Phase Extraction) columns
• Sample tubes
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, log the specimen details (collection time,
description, and condition) in the lab database.
2. Weigh the umbilical cord segment and record the weight.
3. Cut the cord into small pieces using sterile scissors and place
the pieces in a homogenization tube.
4. Add methanol to the tube to facilitate homogenization –
approximately 3 mL per gram of tissue.
5. Use the vortex mixer to homogenize the tissue for 5 minutes.
6. Centrifuge the homogenate at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate solids from the liquid extract.
B) Sample Extraction:
1. Prepare the SPE column according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Load the liquid extract onto the SPE column and allow it to pass
through under gravity.
3. Wash the column with water followed by methanol to remove
non-target compounds.
4. Elute the opiates from the SPE column with acetonitrile.
C) Analytical Testing:
1. Add deuterated internal standards to the extracted sample.
2. Prepare calibration standards for the opiates being tested (e.g.
morphine, codeine).
3. Program the TSQ Quantis Triple Quadrupole Mass
Spectrometer according to the opiate panel, including retention
times and quantification parameters.
4. Inject the sample extracts and calibration standards into the
mass spectrometer.
5. Run the analysis and acquire data for the presence and
concentration of opiates.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Review the mass spectrometer output for each sample.
2. Calculate the concentration of opiates based on the calibration
curves.
3. Verify the results against internal quality controls and
standards.
4. Repeat the analysis if necessary to ensure accuracy.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Document the opiate concentrations in the lab information
system (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results before generating the final report.
3. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines
and flag any critical values.
4. Ensure proper documentation of any observations or deviations
encountered during testing.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality controls using known positive and negative
samples.
• Verify the calibration standards with each batch of samples.
• Ensure instrument maintenance and calibration is up to date.
• Review and document all quality control results to confirm
compliance.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Further analysis and established reference intervals must be referred
to in consultation with clinical experts and based on validated
methods.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Reference the instrument manual and opiate testing kit inserts for
specific assay limitations.
