Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) – Analytical Phase for
Generating Opiates Results in Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
accurate and reliable results for opiates in urine samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis of opiates in urine samples according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring proper training of staff,
reviewing results, and overseeing the implementation of
corrective actions when required.
2. DEFINITION
Opiates are a class of narcotic drugs that include natural, synthetic,
and semi-synthetic substances derived from opium poppy or created
to mimic opium-like effects. Common opiates include morphine,
codeine, and heroin.
3. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Freshly voided urine (minimum volume 10 mL) collected in a
clean, dry container and sent to the laboratory within 6 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 6 hours after
collection unless properly preserved (e.g., in BD Vacutainer
Urinalysis Preservative Conical Urine Tube).
• Specimens without a recorded collection date/time on the sample
container or requisition.
• Specimens that are suspected of tampering or contamination.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzer for opioid testing or alternate manual
methods.
• Calibrated traceable thermometers for validating the temperature
of instruments.
• Urine cups and BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Conical
Urine Tubes.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for laboratory staff.
• Quality control materials (Negative and Positive controls).
• Opiate testing reagents (test strips, ELISA kits, etc.).
5. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling:
• Verify the specimen for proper labeling and adherence to
acceptable criteria.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if immediate testing is not possible.
Ensure specimens are brought to room temperature prior to
analysis.
Preparation:
• Prepare the workspace, ensuring all equipment is calibrated and
functional.
• Put on appropriate PPE for handling biological specimens.
Testing Procedure:
Automated Method:
1. Load the urine samples into the automated analyzer according
to manufacturer guidelines.
2. Follow the automated analyzer's software protocol for opiate
analysis.
3. Review results generated by the analyzer for validity.
Manual Method:
1. Completely immerse the reagent strip in the urine sample and
remove immediately to avoid dissolution of reagents.
◦ Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to remove
excess urine.
2. Start the timer immediately after immersion.
3. Read each pad at the time specified by the manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring accurate color matching.
◦ If the color is outside the expected range, report ‘No result
due to interference.’
Quality Control:
• Run quality control materials (negative and positive controls) with
every batch of samples.
• Document QC results, ensuring they are within acceptable
ranges. If QC fails, identify the source of error and take corrective
actions before proceeding.
Reporting Results:
• Review the generated results to ensure accuracy.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
including any notes about abnormalities or test interferences.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
Reference Intervals: Refer to method-specific package inserts for
reference intervals for opiate levels.
Quality Control:
1. Run controls at the start of each testing shift and record results.
2. Prepare control samples (Biorad Liquichek Urinalysis or similar)
according to manufacturer's instructions.
3. Record control data on the QC log and review for any
deviations.
4. Accept or reject patient results based on QC outcome.
Limitations: Refer to method-specific documentation for limitations
related to individual opiate testing reagent pads or methods.
References:
• Manufacturer’s package insert for automated analyzer or test
strips.
• Laboratory operational manuals for supplemental procedures and
guidelines.
6. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
If specimen integrity or control results are questionable:
• Investigate and document the root cause.
• Perform reanalysis if required.
• Notify the supervisor and involve them in necessary corrective
measures.
Ensuring these procedures are followed precisely helps in
maintaining the integrity of opioid testing results, thereby offering
reliable data for clinical or forensic use.
