STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE OPIATE CONFIRMATION,
CHAIN OF CUSTODY, MECONIUM
1. PURPOSE This document provides the Standard Operating
Procedures (SOP) for the analytical phase for the detection and
confirmation of opiates in meconium samples while ensuring
the chain of custody is maintained. This includes procedures for
the proper handling, processing, analysis, and result verification
of meconium samples.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of meconium samples for the confirmation of
opiates. It is critical to maintain chain of custody to ensure the
integrity of the sample and results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel
to follow the procedures outlined in this document to ensure
accurate, reliable, and timely results. Additionally, personnel
must ensure chain of custody protocols are strictly adhered to.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage for samples
• Analytical balance
• Appropriate LIMS software
• Traceable standards and controls
• Chain of Custody forms
• Labels and tamper-evident seals
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Handle all reagents and chemicals according to their Material
Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Meconium sample: Minimum of 1g collected in a sterile container.
• Samples must be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Meconium samples must be clearly labeled with patient
information and date/time of collection.
1. CHAIN OF CUSTODY
• Document the transfer of the sample using Chain of Custody
(COC) forms.
• All personnel handling the sample must sign and date the COC
form.
• Ensure tamper-evident seals are placed on the sample
containers.
• Store samples in a secure, locked area with restricted access.
1. PROCEDURES 8.1. Sample Preparation and Extraction
• Record the receipt of the sample in the laboratory's LIMS.
• Verify sample integrity and documentation. Note any
discrepancies.
• Weigh an appropriate amount of meconium (0.1g - 0.2g) for
analysis.
• Add internal standards to the sample.
• Utilize solvent extraction procedures to isolate opiates from the
sample matrix.
• Centrifuge the sample to separate solids from the liquid phase.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and dry under nitrogen.
• Reconstitute the dried residue in an appropriate solvent for
analysis.
8.2. Instrument Calibration and Quality Control
• Calibrate the GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS according to
manufacturer guidelines.
• Run quality control (QC) samples with each batch of patient
samples.
• Acceptable calibration and QC results must be documented
before proceeding with sample analysis.
8.3. Analysis
• Inject prepared samples into the GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS
system.
• Follow instrument-specific settings and parameters for opiate
analysis.
• Record and save all chromatograms and spectra.
8.4. Data Analysis and Interpretation
• Identify target opiates using retention times and mass spectral
data.
• Quantify opiates using the calibration curve.
• Verify the results by comparing to the QC samples.
• Review all data for accuracy and consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the LIMS system.
• Verify and approve results by a qualified personnel.
• Generate and provide a report including quantitative results,
interpretation, and any recommendations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the analytical
equipment.
• Ensure all QC measures are within acceptable limits.
• Document all QC activities and results.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all COC forms, analytical data, and QC documentation
according to laboratory policy.
• Ensure records are stored securely and are accessible only to
authorized personnel.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference intervals and cut-off values for opiate confirmation
as established by laboratory standards and guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
• The analysis is limited by the detection capabilities of the
analytical instrument.
• Potential for interference from other substances present in the
meconium.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer instructions for GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS
equipment.
• Current laboratory guidelines for opiate confirmation.
• Relevant scientific literature on meconium analysis and opiate
detection.
1. REVISIONS
• SOP to be reviewed and updated annually or as required to
maintain compliance with regulatory and accreditation
requirements.
