Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Opiate Confirmation in
Meconium
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized
procedures for the confirmation of opiate presence in meconium
samples using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).
The protocol ensures accurate and reliable results while maintaining
compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the analytical procedures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP
and addressing any issues that may arise during the process.
3. DEFINITIONS
• GC-MS: Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, an analytical
method for separating and quantifying compounds.
• Meconium: The earliest stool of an infant.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: At least 5 grams of meconium.
• Handling and Storage: Store meconium at -20°C if analysis is
delayed beyond 24 hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• GC-MS system
• Opiate reference standards (e.g., morphine, codeine, heroin, 6-
acetylmorphine)
• Quality control materials
• Derivatizing agent (e.g., BSTFA + 1% TMCS)
• Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, chloroform)
• Glassware (e.g., vials, columns)
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Nitrogen gas
6. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Calibration and Quality Control
◦ Prepare calibration standards at appropriate concentrations.
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and
end of each batch to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Extraction
◦ Weigh approximately 1 gram of thawed meconium into a
clean glass vial.
◦ Add internal standard and mix thoroughly.
◦ Add appropriate organic solvent (e.g., methanol) to the
meconium sample, vortex for 2 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at ≥ 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean vial.
3. Derivatization
◦ Evaporate the solvent under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas
at 40°C.
◦ Add derivatizing agent (e.g., BSTFA + 1% TMCS) to the dry
residue.
◦ Heat the vial at 70°C for 30 minutes.
B. ANALYTICAL RUN
1. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
◦ Set the GC-MS conditions as specified:
▪ Injection temperature: 250°C
▪ Column temperature program: ramp from 60°C to 300°C
at 10°C/min
▪ Carrier gas: helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min
▪ MS ionization: Electron ionization (EI)
◦ Inject the derivatized sample (e.g., 1 µL) into the GC-MS.
◦ Record the retention times and mass spectra of the analytes
and internal standards.
2. Data Analysis
◦ Analyze the data using appropriate software.
◦ Confirm the presence of opiates by comparing retention
times and mass spectra with reference standards.
◦ Quantify the opiates using the internal standard method.
◦ Save and document chromatograms and spectra.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND REPORTING
• Review the full chain of custody and quality control samples to
ensure the reliability of results.
• If the QC samples are outside acceptance criteria, investigate and
rectify any issues before reporting patient results.
• Properly document all findings and results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed by a qualified person before releasing. Any
critical results must be verified and, if necessary, repeated.
• Report opiate concentrations in ng/mL along with appropriate
interpretive comments.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
• Be aware of possible interferences from other substances present
in meconium.
• Note any overlap in retention times or mass spectra that may
cause false positive or negative results.
10. REFERENCES
• Follow guidelines from the instrument manufacturer’s manual.
• Refer to published scientific literature and regulatory guidelines
for specific detailed procedural standards.
11. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to laboratory safety
protocols.
• Handle chemicals and reagents in compliance with laboratory
safety policies.
