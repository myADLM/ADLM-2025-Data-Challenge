Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase -
Generation of Results for ORANGE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the accurate and
efficient processing of ORANGE, IGE, SERUM specimens to
generate reliable analytical results for clinical decision-making.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this procedure as outlined. It is the responsibility of all staff
to identify any deficiencies and notify the supervisor. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the procedure and
addressing any issues that may arise.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to the analytical phase of
testing ORANGE, IGE, SERUM specimens in the laboratory.
2. SPECIMEN AND HANDLING
Acceptance Criteria: - Serum collected in clot activator tubes (e.g.,
SST, red-top tubes) - Specimens should be stored between 2-8°C
and analyzed within 7 days of collection. - Specimen volume should
be at least 1 mL.
Rejection Criteria: - Hemolyzed specimens - Improperly labeled
specimens - Specimens not meeting the required volume -
Specimens that are more than 7 days old or improperly stored.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
Equipment: - Centrifuge - Serum separator tubes - Refrigerated
storage units - ORANGE/IGE specific automated analyzer (e.g.,
Fluorimetric analyzer) - Pipettes and pipette tips
Reagents and Supplies: - Calibration standards for ORANGE, IGE
assays - Quality control materials (low, medium, and high levels) -
Sample diluent - Wash buffer - Detection reagents - Test cartridges or
microplates as applicable
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Preparation: 1. Centrifuge the specimen tubes at 3000
rpm for 10 minutes to separate the serum from the blood cells. 2.
Transfer the serum carefully into labeled secondary tubes, avoiding
contamination and hemolysis.
Calibration and Quality Control: 1. Perform calibration of the analyzer
with appropriate standards according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 2. Analyze quality control materials (low, medium, and
high levels) alongside the patient specimens to ensure the accuracy
and precision of the assay.
Specimen Analysis: 1. Load the serum samples onto the ORANGE/
IGE specific automated analyzer using appropriate test cartridges or
microplates. 2. Input sample information into the analyzer’s system or
LIS, as required. 3. Run the analysis according to the instrument-
specific protocols provided by the manufacturer.
Result Validation and Verification: 1. After the completion of the
analysis, retrieve and review the results generated by the analyzer. 2.
Compare quality control results with predetermined acceptable
ranges. If QC is out of range, check and troubleshoot the analyzer
before proceeding. 3. Validate the patient results by ensuring they are
within the assay’s reportable range and meet quality standards.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified
by a qualified technologist.
◦ Report critical values immediately to the responsible
healthcare provider as per protocol.
◦ Record results in patient records, ensuring accuracy and
confidentiality.
2. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
◦ If sample integrity is in question (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia),
perform a visual assessment and note any discrepancies.
◦ Run a small aliquot on another analyzer if available or follow
internal protocols for confirmation.
◦ Use professional judgment when reporting such results and
document any deviations in the patient report.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the analyzer
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons to maintain accuracy and reliability.
◦ Document and review any deviations or incidents affecting
the analytical process, and take appropriate corrective
actions.
