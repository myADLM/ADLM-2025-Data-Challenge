Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ORANGE IGG
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions on the analytical procedures
required to generate accurate and reliable results for the ORANGE
IGG (Immunoglobulin G) assay in the laboratory. It ensures
consistency, reliability, and compliance with CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
ORANGE IGG assay and documenting results according to this
procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deviations
or issues that may affect test results and inform the supervisor
immediately.
1. DEFINITION
The ORANGE IGG assay is a serological test used to quantify the
concentration of Immunoglobulin G in serum or plasma specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ORANGE IGG Reagent Kit
◦ Calibrators and Controls
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Conjugate solution
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Specimen collection tubes (SST or heparinized)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm)
• Microplate washer
• Timer
• Laboratory bench with storage at room temperature (20-25°C)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh serum or plasma specimens collected in SST or
heparinized tubes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride, or EDTA
tubes.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or have no collection
date/time.
Note: After collection, centrifuge samples within 2 hours and separate
serum/plasma. Store at 2-8°C if testing is not performed immediately.
Samples are stable for up to 7 days refrigerated or 6 months frozen
at -20°C.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation: 1.1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room
temperature before use. 1.2. Prepare the microplate by adding
calibrators, controls, and patient specimens to designated wells
according to the ORANGE IGG Reagent Kit insert.
3. Assay Procedure: 2.1. Pipette 100 µL of each calibrator,
control, and specimen into the assigned microwells. 2.2. Add
100 µL of Conjugate solution to each well. 2.3. Incubate the
plate at room temperature for 30 minutes. 2.4. Wash the plate 5
times with the Wash buffer using the microplate washer. 2.5.
Add 100 µL of Substrate solution to each well. Incubate for 15
minutes at room temperature in the dark. 2.6. Add 100 µL of
Stop solution to each well. Mix by gently tapping the plate. 2.7.
Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the Stop solution.
4. Quality Control: 3.1. Run at least two levels of control with
each assay to ensure assay performance. 3.2. Document the
control results and ensure they are within the specified ranges
before reporting patient results.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Data Interpretation: 1.1. Generate a standard curve using the
absorbance values of the calibrators. 1.2. Determine the
concentration of IgG in patient specimens by interpolating from
the standard curve.
7. Reporting: 2.1. Review and verify the patient results against
control performance. 2.2. Report the verified results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) according to site-specific
guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range for ORANGE IGG: 700 – 1600 mg/dL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ORANGE IGG Reagent Kit insert for limitations of the
assay, including potential interferences from hemolytic, lipemic, or
icteric samples.
