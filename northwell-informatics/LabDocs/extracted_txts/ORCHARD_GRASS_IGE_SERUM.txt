Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measurement of
Orchard Grass, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a step-by-step
guide for the measurement of specific IgE antibodies against Orchard
Grass in human serum. This testing is intended for the diagnosis of
allergic reactions to Orchard Grass.
2. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to the analytical phase of
laboratory testing for specific IgE antibodies to Orchard Grass using
serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the Medical Laboratory
Scientists (MLS) to perform this assay, record the results, and ensure
the quality and accuracy of the data. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP and for addressing
any issues that arise during testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 4.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum, free from hemolysis and lipemia.
• A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required for testing.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 48 hours or frozen and thawed more than once.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer specific for IgE measurements (e.g.,
Phadia ImmunoCAP, TOSOH AIA, or equivalent).
• Specific IgE test reagents and controls for Orchard Grass
(commercially available kits).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C).
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles.
• Laboratory timer.
6. REAGENTS AND CALIBRATORS
• Orchard Grass, IgE reagents.
• Calibration standards for specific IgE.
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high).
• Dilution buffer.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation:
1. Review and verify the test requisition form.
2. Ensure that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within
their expiration dates and have been stored properly.
7.2 Calibration:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using approved calibration
standards.
2. Record calibration data in the calibration log.
7.3 Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each testing
day or batch, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Verify that control results fall within established ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document QC results in the QC log.
7.4 Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. Mix specimens thoroughly by gentle inversion or vortexing.
3. Centrifuge samples at 1000-1500g for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
4. Transfer supernatant to a clean tube for analysis.
7.5 Assay Procedure:
1. Program the immunoassay analyzer with the appropriate test
method for Orchard Grass, IgE.
2. Load patient samples, calibrators, and quality controls onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Initiate the assay run.
7.6 Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
2. Compare patient sample results to reference intervals:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kUA/L
◦ Equivocal: 0.35 – 0.70 kUA/L
◦ Positive: >0.70 kUA/L
3. Repeat testing or perform verification steps if results are
flagged by the instrument or if quality control results are out of
range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the MLS before
releasing to the medical provider.
3. Report critical or unexpected results directly to the requesting
clinician following laboratory protocol.
9. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
1. If a sample is found to be compromised (e.g., hemolysis,
lipemia), document the issue and request a new specimen.
2. Centrifuge aliquots if needed to confirm sample integrity.
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs as required.
2. Perform periodic maintenance and calibration of equipment
according to manufacturer guidelines.
3. Retain records of all tests, calibrations, controls, and
maintenance for the required retention period.
