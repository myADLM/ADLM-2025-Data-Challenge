Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Generating
Results for Oregano-specific IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for Oregano-specific IgE in serum samples using enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff trained on the ELISA
method to ensure this protocol is followed rigorously to produce
accurate and reliable results.
2. SPECIMEN
2.1 Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen type: Serum
• Volume required: Minimum of 0.5 mL
• Storage: Specimens must be kept at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48
hours; for longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum samples
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin, or
sodium citrate)
• Samples with less than 0.5 mL of serum
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment:
• ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
3.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• Oregano-specific IgE ELISA kit (ensure kit is within its expiration
date)
• Calibrators and controls as provided in the ELISA kit
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Reagent reservoirs
• Microplate seals
Storage:
• Store all reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
2. Mix all reagents gently but thoroughly before use, avoiding the
formation of bubbles.
3. Prepare the wash buffer by diluting the concentrated wash
buffer with distilled water according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4.2 Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microplate strips to correspond with the samples,
standards, and controls.
2. Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and patient serum
sample into the appropriate wells. Ensure to run all samples,
standards, and controls in duplicate.
3. Cover the plate with a microplate seal and incubate at 37°C for
the time specified by the manufacturer (typically 30-60
minutes).
4. After incubation, aspirate the contents of the wells and wash
the wells with wash buffer. Repeat this step for a total of 3-5
washes. Ensure to remove any residual liquid by inverting the
plate and tapping it on absorbent paper.
5. Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified by the
manufacturer.
7. Repeat the washing steps as described in step 4.
8. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well. Incubate the
plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the dark for the time
specified by the manufacturer (typically 10-20 minutes).
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
4.3 Reading and Interpretation:
1. Read the absorbance of each well at the wavelength specified
by the manufacturer (typically 450 nm).
2. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicates.
3. Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
the standards against their known concentrations.
4. Determine the concentration of oregano-specific IgE in the
patient samples by interpolating their absorbance values from
the standard curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
2. Ensure all calibrators, controls, and patient samples are run in
duplicate for accuracy.
3. Review the standard curve and control results to ensure they
fall within the acceptable range as specified by the
manufacturer. If not, rerun the assay where possible.
4. Maintain a log of all quality control data for future reference and
troubleshooting.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the final concentration of oregano-specific IgE for each
patient sample into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify all results before releasing them.
3. Critical values should be promptly communicated to the
requesting physician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Refer to the manufacturer's insert for any limitations of the
ELISA method specific to oregano-specific IgE detection.
2. Ensure the test results are interpreted in the context of clinical
and other laboratory findings.

I included common practices like running samples in duplicate and
creating a standard curve from calibrators and controls as part of
quality assurance. I made sure to include nuances in sample
handling and criteria. Let me know if details could be expanded, such
as steps to create a proper standard curve, or anything else.
