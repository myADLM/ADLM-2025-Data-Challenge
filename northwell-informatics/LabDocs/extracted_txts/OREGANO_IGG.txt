Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative
Measurement of Oregano IgG Antibody Levels
1. Purpose: The purpose of this SOP is to establish the precise
methodology for the quantitative analysis and reporting of Oregano
IgG antibodies in patient serum samples using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This ensures accurate and
reproducible results.
2. Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable specimens: Serum collected in a red-top or serum-
separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimen that is hemolyzed, lipemic,
or icteric.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Automated ELISA analyzer.
• Oregano IgG ELISA kit (Approved and validated lot).
• Micropipettes (single and multichannel) and tips.
• 96-well microtiter plates.
• Plate washer and plate reader capable of measuring absorbance
at 450 nm.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Calibrated laboratory timer.
• Appropriate biohazard waste disposal containers.
4. Reagents Preparation:
• Prepare all reagents and controls as per the manufacturer's
instructions provided in the Oregano IgG ELISA kit. Ensure
reagents are at room temperature before starting the assay.
• Prepare wash buffer, sample diluent, conjugate, substrate, stop
solution, and standard solutions.
5. Quality Control:
• Include both positive and negative control sera in each batch of
tests.
• Run internal quality control (QC) samples with high, medium, and
low concentrations of Oregano IgG on each assay plate.
• Record QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable ranges
before proceeding with sample testing.
6. Procedure: 6.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to come to room temperature.
2. Dilute serum samples as per the manufacturer’s instructions,
typically 1:100 in sample diluent.
6.2 ELISA Assay:
1. Label the 96-well microtiter plate and designate wells for
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Add 100 µL of diluted standards, controls, and patient sample
dilutions to the designated wells.
3. Cover the plate with an adhesive cover and incubate at 37°C
for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plate 4 times with the prepared wash buffer using the
plate washer.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes in the
dark.
7. Wash the plate again 4 times with the wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15 minutes in the
dark.
10. Add 50 µL of the stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm on the plate
reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
6.3 Data Analysis:
1. Calibrate the ELISA plate reader with standards to generate a
standard curve.
2. Determine the Oregano IgG concentration of the patient
samples by comparing the absorbance values to the standard
curve.
3. Record all results, including controls, standards, and patient
samples in the laboratory information system (LIS).
7. Reporting Results: Results are to be reported in standard
international units (e.g., IU/mL). Reference intervals as provided by
the kit manufacturer should be included in the report to assist in the
interpretation of results.
8. Limitations and Troubleshooting:
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date and stored
properly.
• Samples with values higher than the highest standard should be
diluted and retested.
• If controls are not within acceptable ranges, do not report patient
results. Investigate and resolve the issue before retesting.
9. Safety and Precautions:
• Handle all specimens using standard precautions.
• Dispose of all waste according to biohazard regulations.
10. References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Oregano IgG ELISA Kit.
• Laboratory guidelines and protocols for quality control and safety.
11. Documentation:
• Record all temperatures, deviations, corrective actions, and any
unusual occurrences in the designated logs.
By following this SOP, accurate and reliable results for Oregano IgG
antibody levels can be ensured for all patient specimens tested within
the laboratory.
