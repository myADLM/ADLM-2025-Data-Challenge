Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for OREXIN-A/
HYPOCRETIN-1 Analysis in Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
the analytical phase of generating results for Orexin-A (also known as
Hypocretin-1) in spinal fluid. It includes the procedures for sample
preparation, handling, assay performance, and result reporting to
ensure accurate and reliable test outcomes.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel trained in the handling and
processing of spinal fluid and the execution of the Orexin-A/
Hypocretin-1 assay.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to adhere to this SOP to
ensure the integrity of each specimen and the reliability of the results
obtained. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP and addressing any deviations or issues during the
analysis.

1. SPECIMEN
5.1 Specimen Type
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected by lumbar puncture.
5.2 Specimen Handling and Storage
• CSF should be aliquoted upon receipt and immediately frozen at
-80°C.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to preserve specimen integrity.
• Specimens must be labeled with a unique identifier for traceability.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
• Thaw specimen aliquots at 4°C overnight or at room temperature
for 30-60 minutes.
• Vortex specimen gently to ensure homogeneity.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
any cellular debris.
• Transfer the supernatant to a new, labeled micro-centrifuge tube.
6.2 Assay Procedure (using Orexin-A (Hypocretin-1) ELISA kit)
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided with the ELISA kit
for specific reagent preparation and assay execution steps.
• Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before beginning the assay.
• Prepare a standard curve using the provided calibrators in the
ELISA kit.
• Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and CSF specimens to
designated wells on the microplate.
• Cover the plate with adhesive foil and incubate at 37°C for 2
hours.
• Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
• Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
• Cover and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.
• Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
• Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader within
30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
6.3 Result Calculation
• Generate a standard curve using the absorbance readings of the
calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of Orexin-A in the CSF specimens by
interpolating the sample absorbance values on the standard
curve.
• Ensure all quality control measures are followed, and review QC
results before validating specimen results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Internal Quality Control
• Run internal controls included in the ELISA kit with each batch of
specimens.
• Results must fall within the manufacturer's acceptable range. If
QC fails, identify and correct the issue before proceeding.
7.2 External Quality Control
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure assay
accuracy and consistency over time.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results for accuracy.
• Report results in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).
• Ensure that any results falling outside the reference range are
flagged.
• Document and validate results following the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
• Send results to the referring physician or authorized personnel.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's ELISA kit insert for specific reagent
pad limitations and interference factors.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and other factors may affect the accuracy of
the assay.
1. REFERENCES
• Orexin-A (Hypocretin-1) ELISA Kit instruction manual
• Laboratory SOP documentation on ELISA procedures
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of specimen processing, assay runs, quality
control measures, and result reporting per laboratory
documentation policies.
• Ensure proper documentation and storage of calibration curves,
control results, and patient result data.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to safety guidelines for handling biological specimens and
reagents.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to laboratory protocols
and regulations.
