Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generation of Results for
Organic Acids, Qualitative,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the processes and steps necessary for the
qualitative analysis of organic acids in urine. The procedure ensures
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of results. Organic acids
analysis is essential for the diagnosis of various metabolic disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow and
execute this SOP accurately. The laboratory supervisor is responsible
for ensuring compliance with these procedures and for addressing
any deviations or issues during the analytical process.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND
SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS)
• HP-5MS column (or equivalent) for GC-MS
• Sample vials with screw caps
• Derivatizing reagents (trimethylsilylation reagents)
• Internal standards (e.g., Heptadecanoic acid)
• Urine specimen
• Refrigerated centrifugal evaporator (SpeedVac)
• pH adjustment reagents
• Organic solvents (e.g., ethyl acetate, acetonitrile)
• Water bath at 60°C
• Glass pipettes and micropipettes
• Quality controls (positive and negative controls)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
PREPARATION
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: A 10-20 mL random urine sample
collected in a clean, dry container. Specimen should be fresh or
stored at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable: Specimens with severe hematuria, highly turbid,
or those stored at room temperature for more than 24 hours.
Preparation:
1. Specimen thawing (if frozen): Thaw the urine sample in a
refrigerator at 2-8°C, then bring it to room temperature before
analysis.
2. pH Adjustment: Adjust the pH of the urine sample to 1-2 using
concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl).
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Urine Extraction:
1. Add Internal Standard: Add the appropriate amount of internal
standard (e.g., Heptadecanoic acid) to each urine sample.
2. Extraction: Add an equal volume of ethyl acetate to the urine
sample. Mix thoroughly by vortexing for 1 minute.
3. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the mixture at 2000 rpm for 10
minutes at 4°C.
4. Separation: Carefully transfer the upper organic layer (ethyl
acetate) into a clean sample vial.
5.2 Derivatization:
1. Evaporation: Evaporate the organic solvents using a
refrigerated centrifugal evaporator (SpeedVac) until dry.
2. Derivatization: Add 100 μL of derivatizing reagent (e.g., N,O-
bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, BSTFA) and 50 μL of acetonitrile to
the dried residue.
3. Incubation: Heat the vial in a water bath at 60°C for 30-60
minutes to ensure complete derivatization.
5.3 GC-MS Analysis:
1. Injection: Inject 1-2 μL of the derivatized sample into the GC-
MS system.
2. Chromatography: Separate the compounds using an HP-5MS
column with the following gradient: initial temperature at 70°C
for 2 minutes, ramp to 280°C at 10°C/min, hold for 5 minutes.
3. Detection: Identify organic acids by their retention times and
mass spectra using the GC-MS detector.
4. Data Acquisition: Collect and process data using the GC-MS
software to match detected compounds with known library
standards.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Quality Control (QC): Run both positive and negative control
samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Calibration: Perform instrument calibration daily using known
standards. Calibration curves should encompass the expected
range of organic acids.
• Internal Standard Verification: Verify the peak and retention
time of the internal standard in each sample to ensure accurate
quantification and identification.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Low Recovery: Review extraction and derivatization steps.
Ensure sufficient mixing, complete evaporation, and correct
derivatizing reagent volume.
• High Background Noise: Check cleanliness of the sample vials
and GC-MS components. Replace the septum and liner regularly.
• Retention Time Shifts: Recalibrate the GC-MS, check for leaks,
and replace the column if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Qualitative Analysis: Compare the retention times and mass
spectral data of sample peaks with the reference library.
• Results Documentation: Document positive findings, including
identified organic acids and any relevant notes. Report any
abnormalities to the supervising clinician.
