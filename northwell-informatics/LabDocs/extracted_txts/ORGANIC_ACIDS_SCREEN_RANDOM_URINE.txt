STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE Organic Acids Screen,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of organic acids
in random urine samples. This protocol ensures consistent and
accurate results and meets quality control standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring quality control, documenting results, and notifying
supervisors of any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Organic acids screen involves the qualitative and quantitative
assessment of organic acids in random urine samples to diagnose
metabolic disorders.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred/Acceptable: 10 mL of a random urine sample.
◦ Specimen must be collected in a clean, sterile container.
◦ Specimen should be stored at 4 to 8°C and processed within
24 hours.
◦ If immediate processing is not possible, the specimen may be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens contaminated with feces or other substances.
◦ Specimens in containers with preservatives that can interfere
with the analysis.
◦ Specimens without proper labeling including collection date
and time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS analyzer
• Organic acid standards
• Internal standards
• High-purity solvents and reagents
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
• Test tubes and sample vials
• Refrigeration and freezer units
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PREPARATION
2. Ensure that all equipment, instruments, and materials are
operational, calibrated, and within their certification period.
3. Wear appropriate PPE including lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen urine samples at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
3. Transfer an aliquot of the clear supernatant to a clean test tube.
B) Derivatization (if applicable):
1. Add an appropriate volume of the internal standard solution to
the urine sample.
2. Add derivatization reagent according to the specific
methodology instructions.
3. Mix the sample using a vortex mixer and incubate at prescribed
conditions (e.g., temperature and time).
C) GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare the instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Set up the method parameters and create a sample run list.
3. Inject the prepared urine sample into the GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/
MS analyzer.
4. Record the chromatogram and mass spectrum data for the
sample.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Compare results to organic acid standards and reference
ranges.
2. Qualitative analysis: Identify the presence of organic acids
based on retention times and mass spectra.
3. Quantitative analysis: Calculate the concentration of each
organic acid using calibration curves.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run control samples (positive and negative) alongside patient
samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
6. Record and review quality control data. If QC fails, troubleshoot
and repeat the analysis.
7. Documentation: Log all control sample results, calibration data,
any deviations, corrective actions taken, and detailed
procedural steps.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Review and verify results, ensuring they fall within the
established reference ranges and quality control guidelines.
10. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
including any comments or observations regarding sample
integrity or procedural deviations.
11. Critical results should be communicated to the requesting
physician or clinician promptly following laboratory protocols.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to specific standardized reference intervals for organic acids,
typically provided by the instrument manufacturer or based on
validated laboratory data.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Ensure that the urinary creatinine value is within an acceptable
range to rule out dilution effects.
3. Be aware of potential interferences from drugs, dietary sources,
or handling errors that can affect results.
4. Validate new reagents and formulas to ensure stability and
reproducibility of results.
5. REFERENCES
Include references to standard method manuals, equipment user
manuals, and peer-reviewed literature relevant to the organic acids
screen methodology.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure that the
organic acids screen in random urine specimens is carried out
consistently and accurately, providing reliable diagnostic information.
