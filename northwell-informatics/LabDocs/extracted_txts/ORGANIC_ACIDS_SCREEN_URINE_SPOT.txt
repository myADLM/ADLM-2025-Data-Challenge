Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) – Organic Acids Screen,
Urine Spot
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical phase for generating results for
the Organic Acids Screen, Urine Spot (OAS). This test analyzes the
organic acid content in urine and helps diagnose metabolic disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff trained in organic acid analysis are
responsible for performing the procedures stated in this protocol. It is
the responsibility of all staff to identify any anomalies during the
testing process and notify the supervisor immediately.
3. DEFINITION
Organic acids screening involves the analysis of urine to detect and
quantify a range of organic acids that may indicate metabolic
disorders.
4. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type: Urine (spot sample)
1. Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 10 mL freshly voided urine stored at 4°C immediately after
collection.
2. Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens without proper labeling (date, time of collection).
◦ Specimens with presence of contaminants or visible
particulate matter.
◦ Specimens not stored at the required temperature.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS)
• Derivatization reagents (e.g., BSTFA - N,O-
Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide)
• Internal standards
• Calibration standards
• Autosampler vials
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen is properly labeled and stored at the correct
temperature.
2. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot 1 mL of the clear urine into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tube.
4. Add 500 µL of internal standard solution to the urine sample.
5. Vortex the tube for 1 minute to ensure thorough mixing.
B. Derivatization:
1. Transfer the prepared sample into an autosampler vial.
2. Add 100 µL of derivatization reagent (BSTFA) to the sample.
3. Heat the vial to 70°C for 30 minutes in a heating block to allow
the derivatization reaction to occur.
4. Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
C. GC-MS Analysis:
1. Set up the GC-MS according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and laboratory-specific parameters.
2. Inject 1 µL of the derivatized sample into the GC-MS.
3. Run the GC-MS with the following parameters:
◦ Injection temperature: 250°C
◦ Carrier gas: Helium
◦ Flow rate: 1 mL/min
◦ Oven temperature program: Start at 70°C, hold for 1 minute,
ramp to 280°C at 10°C/min, hold for 5 minutes
◦ MS settings: Electron impact ionization, scan mode, m/z
range 50-550
D. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the GC-MS data using the appropriate software.
2. Identify and quantify the organic acids in the sample based on
retention times and mass spectra.
3. Compare the results with established reference ranges.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative control samples with each batch
of tests.
2. Perform calibration of the GC-MS using calibration standards
before running patient samples.
3. Run blank samples between patient samples to check for
carryover contamination.
4. Document QC results in the QC log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify the analytical data.
2. Generate patient reports including the identified organic acids,
their concentrations, and relevant comments.
3. Document and report any critical results immediately to the
requesting physician.
4. Maintain records for all tested samples as per laboratory
guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
Reference the latest published normal values for organic acids in
urine specific to age and sex. Record findings that fall outside these
ranges for further analysis.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Interference may occur from co-eluting substances or degraded
samples.
2. Specimen integrity is critical; improper storage can lead to
inaccurate results.
3. Consult the GC-MS operator manual for specific limitations
associated with the instrument and reagents used.

12. DOCUMENTATION
All raw data, quality control data, and patient results must be
documented and stored according to the laboratory's documentation
policies.
