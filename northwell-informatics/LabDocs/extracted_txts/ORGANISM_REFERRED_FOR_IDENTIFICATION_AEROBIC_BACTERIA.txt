STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Identification of
Aerobic Bacteria
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for the
identification of aerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in
order to ensure accurate and timely results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing bacteriological identification procedures as outlined in this
SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to bring to the attention of a
supervisor any concerns regarding the identification process or the
quality of results.
1. DEFINITIONS: Aerobic Bacteria: Bacteria that require oxygen
for survival and growth. Referred Organism: A bacterial isolate
sent to a reference laboratory for further identification due to
inability to fully identify at the original testing facility.
2. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Preparation and Initial Handling:
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen and accession number.
2. If specimen is from a transport medium, using aseptic
technique, inoculate onto appropriate culture media (blood
agar, MacConkey agar, etc.).
3. Incubate inoculated media at recommended temperature
(typically 35-37°C) in an aerobic incubator for 18-24 hours, or
as per organism growth characteristics.
B. Preliminary Screening and Culture Review:
1. After incubation, examine the plates for colony morphology,
hemolysis, pigmentation, and other growth characteristics.
2. Record observations and perform Gram staining on
representative colonies.
3. Based on morphology and Gram stain results, conduct a
preliminary identification.
C. Biochemical and Molecular Testing:
1. Use an automated identification system (VITEK 2, BD Phoenix,
or similar) for further identification:
• Select well-isolated colonies.
• Prepare inoculum according to system instructions.
• Load the inoculum into the automated system and begin the
identification process.
1. Perform additional biochemical tests as required:
• Catalase, Oxidase, Coagulase, etc.
1. For molecular identification, prepare isolates for PCR or
sequencing techniques if needed:
• Extract bacterial DNA using an appropriate DNA extraction
protocol.
• Amplify target genes using PCR with species-specific primers.
• Sequence amplified products if necessary and compare with
reference database.
D. Referral to Reference Laboratory:
1. If the organism cannot be definitively identified or if further
confirmation is required, package the isolate according to
reference laboratory requirements:
◦ Ensure the isolate is preserved and properly labeled.
◦ Complete a referral form with all relevant details (patient
information, initial findings, tests performed).
2. Ship the isolate according to biosafety and transport
regulations.
E. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review all test results (automated system output, biochemical
tests, molecular findings).
2. Compare findings with reference databases or identification
keys.
3. Enter the final identification results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4. Verify results and prepare the final report for review.
F. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control on all media, reagents, and automated
systems as per laboratory SOPs.
2. Include positive and negative controls in biochemical and
molecular tests.
3. Document all quality control activities.
G. Troubleshooting:
1. If identification results are inconclusive or contradictory, re-
examine colony morphology and Gram stain results.
2. Repeat critical biochemical tests or molecular procedures.
3. Consult a senior technologist or microbiologist for additional
guidance if required.
4. DOCUMENTATION: Record all observations, test results, and
quality control activities accurately in the laboratory logbook or
LIS. Ensure all forms and reports are completed and retained
according to laboratory policy.

bacterial identification.
• Manufacturer's instructions for automated identification systems
and molecular testing kits.
• Scientific literature and bacterial identification reference guides.

bacteria, including steps for initial handling, detailed testing, referral
processes, quality control measures, and documentation. If specifics
about equipment or additional tests are needed, feel free to ask for
