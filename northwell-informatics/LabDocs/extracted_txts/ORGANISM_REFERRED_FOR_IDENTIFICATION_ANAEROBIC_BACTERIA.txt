STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Organism Referred for Identification: Anaerobic Bacteria
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for identifying anaerobic bacteria
from clinical specimens. This protocol ensures precise and
reproducible identification of anaerobic organisms using appropriate
microbiological and biochemical techniques.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
implement the procedures described in this SOP to ensure accurate
identification of anaerobic bacteria. Technologists must document all
findings and report unusual results or inconsistencies to the
supervising microbiologist.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Specimens obtained from sterile body sites, abscesses, deep
wound cultures, surgical specimens, or other clinically relevant
sites.
• Preferably transported in anaerobic transport media.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Superficial swabs or specimens exposed to air.
• Specimens with delayed transport exceeding the recommended
timeframe without anaerobic transport media.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Anaerobic transport media
• Anaerobic chamber or jar
• Anaerobic gas generator packs
• Incubator set at 35-37°C
• Blood Agar Plates (BAP)
• Anaerobic and selective media for anaerobic organisms (e.g.,
Kanamycin-Vancomycin Agar, Bacteroides Bile Esculin Agar)
• Gram stain reagents
• Biochemical test kits (e.g., RapID ANA II System, API 20A, Vitek
ANC card)
• Microscope
• Sterile inoculating loops and needles
• Identification algorithms and guidelines for anaerobic organisms
4. PROCEDURE
A. SPECIMEN CULTURE:
1. Verify specimen integrity upon arrival.
2. Inoculate appropriate media including Blood Agar Plate,
Kanamycin-Vancomycin Agar, and Bacteroides Bile Esculin
Agar.
◦ Use sterile inoculating loops to streak plates.
◦ Include control plate to ensure anaerobic conditions.
3. Place inoculated plates in anaerobic chamber or jar with gas
generator packs.
◦ Ensure all seals are tight to maintain an anaerobic
environment.
4. Incubate plates at 35-37°C for 48-72 hours (monitor for growth
every 24 hours).
B. ORGANISM ISOLATION AND PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATION:
1. Examine plates for colony morphology, pigmentation, and
hemolysis.
2. Perform Gram staining on suspected colonies.
◦ Document Gram reaction and cell morphology.
3. Subculture isolated colonies onto fresh anaerobic media if
necessary for purity.
C. BIOCHEMICAL TESTING:
1. Utilize RapID ANA II System, API 20A, or Vitek ANC card
according to respective manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare and inoculate the selected test system with isolated
colonies.
3. Incubate in the anaerobic environment as specified by the test
kit instructions.
4. Interpret results according to the reference charts provided with
the test kits.
◦ Record and analyze biochemical reactions to determine
organism identification.
D. CONFIRMATORY TESTING:
• If preliminary identification indicates a rare or unusual anaerobic
bacterium, perform additional confirmatory tests:
◦ Molecular methods (PCR for specific genes, sequencing)
◦ Additional biochemical assays or antimicrobial resistance
testing
E. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure all media, reagents, and equipment are within expiration
dates and functioning properly.
• Include positive and negative controls for biochemical tests.
• Perform routine checks on incubator temperature and anaerobic
conditions.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Documentation:
1. Record all observations, Gram stain results, biochemical test
results, and organism identification in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Include any relevant notes on unusual findings or difficulties
encountered during identification.
B. Result Communication:
1. Confirm results with supervising microbiologist.
2. Report identified organism to ordering clinician or healthcare
provider.
◦ Include organism name, gram reaction, and any
antimicrobial resistance patterns.
6. REFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturer's instructions and guidelines for
biochemical test systems.
• Review quality control data routinely to ensure the reliability of
test results.
• Note that some anaerobic bacteria may have atypical biochemical
profiles; consult additional literature or microbiological guides
when necessary.
7. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection).
• Handle specimens within biosafety cabinet or other contained
space due to potential exposure risks.
• Follow all institutional guidelines for disposal of biological waste.
8. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
anaerobic bacteriology
• Manufacturer’s instructions for RapID ANA II, API 20A, Vitek ANC
cards
