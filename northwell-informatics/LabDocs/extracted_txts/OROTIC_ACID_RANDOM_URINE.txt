1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for the analysis of orotic acid in random
urine samples to ensure accurate and precise results. This protocol
ensures that all relevant processes are properly executed, corrective
actions are addressed, and laboratory testing complies with
regulatory standards.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory staff performing
orotic acid analysis on random urine samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures described in this protocol. It is the responsibility of the
staff to notify the supervisor of any issues that may affect the
accuracy and precision of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean,
dry plastic container without preservatives.
• Storage: If not analyzed immediately, store the sample at 2-8°C
for up to 24 hours or at -20°C for longer storage.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples with significant hematuria,
samples collected with preservatives, or contaminated samples.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) with PDA or UV
detector.
• Orotic Acid Reference Standard.
• Water (HPLC Grade).
• Mobile Phase (Note specific components and preparation method
as per instrument requirements).
• Sample vials with caps.
• Pipettes and tips (suitable for microliter volume transfers).
• Centrifuge.
• Water bath (37°C).
• Analytical balance.
• Calibration standards, control material, and quality control
samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control:
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples using
the orotic acid reference standard dissolved in the mobile phase.
• Prepare standards at concentrations that cover the expected
range of urinary orotic acid levels.
• Store calibration standards and quality controls at 2-8°C when not
in use.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature (if applicable).
• Vortex urine samples to ensure homogeneity.
• Pipette 2 mL of urine into a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 3000
rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial for analysis.
C. Instrument Setup and Calibration:
• Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Ensure that all parameters (e.g., flow rate, column
temperature, detection settings) are appropriately configured.
• Perform an initial calibration of the HPLC system using the
prepared calibration standards. Plot the calibration curve and
verify acceptable linearity.
D. Sample Analysis:
• Inject a suitable volume (e.g., 10 µL) of each prepared urine
sample, calibration standard, and quality control sample into the
HPLC system.
• Follow the sequence: calibration standards, quality control
samples, unknown urine samples, and final quality control
samples.
• Run the HPLC method as per the standard protocol and record
peak areas.
E. Post-Analysis:
• Analyze system suitability by verifying that the quality control
samples fall within the acceptable range.
• Calculate orotic acid concentrations in the urine samples using
the calibration curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include necessary comments and references based on standard
procedures for generating and reviewing results.
• Verify results accuracy by examining QC samples and other
analytical metrics.
• Critical results shall be communicated to the appropriate clinical
personnel immediately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Run quality control samples at least once per batch or as required
by regulatory standards.
• Investigate and document any out-of-range QC samples and take
corrective actions as needed.
• Address any discrepancies encountered during the analysis (e.g.,
sample issues, instrument errors) and consult the supervisor if
necessary.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow standard laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of waste and chemical reagents in accordance with
laboratory safety protocols and local regulations.

future revisions as required by the laboratory management and
regulatory bodies.
