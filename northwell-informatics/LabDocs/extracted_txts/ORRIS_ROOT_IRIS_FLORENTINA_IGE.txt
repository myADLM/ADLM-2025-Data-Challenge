Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase for
ORRIS ROOT (IRIS FLORENTINA) IgE Testing
1. Purpose: To provide a standardized procedure for the
quantitation of IgE antibodies specific to Orris Root (Iris
Florentina) in patient sera using immunoassay techniques. This
SOP ensures consistent and reliable generation of results for
the measurement of IgE antibodies for clinical diagnostic
purposes.
2. Scope: This procedure is applicable to the clinical laboratory
setting for the analysis of patient serum samples for the
presence of Orris Root (Iris Florentina)-specific IgE. This SOP
is to be followed by all laboratory personnel trained in
performing immunoassays for IgE quantitation.
3. Responsibilities: 3.1. Laboratory personnel are responsible for
adhering to this SOP and ensuring the accurate preparation,
execution, and documentation of Orris Root-specific IgE testing.
3.2. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for verifying the
competency of laboratory personnel, overseeing assay
performance, and troubleshooting issues as necessary.
4. Specimen Requirements: 4.1. Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-
top tube.
◦ Specimens should be free from hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus.
◦ Specimens must be handled and stored according to proper
clinical practices.
4.2. Specimen Stability: - Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days. - For long-term storage, specimens can be stored at -20°C or
colder.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies: 5.1. Equipment:
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia™ 250 or
equivalent)
◦ Micropipettes and tips (e.g., 100 μL, 1 mL)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Incubator
5.2. Reagents: - Specific IgE reagent kit for Orris Root (Iris
Florentina) (e.g., ImmunoCAP or equivalent) - Calibrators and
Controls specific for the assay - Diluent and wash solutions as
specified by the reagent manufacturer
5.3. Supplies: - Sample tubes - Reaction vessels specific to the
analyzer - Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat)
1. Procedure: 6.1. Preparation: 6.1.1. Verify the availability of
reagents, calibrators, and controls. 6.1.2. Perform maintenance
checks on the analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
6.1.3. Ensure all required documentation is available and up to
date.
6.2. Calibration: 6.2.1. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided
calibrator set following the manufacturer's protocol. 6.2.2. Verify
calibration by running quality control samples to ensure instrument
accuracy.
6.3. Sample Processing: 6.3.1. Allow serum samples to come to
room temperature. 6.3.2. Mix samples gently but thoroughly. 6.3.3.
Aliquot the required volume of serum (as specified in the reagent kit
instructions) into the designated reaction vessels.
6.4. Immunoassay Analysis: 6.4.1. Load reagents, samples,
calibrators, and controls into the automated analyzer. 6.4.2. Initiate
the assay sequence as per the manufacturer's protocol. 6.4.3.
Monitor the assay run and address any alarms or errors promptly.
6.5. Result Interpretation: 6.5.1. The analyzer will automatically
generate results upon completion of the assay. 6.5.2. Evaluate the
quality control data to ensure results are within acceptable limits.
6.5.3. Review the generated data for each patient sample.
6.6. Reporting Results: 6.6.1. Enter results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review. 6.6.2. Report results according
to site-specific guidelines and include the following information: -
Patient identification - Date and time of sample collection - Date and
time of analysis - Result units (e.g., kUA/L) - Reference ranges
1. Quality Control: 7.1. Run quality control samples at the
beginning and end of each batch of assays. 7.2. Document
quality control results and take appropriate corrective actions if
results fall outside the acceptable range.
2. Method Limitations: 8.1. Refer to the specific reagent kit insert
for limitations of the assay. 8.2. High concentrations of
heterophilic antibodies in patient samples may cause
interference.
3. References: 9.1. Manufacturer's insert for the Orris Root (Iris
Florentina)-specific IgE reagent kit. 9.2. Standard operating
procedures and guidelines for immunoassay analyzers used in
the laboratory.
