STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ORTHOPEDIA
HOMEOBOX PROTEIN (OTP) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to describe the procedure for
performing the Orthopedia Homeobox Protein (OTP) immunostain on
tissue specimens using the appropriate analytical technique. This
procedure ensures the reliable and consistent detection of OTP
protein for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
and document the OTP immunostaining process as per this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP, verifying results, and performing any necessary corrective
actions.
1. PRINCIPLE AND SCOPE
Orthopedia Homeobox Protein (OTP) is a protein expressed in some
neuroendocrine tissues and tumors. The immunohistochemical
staining technique allows for the visualization of this protein to aid in
diagnostic decision-making.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens suitable for OTP immunostain include:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
• Tissue sections (4-5 micrometers thick) mounted on positively
charged glass slides
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not adequately fixed in formalin
• Specimens inadequately prepared or sectioned
1. REAGENTS AND CONSUMABLES
• Primary anti-OTP antibody (specific clone to be used as per
manufacturer's instructions)
• Secondary antibody (linked to a detectable enzyme, e.g.,
horseradish peroxidase)
• Detection systems (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Reagent buffers (e.g., Tris-buffered saline, TBS)
• Mounting medium
• Glass slides
• Cover slips
Storage:
• Reagents must be stored at the temperatures recommended by
the manufacturer.
• Primary and secondary antibodies must be stored refrigerated at
2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome for sectioning tissue specimens
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining equipment
• Slide drying oven
• Humidity chamber (if manual staining is performed)
• Light microscope
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections:
• Section the FFPE tissue blocks to obtain 4-5 micrometer thick
sections.
• Mount sections onto positively charged slides.
• Allow slides to dry at 37°C overnight or at 60°C for 1-2 hours.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
• Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%)
for 3 minutes each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using an
appropriate antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or
Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0) based on the primary antibody's
requirements.
• Heat the slides in a pressure cooker, microwave, or steamer for
the time specified by the manufacturer.
• Allow slides to cool in the retrieval buffer for 20 minutes.
• Rinse slides in TBS or PBS.
D) Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in TBS or PBS.
3. Apply primary anti-OTP antibody and incubate as per the
manufacturer's specified conditions (time and temperature).
4. Wash slides in TBS or PBS.
5. Apply secondary antibody and incubate as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
6. Wash slides in TBS or PBS.
7. Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB) and incubate until desired
staining intensity is achieved, typically 5-10 minutes.
8. Wash slides in distilled water.
E) Counterstaining and Mounting:
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Wash slides in running tap water.
• Dehydrate through a graded series of alcohols (70%, 95%,
100%).
• Clear slides in xylene.
• Mount coverslips using a mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run.
• Positive control: Tissue known to express OTP.
• Negative control: Omit primary antibody application from one
slide.
• Review control slides to ensure appropriate staining.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• The pathologist will review the stained slides and record the
presence, intensity, and localization of OTP staining.
• The technologist will ensure that all documentation and quality
control measures have been completed.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the staining is weak or non-specific, check the antibody
concentration, incubation times, and ensure proper antigen
retrieval.
• Ensure fresh reagents are used, and that slides are adequately
deparaffinized and rehydrated.

secondary antibodies used.

immunohistochemistry.
