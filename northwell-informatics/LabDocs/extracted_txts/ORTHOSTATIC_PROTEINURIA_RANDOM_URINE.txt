Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Orthostatic Proteinuria, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE: This SOP outlines the procedures for analyzing and
generating results for orthostatic proteinuria in a random urine
sample. The purpose is to provide accurate and reliable
measurements to aid in the diagnosis and management of orthostatic
proteinuria in patients.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel
performing urinalysis for orthostatic proteinuria using designated
laboratory equipment and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: All laboratory personnel trained in urinalysis
and specifically in the orthostatic proteinuria test procedure are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. Supervisors ensure compliance
and perform periodic audits for quality assurance.
4. DEFINITIONS: Orthostatic Proteinuria: Presence of protein in a
urine sample collected after the patient has been standing for a
certain period, indicating the potential of postural protein excretion.
5. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ A fresh, random urine specimen collected at the laboratory.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens received more than 6 hours after collection without
proper refrigeration.
◦ Specimens without proper labeling, including the time of
collection.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Urine collection containers
• Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG reagent strips
• Automated urinalysis analyzer (if available)
• Centrifuge (for microscopic analysis if required)
• Timer
• Gloves, lab coats, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure the random urine sample is fresh and properly
labeled.
◦ If needed, bring the refrigerated sample to room
temperature before analysis.
2. Reagent Strip Test:
◦ Immerse the Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG reagent strip
completely in the urine sample and remove immediately to
avoid the reagents dissolving in the urine.
◦ Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to remove
excess urine.
◦ Start the timer immediately.
3. Reading the Results:
◦ Read each pad at the specified times indicated on the
reagent strip packaging, starting with the shortest time.
◦ Hold the strip close to the color block on the label and match
carefully.
◦ Record the protein concentration result. Note any other
significant findings (e.g., glucose, nitrite, blood) that may be
relevant.
4. Microscopic Analysis (if required):
◦ If the reagent strip indicates positive for protein, centrifuge
the sample if microscopy is also requested.
◦ Examine the sediment under a microscope for casts, RBCs,
WBCs, and other elements.
◦ Record and report the microscopic findings.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative control samples using the Siemens
Multistix 10SG or 8SG strips each day of testing.
• Record quality control results and ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before analyzing patient samples.
• Perform periodic instrument calibration and maintenance as per
manufacturer guidelines if using an automated analyzer.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document the protein concentration results and any additional
findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure all manual entries follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
• If reporting results manually, transcribe onto the appropriate
laboratory report forms.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Protein: Negative (Reference intervals might be specific to patient
demographics or clinical context; always verify with site-specific
guidelines).
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG product insert for
limitations related to individual reagent pads and interferences.
12. REFERENCES:
• Siemens Multistix Product Insert for use with Multistix 10SG and
Multistix 8SG.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory guidelines for urinalysis and
diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria.
13. APPENDICES:
• Detailed procedures for Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG reagent
strip usage.
• Troubleshooting and corrective actions for quality control failures.
14. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW:
• Maintain records of all test results, quality control logs, and
instrument maintenance.
• Regularly review and update SOP to align with current best
practices and regulatory requirements.
15. SAFETY:
• Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
By adhering to these protocols, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate analysis of random urine samples for orthostatic proteinuria,
providing essential diagnostic data to healthcare providers.
