Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Orthostatic Protein, Timed
Collection, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise measurement of orthostatic
protein in a timed urine collection sample, to aid in diagnosing and
monitoring conditions associated with proteinuria.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for processing, analyzing,
and reporting orthostatic protein results. It is the responsibility of all
staff to follow this protocol to ensure the integrity of the results and to
follow up on any issues that may arise during the analytical phase.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all timed urine collections submitted for
orthostatic protein analysis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• 24-hour urine collection or timed urine collection as specified by
the healthcare provider.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum of 10 mL of thoroughly mixed urine.
Specimen Stability:
• Store urine collection at 2-8°C during the collection period and
before analysis.
• If delays in analysis occur, aliquot and freeze at -20°C for stability
up to 7 days.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Protein analyzer or automated chemistry analyzer with protein
assay capability.
• Centrifuge.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Storage vials/tubes.
• Timer.
Reagents:
• Standard protein reagents as per the analyzer manufacturer's
instructions.
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls).
6. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify that the specimen container is labeled with
patient information, collection start and stop times.
2. Mix the entire urine collection thoroughly to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Measure and record the total urine volume of the timed
collection.
4. Aliquot 10 mL of urine into a labeled tube for analysis.
Procedure:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500-2000 x g for 5 minutes
to remove any particulate matter.
2. Protein Analysis:
◦ Set up the protein analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the appropriate calibration
standards.
◦ Load the urine sample onto the analyzer.
◦ Analyze the sample for total protein concentration.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (positive and negative controls)
alongside patient samples.
2. Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
3. If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and
repeat QC runs as necessary. Do not report patient results until
accurate QC performance is confirmed.
7. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT REPORTING
Calculation of Protein Excretion Rate:
1. Total Protein (mg/24h or over collection period):
◦ Total Protein (mg) = Protein Concentration (mg/dL) × Total
Volume (dL)
2. Report:
◦ Report the total protein excretion rate (mg/24h or the
specific collection period).
◦ Add a comment specifying the collection time and
adherence to collection instructions if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all calculated and analytical data before reporting.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) along
with any relevant comments.
• Review results to ensure completeness and correctness.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Results may be compromised if the collection is not properly
timed or if the specimen is mishandled.
• Ensure patient adherence to collection protocol to avoid
contamination or loss.
• Hematuria, pyuria, or high specific gravity can affect protein
measurement accuracy.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for the protein analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urine protein analysis.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all specimens processed, including collection
start and stop times, total volume, protein concentration, QC
results, and any deviations from the standard procedure.
By following this protocol, accuracy and precision in measuring
orthostatic protein excretion in timed urine collections can be
ensured, providing reliable diagnostic and monitoring information for
clinicians.
