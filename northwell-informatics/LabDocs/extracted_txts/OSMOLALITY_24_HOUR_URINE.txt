Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Determining Urine
Osmolality in a 24 Hour Specimen
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps and
responsibilities necessary to accurately measure and document the
osmolality of a 24-hour urine specimen.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the technologist/clinical laboratory scientist to
follow this procedure accurately to ensure the integrity and reliability
of the test results.
1. DEFINITION
Urine Osmolality: Osmolality is a measure of the concentration of
solutes in urine. It is expressed as milliosmoles per kilogram of water
(mOsm/kg). The test is used to assess the kidney's ability to
concentrate urine and is valuable in diagnosing various renal and
non-renal conditions.
1. SPECIMEN
Type: 24-hour urine collection.
Collection Instructions:
• Instruct the patient to discard the first morning urine on the day of
collection.
• Collect all subsequent urine voided during the next 24 hours,
including the first morning urine of the second day.
• Store the urine in a clean, properly labeled container provided by
the laboratory.
• Keep the specimen refrigerated throughout the collection period.
• Ensure the container is tightly sealed to prevent contamination
and evaporation.
Criteria for Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine not collected for the full 24-hour period.
• Specimens not stored properly (e.g., not refrigerated).
• Leaking containers or improperly labeled specimens.
• Presence of preservatives not approved by the laboratory.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Osmometer
◦ Pipettes and disposable tips
◦ Calibrated containers for urine measurement
◦ Quality Control materials
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
2. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
• Mix the 24-hour urine specimen thoroughly to ensure a
homogeneous sample.
• Measure and record the total volume of urine collected.
• Aliquot a sample into a properly labeled, clean, and dry container
for testing.
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Verify the calibration of the osmometer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run quality control checks using control solutions at different
osmolality levels (e.g., high, normal, low). Ensure results are
within acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
Measurement:
• Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 50 µL) of the well-mixed
urine into the osmometer, following instrument-specific
instructions.
• Initiate the osmolality measurement according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Recording and Reporting Results:
• Document the result generated by the osmometer in mOsm/kg on
the laboratory information system (LIS), including the patient’s ID,
date, and time of analysis.
• Compare the result with the reference intervals (typically 50-1200
mOsm/kg for random urine; specific ranges for 24-hour collections
may vary).
• Review and verify the result for accuracy before releasing it to the
physician.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Quality Control:
• Perform quality control at the start of every shift, after any
maintenance, or as specified by the laboratory policy.
• Troubleshoot any out-of-range QC results following lab guidelines
before processing patient samples.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges for urine osmolality in 24-hour collections
generally depend on patient hydration status and clinical context.
Specific ranges should be verified with laboratory standards.
1. INTERPRETATION AND LIMITATIONS
◦ Verify any unusual or suspect results, considering factors
that may influence the test (medications, hydration status,
etc.).
◦ Repeat the test if necessary to verify results.
◦ Use comprehensive clinical judgment alongside osmolality
results to assist in diagnosis.
2. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
◦ Ensure all results, QC data, and any pertinent observations
or comments are meticulously documented.
◦ Report any critical values immediately to the designated
personnel following laboratory protocols.

This protocol ensures the accuracy, reliability, and effective reporting
of urine osmolality in a 24-hour specimen, contributing to the high
standards of clinical diagnostics.
