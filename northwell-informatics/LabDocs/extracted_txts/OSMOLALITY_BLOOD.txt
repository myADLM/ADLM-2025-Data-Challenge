Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Measuring Blood Osmolality
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the measurement of blood
osmolality to ensure consistent and accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing blood osmolality tests
within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
procedure accurately and to ensure that all equipment is properly
maintained and calibrated. Supervisors must ensure compliance and
address any deviations discovered.
4. DEFINITIONS
Blood Osmolality: A measure of the total concentration of solutes in
the blood.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Osmometer
• Calibrated pipette
• Quality control materials (high and low osmolality controls)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Water bath (if required by the osmometer)
• Sample cups or test tubes
• Laboratory timer
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in lithium heparin,
PST, or SST tubes.
• Serum: Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes, then centrifuge for
10 minutes at 1500 RCF.
• Plasma: Centrifuge immediately after collection for 10 minutes at
1500 RCF.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or oxalate tubes.
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens with visible particulate matter.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform an initial calibration of the osmometer using calibration
standards specified by the manufacturer.
• Run high and low osmolality controls at the beginning of each
shift, with each new lot of test strips or reagents, and after any
maintenance or calibration.
• Record the results of calibration and quality control checks in the
Quality Control Log. Acceptable control ranges are as specified by
the control manufacturer. If controls fall outside acceptable
ranges, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s guidelines
and do not proceed with patient testing until resolved.
7.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis
1. Ensure the osmometer is properly calibrated and QC is within
acceptable range.
2. Obtain the patient’s serum or plasma specimen.
3. Label a sample cup or test tube with the patient’s identification.
4. Use a calibrated pipette to dispense the required volume of
serum or plasma into the sample cup/test tube.
5. Follow the osmometer manufacturer's instructions for loading
and analyzing the sample.
6. Start the measurement process as per the osmometer’s
operational manual.
7. Record the osmolality result displayed on the osmometer.
8. RECORDING AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the osmolality result into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Verify that results are within the acceptable reference range:
◦ Normal reference range: 280-295 mOsm/kg
• Critical Values
◦ <260 mOsm/kg - Notify immediate supervisor and clinician
◦ 320 mOsm/kg - Notify immediate supervisor and
clinician
9. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
• Document any instrument errors or issues in the Maintenance
Log.
• Follow the osmometer manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for
any instrument errors.
• Perform routine maintenance as recommended by the osmometer
manufacturer.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Document the Quality Control results.
• Ensure that Quality Control results fall within established ranges
before patient results are reported.
• If Quality Control results fall outside the accepted range, take
appropriate corrective action before testing samples, which may
include recalibrating the osmometer, replacing reagents, or
performing maintenance.

12. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP is subject to review and update annually or as needed
based on equipment updates, procedural changes, or regulatory
requirements.
