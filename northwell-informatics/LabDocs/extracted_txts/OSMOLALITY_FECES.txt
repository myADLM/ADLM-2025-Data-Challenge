Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Results for
Osmolality in Feces
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to determine the
osmolality of fecal specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: This procedure is to be followed by all trained staff
conducting the osmolality analysis on fecal specimens. It is the
responsibility of the staff to ensure that all steps are carried out
correctly and documented properly.
1. DEFINITION
Osmolality: The concentration of osmotically active particles in a
kilogram of solvent, measured in milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/
kg).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Fresh fecal specimen.
• Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Fecal specimen collected and stored at 2-8°C, transported to
the laboratory within 48 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Fecal specimens with visible contamination, specimens that
have been improperly stored or transported, and specimens
without proper labeling (collection date/time not indicated).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Osmometer (e.g., Advanced Instruments, Model 3320 or
equivalent)
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Test Tubes
• Deionized Water
• Controls (Low and High osmolality standard solutions)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab
coat
• Sample Cups
• Heating Block or Water Bath
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Wipe down the bench area with appropriate disinfectant.
2. Don appropriate PPE.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the Osmometer:
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for calibration.
◦ Document calibration results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run Low and High control solutions.
◦ Document results and ensure they are within the predefined
acceptable range.
C) Sample Preparation:
1. Collect a sufficient amount of fresh fecal sample into a test
tube.
2. Homogenize the sample thoroughly to ensure uniformity.
3. Pipette an appropriate volume (as specified by the osmometer
manufacturer) of the homogenized fecal sample into a sample
cup.
4. Place the sample cup in a water bath or heating block set to
37°C to equilibrate for at least 20 minutes.
D) Osmolality Measurement:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for running fecal samples
on the osmometer.
2. Pipette the equilibrated sample from the sample cup into the
osmometer sample chamber.
3. Start the osmometer and allow it to run the analysis.
4. Once complete, record the osmolality reading displayed by the
osmometer.
5. Repeat the measurement for at least two more aliquots of the
same sample to ensure reproducibility.
E) Post-Measurement:
1. Record all results, initial, date, and time on the result sheet.
2. If results are outside the expected range, repeat analysis.
3. If discrepancies persist, consult a supervisor.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
5. Each day's testing must be preceded by quality control as
outlined in "Calibration and Quality Control."
6. Test results are valid only if QC results are within acceptable
limits.
7. Document any QC failures and corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. The final result is an average of the valid reproducible results
obtained.
10. Enter the average osmolality value into the laboratory
information system, ensuring proper verification.
11. Ensure any critical values are flagged and communicated to the
relevant clinical personnel according to site-specific guidelines.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal osmolality values for feces will be established based on site-
specific ranges as determined through validation studies or literature
references.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Review the osmometer's user manual for specific limitations
related to sample volume, temperature, and interferences.
3. Ensure proper sample homogenization to avoid inaccurate
results.
