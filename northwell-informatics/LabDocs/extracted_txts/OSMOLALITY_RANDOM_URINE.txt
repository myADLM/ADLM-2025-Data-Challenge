Standard Operating Procedure: Osmolality, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for measuring the osmolality of a random
urine specimen using an osmometer. This ensures accurate and
reliable results are generated, documented, and reported according
to CLIA laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists will perform the osmolality
test.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure the proper functioning
of the osmometer and to adhere to standard operational
procedures.
1. DEFINITION
Osmolality measures the concentration of solute particles in a
solution and is expressed as milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• A minimum of 10 mL of random urine collected in a sterile
container.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples that are not properly labeled with collection date
and time.
• Samples with visible contamination or patient identification
discrepancies.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Osmometer
• Urine specimen cups
• Sterile pipettes
• Calibration standards (e.g., 100, 500 and 1000 mOsm/kg)
• Quality control materials
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory logbook or LIS
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Ensure the osmometer is properly calibrated using standards
as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Check and record the room temperature to ensure it is within
the operating range of the osmometer.
B. Specimen Handling:
1. Mix the urine specimen well before testing.
2. Using a sterile pipette, transfer a small aliquot of urine (typically
50-100 μL) to a clean sample cup or tube designated for the
osmometer.
C. Running the Test:
1. Follow the osmometer’s instructions for sample loading and
analysis.
2. Carefully place the urine sample into the sample well or onto
the sample platform as specified by the device.
3. Initiate the measurement process.
D. Result Documentation and Interpretation:
1. Document the resultant osmolality value displayed on the
osmometer in the laboratory logbook or directly into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure that the results are expressed in mOsm/kg and
recorded accurately.
3. Compare the result with the expected reference interval for a
healthy individual (50-1200 mOsm/kg for random urine).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift or
when a new batch of reagents is opened.
• Three levels of quality control material (low, medium, high) will be
analyzed to ensure the accuracy of the osmometer.
• Document the control results in the logbook or LIS. Investigate
and resolve any out-of-range QC results before proceeding with
patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results before reporting.
• Report any critical values immediately to the designated physician
and document the notification.
• Ensure all results are entered into the LIS and accessible for
clinician review.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the osmometer malfunctions or produces erratic results, refer to
the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
• Re-calibrate the device if necessary and repeat the quality control
tests.
• If problems persist, notify the supervisor and refrain from reporting
any patient results until the issue is resolved.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• The normal reference interval for urine osmolality: 50-1200
mOsm/kg for a random urine sample.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interference from contaminants in the sample may affect results.
• Hematuria or presence of large particulate matter can skew
osmolality readings.
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid erroneous results.
