Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measuring
Serum Osmolality
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of serum osmolality in
patient samples using a designated osmometer. This procedure
outlines the steps for measuring serum osmolality and verifying the
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing serum
osmolality measurements in the clinical laboratory using
osmometers.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing serum
osmolality measurements, maintaining equipment, and ensuring
quality control.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process, reviewing results, and addressing any discrepancies or
problems that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Preferred: Serum obtained from a SST (Serum Separator
Tube)
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Storage Conditions:
◦ Serum samples should be separated from clot within 2 hours
of collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
◦ For extended storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Osmometer (AML 1000, Advanced Instruments, or equivalent)
• Calibration standards (supplied by the manufacturer)
• Quality control materials (Low, Normal, High)
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample cups or tubes
• Laboratory timer or stopwatch
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure the osmometer is properly calibrated according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Perform daily QC checks using at least two levels of quality
control materials (Low and High). Record the results in the QC
log and ensure they are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before testing.
2. Gently mix the serum sample by inverting the tube several
times. Avoid vigorous shaking to prevent hemolysis.
3. Pipette an appropriate volume (typically 20-50µL) of the serum
into a clean sample cup or tube, following the osmometer's
requirements.
4. Place the sample cup/tube into the osmometer’s sample
compartment.
5. Initiate the analysis by following the osmometer's operating
instructions.
6. Record the osmolality value displayed by the osmometer once
the analysis is complete.
C. Post-Analysis
1. Dispose of used sample cups/tubes and pipette tips according
to biohazard waste protocols.
2. Review and verify the results. Any flagged or questionable
results should be reanalyzed.
3. Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
ensuring that all relevant patient information is recorded.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples at the start of each day and
whenever a new lot of reagents is used.
2. Document and review QC results, ensuring they are within
established control limits before testing patient samples.
3. Investigate and resolve any QC failures before analyzing
patient samples. Record corrective actions taken in the QC log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS. Manually input
results if the automatic transmission is disrupted.
2. Review and verify results in the LIS before they are released.
Ensure all critical values are highlighted and documented
according to the laboratory's critical result policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal serum osmolality: 275 – 295 mOsm/kg
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with osmolality
measurements. Samples exhibiting these conditions should be
handled according to laboratory protocols.
• Ensure that samples are free of large particles or clots, which can
obstruct the measurement process.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction manuals for the osmometer and quality
control materials
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
osmolality testing
12. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain all records of calibration, quality control, patient results, and
any troubleshooting or maintenance activities performed on the
osmometer in appropriate logs/reports.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Consult the manufacturer's manual for specific troubleshooting
steps if issues arise with the osmometer.
2. If unresolved, notify the supervisory staff for further guidance.
3. Document all troubleshooting activities and resolutions in the
instrument maintenance log.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure
precise and consistent results in the measurement of serum
osmolality, contributing to accurate clinical diagnosis and
patient management.
