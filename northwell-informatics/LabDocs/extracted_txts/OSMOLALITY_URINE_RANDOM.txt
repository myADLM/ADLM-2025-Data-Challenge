OSMOLALITY, URINE, RANDOM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the determination of urine
osmolality, ensuring accurate and consistent results for clinical
interpretation.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the handling and processing of random
urine specimens to measure osmolality in the clinical laboratory
setting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
procedure in compliance with established protocols.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Random urine
◦ Collection: Collect a random urine sample in a clean, dry,
sterile container without any preservatives.
◦ Volume: Minimum volume required is 10 mL.
◦ Storage: Store the specimen at room temperature (15-25°C)
if analysis is performed within 2 hours; otherwise, refrigerate
at 2-8°C if delay in analysis is expected.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Osmometer, set to measure urine samples (e.g., Advanced
Instruments Model 3320)
◦ Calibrators and quality control solutions specific to the
osmometer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Appropriate laboratory glassware
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, goggles).
2. Ensure the osmometer is calibrated according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Prepare the urine specimen for analysis:
▪ For refrigerated samples, ensure they are brought to
room temperature before testing and mixed
thoroughly.
B. Measurement
1. Pipette a 100 µL aliquot of the urine sample into a sample
tube.
2. Load the sample into the osmometer following the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Initiate the measurement process as per the osmometer's
operational guidelines.
4. Record the osmolality result expressed in mOsm/kg.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples at both high and low osmolality
levels at the beginning of each shift, after an instrument
calibration, or as deemed necessary to ensure the accuracy
of analyses.
◦ Document the control results and verify that they fall within
the established control ranges before proceeding with
patient samples.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot the
osmometer according to the manufacturer's guidelines,
recalibrate if necessary, and reassay the control samples.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Urine osmolality results should be recorded and verified by
the technologist.
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) promptly.
◦ Ensure that results are correctly assigned to the respective
patient records.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal adult urine osmolality: 50-1200 mOsm/kg.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Samples contaminated with large amounts of other substances
(e.g., cleaning agents, excessive supplements) may yield
erroneous results.
1. CRITICAL VALUES
• There are no critical values established for urine osmolality in our
laboratory as it is a supporting diagnostic test.
1. REFERENCES
• Osmometer manufacturer’s manual.
• Laboratory quality assurance guidelines.
• Current clinical laboratory standards and guidelines.
1. RECORD REVIEW AND STORAGE
• Maintain all records of calibration, quality control results, patient
sample results, and any maintenance performed on the
osmometer for a minimum of 2 years.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This procedure will be reviewed annually or as needed according
to policy changes and updates.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the reliability,
accuracy, and traceability of urine osmolality results, maintaining
compliance with clinical and regulatory requirements.
