OSMOTIC FRAGILITY, ERYTHROCYTES STANDARD OPERATING
PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to describe the
methodology for determining the osmotic fragility of
erythrocytes. The osmotic fragility test measures the resistance
of erythrocytes to hemolysis when exposed to varying
concentrations of a hypotonic sodium chloride solution.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
authorized to perform and document erythrocyte osmotic
fragility testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to ensure that erythrocyte osmotic fragility
testing is performed and documented accurately. Supervisors
are responsible for verifying that personnel are trained in this
SOP and that the test is performed according to established
protocols.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Fresh whole blood collected in EDTA or
heparin tube.
• Volume: A minimum of 2 mL whole blood.
• Specimen Storage: Specimens should be kept at room
temperature and tested within 6 hours of collection. If testing
cannot be performed within 6 hours, refrigerate the specimen at
2-8°C and test within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples clotted or hemolyzed, or
samples older than 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Spectrophotometer or visible light absorbance reader
◦ Pipettes (calibrated): 1 mL, 2 mL
• Reagents:
◦ Sodium chloride (NaCl), analytical grade
◦ Distilled water
◦ Phosphate buffer (optional)
◦ Quality control materials
1. REAGENT PREPARATION
• Prepare NaCl solutions with concentrations ranging from 0.10% to
0.90% in 0.05% increments as follows:
◦ 0.10% NaCl: Mix 0.1 g NaCl in 99.9 mL distilled water
◦ 0.15% NaCl: Mix 0.15 g NaCl in 99.85 mL distilled water
◦ Continue preparing solutions up to 0.90% NaCl
◦ Store solutions at room temperature (20-26°C).
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
• Label all necessary tubes corresponding to the NaCl
concentrations prepared.
• Transfer 4 mL of each NaCl solution to each labeled tube.
• Allow solutions to equilibrate to room temperature.
B. Sample Preparation
• Gently mix the whole blood sample to ensure uniformity.
• Add 0.05 mL (50 µL) of the blood sample to each NaCl solution
tube.
• Gently invert each tube to mix the blood with the solution.
C. Incubation
• Incubate the tubes at room temperature (20-26°C) for 30 minutes,
gently mixing by inversion every 10 minutes.
D. Hemolysis Determination
• After the 30-minute incubation, centrifuge the tubes at 1500 g for
5 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the supernatant from each tube to clean
spectrophotometer cuvettes.
• Measure and record the absorbance of each supernatant at 540
nm using distilled water as the blank control.
• For quality control, run a negative control (normal saline) and
positive control (distilled water).
E. Calculations and Interpretation
• Convert the absorbance values to percentage hemolysis using
the following formula: % Hemolysis = (Absorbance of Sample /
Absorbance of Positive Control) × 100
• Plot the percentage hemolysis against the NaCl concentrations to
generate an osmotic fragility curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control samples (normal and abnormal controls) should be
run with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all control results in the QC log book and ensure they
fall within the established control range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the NaCl concentration at which 50% hemolysis occurs as
the osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes.
• Use site-specific reporting guidelines to enter the results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that samples are not contaminated or hemolyzed before
use.
• Osmotic fragility results must be interpreted in the context of
clinical findings and other laboratory tests.
