SOP: Analytical Procedure for Calculating Osmotic Gap in Feces
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for calculating the osmotic gap in feces
specimens. This diagnostic measurement is vital in distinguishing
between osmotic and secretory diarrhea, aiding clinicians in patient
diagnosis and treatment.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and interpreting the osmotic gap test in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the test
accurately, documenting all necessary data, and performing
necessary quality control procedures. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP and for taking
appropriate action when deviations from protocol occur.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• pH meter
• Refractometer or osmometer (for measurement of osmolarity)
• Serum chemistry analyzer
Reagents:
• Distilled water
• Calibrating solutions for osmometer/refractometer
• Feces diluent (if necessary)
Supplies:
• Sterile containers
• Disposable gloves
• Transfer pipettes
• Labeling materials
• Specimen storage solutions (if necessary)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Collection:
• Fecal specimens should be collected in a sterile container.
• Ensure the specimen is transported to the laboratory immediately
or within 24 hours if refrigerated at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable specimens include those contaminated with urine,
with delayed transport beyond 24 hours without refrigeration, or
improperly labeled.
B. Preparation of the Specimen:
• Mix the fecal specimen thoroughly to achieve a homogenous
sample.
• If necessary, dilute the specimen using a feces diluent to achieve
a manageable consistency for analysis.
• Spin the specimen in a centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 15 minutes to
separate the supernatant.
C. Measurement of Fecal Osmolarity:
• Calibrate the osmometer or refractometer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Measure and record the osmolarity of the fecal supernatant in
mOsm/kg.
D. Measurement of Electrolytes:
• Measure the concentrations of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+)
in the fecal sample using a serum chemistry analyzer.
• Record the values of Na+ and K+ in mmol/L.
E. Calculation of Osmotic Gap:
• Calculate the fecal osmotic gap using the formula: [ \text{Fecal
Osmotic Gap} = \text{Fecal Osmolarity} - 2 \times (\text{Na}^+ +
\text{K}^+) ]
• Record the calculated osmotic gap.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Calibration:
• Ensure all instruments are calibrated using appropriate calibrating
solutions before starting the measurements.
• Record all calibration data.
B. Internal Controls:
• Include known control samples with high and low osmolarity
values to ensure the accuracy and precision of the test.
• Record results of control samples and ensure they fall within
acceptable limits.
C. Corrective Actions:
• If control samples fall outside acceptable limits, recalibrate
instruments or troubleshoot equipment as necessary.
• Document all corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Documentation:
• Record all measurements and calculations in the appropriate
logbook or electronic system.
• Ensure all entries are dated, timed, and initialed by the technician
performing the test.
B. Interpretation:
• Reference ranges for the fecal osmotic gap:
◦ Normal: 50–100 mOsm/kg
◦ Osmotic diarrhea: <50 mOsm/kg
◦ Secretory diarrhea: >100 mOsm/kg
C. Communication:
• Report results to the requesting clinician via laboratory
information system (LIS)
• Notify clinicians directly for critical results or values requiring
immediate attention.
