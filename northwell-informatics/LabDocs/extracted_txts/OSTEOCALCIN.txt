Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Osteocalcin
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable measurement of osteocalcin
levels in patient samples. Osteocalcin is an important marker for
bone metabolism, and its measurement must be performed with
precision and adherence to laboratory standards.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
1. Specimen Type: Serum is the preferred specimen type.
2. Collection:
◦ Collect 5 mL of blood in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes at room
temperature, but not more than 60 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Stability:
◦ Serum should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
◦ For long-term storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
4. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume.
◦ Samples collected in tubes other than red-top or SST.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
1. Equipment:
◦ Refrigerators and freezers with temperature monitoring.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Analytical instruments (e.g., ELISA reader or automated
immunoassay analyzer).
2. Reagents:
◦ Osteocalcin assay kit (ensure the kit is within expiry date).
◦ Quality control materials (negative and positive controls).
◦ Calibrators.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
• Prepare quality control and calibrators as per manufacturer
instructions.
B. Calibration
• Calibrate the analytical instrument with osteocalcin-specific
calibrators.
• Record calibration results and verify before proceeding with
sample analysis.
C. Quality Control
• Run both positive and negative controls at the start of each batch
of samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within established ranges.
• Record and review QC results before reporting patient results.
D. Sample Analysis
• Load patient specimens, controls, and calibrators into the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Initiate the assay protocol as per the instrument's guidelines.
• Record the assay results as indicated by the instrument.
E. Result Validation
• Review all results to ensure they meet quality control criteria.
• Investigate and troubleshoot any out-of-range controls or
unexpected values.
• Verify results before releasing.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all results, including controls and calibrators, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure data entry is accurate and complete.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Technologist will review the results for accuracy.
◦ Results are verified in the LIS before being released to the
electronic medical record (EMR).
3. Critical Results:
◦ Any critical osteocalcin results must be communicated to the
responsible healthcare provider as per critical result
reporting guidelines.
6. REFERENCE RANGES
1. Normal Range:
◦ Adult males: 11-50 ng/mL
◦ Adult females: 8-32 ng/mL (Premenopausal)
◦ Adult females: 7-22 ng/mL (Postmenopausal)
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for detailed information on
osteocalcin assay limitations, potential interferences, and assay-
specific precautions.
8. REFERENCES
Manufacturer's instructions for osteocalcin assay kit.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Instrument Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance on the analytical instrument as
per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Document all maintenance activities.
2. Staff Training:
◦ Ensure all staff are trained and competent in performing
osteocalcin assays.
◦ Provide ongoing education and training updates.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this SOP
to ensure accurate and reliable results. Supervisors must oversee
adherence to this protocol and address any issues or deviations from
the procedure.
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
comply with the latest standards and manufacturer
recommendations.
