Standard Operating Procedure for Osteocalcin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for osteocalcin in serum specimens. This SOP is
intended to ensure precise and accurate osteocalcin measurement,
maintain integrity and compliance with CLIA regulations, and to guide
technical personnel in consistent execution.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of serum osteocalcin levels using immunoassay methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to perform osteocalcin
testing as outlined in this SOP, including sample preparation, assay
performance, result validation and documentation. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring all personnel are trained and competent in
this procedure, monitoring the quality of test results, and
implementing corrective actions when necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum
• Collect blood using a standard venipuncture technique into a SST
(serum separator tube), allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes,
then centrifuge at 1500–2000 x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature to obtain the serum.
Specimen Stability and Storage:
• Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, serum should be aliquoted and frozen at
-20°C or below. Ensure frozen samples are completely thawed
and mixed thoroughly before analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
• Serum specimens that have not been properly separated from
clot within 2 hours of collection.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Osteocalcin immunoassay reagent kit (follow manufacturer’s
instructions for storage and handling)
Equipment:
• Automated chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
Abbott ARCHITECT, Roche Cobas, or equivalent)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Calibrators, controls, and quality control materials as specified by
the assay manufacturer
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure that all reagents are brought to room temperature
before use, if required.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer using the
appropriate osteocalcin calibrators.
◦ Maintain records of calibration data and verify that
calibration meets the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning of each
testing day, with each assay batch, and after any major
maintenance or calibration.
◦ Document the QC results and ensure they are within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient sample
testing.
◦ If QC is out of range, troubleshoot, take corrective action,
and re-run QC until acceptable results are obtained.
4. Sample Preparation:
◦ Label sample tubes with appropriate patient identification.
◦ Pipette the required volume of serum into the sample cups
or tubes as per the immunoassay analyzer requirements.
5. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and controls onto
the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Follow the specific operating instructions of the analyzer to
initiate the assay.
◦ Ensure that the assay runs without interruption and monitor
the analyzer for any error messages.
6. Result Validation:
◦ Upon completion of the assay, review the test results
generated by the analyzer.
◦ Verify that QC results are within the acceptable limits for that
run.
◦ Validate patient results and investigate any flags or errors
that may indicate potential issues with sample quality or
assay performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the osteocalcin results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) following laboratory-specific reporting guidelines.
• Results that are outside the reference ranges or critical values
must be flagged and communicated to the requesting clinician as
per laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for osteocalcin may vary based on age, sex,
and population. Refer to the specific manufacturer's guidelines or
established laboratory reference ranges.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure awareness of and adherence to the limitations as
specified in the kit insert. Factors such as cross-reactivity,
interference, or matrix effects should be considered.
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL
• Participate in external proficiency testing for osteocalcin as
available.
• Review QC and patient data regularly to ensure ongoing assay
performance.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• For any technical difficulties or flagged results, refer to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
• Document all troubleshooting steps taken and notify the
supervisor if the issue cannot be resolved.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the osteocalcin reagent kit.
• Laboratory policies and guidelines.
• Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
documents.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibration, QC, and patient results.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and maintenance
performed on the assay equipment.
