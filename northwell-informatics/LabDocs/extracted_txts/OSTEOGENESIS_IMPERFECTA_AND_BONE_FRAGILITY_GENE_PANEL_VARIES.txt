Imperfecta (OI) and Bone Fragility, screened for mutations.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput method
used to sequence genes in the panel.
• Bioinformatics Analysis: Computational analysis used for
interpreting sequencing data and identifying relevant genetic
variants.
1. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
• NGS Instrument (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Agilent TapeStation or Bioanalyzer
• Library Preparation Kits
• Sequencing Reagents and Consumables
• Bioinformatics Software (e.g., GATK, ANNOVAR)
• Quality Control (QC) Materials and Standards
1. PROCEDURE
A. Library Preparation:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Use standardized protocols for DNA extraction from patient
blood or tissue samples.
◦ Ensure DNA purity and concentration meet predefined
criteria.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until use.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Amplify target regions of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta and
Bone Fragility genes using specific primers.
◦ Ensure positive and negative controls are included.
3. Library Construction:
◦ Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation using
library preparation kits.
◦ Purify libraries using magnetic beads as per kit protocols.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Evaluate library size distribution and concentration using
TapeStation or Bioanalyzer.
◦ Ensure libraries are free of adapter dimers and appropriate
size distributions are achieved.
B. Sequencing:
1. Loading the Sequencer:
◦ Dilute libraries to sequencer-specific concentrations.
◦ Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing instrument.
◦ Enter appropriate run parameters and start the sequencing
run.
2. Monitoring:
◦ Monitor the sequencing process to ensure successful run
completion.
◦ Address any error messages or interruptions immediately.
C. Bioinformatics Analysis:
1. Data Pre-processing:
◦ Perform base calling and convert raw sequencing data to
FASTQ files.
◦ Trim adapter sequences and filter low-quality reads.
2. Alignment:
◦ Align high-quality reads to the human reference genome
(e.g., GRCh38).
◦ Use software like BWA or Bowtie for sequence alignment.
3. Variant Calling:
◦ Identify genetic variants using tools such as GATK or
FreeBayes.
◦ Annotate variants with clinical significance using databases
like ClinVar.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Analyze variants in the context of known pathogenic
mutations related to Osteogenesis Imperfecta and Bone
Fragility.
◦ Confirm findings through a second technologist or
automated verification system.
5. Quality Control and Validation:
◦ Perform internal quality controls, including coverage
analysis.
◦ Validate variants in a subset of samples using Sanger
sequencing or other confirmatory methods.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Generating Reports:
◦ Compile a detailed report including identified variants, their
clinical significance, and potential implications.
◦ Ensure data integrity and accuracy before finalizing the
report.
2. Verification and Sign-out:
◦ Supervisor or qualified senior technologist reviews the
report.
◦ Sign out results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for electronic delivery to the ordering physician.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Regularly perform quality checks on all reagents, consumables,
and equipment.
• Maintain and calibrate instruments per manufacturer instructions.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
• Participation in external proficiency testing programs for genetic
testing.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Mutations outside targeted regions may not be detected.
• Inadequate sample quality can affect test accuracy.
• Variant interpretation is limited by current knowledge and
available databases.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's Manuals for NGS instruments and library
preparation kits.
• GATK Best Practices Workflow Documentation.
• Clinical guidelines from professional genetic testing organizations.
1. REVISIONS:
• This protocol will be reviewed annually or when significant
changes in procedures or equipment occur.
• Updates based on new scientific evidence, technological
advancements, or regulatory requirements.
