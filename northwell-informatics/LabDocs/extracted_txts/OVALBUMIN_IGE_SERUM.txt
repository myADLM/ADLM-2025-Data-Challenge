Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Ovalbumin-Specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the quantification of ovalbumin-
specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples using Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of generating ovalbumin-specific IgE results in
serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay and documenting results according to this protocol.
• Lab supervisors are responsible for ensuring all personnel are
trained and competent in performing this assay.
• Quality Assurance (QA) personnel are responsible for
reviewing and verifying assay performance and compliance with
QC standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Specimen Collection: Collect blood in a non-coated or serum
separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot and then centrifuge
to separate the serum.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Specimen Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours or at -20°C for long-term storage.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA microplate reader
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• ELISA Kit for Ovalbumin-Specific IgE (includes microtiter plates
coated with ovalbumin allergen, enzyme conjugate, substrate
solution, stop solution, and calibrators)
• Plate shaker
• Deionized water
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Controls: Include both positive and negative controls in each
assay run.
• Calibration: Calibrate the ELISA reader according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with each use.
• Validation: Validate each new lot of reagents by running known
standards and controls.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and
controls as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Plate Preparation: Label the microtiter plate wells for samples,
standards, and controls.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Pipette 100 μL of each standard, control, and serum sample
into the designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash the plate with the wash buffer provided in the kit,
repeating wash steps as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for another 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Wash the plate as per the previous wash step.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of the substrate solution to each well.
6. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 15-20 minutes in the dark.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
8. Read the Plate:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using the ELISA
microplate reader within 30 min after stopping the reaction.
C. Result Calculation
1. Standard Curve: Plot a standard curve using the OD values of
the calibrators against their known concentrations.
2. Interpretation: Determine the concentration of ovalbumin-
specific IgE in serum samples from the standard curve.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analytical Range: Report results within the linear range of the
standard curve.
• Result Verification: Confirm the results by cross-checking with
quality control data before reporting.
• Documentation: Record the patient results, along with control
and calibrator details, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
9. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect results.
• Ensure the serum is not contaminated, as this may interfere with
the assay.

END OF PROTOCOL
This protocol shall be reviewed and updated as necessary to comply
with new developments or regulatory changes.
Note for lab personnel: Always follow laboratory safety procedures,
wear appropriate PPE, and handle all specimens as potentially
infectious.
