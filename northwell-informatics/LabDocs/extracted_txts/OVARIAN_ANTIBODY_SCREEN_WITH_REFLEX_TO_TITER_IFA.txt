Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Ovarian Antibody
Screening with Reflex to Titer, IFA
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for the analytical phase of Ovarian
Antibody Screening with Reflex to Titer by Indirect
Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) in order to ensure accurate and
reliable results, maintain quality control, and provide timely and
appropriate follow-up testing when necessary.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of
Ovarian Antibody Screening with Reflex to Titer, IFA in the Clinical
Immunology Laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• The designated technologist or medical laboratory scientist is
responsible for performing the assays following this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance,
and that personnel are adequately trained and competency is
maintained.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Ovarian Antibodies (OA): Autoantibodies directed against
ovarian tissue, indicative of autoimmune oophoritis.
• Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA): A sensitive method
for detecting specific antibodies by the use of fluorescence-
labeled secondary antibodies and microscopic evaluation.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Storage: Store sera at 2-8°C if testing within 72 hours; for longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
6. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Substrate slides with ovarian tissue sections
• PBS Buffer (pH 7.4)
• Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-human IgG
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Microscopy slides
• Light microscope equipped for fluorescence
7. PROCEDURE
A) Initial Ovarian Antibody Screening:
1. Preparation of Substrate Slides: a. Allow the ovarian tissue
section slides to equilibrate to room temperature if stored under
refrigeration. b. Place slides in a humid chamber.
2. Serum Dilution and Incubation: a. Dilute patient serum 1:10
in PBS. b. Apply 50 µL of diluted serum to the slides and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in a humidified
chamber.
3. Washing: a. Wash slides in PBS buffer gently for 5 minutes,
repeat washing 3 times to remove unbound antibodies.
4. Application of FITC-labeled Anti-Human IgG: a. Dilute FITC-
labeled anti-human IgG according to the manufacturer's
instructions. b. Apply 50 µL of the diluted conjugate to each
slide and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
5. Final Wash: a. Wash the slides in PBS buffer gently for 5
minutes, repeat washing 3 times.
6. Mounting: a. Add mounting medium and cover with a coverslip.
7. Microscopic Examination: a. Examine the slides under a
fluorescence microscope. b. Record the presence or absence
of fluorescence.
B) Reflex to Titer, if Initial Screen is Positive:
1. Serial Dilution: a. Prepare serial dilutions of the patient serum
(1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, etc. in PBS).
2. Repeat IFA Procedure: a. Follow steps 1-7 for each dilution. b.
Determine the endpoint titer as the highest dilution at which
specific fluorescence is detectable.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Control Sera: Include positive and negative control sera with
each batch of tests.
• Quality Control Checks: Verify that controls perform within
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
• Instrument Maintenance: Regular maintenance and calibration
of the fluorescence microscope as per manufacturer guidelines.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ovarian Antibody Screen:
◦ Negative: No fluorescence
◦ Positive: Presence of specific fluorescence; proceed to titer
determination.
• Reflex to Titer:
◦ Report the endpoint titer of the serum.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
interpretation.
• Frozen and thawed samples might lead to inaccurate results.
• Ensure proper labelling and handling to avoid cross-
contamination.

12. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all testing details, including specimen ID, date and time
of analysis, results, and technologist initials, in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Maintain records of quality control results and instrument
maintenance logs.
