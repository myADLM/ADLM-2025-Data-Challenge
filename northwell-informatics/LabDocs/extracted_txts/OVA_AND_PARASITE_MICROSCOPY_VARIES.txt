Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Ova and Parasite Microscopy Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for ova and parasite (O&P) microscopy
analysis. This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability
in the examination and reporting of parasitic specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing O&P
microscopy analysis as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff
to report any discrepancies or issues during the analysis to a
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Ova and parasite microscopy analysis involves examining stool
specimens to identify and report the presence of intestinal parasites,
including eggs (ova), larvae, trophozoites, and cysts.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Preparation
1. Specimen Acceptance Criteria
◦ Fresh stool samples are preferred and should be collected
in clean, dry, leak-proof containers.
◦ Preserved samples in formalin, SAF (sodium acetate-acetic
acid-formalin), or other fixatives are acceptable.
◦ Unacceptable specimens include those that are unlabeled,
incorrectly preserved, or contaminated.
2. Specimen Preparation
◦ Mix the stool specimen thoroughly to ensure consistency.
◦ Prepare slides using the sediment concentration method or
direct smear, as prescribed.
◦ Use both iodine and saline for staining, as recommended.
B. Microscopy Examination
1. Equipment and Reagents
◦ Microscopes (bright-field and phase-contrast capability).
◦ Glass slides, coverslips, iodine solution, saline, and
immersion oil.
◦ Gloves and appropriate PPE.
2. Microscopy Procedure
1. Add a small amount of stool sample onto a glass slide.
2. Apply a drop of iodine solution or saline to the sample.
3. Cover the sample with a coverslip to avoid air bubbles.
4. Examine under the microscope at 10x and 40x
magnifications.
5. Identify and record any parasitic forms (ova, cysts, larvae,
etc.)
C. Quality Control
1. Daily Quality Control
◦ Ensure microscope calibration and maintenance.
◦ Use positive and negative controls to verify staining
reagents effectiveness.
◦ Review prepared slides regularly to ensure consistent
quality.
D. Interpretation and Reporting Results
1. Result Interpretation
◦ Identify and categorize any detected parasite according to
taxonomy (e.g., helminths, protozoa).
◦ Record observations clearly in laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Reporting Results
◦ Report negative results if no parasites are observed.
◦ Report positive results with the type and stage of the
parasite found.
◦ Use appropriate clinical terminology and reference ranges.
E. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
1. If Results Are Unsatisfactory
◦ Check reagent expiry dates and replace if necessary.
◦ Ensure correct specimen preparation techniques.
◦ Re-examine slides, and if necessary, repeat the analysis
with a new sample.
2. Notify Supervisor
◦ Report any issues with the microscopy equipment or
reagents promptly.
◦ Document corrective actions taken in the laboratory log.
3. REFERENCE MATERIALS
• Standard reference texts for parasitic identification.
• Laboratory guidelines and manuals.
• Package inserts for staining reagents.
1. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
Ova and Parasite Microscopy.
• Manufacturer instructions for storage and handling of reagents
and equipment.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Laboratory logbook entry of daily QC checks.
• Results entry into LIS.
• Documentation of any issues and corrective actions taken.
This SOP outlines the proper steps for O&P microscopy to ensure
reliable and accurate results while maintaining proper documentation
and quality control measures.
