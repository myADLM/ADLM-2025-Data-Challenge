Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Ova and
Parasites in Fecal Specimens
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of ova and parasites in
fecal specimens, particularly for patients with recent travel history or
those who are immunocompromised. This protocol ensures the
accurate identification of parasitic infections to guide appropriate
treatment.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the analysis according to this procedure. Any
deviations or issues encountered during the process should be
reported to a supervisor promptly.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
- Freshly collected fecal specimens submitted in sterile, leak-proof containers, ideally received in the laboratory within 1-2 hours of collection.
- Preserved fecal specimens using a 10% formalin solution or a suitable transport medium such as PARASAFE or TOTAL-FIX.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens received in non-sterile containers.
- Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without preservation.
- Specimens with no patient identification or collection date/time indicated on the container or requisition.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Biological safety cabinet (BSC)
◦ Light microscope
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Slides and cover slips
◦ Lugol's iodine solution
◦ Saline solution (0.85% NaCl)
◦ 10% formalin
◦ Zinc sulfate flotation solution (specific gravity 1.18)
◦ Parapak ULTRA ECOFIX-coded yello or blue
◦ Applicator sticks
◦ Protective gloves
◦ PPE (lab coat, face shield/goggles)
3. PROCEDURE
A) Direct Microscopy
1. Mix the fecal specimen thoroughly with an applicator stick.
2. Prepare a wet mount by placing a small amount (about
the size of a match head) on a slide.
3. Add 1-2 drops of saline solution and mix.
4. Place a cover slip on the slide and examine under the
microscope for motile trophozoites and cysts.
B) Concentration Technique
Flotation Method (Zinc Sulfate):
1. Add an equal volume of 10% formalin to the fecal
specimen and mix thoroughly.
2. Filter the mixture through gauze into a centrifuge tube.
3. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes.
4. Pour off the supernatant, leaving the sediment at the
bottom.
5. Resuspend the sediment in 3-4 mL of zinc sulfate
solution.
6. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes.
7. Carefully remove the tube and add a cover slip to the
surface of the zinc sulfate solution.
8. After 10 minutes, lift the cover slip and place it on a clean
slide.
9. Examine under the microscope for ova and parasites.
Sedimentation Method:
1. Mix an equal volume of 10% formalin with the fecal specimen
and let it stand for at least 30 minutes to fix the eggs and
larvae.
2. Strain the mixture through gauze into a clean test tube.
3. Centrifuge at 500x g for 10 minutes.
4. Carefully decant the supernatant.
5. Add 7 mL of ethyl acetate and 3 mL of 10% formalin to the
sediment.
6. Shake vigorously for 30 seconds.
7. Centrifuge at 500x g for 10 minutes.
8. Loosen the debris layer with an applicator stick and decant the
supernatant.
9. Resuspend the sediment with a small amount of formalin.
10. Place a drop of the sediment on a slide, add a drop of iodine,
and cover with a cover slip.
11. Examine the slide under the microscope for ova and parasites.
C) Reporting Results
◦ Record observations, including the type and quantity of
parasites found.
◦ Utilize established parasitology keys and reference
materials for accurate identification.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Positive results should be reviewed and verified by a second
trained technologist.
◦ Report findings to the requesting physician. If the patient is
immunocompromised or has recent travel history, note this
on the report as it may influence interpretation and
treatment.
Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control samples with each batch of
patient specimens.
• Ensure all solutions and reagents are within their expiry dates and
properly stored.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of microscopy
equipment.
Reference Intervals:
• Ova and parasites: None detected in healthy individuals.
Method Limitations:
• Certain parasites may not be detectable if the sample is not
properly collected, preserved, or analyzed promptly.
• Microscopy skill and experience are critical for accurate
identification.
