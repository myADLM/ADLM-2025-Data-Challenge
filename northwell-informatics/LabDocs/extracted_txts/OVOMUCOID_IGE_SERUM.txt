Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for OVOMUCOID IgE
(Serum)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a comprehensive and standardized procedure for
generating accurate and reliable results for OVOMUCOID IgE testing
in serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Staff: Ensure the procedures outlined in this SOP
are carried out correctly.
• Supervisors: Verify that staff are properly trained and that all
procedures are followed appropriately.
• All Staff: Identify and correct any issues affecting testing quality.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum.
• Specimen Stability: Transport and process specimens within 24
hours at 2-8°C, or store frozen at -20°C for up to 1 month.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP or
equivalent)
• OVOMUCOID-specific IgE reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls for IgE testing
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for data entry and result
reporting
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using the calibrators specific
to the OVOMUCOID IgE assay.
• Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quality Control:
• Run at least two levels of internal quality control (QC) materials
(high and low) before processing patient samples each day.
• Document QC results and ensure they fall within the acceptable
range provided by the manufacturer.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot following
the manufacturer’s recommendations and repeat QC until results
are within acceptable limits.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum specimens at room temperature if previously
frozen.
◦ Mix specimens gently by inverting several times.
◦ Centrifuge specimens at 1500 g for 10 minutes to remove
any residual cells or debris.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls according to
the manufacturer's guidelines on the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Ensure that all necessary reagents and consumables are
available and properly loaded into the analyzer.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Program the analyzer according to the specific protocol for
IgE OVOMUCOID.
◦ Initiate the assay run, ensuring that all sample and reagent
positions are correctly identified in the system.
4. Data Collection and Analysis:
◦ Once the run is complete, review the output data from the
analyzer.
◦ Verify that all controls are within the acceptable range and
that no flags or error messages indicate issues with the
assay.
5. Result Validation:
◦ Cross-check results in the LIS for accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Apply any necessary dilution factors manually if samples
were diluted before testing.
◦ If results are outside the expected range or show any
discrepancies, repeat the assay on a fresh aliquot of the
specimen.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results in the LIS.
• Document any abnormal or critical results according to laboratory
protocol.
• Notify the requesting physician of any critical results as per lab
policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC fails, do not release patient results until the issue is
resolved.
• Recalibrate the instrument if necessary, and repeat QC.
• Check instrument maintenance logs for any recent issues that
might affect performance.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal IgE levels: ≤0.35 kU/L.
• Reporting Units: kU/L (kilo-Units per Liter)
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
performance.
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid any pre-analytical issues.

Notes:
• This protocol is applicable until updated with improved procedures
or reagents and is reviewed periodically for compliance with
regulatory standards.
This protocol ensures consistency and reliability in the analytical
phase of OVOMUCOID IgE serum testing, adhering to best
laboratory practice and compliance with regulatory standards.
