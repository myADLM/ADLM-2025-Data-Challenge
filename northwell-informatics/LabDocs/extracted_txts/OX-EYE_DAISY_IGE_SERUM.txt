Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for OX-EYE Daisy, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of quantifying
IgE levels specific to OX-EYE Daisy allergens using serum samples
in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The procedure includes preparation,
testing, quality control, and result documentation.
2. SPECIMEN
Specimen Accepted:
• 5-10 mL of blood sample collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Serum samples stored at 2-8°C, preferably tested within 48 hours
of collection.
• Serum samples frozen at -20°C or lower can be stored for up to 3
months. Thaw at room temperature before analysis.
Specimen Unacceptable:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis.
• Specimens not properly labelled.
• Specimens stored or transported at improper temperatures
leading to degradation.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
Reagents:
• Allergen-specific IgE reagent kits for OX-EYE Daisy
• Calibration controls specific for IgE measurement
• Quality control material (positive and negative)
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Pipette tips
• Gloves
• 70% Ethanol or an appropriate disinfectant for cleaning surfaces
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Bring serum samples to room temperature if frozen.
2. Mix serum samples gently but thoroughly to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer following the
manufacturer's instructions, ensuring all supplies and reagents
are available and within expiry date.
B. Manual Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples in SST tubes for 10 minutes at 3500
RPM.
2. Transfer the supernatant (serum) into clean microtubes or cups
for analysis.
C. Automated Sample Analysis:
1. Load serum samples into the immunoassay analyzer's sample
rack.
2. Load calibration standards, reagent kits, and QC materials into
designated positions on the analyzer.
3. Configure the assay run parameters specific to OX-EYE Daisy
IgE as defined in the assay kit insert.
4. Initiate the run, monitoring analyzer alerts and messages for
errors or sample issues.
5. Upon completion, review initial analyzer results for any flags,
message codes, or data inconsistencies.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform both positive and negative quality control assays
before analyzing patient samples. Follow site-specific QC
protocols.
2. Log QC results immediately post-analysis, including date, time,
and initials of the technologist.
3. Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
6. RESULT REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Results transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
should be reviewed for flags or error codes.
2. Confirm that results align with expected values for the control
samples.
3. Flag critical values and follow the established protocol for
urgent reporting to the requesting physician.
4. Document results accurately in the LIS, using approved
reference ranges and comments for results outside
expectations.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals for IgE specific to OX-EYE Daisy will be
provided in the reagent kit's product insert or as determined by
validated internal procedures.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations concerning
cross-reactivity, sensitivity, specificity, or other assay constraints.

By following this SOP, we ensure consistent, accurate, and timely
quantification of IgE levels specific to OX-EYE Daisy allergens in
serum samples, thus maintaining high standards of testing and
patient care.
