STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
OXALATE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for oxalate in 24-hour urine specimens. This
procedure ensures reliable and accurate quantification of urinary
oxalate for clinical diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel involved in the analysis must
adhere to this procedure. It is the responsibility of the analytical staff
to follow the protocol precisely to ensure the quality of results and
timely reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 24-hour urine collection in a clean, appropriately labeled container
with an acid preservative (6N HCl or 6N H₂SO₄) added at the start
of the collection.
• Total collection volume must be measured and recorded.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Any specimen with missing date/time of collection.
• Inadequately preserved urine specimens.
• Specimens received in laboratory greater than 24 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
Note: Ensure the specimen is refrigerated during collection and
transport to the laboratory.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• pH Meter
• Pipettes
• Test tubes and racks
• HPLC or Ion Chromatography system with proper oxalate
application
• Oxalate standards and internal controls
• Acidified urine preservative
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Verify patient information and collection time on the specimen
label.
2. Measure the total urine volume accurately.
3. Mix the urine thoroughly and record the volume.
B) Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Aliquot 10 mL of mixed 24-hour urine into a clean centrifuge
tube.
2. Adjust the sample’s pH to below 2 using concentrated
hydrochloric acid (6N HCl).
3. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any precipitates.
4. Transfer the supernatant into a new labeled test tube for
analysis.
C) Analytical Procedure
1. Calibrate the HPLC or Ion Chromatography System according
to the manufacturer's instructions and SOP.
2. Prepare standard solutions and quality control materials.
3. Inject the sample into the system as per the specified method
for oxalate analysis.
4. Run the quality control and standard solutions to verify system
accuracy before sample analysis.
D) Result Interpretation
1. Obtain chromatograms and identify oxalate peaks.
2. Quantify oxalate based on peak areas or heights in comparison
to the standard curve.
3. Ensure results fall within acceptable QC limits before validation.
E) Reporting Results
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify that all relevant data (patient information, total volume,
concentration) are accurately recorded.
3. Review results, if any deviations or unusual findings occurred,
notify the supervisor.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control
• Perform daily system checks using control materials at different
concentrations.
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for maintenance and
calibration of analytical equipment.
• Record all QC activities and any corrective actions in QC logs.
External Quality Assurance
• Participate in accredited external proficiency testing for oxalate
analysis.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure acidification step is performed accurately to avoid oxalate
precipitation.
• Avoid sample contamination during processing.
• Refer to the instrument's manual and generated data for any
calculation limitations.
