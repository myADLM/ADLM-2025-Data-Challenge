Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Oxalate Analysis, Hemodialysate
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantitative analysis of oxalate
concentrations in hemodialysate samples. The aim is to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results that can assist in the
clinical management of patients undergoing hemodialysis.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the oxalate analysis following this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure and
addressing any anomalies or issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable specimens:
• Hemodialysate samples collected during the dialysis process
should be collected in sterile, non-reactive containers specifically
designed for fluid sample collection.
• The sample volume should be minimally 10 mL to ensure
adequate quantity for analysis and potential confirmatory testing.
• The collected sample should be stored and transported at 2-8°C
and must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection to ensure
integrity.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Samples not stored within the specified temperature range.
• Specimens that are contaminated, inadequately labeled, or with
insufficient volume.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) system
• Oxalate standard solutions (traceable to NIST standards)
• Mobile phase: Methanol and water mixture (70:30 v/v) with 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid
• Sample filtration units (0.45 µm filters)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Calibration curve for oxalate standards (range: 0-50 µg/mL)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the mobile phase mixture and degas it using a
suitable method (e.g., ultrasonication).
◦ Prepare working oxalate standard solutions for calibration
using serial dilution of the stock standard solution.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the hemodialysate sample thoroughly using a vortex
mixer.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
◦ Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter membrane
into a clean vial.
3. HPLC System Setup:
◦ Initialize and calibrate the HPLC system following the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Inject calibration standards to generate a calibration curve.
◦ Ensure the column and detector parameters are set
according to the oxalate method requirements.
B. Analysis
1. Sample Injection:
◦ Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system.
2. Chromatography:
◦ Run the chromatographic analysis using the specified
mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
◦ Record the retention time and peak area for oxalate.
3. Data Integration:
◦ Using the software, integrate the oxalate peak and compare
with the calibration curve to determine the concentration in
the sample.
C. Quality Control:
• Include at least one blank, one low-level, and one high-level
quality control specimen with each batch of samples.
• Acceptability criteria: The quality control specimens must fall
within ±2 standard deviations of the expected value.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the oxalate concentration in µg/mL.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a laboratory
technologist before being entered into the LIS.
• Critical Results: Any concentration indicative of potential clinical
concern should be promptly communicated to the responsible
healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for oxalate concentration in hemodialysate
should be established based on validated clinical data or specific
literature references.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of the HPLC system.
• Document all quality control measures and any corrective actions
taken.
• In case of an instrument malfunction or suspect results, reanalyze
the sample and/or consult the designated supervisor.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interfering substances in the sample may affect the accuracy of
the oxalate measurement.
• Inadequate sample preparation may result in erroneous results.
