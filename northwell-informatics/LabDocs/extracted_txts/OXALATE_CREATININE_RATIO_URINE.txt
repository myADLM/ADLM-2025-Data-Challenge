STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) OXALATE/
CREATININE RATIO, URINE
1. PURPOSE This procedure describes the steps necessary for
the accurate analysis and reporting of the Oxalate/Creatinine
Ratio in urine samples.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained
in clinical chemistry assays to perform the Oxalate/Creatinine Ratio
analysis following the procedure outlined below. Supervisors must
ensure that all staff are adequately trained and adhere to this
protocol.
1. DEFINITION The Oxalate/Creatinine Ratio is a clinical test used
to evaluate the excretion of oxalate in urine, standardized
against creatinine excretion, to determine the risk of kidney
stone formation and monitor patients with known conditions
affecting oxalate metabolism.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS a. Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Random or 24-hour urine collection.
◦ If using a 24-hour urine sample, ensure proper mixing
before aliquoting for analysis.
b. Specimen Collection and Preservation:
◦ Collect urine in a clean, dry container.
◦ For random samples, ensure at least 10 mL of urine is
collected.
◦ For 24-hour collections, instruct the patient to keep the urine
in a cool place and add a preservative if necessary,
depending on laboratory guidelines (e.g., 25 mL of 6 mol/L
HCl).
c. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Urine specimens with visible contamination.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled with collection start and end
times for 24-hour collections.
◦ Specimens exceeding the stability timeline or with improper
preservation.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES a. Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Spectrophotometer or clinical chemistry analyzer
◦ Pipettes and tips
b. Reagents:
◦ Oxalate reagent (as specified by the manufacturer’s insert)
◦ Creatinine reagent (as specified by the manufacturer’s
insert)
◦ Calibration standards for oxalate and creatinine
◦ Quality control materials for oxalate and creatinine
c. Supplies:
◦ Urine collection containers
◦ Calibration and quality control record logs
◦ Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, eye
protection)
4. PROCEDURE a. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge each urine sample at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove any debris.
◦ Aliquot the clear supernatant for analysis.
b. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Run calibration standards for both oxalate and creatinine on
the analyzer.
◦ Ensure calibration curves meet acceptable criteria before
proceeding with sample analysis.
c. Analysis:
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples
onto the analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Set the analyzer to the appropriate method parameters for
oxalate and creatinine.
◦ Program the analyzer to run a complete assay for both
oxalate and creatinine, ensuring proper use of blank,
standards, and controls.
d. Quality Control:
◦ Run appropriate quality control materials for both oxalate
and creatinine with each batch of samples.
◦ Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective actions if
necessary.
e. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the Oxalate/Creatinine Ratio using the results
obtained from the analyzer.
◦ Formula: Oxalate/Creatinine Ratio = (urine oxalate
concentration (mmol/L) / urine creatinine concentration
(mmol/L))
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter the Oxalate/Creatinine Ratio results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by the
technologist before release.
◦ For critical or significantly abnormal results, follow laboratory
policy for notifying the requesting physician or healthcare
provider.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for Oxalate/Creatinine Ratio should be
established based on laboratory-specific data or provided
literature ranges.
◦ Common reference interval: < 0.1 mmol/mmol creatinine.
However, verify with the clinical guidelines applicable in your
lab's region.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform QC on each new lot of reagents and calibrators and
record results as per laboratory protocol.
◦ Participate in inter-laboratory proficiency testing to ensure
consistent and accurate results across different platforms
and labs.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure accurate timing and proper preservation of 24-hour
urine collections.
◦ Avoid delays in processing once samples are received in the
lab.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations
related to the oxalate and creatinine assays.
