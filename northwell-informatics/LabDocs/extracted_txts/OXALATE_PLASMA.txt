Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Oxalate, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for accurately
measuring plasma oxalate levels using calibrated instruments and
validated methods. The primary goal is to ensure quality and reliable
results through consistent procedures, effective documentation, and
proper equipment maintenance.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing plasma oxalate
measurement, documenting procedures, troubleshooting any issues
and adhering to this SOP.
It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any discrepancies that may
affect the oxalate assay results and bring them to the attention of a
supervisor.
Staff and supervisors must ensure that all monitoring and
documentation are performed according to this SOP, including any
required corrective actions.
1. DEFINITION
Plasma oxalate measurement is conducted using plasma samples
obtained from properly collected and prepared specimens. Analytical
instrumentation specific to plasma oxalate measurement should be
utilized.
1. PROCEDURE
Receiving Specimen: Ensure proper specimen collection and
handling to prevent degradation or contamination. Ensure plasma
samples arrive in the laboratory within the specified time frame and
are stored appropriately.
Specimen Handling:
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma from EDTA anticoagulated whole
blood.
• Specimen Stability: Plasma samples are stable for up to 48 hours
when stored at 2-8°C. If analysis cannot be performed within this
time frame, freeze the samples at ≤ -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Samples that are hemolyzed,
significantly lipemic, or not properly labeled.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Analytical instrumentation (e.g., ion chromatography, HPLC, etc.).
• Calibration standards and controls specific to plasma oxalate
measurement.
• Appropriate sample tubes (e.g., EDTA tubes).
• Calibration certificates for equipment.
Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature if required. Mix the
sample gently and thoroughly before analysis.
2. Ensure instrument calibration using traceable standards
specific to oxalate measurement as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Perform maintenance checks according to the instrument
manual.
Analytical Procedure:
1. Prepare reagents and calibration standards as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Follow instrument setup protocols and verify optimal operational
status.
3. Load plasma samples and calibration standards into the
instrument.
4. Run the calibration standards to verify instrument accuracy. If
calibration fails, troubleshoot as required and re-calibrate
before continuing.
5. Run the plasma samples following the instrument’s procedure
to measure oxalate levels.
6. Document all steps, including temperatures, times, and initials
of individuals performing the analysis.
Troubleshooting:
1. For any issues with instrument performance or sample analysis,
refer to the instrument manual troubleshooting section.
2. Notify the supervisor in the event of persistent unresolved
issues.
3. Document all troubleshooting actions.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (both high and low concentration)
at the beginning of each analytical batch to ensure accurate
measurement.
2. If quality control fails, reassess and recalibrate the instrument
as needed.
3. Record all quality control findings and corrective actions.
Reporting Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed
by the technologist.
2. Verify results for any discrepancies or unusual findings.
3. Apply results to the appropriate patient's record, following site-
specific reporting guidelines.
4. Any critical results should be communicated immediately to the
responsible clinician as per the established protocol.
Reference Intervals: Refer to validated laboratory-specific reference
intervals for plasma oxalate levels.
Documentation and Records: Keep accurate documentation of all
analytical procedures, instrument maintenance, calibration records,
quality control results, and patient results in dedicated logs as per
laboratory protocols.
References:
• Manufacturer’s instrument manuals and guidelines.
• Peer-reviewed literature on plasma oxalate measurement.
• Laboratory policy documentation for reference ranges and
reporting procedures.
Compliance: Ensure all procedures align with CLIA standards to
maintain accreditation and uphold quality laboratory practices.
By meticulously following this protocol, the laboratory ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible plasma oxalate readings, thus
contributing to proper diagnosis and treatment plans.
