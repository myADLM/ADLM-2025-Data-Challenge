Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Oxalate, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for oxalate, random, urine, ensuring
consistent and accurate test results. This document outlines the
steps to be taken, including specimen handling, equipment usage,
and result reporting.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all CLIA-certified laboratory staff responsible for
the analysis of oxalate in urine specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the assigned laboratory staff to follow this
protocol accurately and meticulously to ensure high-quality results.
Any deviations or issues must be reported to the supervisor
immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Type: Freshly voided random urine
◦ Volume: Minimum of 10 mL of urine
◦ Storage: If not analyzed immediately, specimens should be
stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours. Specimens
can be frozen at -20°C if the analysis will be done later than
24 hours.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Urine samples that have been
at room temperature for more than 24 hours or show
evidence of contamination or hemolysis.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Urine oxalate reagent kit
◦ Calibrators and controls for oxalate
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Urine collection cups
◦ Storage containers for refrigeration/freezing
◦ Sample tubes
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
◦ Ensure the specimen is well-mixed by inverting the
container several times.
◦ Aliquot the urine into a labeled sample tube if the entire
volume is not needed.
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 1,500 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
B. Reagent Preparation
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions included in the oxalate reagent kit.
◦ Calibrators and controls must be prepared and handled as
directed by the manufacturer.
C. Sample Analysis
◦ Set up the analytical instrument and ensure it is calibrated
correctly.
◦ Pipette the required volume of urine (typically 50-100 µL)
into the reaction vessel.
◦ Add the appropriate volumes of reagent to the sample
according to the oxalate reagent kit's protocol.
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at the specified temperature
and duration as instructed in the reagent kit.
◦ Measure the absorbance or other specified endpoint using
the designated analytical equipment.
◦ Record the raw data and calculate the concentrations using
the calibration curve generated from the calibrators.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples with each batch of urine
specimens to ensure accuracy and precision.
◦ Record all control results and validate that they fall within
the acceptable range before reporting patient results.
◦ If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's guidelines and reanalyze
the samples.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter all patient results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results for accuracy before they are
released.
◦ Any results that fall outside the reference interval should be
flagged and reported with comments as necessary.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for oxalate in urine should be defined
based on specific population studies or literature. Ensure to
update the reference intervals as needed based on the
latest clinical guidelines.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Certain medications and dietary influences can affect oxalate
levels in urine. Proper patient instructions should be given before
sample collection.
• Interfering substances in the urine can affect the accuracy of the
test results.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If issues are encountered during the testing process, refer to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide for the oxalate reagent kit.
• Document and report any persistent problems to the laboratory
supervisor for further investigation.
