Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Generating
Results for Oxazepam (Serax), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate
and precise analysis of Oxazepam (Serax) levels in serum samples
using chromatography techniques. This includes steps on
preparation, calibration, sample analysis, and quality control.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the clinical laboratory procedures used to
determine Oxazepam levels in human serum samples. The protocol
covers the full analytical process from sample preparation to result
reporting.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Oxazepam (Serax): A benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and
alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
• Serum: The clear liquid that can be separated from clotted blood,
in which Oxazepam levels will be measured.
• Chromatography: A method used for separating and analyzing
components in a mixture.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP and ensure that all procedures are performed accurately
and documented thoroughly. Any issues or deviations from the
protocol must be reported to the supervisor immediately.
5. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system
• Sample vials and caps
• Oxazepam reference standard
• Internal standards (e.g., Diazepam as an internal control)
• Mobile phases (e.g., Methanol, Water, Acetonitrile)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
6. CALIBRATION & QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration of the chromatography system using a series
of Oxazepam standards ranging from low to high concentrations
as specified by the method validation protocol.
• Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
Oxazepam concentrations to validate the accuracy and precision
of the analysis.
• Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples to ensure
system accuracy.
7. SAMPLE COLLECTION & PREPARATION
• Collect blood samples in a plain (red-top) tube.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the clotted specimen at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
• Separate the serum and transfer it to a clean, appropriately
labeled sample vial.
• Store samples at -20°C if analysis is not immediately performed.
8. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare Oxazepam standard solutions according to the
laboratory's validated protocol.
2. Prepare QC samples at three different levels: low, medium, and
high concentrations.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
2. Pipette a known volume (e.g., 0.5 mL) of serum into a labeled
sample vial.
3. Add an internal standard to the serum sample.
4. Mix gently and proceed with sample extraction procedures
(e.g., liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction) as
described in the method validation.
C) Chromatography Analysis:
1. Set up the chromatography system according to the
manufacturer's specifications and validated SOP.
2. Condition the column and equilibrate the system with the
mobile phase.
3. Inject a blank, calibration standards, QC samples, and serum
samples into the chromatographic system.
4. Record and analyze the chromatograms to quantify Oxazepam
levels in the samples.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatographic data using appropriate software.
2. Calculate the Oxazepam concentration in serum samples from
the calibration curve.
3. Evaluate QC results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range. If not, identify and correct any issues before reporting
patient results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
immediately after analysis.
• Review results for accuracy and consistency. Double-check any
samples with unexpected results.
• Report critical results to the requesting healthcare provider
promptly and document the communication process.
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE & DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough documentation of all procedures, including
calibration, sample preparation, and analysis.
• Record any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and compliance with regulatory standards.

monitoring.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the reliable
determination of Oxazepam levels in serum, contributing to effective
patient care and treatment management.
