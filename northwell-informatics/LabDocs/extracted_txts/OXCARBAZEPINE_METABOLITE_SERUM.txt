Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Oxcarbazepine Metabolite, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides the procedures for the analysis of oxcarbazepine
metabolite (10,11-Dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine) levels in
serum to ensure the generation of accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the quantification of oxcarbazepine
metabolite in serum samples received in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
analysis and ensuring accuracy and reliability according to this SOP.
Any issues or deviations should be promptly reported to the
supervisor.
4. DEFINITION
Oxcarbazepine Metabolite: 10,11-Dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine,
an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine.
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Adhere to all institutional laboratory safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all reagents and specimens according to standard
biosafety guidelines.
• Dispose of waste materials as per hazardous waste protocols.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen: Serum.
• Collection container: Red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Unprocessed serum: Refrigerated (2-8°C) up to 72 hours.
◦ Processed serum: Frozen (-20°C or lower) up to 1 month.
7. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC system with UV detector or LC-MS/MS system.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Standard laboratory glassware.
• Analytical balance.
8. REAGENTS AND STANDARDS
• Mobile phase solvent compatible with HPLC or LC-MS/MS.
• Internal standard for calibration (e.g., carbamazepine).
• Standard solution of oxcarbazepine metabolite.
• Deionized water.
• Methanol or acetonitrile.
9. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to come to room temperature.
2. Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Carefully transfer clear serum into labeled sample tubes.
B. Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls by spiking
known concentrations of oxcarbazepine metabolite into drug-
free serum.
2. Include a blank serum sample without oxcarbazepine
metabolite.
C. Extraction:
1. Pipette appropriate volume (e.g., 200 µL) of serum into
extraction tubes.
2. Add internal standard to each tube.
3. Add appropriate volume of extraction solvent (e.g., 1 mL of
methanol) and vortex mix for 30 seconds.
4. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
5. Carefully transfer supernatant into clean tubes, avoiding any
protein pellet.
D. HPLC or LC-MS/MS Setup:
1. Ensure system calibration and maintenance checks are
performed as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load mobile phase and samples onto the system.
3. Program the system with the appropriate chromatographic
conditions (e.g., flow rate, gradient, detection wavelength).
E. Analysis:
1. Inject calibration standards, quality control samples, and test
specimens into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS.
2. Record chromatograms and integrate peaks corresponding to
oxcarbazepine metabolite and internal standard.
3. Calculate the concentration of oxcarbazepine metabolite in the
serum samples using the standard calibration curve.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations with each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure quality control results fall within established limits before
accepting the batch.
• Confirm any out-of-range quality control results and troubleshoot
as necessary.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the test results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report oxcarbazepine metabolite concentrations in µg/mL or
µmol/L.
• Flag any critical or out-of-range results and notify the appropriate
healthcare provider.
12. REFERENCES
• OEM product inserts and user manuals for instruments and
reagents.
• Laboratory Quality Management System documentation.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on oxcarbazepine metabolite
analysis.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of calibration, quality control, and patient sample
results.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and actions taken to
resolve issues.
14. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed based on
new regulations, instrument updates, or procedural changes.
