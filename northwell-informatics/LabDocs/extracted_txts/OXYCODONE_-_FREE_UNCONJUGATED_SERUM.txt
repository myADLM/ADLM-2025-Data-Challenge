Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
OXYCODONE - FREE (UNCONJUGATED), SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the systematic procedure for the accurate
and reliable analysis of Oxycodone - Free (Unconjugated) in
serum specimens, ensuring quality and consistency in test
results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to follow this procedure precisely and consistently. It is the
responsibility of the supervisors and laboratory management to
ensure all personnel are trained and comply with the procedure,
including documentation and corrective actions.
1. DEFINITION This procedure refers to the analytical technique
utilized for the detection and quantification of free
(unconjugated) Oxycodone in serum samples.
2. PROCEDURE
3.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system or alternative validated analytical instrumentation
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator for sample storage (2-8°C)
• Freezers for sample storage (-20°C or lower, as appropriate)
• Certified Reference Material (CRM) of Oxycodone
• Commercially available Oxycodone Internal Standard
• Solvents: Methanol, Acetonitrile, Water (LC-MS grade)
• Mobile phase additives (e.g., formic acid, ammonium acetate)
• Serum quality control material
• Disposable polypropylene tubes or glass tubes
• Sample extraction and preparation kits (SPE cartridges or similar
validated method)
3.2 Preparation of Reagents and Standards 3.2.1 Preparation of
Calibration Standards Prepare a series of known concentrations of
Oxycodone in drug-free human serum by spiking certified reference
material:
• Stock solution: 1.0 mg/mL in methanol
• Prepare serial dilutions to generate calibration standards covering
the intended analytical measurement range (e.g., 0.5 to 100 ng/
mL).
Store calibration standards at -20°C when not in use.
3.2.2 Preparation of Quality Controls Prepare low, medium, and high
concentration quality controls in serum similarly to calibration
standards.
Store quality controls at -20°C when not in use.
3.3 Sample Preparation 3.3.1 Handling and Storage Store serum
specimens at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours or at -20°C for longer
storage.
3.3.2 Extraction Procedure Perform sample extraction using solid-
phase extraction (SPE) or a validated alternative.
• Thaw serum samples and allow them to reach room temperature.
• Add known volume of serum (e.g., 500 μL) to labeled
polypropylene tubes or glass vials.
• Add a fixed amount of internal standard solution to each sample.
• Vortex mix for 30-60 seconds.
• If using SPE:
◦ Condition SPE cartridge with methanol and equilibrate with
water.
◦ Load serum sample onto the cartridge and wash with washing
solutions as recommended in the extraction kit protocol.
◦ Elute Oxycodone with elution solvent.
• Evaporate eluted solution using gentle nitrogen stream or similar.
• Reconstitute dried extract in mobile phase solvent optimal for LC-
MS analysis.
3.4 Instrumentation Setup and Calibration 3.4.1 LC-MS/MS System
Setup
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for instrument setup and
calibration.
• Set appropriate LC gradient conditions for analyte separation.
• Set MS parameters (e.g., ion source, cone voltage, collision
energy) for optimized detection.
3.4.2 Instrument Calibration and Quality Control
• Inject calibration standards and analyze them to generate a
calibration curve.
• Analyze quality control (QC) samples at the beginning and end of
each run to verify system performance.
3.5 Sample Analysis 3.5.1 Sequence and Injection
• Inject prepared samples into the LC-MS/MS system following QC
samples.
• Ensure even sequence distribution of calibrators, samples, and
QCs to monitor any instrument drift/matrix effects.
3.5.2 Data Analysis
• Use the generated calibration curve to quantify Oxycodone in
serum samples.
• Validate each batch by assessing QC sample recoveries within
acceptable criteria (e.g., ±15% of the nominal value).
3.6 Reporting Results
• Review each sample chromatogram and mass spectrum for
compliance.
• Report Oxycodone concentration in ng/mL (or appropriate units)
as per laboratory reporting guidelines.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3.7 Quality Control and Troubleshooting
• Regularly review QC results to ensure the reliability of the
analytical process.
• Perform instrument maintenance as per schedule.
• Include steps for troubleshooting unexpected results or instrument
errors, documenting all investigations and corrective actions.
1. REFERENCES
• Product inserts and manuals for LC-MS/MS and consumables
used.
• Certified Reference Material documentation.
• CLSI guidelines for toxicology testing.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and method validation reports.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log for the sample extraction and preparation process.
• Record all instrument runs, calibration curves, QC performance,
and maintenance activities.
• Document all deviations from SOP and corrective actions taken.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL This procedure will be reviewed
annually and updated as necessary by the laboratory
supervisory team. Approval of the SOP will be confirmed by the
laboratory director.
By adhering to this protocol, we ensure reliable and valid results for
the detection and quantification of free (unconjugated) Oxycodone in
serum specimens.
