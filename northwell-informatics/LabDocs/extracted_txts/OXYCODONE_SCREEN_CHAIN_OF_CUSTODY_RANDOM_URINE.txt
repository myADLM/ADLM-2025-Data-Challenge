Analytical Phase Protocol for Oxycodone Screen, Chain of Custody,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE:
To ensure the accurate and reliable screening of urine specimens for
oxycodone in compliance with chain of custody (CoC) protocols. This
procedure is designed to provide detailed steps for the analytical
phase to generate test results for oxycodone.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to perform the oxycodone urine screen and adhere to the chain
of custody protocols as outlined below. All staff must be familiar with
the procedure and understand the importance of maintaining the
integrity and confidentiality of the specimen and results.
1. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/acceptable: - 30-45 mL of freshly voided urine
collected in a tamper-evident container. - Urine specimen must
be retained in chain of custody (CoC) documentation
throughout transport and storage.
Unacceptable: - Specimen arriving in the laboratory without
CoC documentation. - Specimen that is not in a tamper-evident
container or container is compromised (broken seal).
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Tamper-evident containers
◦ Chain of custody forms
◦ Heating blocks
◦ Reagent test kits for oxycodone (e.g., ELISA,
immunoassays)
◦ Calibrators and controls (Negative control, Positive control
at cutoff concentration, High Positive Control)
◦ Laboratory Information System (LIS)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
3. PROCEDURE:
A. Initial Protocol:
1. Verify the integrity of the specimen and ensure the CoC
documentation is complete.
2. Document receipt of the specimen in the LIS, including date
and time of receipt and the condition of the tamper-evident seal.
3. Record initial sample temperature upon receipt. If the
temperature is not within 32-38°C, note it in the CoC
documentation.
4. Log the specimen information on the respective Chain of
Custody Log.
B. Specimen Preparation:
1. Mix the urine specimen well to ensure homogeneity.
2. Aliquot 3-5 mL of the specimen into a labeled test tube.
C. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibrators and controls as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run calibrators and controls at the beginning of each analytical
batch to ensure accuracy and precision.
3. Verify the calibrator and control results against the expected
values. If values are outside the acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot and retest until within range.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Perform testing using the designated oxycodone reagent test
kit:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s protocol for reagent preparation and
sample incubation.
◦ Ensure all controls are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding to sample analysis.
2. For immunoassays:
◦ Add urine samples, calibrators, and controls to the reaction
wells or tubes.
◦ Incubate at the specified temperature and time.
◦ Measure absorbance or other signal as specified by the
assay protocol.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Evaluate absorbance or signal data from the assay.
2. Compare sample results against the cutoff concentration for
oxycodone:
◦ Negative: Signal less than the cutoff concentration.
◦ Positive: Signal greater than or equal to the cutoff
concentration.
3. Document results in the LIS:
◦ Enter results for each specimen, control, and calibrator.
◦ Include a comment for any specimens requiring repeat
testing or additional validation.
4. Verify the results and ensure all CoC documentation is
complete.
F. Confirmation Testing:
1. Perform confirmatory testing using Gas Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography-Tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for any positive oxycodone
results:
◦ Prepare samples and controls for the confirmatory assay.
◦ Operate the confirmatory instrument as per standard
operating procedures.
2. Compare confirmatory results with initial screening results and
document in the LIS.
3. REPORTING RESULTS:
4. Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
5. Transmit finalized results to the requesting entity, maintaining
CoC documentation.
6. Critical values or discrepancies in CoC documentation must be
flagged and reviewed by the laboratory supervisor.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to specific reagent and assay kit inserts for individual assay
limitations. Factors such as sample dilution, endogenous substances,
or interfering compounds may affect assay performance.

This protocol ensures that every step of the oxycodone urine screen,
from specimen receipt to result reporting, is conducted under
controlled conditions to maintain specimen integrity and compliance
with chain of custody requirements.
