Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Oxycodone Screen,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Oxycodone Screen, Random, Urine in
a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory staff member(s) will be responsible for
performing the oxycodone screen test, documenting results, and
performing necessary quality control procedures.
1. DEFINITION
Oxycodone screen testing is used to identify the presence of
oxycodone and its metabolites in a random urine specimen.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Specimen: Randomly collected urine sample
◦ Preferred: 10 mL freshly voided urine
◦ Unacceptable: Urine specimen older than 72 hours without
refrigeration, urine with visible contamination
• Test Devices: Oxycodone test strips, analyzers, or laboratory
instruments verified for oxycodone screening
• Reagents: Manufacturer’s recommended reagents for oxycodone
screening
• Quality Control Materials: Commercially available positive and
negative urine-based controls
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure work area is clean and proper PPE (Personal Protective
Equipment) is worn.
2. Verify the specimen has been properly collected, received, and
accessioned.
3. Allow urine specimen and controls to come to room
temperature.
B. Initial Testing
1. Labeling and Documentation:
◦ Verify patient identification on the sample.
◦ Label the test device as per the laboratory’s guidelines.
◦ Document the date, time, and technologist’s initials.
2. Screening Test Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided with the
oxycodone test strips or analyzer.
◦ Manual Test Method:
▪ Immerse the test strip into the urine sample for the time
specified by the manufacturer.
▪ Remove strip and allow to develop for the reaction time
specified by the manufacturer.
▪ Compare the color reaction to the reference chart or
insert the strip into a compatible reader.
◦ Automated Analyzer Method:
▪ Place an aliquot of the sample into the designated
analyzer container.
▪ Run the sample through the instrument according to the
manufacturer’s operating manual.
▪ The analyzer will process and display the result.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests
or as per manufacturer's guideline.
◦ Document control results; all controls must pass before
releasing patient results.
◦ If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to
manufacturer’s manual and retest controls.
4. Interpreting Results:
◦ Read and record the results from the test device or
analyzer.
◦ Positive Result: Indicates the presence of oxycodone/
metabolite above the designated cutoff.
◦ Negative Result: Indicates the absence or below the
detectable level of oxycodone/metabolite.
5. Confirmatory Testing:
◦ Send positive screens to a confirmation laboratory as
required by protocol for further analysis via Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or equivalent
higher sensitivity methods.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Ensure all entries are verified by a second technologist where
required.
• Report all results to the authorized requesting healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE RANGES
• Negative: No significant presence of oxycodone and its
metabolites (below the assay's cutoff threshold).
• Positive: Significant presence of oxycodone and/or its
metabolites (above the assay's cutoff threshold).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• All QC materials must be documented, including lot numbers,
expiration dates, and quality control results.
• QC results should be within established acceptable ranges before
patient results are reported.
• Any QC failure must be investigated, documented, and corrected
before patient testing continues.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Each testing method may have specific interferences and
limitations outlined by the manufacturer (refer to the product insert
for specific details).
• Ensure the integrity and handling of specimens to avoid false
results due to contamination or degradation.

and reagent verification.
This SOP has been prepared considering the clinical laboratory
standards of practice and regulatory compliance for efficient and
accurate screening of oxycodone in urine specimens. Adjustments
and updates should be made per the latest guidelines and
technological advancements.
