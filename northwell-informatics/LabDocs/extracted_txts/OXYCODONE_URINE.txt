STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for Oxycodone, Urine with the goal of ensuring consistent and
accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
Oxycodone, Urine analysis in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to the procedures in this
SOP, which includes specimen handling, preparation, analysis,
quality control, and result reporting. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with these procedures.
4. DEFINITIONS
Oxycodone: Oxycodone is a prescription opioid pain medication. It is
commonly detected in urine samples to monitor adherence to
prescription treatment plans or to screen for potential misuse.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens must be urine collected into a clean, sterile container with
no preservatives.
• Preferred: 10 mL of freshly voided urine.
• Acceptable: Urine samples collected within the past 72 hours,
stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed within the first 24 hours.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine drug test cups specific for Oxycodone.
• Calibrated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or
immunoassay analyzer.
• Quality control materials: known concentrations of Oxycodone for
positive and negative controls.
• Urine sample aliquots.
• Disposable pipettes.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation
1. Check and Prepare Equipment:
◦ Ensure that the LC-MS or immunoassay analyzer is
calibrated and that quality control checks are documented.
◦ Verify that all reagents and supplies are within their
expiration date and stored as recommended by the
manufacturer.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Verify that the specimen container is properly labeled and
matches the accompanying requisition.
◦ Inspect the sample for any signs of contamination or
adulteration, and reject specimens that are improperly
labeled or compromised.
◦ Aliquot the urine sample if not already portioned for testing.
Testing Procedure
1. For Immunoassay Analyzer:
◦ Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Load the appropriate test cartridge for Oxycodone into the
analyzer.
◦ Pipette the required amount of urine sample into the test
cartridge.
◦ Start the analysis process.
2. For LC-MS:
◦ Prepare the LC-MS system for Oxycodone detection
following the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Pipette the urine sample onto the designated sample plate
position or container.
◦ Initiate the LC-MS analysis sequence.
Quality Control
1. Daily QC Protocol:
◦ Run a negative control (urine sample free of Oxycodone).
◦ Run a positive control (urine sample with a known
concentration of Oxycodone).
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log.
◦ If QC results are out of acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer's manual, and re-run the controls
before proceeding with patient samples.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the analyzer as required by the
manufacturer's recommendation.
◦ Document every calibration activity in the calibration log.
Reporting Results
1. Result Review:
◦ Review the analysis data generated by the analyzer.
◦ Verify that the controls fall within acceptable ranges before
considering patient results valid.
◦ Assess sample integrity, and if necessary, note any issues
such as hemolysis or turbidity that could affect results.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Interpret results based on predefined cut-off levels as per
laboratory policies.
◦ Results should indicate either positive or negative for
Oxycodone presence.
3. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Results should be reviewed and verified by a certified
technologist before releasing to the ordering physician.
◦ Inform the appropriate healthcare provider of any critical
values immediately following the laboratory's standard
communication procedures.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's product insert for specific analyzer
limitations. Interfering substances may include other medications or
substances in the urine. Consider these in the interpretation of
results.

• Manufacturer's instructions for use for the analyzers.
• Laboratory quality assurance and quality control procedures.
• Current CLIA regulations regarding urine drug testing.
10. CHANGE HISTORY
