Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for OXYCODONE WITH
METABOLITE CONFIRMATION, CHAIN OF CUSTODY, RANDOM,
URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedural steps and guidelines for the
analysis of oxycodone and its metabolites in urine samples under
chain of custody. This procedure ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
traceability of the generated test results and complies with applicable
regulations and standards.
1. APPLICABILITY
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis and reporting of oxycodone and its metabolite results in
urine samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis according to the SOP and document all activities
appropriately. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
the procedure and resolving any deviations that may impact the test
results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Oxycodone: A semi-synthetic opioid used for pain management.
Metabolites: Compounds derived from the biotransformation of
oxycodone, including noroxycodone and oxymorphone. Chain of
Custody: A process that ensures the integrity of the sample from
collection to the reporting of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A) Specimen:
• Freshly voided urine samples.
• Specimen volume: Minimum 30 mL urine required.
B) Acceptable Criteria:
• Specimens provided under a secure chain of custody.
• Properly labeled and sealed containers with no evidence of
tampering.
C) Unacceptable Criteria:
• Insufficient specimen volume.
• Evidence of tampering or broken chain of custody.
• Specimens that have exceeded stability limits (unrefrigerated > 6
hours).
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunoassay kits specific for oxycodone and its
metabolites.
◦ Confirmatory test reagents (e.g., standards, controls,
solvents)
◦ Chain of custody forms and labels.
◦ Temperature monitoring logs.
◦ Pipettes, vials, centrifuges, and appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE).
2. PROCEDURE
A) Initial Screening:
1. Verify chain of custody documentation has been properly
completed.
2. Inspect the urine specimen for adequate volume and signs of
tampering.
3. Record specimen details in LIMS (Laboratory Information
Management System).
4. Aliquot a portion of the urine sample and store the remaining in
a secure frozen storage.
5. Perform immunoassay screening for oxycodone and its
metabolites:
◦ Follow the instructions provided with the immunoassay kit.
◦ Use control samples to verify the accuracy of the assay.
B) Confirmatory Analysis:
1. Prepare sample and control aliquots for confirmatory testing
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS).
2. Include calibration standards and quality control samples to
ensure the reliability of results.
3. Follow the detailed LC-MS/MS operational procedure:
◦ Calibrate the instrument with known standards.
◦ Analyze each sample in duplicate to confirm results.
◦ Record retention times and peak areas for oxycodone and
its metabolites.
C) Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Compare sample data with calibration curves to quantify
oxycodone and metabolites.
2. Validate the results using QC samples.
3. Review raw data files for irregularities or deviations.
4. In case of a problem, repeat the analysis or consult with the
supervisor.
5. Upload validated results into LIMS and ensure the chain of
custody is properly updated.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Controls:
1. Use negative and positive controls for each batch of samples
analyzed.
2. Maintain control charts to monitor assay performance.
3. Follow manufacturer's instructions for control sample storage
and usage.
B) External Controls:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
2. Compare test results with expected values to ensure inter-
laboratory consistency.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Review:
• Review all analysis results and chain of custody documentation
by a qualified personnel.
B) Reporting:
• Report findings via the LIMS following laboratory-specific
reporting guidelines.
• Include a statement confirming that chain of custody was
maintained.
• Results are to be checked and verified by a supervising
technologist before release.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific kit insert and the LC-MS/MS operational manual
for limitations related to sensitivity, specificity and possible
interferences.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Document all performed activities including temperature logs, chain
of custody forms, instrument calibrations, methods used, and any
deviations encountered during the analysis. Maintain records in
compliance with legal and accreditation requirements.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the
generation of accurate and reliable results for oxycodone and its
metabolite confirmations while maintaining the integrity of the chain
of custody.
