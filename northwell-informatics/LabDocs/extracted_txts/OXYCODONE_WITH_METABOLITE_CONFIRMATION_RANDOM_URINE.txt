Standard Operating Procedure for Oxycodone with
Metabolite Confirmation, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the confirmation and
quantification of oxycodone and its metabolites in random urine
samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analytical
phase for the confirmation of oxycodone and its metabolites in
random urine samples at the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to adhere to this SOP to
ensure accurate and reliable results. Supervisors must ensure that all
staff are trained and competent in this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Random urine Volume Required: Minimum 10 mL
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system
• Urine sample cups
• Reagent-grade methanol, acetonitrile, and water
• Standard solutions of oxycodone and metabolites (oxymorphone,
noroxycodone, noroxymorphone)
• Internal standards for quantification
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., solid-phase extraction
cartridges)
• Calibration curves and quality control samples
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Sample Collection:
◦ Ensure the urine sample was collected randomly and follow
proper chain of custody procedures.
◦ Label the sample with patient identification details, date, and
time of collection.
◦ Store the sample at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately. Bring
the sample to room temperature before analysis.
2. Sample Aliquoting:
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a pre-labeled
centrifuge tube.
3. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Add a defined quantity of internal standards to the urine
aliquot.
4. Sample Cleanup:
◦ Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE) to clean up the
sample.
◦ Condition the SPE cartridge with methanol followed by
water.
◦ Load urine sample onto the SPE cartridge.
◦ Wash the cartridge with water and methanol.
◦ Elute the analytes with a suitable solvent (e.g., methanol).
5. Sample Drying:
◦ Dry the eluate under nitrogen stream at 40°C.
◦ Reconstitute the dried extract in mobile phase for LC-MS/
MS analysis.
B) LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Ensure the LC-MS/MS system is calibrated and verify using
calibration standards and quality control samples.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject the prepared sample extract into the LC-MS/MS
system.
◦ Program the LC-MS/MS method to detect and quantify
oxycodone and its metabolites.
3. Analysis:
◦ Analyze the sample following the pre-set LC-MS/MS method
parameters.
◦ Monitor retention times and mass transitions specific to
oxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxycodone, and
noroxymorphone along with their respective internal
standards.
4. Data Processing:
◦ Acquire and process data using the LC-MS/MS software.
◦ Quantify the analytes using the calibration curve and
internal standard ratios.
C) Quality Control
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Include internal quality controls in each batch of samples.
◦ Run negative control (urine without oxycodone/metabolites),
and positive control (known concentration of oxycodone/
metabolites) in parallel with patient samples.
◦ Verify that the control results fall within acceptable limits.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Review the analytical data to ensure compliance with the
calibration curve.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
◦ Verify the results by a second qualified technician, if
required.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the concentration of oxycodone and its metabolites in ng/
mL.
• Interpret the results based on the cutoff values defined for
oxycodone confirmation.
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
final review and verification by designated staff.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High urinary concentrations of non-related compounds may
interfere with oxycodone detection.
• Samples that are improperly stored or handled may result in
degradation of analytes.
9. REFERENCES
• Oxycodone and metabolite LC-MS/MS assay insert and manuals.
• Laboratory quality control procedures documentation.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
10. MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure documentation and maintenance logs for the LC-MS/MS
equipment are current and properly filled.
• Maintain records of calibration, internal controls, and patient
results for reference.
