Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Oxyhemoglobin, Arterial, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the detailed procedures for the analysis of
oxyhemoglobin levels in arterial blood samples. The accurate
measurement of oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) is critical for patient care
and management, particularly in the assessment of oxygenation
states.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
O2Hb analysis as defined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of
all staff to ensure adherence to these protocols to maintain accuracy
and reliability of results.
1. DEFINITION
Oxyhemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin bound with oxygen. It is
measured to evaluate the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Arterial blood collected in a blood gas
syringe containing low concentration or balanced lithium heparin.
• After collection, ensure the air in contact with the blood is
expelled, the needle is removed, the syringe is capped, and the
blood is adequately mixed.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately. Preferably
use a pneumatic tube system or a transportation worker.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10% of the specimen
volume).
• Specimens with needle attached.
• Specimens that have clotted.
• Blood collected in a Microtainer or non-heparinized tube for this
test.
• Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA specimens.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• ABL90 or equivalent blood gas analyzer.
• Calibrated heparinized syringes.
• Quality control materials.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify patient identification on the specimen label and
requisition form.
2. Check for specimen integrity; ensure no clots or significant air
bubbles are present.
3. Mix the sample thoroughly by gently rotating the capped
syringe.
Instrumentation:
1. Load the blood gas syringe into the ABL90 analyzer according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Initiate the analysis process.
Analysis:
1. The ABL90 analyzer will automatically aspirate the blood
sample and perform the measurement of oxyhemoglobin.
2. Oxyhemoglobin results will be reported in percentage (%) of
total hemoglobin.
Quality Control:
1. Three levels of quality control material are automatically
analyzed on the ABL90 according to a set schedule.
2. If quality control fails for any analyte, the instrument will not
provide a result for that analyte.
3. Perform a 3-patient comparison with the other ABL90 in the lab
in case of quality control failure.
Result Verification:
1. Review results and printed measurement parameters.
2. If flagged results or error messages appear, troubleshoot per
the instrument manual and repeat the analysis if necessary.
Sample Integrity:
1. If the sample integrity is in question, centrifuge a small aliquot
to check for hemolysis and decide on action based on the
visual assessment.
Critical Results:
1. Report critical oxygenation levels (e.g., critically low O2Hb %)
immediately to the attending clinician according to the
established critical value policy. Document the action taken.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Ensure all results are accurately entered and verified before
releasing to the clinical team.
Reference Intervals:
• Oxyhemoglobin: 95-98% for arterial blood in healthy individuals.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, air contamination, or inappropriate anticoagulants can
interfere with accurate measurement of oxyhemoglobin.
• Ensure strict adherence to specimen collection and handling
procedures.
