Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing Central
Venous Oxyhemoglobin
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to detail the steps for the accurate
and precise analysis of central venous oxyhemoglobin in the
laboratory. This SOP aims to ensure the reliability of test results and
provide guidelines for appropriate corrective action when necessary.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of central venous oxyhemoglobin using the designated
laboratory instruments and methodologies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and designated personnel are responsible
for performing the procedures as outlined in this document and
ensuring compliance with all steps. It is the responsibility of the
designated personnel to identify any deficiencies or deviations from
the procedures and report them to their supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Central venous blood
• Collection Device: Vented or non-vented blood gas syringe
containing balanced lithium heparin
• Handling Requirements:
◦ Expel air in contact with the blood specimen immediately after
collection.
◦ Remove the needle and firmly cap the syringe.
◦ Mix the blood adequately by gentle inversion.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation for Analysis:
• Ensure that the ABL 90 analyzer is calibrated and quality controls
are within acceptable limits before sample testing.
• Review the specimen to ensure it meets the acceptable criteria
(no significant proportion of air bubbles, no visible clots, etc.)
5.2 Specimen Processing:
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately. If
transported via pneumatic tube, ensure the blood gas syringe is
securely capped and placed in a plastic bag.
• Inspect the sample for any issues that could compromise the
integrity of the analysis (e.g., hemolysis, clotting).
5.3 Analyzing the Sample:
• Load the sample into the ABL 90 analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions.
• Initiate the analysis following the steps outlined in the ABL 90 user
manual.
◦ Enter patient demographics if required.
◦ Ensure proper aspiration of the sample into the analyzer.
5.4 Interpreting and Recording Results:
• Review the results displayed on the analyzer.
• Check for any instrument messages or flags that could indicate
potential errors or issues.
◦ Resolve any flagged results as per troubleshooting guidelines.
• Document the oxyhemoglobin concentration and any other
relevant parameters in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• If results fall within critical values, follow the laboratory’s critical
results protocol.
5.5 Quality Control and Validation:
• Conduct bi-weekly internal quality control using a blood gas
syringe.
• Monthly inter-lab comparisons should be performed between two
ABL 90 analyzers.
• Regularly validate the solution packs and sensor cassettes using
patient sample comparisons.
◦ Follow up on the correlation as outlined in the ABL 90 Blood
Gas Procedures.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Result Verification:
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
being released.
• Ensure that automated transmission to the LIS is completed and
review any discrepancies.
6.2 Critical Results Handling:
• Document and call critical results in accordance with the
laboratory’s policy.
• If critical results have been previously called by a Respiratory
Therapist, verify documentation and proceed accordingly.
6.3 Handling Hemolyzed Samples:
• If a sample is hemolyzed, centrifuge a small aliquot to verify
integrity.
• Use best judgment to report accurate results or request a new
sample as necessary.
6.4 Result Comments and Anomalies:
• For printed results with “?” or message codes, refer to instrument
messages for troubleshooting.
• Report appropriate comments for any anomalies according to the
guidelines.

• ABL 90 User Manual
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Laboratory Quality Assurance Plan
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Follow internal and external quality control measures to ensure
accuracy and reliability of results.
• Document and review quality control data regularly.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the ABL 90 user manual for detailed troubleshooting
steps for common issues.
• In case of unresolved instrument errors, contact the on-call
support or technical service.
This SOP is intended to provide clear, comprehensive instructions for
the accurate analysis of central venous oxyhemoglobin. Compliance
with these guidelines will help to ensure the production of reliable and
accurate test results.
This protocol covers all the essential aspects to guide operators
through the analysis methodically. If your equipment or reagents
differ, I can adjust this.
