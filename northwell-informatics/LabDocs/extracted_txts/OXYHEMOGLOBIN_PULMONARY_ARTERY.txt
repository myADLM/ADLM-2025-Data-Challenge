Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generation of Results
for Oxyhemoglobin (Pulmonary Artery)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating accurate and reliable results for oxyhemoglobin in
pulmonary artery blood samples, ensuring the results contribute to
optimal patient care.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out the
procedure, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the results, and
documenting all actions taken.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
that staff follow the protocols correctly, and addressing any issues
that arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen requirements for Pulmonary Artery Oxyhemoglobin testing:
• Type: Arterial blood from pulmonary artery.
• Collection: Blood must be drawn using vented or non-vented
blood gas syringes containing low concentration or balanced
lithium heparin.
• Handling: Ensure that air is expelled from the syringe
immediately after collection, the needle is removed, the syringe is
capped, and the blood is adequately mixed.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with significant proportion (> 10%) of air bubbles.
• Specimens with needle attached.
• Specimens that have clotted.
• Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Blood Gas Analyzer (e.g., ABL90)
• Heparinized blood gas syringes
• Nitrile gloves and other required PPE
• Mixing apparatus (e.g., metal "flea" and magnet)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Collection and Handling
1. Collect arterial blood from the pulmonary artery using
heparinized blood gas syringes.
2. Ensure all air bubbles are expelled, and the needle is removed
and capped immediately.
3. Mix the blood thoroughly to avoid clot formation and ensure
consistency.
4.2 Sample Analysis
• Preparation:
1. Verify that the blood gas analyzer (ABL90) is calibrated and
in optimal working condition.
2. Ensure that the solution packs and sensor cassettes are
validated and within expiry dates.
• Running the Sample:
1. Load the properly prepared and capped syringe into the
blood gas analyzer.
2. Select the analysis mode appropriate for oxyhemoglobin
measurement.
3. Initiate the analysis procedure as per the instrument
manual, ensuring all internal checks and calibrations are
completed.
• Recording Results:
1. Ensure the analyzer correctly identifies and prints the
oxyhemoglobin levels.
2. Review results for message codes and "?" marks. If a
message code appears, consult the instrument data logs for
troubleshooting.
3. Document the results, including date, time, and the staff
member's initials on appropriate logs and laboratory
reporting systems.
4. Verify results according to the laboratory's protocols before
transmitting to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4.3 Quality Control
• Perform regular quality control checks using designated control
materials as per the lab’s guidelines:
◦ Bi-weekly: Run comparison checks between various blood
gas analyzer units.
◦ Monthly: Carry out broader comparison checks involving
different labs or clinical departments as required.
• Troubleshoot and rectify any issues that arise during quality
control checks. Re-run tests or contact appropriate personnel for
further guidance as needed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Critical Values Handling: If oxyhemoglobin levels fall outside the
reference range and are deemed critical:
◦ Follow the lab’s critical result reporting protocol.
◦ Ensure the results are reviewed and confirmed before
reporting.
◦ Contact the relevant healthcare provider immediately with the
critical values.
• Documentation: Results must be accurately documented and
verified:
1. Ensure printouts are free from error messages or
discrepancies.
2. Use smart phrases for any issues or unavailable analytes.
3. If integrity is in question, centrifuge a small aliquot to check
for issues like hemolysis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Oxyhemoglobin: Reference intervals depend on patient-specific
factors and the reference guidelines provided by your facility.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to analyzer’s product insert and user manuals for limitations
pertaining to the measurement of oxyhemoglobin, handling of
errors, and troubleshooting protocols.
