Oxymorphone Confirmation, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To confirm and accurately measure the concentration of
oxymorphone in a random urine specimen using specified analytical
techniques.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the confirmation phase of oxymorphone testing
for random urine specimens in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this procedure to
ensure accurate and timely results. It is the responsibility of the lab
supervisor to ensure compliance and address any deviations or
issues encountered during the analytical process.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Urine collection containers
• Certified reference standards of oxymorphone
• Certified internal standard (Deuterated oxymorphone)
• Appropriate reagents and solvents for sample preparation and
analysis (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile, water)
• pH buffers
• Extraction columns or devices
• Laboratory SOPs for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS operation
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as gloves and lab
coats
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• A random urine sample collected in a clean, leak-proof container.
• The urine sample should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 7 days of collection.
• If analysis is delayed beyond 7 days, specimens should be frozen
at -20°C.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Receipt & Verification:
◦ Verify patient information and specimen integrity.
◦ Record specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ If the sample is inadequate or compromised, notify the
supervisor and document the issue.
2. Sample Aliquoting:
◦ Vortex the urine sample thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot a sufficient volume (e.g., 5 mL) into a labeled
secondary container for analysis.
3. Sample Pre-Treatment:
◦ Adjust the pH of the urine sample to 6.0-6.5 using pH buffer.
◦ Add the internal standard (deuterated oxymorphone) to
each urine sample at a known concentration.
4. Sample Extraction:
◦ Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid
extraction (LLE) following the specific protocol for
oxymorphone.
◦ Elute the analytes using the appropriate solvents.
◦ Dry the extract under a nitrogen stream or a gentle vacuum.
5. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the dried extract in an appropriate solvent
(e.g., mobile phase for LC-MS/MS).
◦ Vortex to mix and transfer to an auto-sampler vial with an
insert.
B. Instrumental Analysis
1. Calibration and QC:
◦ Run calibration standards and quality control samples at the
start of each batch.
◦ Use certified reference standards for calibration.
◦ Ensure the internal standard peak area is consistent across
all samples.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Set up the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS as per the laboratory SOP.
◦ Verify that the system is operating correctly with appropriate
parameters set for the analysis of oxymorphone.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Inject the prepared urine sample extract into the instrument.
◦ Set the instrument to monitor the specific retention times
and mass transitions of oxymorphone and the internal
standard.
4. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire data and ensure there are no matrix interferences.
◦ Generate chromatograms and mass spectra for
oxymorphone and the internal standard.
C. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Quantification:
◦ Calculate the concentration of oxymorphone in the urine
samples using the internal standard method.
◦ Confirm the accuracy and precision of the results by
comparing with quality control samples.
2. Data Validation:
◦ Validate results according to laboratory protocols. Review
integration and quantitation data.
◦ Ensure all calibration and quality control criteria are met.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Enter validated results into the LIS.
◦ Review and sign off on the final report.
◦ Notify appropriate clinical personnel of critical results if
required.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks with every batch of samples to ensure the
reliability of the test.
• Perform instrument calibration at the start of each analytical run.
• Analyze negative and positive urine control samples with each
batch.
8. REFERENCES
Include all reference materials used for this procedure:
• Instrument manufacturer's user manual for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urine drug testing
• Certified reference standard certificates
9. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps, calibrations, and observations are documented in
the appropriate logs:
• Calibration logs
• Sample processing logs
• Maintenance logs for equipment
• Quality control logs
10. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, wearing appropriate
PPE.
• Dispose of chemical wastes according to institutional and federal
guidelines.
