Protocol: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
OXYSTEROLS, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The primary objective of this protocol is to outline the procedures for
accurately analyzing and generating results for oxysterols in blood
samples. This document defines necessary steps to ensure high-
quality, reliable test results, and includes guidelines for
troubleshooting during the analytical phase.
Responsibilities:
Designated medical laboratory technologists are responsible for
conducting the testing procedure and documenting the results
accordingly. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
these procedures and providing directions for troubleshooting when
needed.
1. DEFINITION
Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol. This protocol
pertains to the analysis of oxysterols in blood samples, which
involves preparation, extraction, and quantification using advanced
chromatographic and spectrometric techniques.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Instrumentation
• LC-MS/MS System or GC-MS System (depending on the
laboratory setup)
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory glassware for extraction (e.g., vials, test tubes)
• Pipettes and micropipette
• Sample refrigeration unit (if needed)
B. Reagents and Supplies
• Solvents for extraction (e.g., methanol, chloroform)
• Internal Standards for oxysterols
• Mobile phase solvents for chromatography (e.g., water,
acetonitrile)
• Calibration standards
C. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Handling
◦ Blood specimens for oxysterol analysis must be collected in
appropriate tubes (e.g., EDTA tubes).
◦ After collection, specimens should be mixed gently and
stored at 4°C until processing.
◦ Specimens must be processed within 24 hours to ensure
the stability of analytes.
2. Extraction Procedure
a. Centrifuge blood samples at 2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma. b. Aliquot the required volume of plasma into
glass vials. c. Add internal standards to the plasma samples for
accurate quantitation. d. Perform liquid-liquid extraction using
methanol and chloroform. Vortex and centrifuge for phase
separation. e. Collect the organic phase, carefully avoiding any
contamination from the aqueous phase.
3. Evaporation and Reconstitution
◦ Evaporate the organic phase under nitrogen stream or
vacuum.
◦ Reconstitute the dried residue in mobile phase solvent
appropriate for LC-MS/MS or GC-MS analysis.
D. Chromatographic Analysis
1. LC-MS/MS or GC-MS Procedure
a. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples
using serial dilutions from stock solutions. b. Set up the
chromatographic instrumentation according to the
manufacturer's guidelines. Adjust parameters such as flow rate,
column type, and temperature depending on the specific
method. c. Inject the reconstituted samples into the LC-MS/MS
or GC-MS system. d. Monitor specific ions characteristic of
oxysterols and their internal standards.
2. Data Analysis
◦ Quantify concentrations using calibration curves generated
from standards.
◦ Review chromatograms for any anomalies or signal
interference.
E. Quality Control and Calibration
1. Internal Quality Control
◦ Ensure that three levels of Quality Control (low, medium,
high) are run with each batch.
◦ Confirm that calibration curves have acceptable linearity (r²>
0.99).
◦ Validate instrument performance daily using stable quality
control samples.
2. External Quality Control
◦ Participate in bi-annual or quarterly external quality
assessment programs to ensure accuracy.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions.
F. Troubleshooting
If any deviations from standard operation occur (e.g., abnormal
chromatograms, equipment malfunctions), perform the following
actions:
• Check solvent purity and ensure no contamination.
• Verify calibration standards and internal standards.
• Contact the supervisor for additional troubleshooting suggestions.
• Document any corrective actions taken in the laboratory log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Result Documentation
◦ Ensure that results are validated by a certified technologist.
◦ Report the concentrations of various oxysterols in mmol/L as
per laboratory standards.
◦ Upload the results onto the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for verification by a supervisor.
3. Critical Results
◦ Any critical results (e.g., significantly elevated oxysterol
levels) should be flagged and communicated to the referring
clinician immediately.
◦ Document the communication in patient records.
