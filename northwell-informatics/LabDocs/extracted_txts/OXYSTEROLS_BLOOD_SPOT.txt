Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for OXYSTEROLS, BLOOD
SPOT Analysis
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized protocol for the accurate
and precise analysis of oxysterols in blood spot samples within the
laboratory. This SOP outlines the procedure to ensure the validity of
the results, including quality control measures and reporting.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the analysis according to this procedure,
ensuring the accuracy of the results and adherence to quality control
guidelines.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen:
• Dried blood spots on filter paper are acceptable. Ensure the
samples have been adequately dried and are within the stability
period.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Blood spots that are not fully dried.
• Blood spots with insufficient quantity for analysis.
• Specimens that are contaminated or compromised.
Storage:
• Store blood spot samples at room temperature, away from direct
sunlight, until analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS).
• Solvents: methanol, acetonitrile, and water (all HPLC grade).
• Internal standards for oxysterols.
• Reagent-grade chemicals for standard preparation and mobile
phase preparation.
4. PROCEDURE:
Sample Preparation:
1. Punch out a 3 mm diameter disc from the blood spot for each
specimen.
2. Place the disc into a microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add 200 μL of methanol to each tube for extraction, along with
the internal standard.
4. Vortex vigorously for 1 minute.
5. Incubate the samples at room temperature for 30 minutes to
ensure complete elution of oxysterols.
6. Centrifuge the tubes at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
8. Dry the supernatant under a gentle stream of nitrogen.
9. Reconstitute the dried residue in 50 μL of mobile phase A
(mixture of water/methanol).
LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. Equilibrate the column with the starting mobile phase
composition.
3. Inject 10 μL of the reconstituted sample into the LC-MS/MS
system.
4. Use a gradient elution profile for optimal separation of
oxysterols.
5. The mobile phases often consist of (A) water with 0.1% formic
acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
6. Detection will be conducted in positive ion mode with specific
transitions for oxysterols and internal standards.
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL:
Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration curves using authentic oxysterol standards
at known concentrations.
2. Process calibration standards similarly to unknown specimens.
3. Incorporate at least 5 concentration points for each oxysterol to
establish the linear dynamic range.
Quality Control:
1. Include quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within each batch of samples assayed.
2. Analyze QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of the
run to monitor instrument performance and analytical accuracy.
3. Acceptable QC results need to be within ±15% of the target
value. If not, re-evaluate the affected run for potential issues,
and re-run if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Review data generated by the LC-MS/MS for each sample for
any anomalies or issues.
2. Calculate the concentrations of oxysterols in the samples using
the calibration curve.
3. Verify that all quality control results are within acceptable limits.
4. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and approve them for validation if they meet all criteria.
5. Document any critical results or deviations observed and notify
the supervisor if necessary.
Critical Results:
• Communicate values that fall outside the established reference
range immediately to the relevant medical personnel, as indicated
by laboratory policy.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s manual for the LC-MS/MS system.
• Current literature on oxysterol analysis methodology.
• Laboratory's quality assurance and control guidelines.
8. REVIEW: This SOP is to be reviewed annually or as needed upon
updates in methodology or instrument change.
