Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Oxysterols, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
accurate and reliable analysis of oxysterols in plasma using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This SOP
ensures consistency, accuracy, and compliance with CLIA
regulations.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
precisely and to perform all necessary quality control checks to
ensure the validity of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION

tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL plasma.
• Specimen Storage: Plasma should be separated from cells and
stored at -80°C until analysis.
• Stability: Plasma is stable for up to 6 months at -80°C.

1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw Plasma Samples:
◦ Thaw plasma samples on ice. Vortex to mix well once
thawed.
2. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Pipette 200 µL of plasma into a clean glass tube.
◦ Add 800 µL of methanol containing the internal standard
mix.
◦ Vortex for 2 minutes to mix thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
3. Supernatant Collection:
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new clean tube.
◦ Evaporate the supernatant to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen at room temperature.
4. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the dried residue in 100 µL of mobile phase
(50% water + 50% acetonitrile).
◦ Vortex to mix and briefly centrifuge to remove any
particulates.
5. Filtration:
◦ Filter the reconstituted sample using a 0.2 µm syringe filter
into an LC-MS/MS vial.
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Ensure the LC-MS/MS system is calibrated and that all
maintenance activities have been completed.
◦ Prime the system with mobile phases A and B.
2. Method Parameters:
◦ Column: C18, 2.1 x 100 mm, 3 µm
◦ Flow Rate: 0.4 mL/min
◦ Injection Volume: 10 µL
◦ Gradient Elution: - 0-3 min: 20% B - 3-8 min: 20% B to
80% B linear gradient - 8-10 min: 80% B - 10-12 min: 80% B
to 20% B linear gradient - 12-15 min: 20% B (re-
equilibration)
◦ Detection: Positive ion mode, multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM)
3. Injection:
◦ Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS
system.
4. Data Acquisition:
◦ Monitor the MRM transitions specific to the oxysterols of
interest and the internal standards.
◦ Ensure to include blank, calibrators, and quality control
samples within each batch run.
C. Data Analysis
1. Peak Integration:
◦ Use appropriate software to integrate peaks corresponding
to the oxysterols and internal standards.
◦ Verify peak integration and ensure chromatograms are
properly interpreted.
2. Quantification:
◦ Calculate the concentration of oxysterols using the internal
standard method and calibration curve.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Review QC results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range.
◦ Re-run any samples that fall outside QC limits.
D. Reporting Results
1. Data Review:
◦ Technologists must review data for accuracy and
consistency.
◦ Identify any outliers or anomalies and address them as per
standard troubleshooting protocols.
2. Validation:
◦ Ensure all QC samples meet predefined acceptance criteria
before validating patient results.
3. Result Entry:
◦ Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review and verification by a senior
technologist.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Perform daily quality control using low, medium, and high
concentration QC materials.
◦ Document QC results and take corrective actions if QC results
fall outside acceptable ranges.
• Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs and
compare results with peer laboratories to ensure accuracy.
