Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analysis of OYSTER
specific IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for accurately measuring OYSTER specific
IgE levels in human serum using an immunoassay analyzer, ensuring
quality results for patient diagnosis and treatment.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to conduct OYSTER specific IgE assays in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All personnel performing this procedure must be trained and
competent in IgE assay techniques and the operation of
immunoassay analyzers.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring adherence
to this protocol and performing regular reviews and updates as
required.
4. MATERIALS REQUIRED
• Immunoassay Analyzer (Refer to manufacturer’s manual for
specific model)
• Oyster-specific IgE Reagent Pack (follow storage instructions
outlined by the manufacturer)
• Serum samples
• Quality Control Materials (High and Low controls)
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Calibrators provided by reagent manufacturer
• Reaction vessels or microplates as recommended by instrument
manufacturer
• Timer
5. PREPARATION AND EQUIPMENT SETUP
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is properly calibrated and
maintained (refer to the instrument's user manual for specific
instructions).
• Perform instrument startup procedures including warm-up, self-
test, and baseline checks as per instrument guidelines.
• Load Oyster-specific IgE reagents and calibrators according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum required.
• Stability: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if not tested
immediately. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis
1. Verify the specimen and requisition information. Ensure proper
patient identification, serum integrity, and suitability for analysis.
2. Bring the serum samples, controls, and calibrators to room
temperature before analysis.
B. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples at two levels (high and low) at the
beginning of each shift and after any major maintenance on the
analyzer.
2. Ensure control results are within the established ranges before
proceeding with patient samples. If controls fail, troubleshoot,
resolve issues, and rerun controls.
C. Calibration
1. Perform calibration of the Oyster-specific IgE assay as required
by the manufacturer (e.g., with each new reagent lot or as
recommended by the instrument).
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the analyzer as
per the instrument’s loading protocol.
2. Select the Oyster IgE assay program.
3. Start the analysis run on the immunoassay analyzer.
4. Monitor the analysis process and ensure samples are
processed without interruptions.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted from the analyzer to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify all results for accuracy and for notes on any
analyzer error codes or flagged results.
• Flag or repeat any sample with atypical results or flagged by the
system for reanalysis.
• Report the verified IgE levels according to the laboratory’s
reporting guidelines.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Routine maintenance and function checks must be carried out as
per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all maintenance and quality control activities in the
appropriate logs.
• Periodically review QC performance and take corrective actions if
outliers or trends are observed.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manual for the immunoassay analyzer.
• Package insert provided with the Oyster-specific IgE reagent kit.
• Laboratory quality control and instrument maintenance
procedures.
This SOP will be reviewed annually or sooner if there are updates to
the assay methodology, instrumentation, or reagents by the
laboratory supervisor.
Documentation and adherence to this SOP will ensure accurate and
timely results aiding in the proper diagnosis and management of
patient conditions related to OYSTER specific IgE levels.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure high
standards of laboratory practice consistent with CLIA regulations and
internal quality policies.
