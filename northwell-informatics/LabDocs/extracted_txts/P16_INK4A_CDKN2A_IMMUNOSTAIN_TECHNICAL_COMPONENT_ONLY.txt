Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
TITLE: Protocol for Generating Results for P16 (INK4A/
CDKN2A) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized method for the technical component of
generating P16 (INK4A/CDKN2A) immunostain results, ensuring
reliability, reproducibility, and accuracy of the staining procedure.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel who are trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedures will be responsible for
performing and documenting the staining process. It is the
responsibility of the technical director or supervisor to ensure that all
personnel are adequately trained and that the procedure is followed
correctly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks or unstained sections on positively charged
slides.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens not properly fixed, non-
paraffin-embedded tissues, or slides that are inadequately
prepared.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• P16 (INK4A/CDKN2A) primary antibody
• Appropriate secondary antibody and detection system
• Positive control slides
• Negative control slides (using appropriate isotype controls)
• Antigen retrieval buffer
• Wash buffer (PBS or TBS)
• Peroxidase/DAB substrate kit
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Automated IHC staining instrument (if available)
• Incubator set at required temperatures according to procedure
• Microscope for visualization
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Use a control tissue known to express the P16
protein.
• Negative Control: Perform the procedure with an isotype control
on a section of the same sample to ensure specificity of the
staining.
• Internal QC: Perform QC runs with each batch of staining to
ensure reproducibility and reliability.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Steps
1. Verify that the specimen is correctly labeled and corresponds to
the request form.
2. Prepare FFPE tissue sections (3-5 μm thickness) and place
them on positively charged slides.
3. Deparaffinize sections in xylene and rehydrate through graded
alcohol to water.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Immerse slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave, pressure cooker,
or water bath according to laboratory protocol for optimal
antigen retrieval (typically 20 minutes).
2. Allow slides to cool in the buffer at room temperature for 20
minutes.
C. Blocking and Staining
1. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer three times for 5 minutes
each.
2. Apply a peroxidase block reagent to each slide for 10 minutes
to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
3. Rinse slides in buffer.
4. Apply a protein block (e.g., serum-free protein block) for 10
minutes to reduce nonspecific binding.
5. Incubate slides with P16 (INK4A/CDKN2A) primary antibody at
the recommended dilution (refer to the manufacturer’s
instructions) at room temperature for 1 hour or as optimized.
6. Wash slides in buffer three times for 5 minutes each.
7. Apply an appropriate secondary antibody for 30 minutes.
8. Wash slides in buffer three times for 5 minutes each.
9. Apply the detection reagent (e.g., avidin-biotin complex or
polymer-based system) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.
10. Wash slides in buffer, then apply the DAB substrate solution to
visualize the antibody-antigen reaction (monitor under a
microscope to ensure adequate development; typically 5-10
minutes).
11. Rinse slides in distillated water to stop the reaction.
D. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain tissues with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Dip slides in bluing reagent to enhance the hematoxylin
contrast.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohol and clear in xylene.
4. Apply mounting medium and coverslips.
E. Review and Documentation
1. Examine the stained slides under the microscope to ensure the
quality and specificity of staining.
2. Compare the staining intensity and pattern of the sample to the
positive and negative controls.
3. Document any issues or variabilities observed with the stained
sections.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Since this SOP covers only the technical component, the resultant
stained slides should be forwarded to a pathologist for interpretation.
The pathologist will provide the diagnostic report based on the
staining patterns observed.
8. RECORDING AND MAINTENANCE
Maintain the following documents for each staining run:
• Date and time of staining
• Technician’s identification
• Batch numbers of antibodies and reagents used
• Results of positive and negative controls
• Any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions taken
