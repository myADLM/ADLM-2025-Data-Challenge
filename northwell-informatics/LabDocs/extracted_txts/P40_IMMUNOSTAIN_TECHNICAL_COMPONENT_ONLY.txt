Standard Operating Procedure for P40 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed description of the technical procedures
required to perform P40 immunostaining on tissue sections in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. The purpose is to ensure consistent and
accurate detection of P40 protein expression in histopathological
specimens.
Responsibility:
All designated histology laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting the P40 immunostaining procedures as
described. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to the SOP and addressing any identified deficiencies.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all histology laboratory personnel
performing P40 immunostaining on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections.
3. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• P40 Primary Antibody
• Secondary Antibody (Polymer HRP or equivalent)
• DAB Chromogen kit
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Xylene or Xylene substitute
• Ethanol (70%, 95%, and 100%)
• Distilled water
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
4. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath (set to 37-42°C)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Staining racks and trays
• Slide warmers/dryers
• Automated immunostainer (if applicable)
• Light microscope
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks should
be received according to laboratory policies.
• Tissue sections of 3-5 µm thickness should be cut from the FFPE
blocks using a microtome and mounted on positively charged
glass slides.
• Ensure slides are properly labeled with the laboratory accession
number and patient identifier.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Bake slides at 60°C for 30 minutes to overnight.
2. Deparaffinize sections in xylene or xylene substitute three times
for 5 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate slides using decreasing concentrations of ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each, followed by a rinse in
distilled water.
6.2. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA
buffer (pH 8.0), depending on the antibody manufacturer's
recommendation.
2. Heat sections in a microwave oven, pressure cooker, or
steamer for the specified time (typically 20-30 minutes).
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.3. Blocking
1. Apply blocking solution (e.g., normal serum or protein block) to
cover the entire tissue section and incubate for 10-20 minutes
at room temperature to minimize non-specific binding.
2. Gently rinse slides in buffer (e.g., TBS or PBS).
6.4. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the primary P40 antibody to the tissue sections, ensuring
complete coverage of the specimen.
2. Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 30-60 minutes or
at 4°C overnight, as per antibody specifications.
6.5. Washing
1. Rinse slides in buffer (e.g., TBS or PBS) for 5 minutes, with two
changes of buffer to remove unbound primary antibody.
6.6. Secondary Antibody Application
1. Apply the secondary antibody (Polymer HRP or equivalent) to
each slide.
2. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in buffer (e.g., TBS or PBS) for 5 minutes, with two
changes of buffer.
6.7. DAB Chromogen Development
1. Prepare DAB chromogen solution according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Apply DAB chromogen solution to slides and incubate for 5-10
minutes, monitoring closely for appropriate staining intensity.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
6.8. Counterstaining
1. Dip slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to counterstain the
nuclei.
2. Rinse slides in tap water, followed by a brief dip in bluing
reagent, if necessary.
3. Rinse in tap water and briefly in distilled water.
6.9. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through increasing concentrations of ethanol
(70%, 95%, 100%).
2. Clear slides in xylene or xylene substitute.
3. Mount coverslips using a compatible mounting medium.
7. CONTROLS
1. Ensure the inclusion of positive and negative control slides with
each staining run.
2. Positive control: Known P40-expressing tissue.
3. Negative control: Tissue section incubated without the primary
antibody.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Verify staining quality by examining control slides before
evaluating patient slides.
2. Document all steps, observations, and any deviations
encountered during the staining procedure.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Interpret the staining results under a light microscope, focusing
on the presence and intensity of P40 immunostaining.
2. Record the findings according to laboratory documentation
procedures.
3. Report any technical issues to the laboratory supervisor
promptly.
