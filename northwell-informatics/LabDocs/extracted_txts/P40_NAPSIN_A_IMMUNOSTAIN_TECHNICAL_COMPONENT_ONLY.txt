SOP: P40 + NAPSIN A Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE To delineate the technical procedure for performing
P40 and Napsin A immunostaining on tissue specimens to
ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedures are responsible for
performing and documenting each step as outlined.
1. DEFINITIONS P40: A marker commonly used in the diagnosis
of squamous cell carcinoma. Napsin A: A marker commonly
used in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
2. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE) should be cut
to a thickness of 4 micrometers.
2. Mount the tissue sections on positively charged glass
slides.
3. Bake the slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adherence of
tissue to the slides.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 1. Incubate the slides in xylene
for three changes, 5 minutes each. 2. Hydrate through graded
alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each. 3. Rinse the slides in
distilled water for 2 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval: 1. Prepare the antigen retrieval buffer (10 mM
Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0 for P40; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 for Napsin A). 2.
Place the slides in a microwave-safe staining jar and cover with
retrieval buffer. 3. Microwave at high power for 10 minutes. 4. Allow
slides to cool in the retrieval buffer at room temperature for 20
minutes. 5. Rinse slides in distilled water thrice for 5 minutes each.
D) Blocking: 1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating
slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. 2. Rinse slides in
PBS/TBS buffer for 5 minutes.
E) Primary Antibody Incubation: 1. Apply the P40 primary antibody
according to manufacturer's instructions. 2. Incubate in a humidified
chamber at room temperature for 30 minutes. 3. Rinse slides in PBS/
TBS buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes each. 4. Apply the Napsin A
primary antibody following the manufacturer’s guidelines. 5. Incubate
in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 30 minutes. 6.
Rinse in PBS/TBS buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
F) Secondary Antibody Incubation: 1. Apply the secondary antibody
reagent (linking antibody) to the slides. 2. Incubate in a humidified
chamber at room temperature for 30 minutes. 3. Rinse in PBS/TBS
buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
G) Detection: 1. Apply the DAB chromogen or the suitable detection
reagent to visualize the staining. 2. Incubate in the dark until the
desired staining intensity is achieved, typically 5-10 minutes. 3. Rinse
slides in distilled water.
H) Counterstaining and Mounting: 1. Counterstain slides with
hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 2. Rinse in tap water for 5 minutes. 3.
Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) for 2 minutes
each. 4. Clear in xylene for 2 changes, 5 minutes each. 5. Mount
coverslip using a permanent mounting medium.
I) Quality Control: 1. Include positive and negative control slides with
each run. 2. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
3. Review staining quality and consistency with established controls
before proceeding to interpretation.
