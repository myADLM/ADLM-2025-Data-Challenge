P504S Immunostain Protocol (Technical Component Only)
1. Purpose To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for P504S immunostain used in the
detection of prostate cancer. This protocol is intended for use in
the laboratory and covers the preparation, staining, and
analysis of P504S antibody on formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue sections.
2. Specimen Requirements Specimen: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks or unstained slides.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Positive-charge slides
• Forceps
• Slide racks
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol
• PBS buffer (pH 7.4)
• Microwave or pressure cooker
• Hydrogen peroxide, 3%
• Antibody Diluent
• P504S (AMACR) Primary Antibody
• Detection System (e.g., HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and
DAB chromogen)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting media
• Coverslips
• Control tissue (known positive and negative control slides)
1. Procedure
A. Slide Preparation
1. Cut 3-4 μm sections from the paraffin-embedded tissue block
using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a 40-45°C water bath and pick up on positive-
charge slides.
3. Dry slides at 60°C for one hour or overnight at 37°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, three minutes
each.
2. Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%
ethanol), three minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using either a microwave or pressure
cooker with an appropriate retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer,
pH 6.0, or Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0) as per the manufacturer's
recommendation.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for three minutes.
D. Blocking
1. Apply 3% hydrogen peroxide to slides to block endogenous
peroxidase activity, incubate for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for three minutes.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply P504S (AMACR) primary antibody diluted in Antibody
Diluent as per manufacturer’s recommendation.
2. Incubate the slides in a humidified chamber at room
temperature for 60 minutes or overnight at 4°C.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Wash slides in PBS buffer to remove excess primary antibody,
three times, three minutes each.
2. Apply the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as
per the detection system used, incubate for 30 minutes.
3. Wash slides in PBS buffer, three times, three minutes each.
4. Apply DAB chromogen solution, incubate and monitor the
development of the stain under a microscope (usually 5-10
minutes).
5. Rinse slides in distilled water.
G. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for one minute.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Bluing in tap water or 0.1% ammonium hydroxide.
H. Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols, three minutes each.
2. Clear slides in xylene, three minutes.
3. Apply mounting media and coverslips.
4. Quality Control
• Include known positive and negative control tissue sections in
each staining run to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
staining.
• Review control slides before evaluating patient samples.
1. Result Interpretation
• Brown, granular cytoplasmic staining in glandular epithelium
indicates positive staining for P504S.
• Ensure pathologist or trained personnel reviews all results.
1. Reporting Results
• Document staining intensity and distribution in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Refer results to a pathologist for final interpretation and clinical
correlation.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s insert for P504S (AMACR) primary antibody.
• Literature guidelines on immunohistochemistry procedures and
best practices.
1. Method Limitations
• Interpretation should consider possible cross-reactivity and non-
specific staining.
• Inadequate fixation, under/over-staining, and prolonged storage of
tissue sections can affect results.
