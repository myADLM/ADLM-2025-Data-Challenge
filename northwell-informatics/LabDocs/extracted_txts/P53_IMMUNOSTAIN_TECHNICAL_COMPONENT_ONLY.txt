SOP: P53 Immunostain (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the technical
component of generating P53 immunostain results, ensuring
accurate and reliable immunohistochemistry (IHC) outcomes for
patient samples in compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory technologists and staff are responsible for
performing P53 immunostaining procedures and documenting results
as defined in this protocol. It is the responsibility of all staff to
promptly report any issues that may affect test results to the
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Specimen Type: - Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
2.2. Specimen Acceptance Criteria: - Specimen blocks must be
appropriately labeled with patient identification. - Accompanying
requisition forms must include relevant clinical information and
requesting physician details.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1. Equipment: - Microtome - Water bath - Immunostainer (e.g.,
Ventana BenchMark, Dako Autostainer) - Microscope - Slides drying
oven (56°C)
3.2. Reagents: - P53 primary antibody (validated for IHC use) -
Secondary antibody (HRP or AP-conjugated) - Detection system
(DAB or other chromogen) - Positive and negative control slides -
Hematoxylin counterstain - Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
- Mounting media
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Slide Preparation: 1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-micron
thickness using a microtome. 2. Place sections on positively charged
glass slides. 3. Air dry slides overnight at room temperature or dry at
56°C for 1 hour.
4.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 1. Deparaffinize slides in two
changes of xylene for 10 minutes each. 2. Rehydrate through graded
alcohols (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) for 5 minutes each. 3. Rinse slides
in running distilled water for 5 minutes.
4.3 Antigen Retrieval: 1. Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or EDTA (pH 9.0) in a microwave or pressure cooker
according to manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Cool slides to room
temperature and rinse in PBS.
4.4 Immunostaining: 1. Load slides into the immunostainer. 2. Apply
P53 primary antibody according to manufacturer's recommended
dilution and incubation time. 3. Wash slides with PBS. 4. Apply
secondary antibody and incubate as per manufacturer's instructions.
5. Wash slides with PBS. 6. Apply the chromogen (DAB or
appropriate alternative) until the desired staining intensity is
achieved. 7. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 8. Rinse
in tap water and bluing reagent if necessary.
4.5 Dehydration and Mounting: 1. Dehydrate slides through alcohol
series (70%, 80%, 95%, 100%) and clear in xylene. 2. Apply
mounting media and coverslip.
4.6 Quality Control: 1. Include positive and negative control slides
with each batch of staining. 2. Inspect control slides to confirm
appropriate staining patterns. 3. Document any deviations or issues
in the quality control log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
5.1. Slide Review: - Stained slides are reviewed by a qualified
pathologist for accurate interpretation.
5.2. Documentation: - Document results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
5.3. Record Keeping: - Retain records of all performed staining
procedures, including slide ID, staining conditions, control results,
and any corrective actions taken.
