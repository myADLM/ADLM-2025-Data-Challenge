Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for P57 (KIP2/CDKN1C) Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for the technical
processing, staining, and documentation of P57 (KIP2/
CDKN1C) immunohistochemistry stains to ensure accurate and
reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing P57 (KIP2/
CDKN1C) immunostains within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to
perform the P57 (KIP2/CDKN1C) immunostain according to
this protocol.
◦ Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing
adherence to the procedure and ensuring the quality of
results.
◦ All laboratory staff must report any issues or deviations from
this SOP to their supervisor immediately.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Hotplate/drying oven
◦ Slide rack
◦ Staining jars
◦ Automated stainer (if applicable)
◦ P57 (KIP2/CDKN1C) primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody solution
◦ Detection kit
◦ Hematoxylin solution
◦ Mounting medium and cover slips
◦ Positive and negative control tissue sections
◦ Timer
◦ Distilled water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Xylene and graded ethanol series
5. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
a. Ensure specimens have been paraffin-embedded and are
properly identified.
b. Cut 3-5µm sections of the paraffin-embedded tissue using a
microtome.
c. Place sections onto positively charged microscope slides and
incubate at 60°C for 1 hour to adhere tissue sections.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
a. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 10 minutes,
twice.
b. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 85%,
and 70%) for 5 minutes each, ending with distilled water.
Antigen Retrieval:
a. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a
microwave or pressure cooker according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
b. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in PBS or
distilled water.
Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
a. Incubate slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution in
methanol for 10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase
activity.
b. Rinse slides in PBS.
Primary Antibody Incubation:
a. Apply P57 (KIP2/CDKN1C) primary antibody to each slide.
b. Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature for
30-60 minutes, or as specified by the antibody manufacturer.
c. Rinse slides in PBS.
Secondary Antibody and Detection:
a. Apply secondary antibody solution to slides and incubate
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
b. Wash slides in PBS.
c. Apply detection reagent (e.g., DAB) and incubate until color
develops, monitoring under a microscope for optimal staining.
d. Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water to stop the reaction.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
a. Dip slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes for nuclear
counterstaining.
b. Rinse in running tap water and then dip in distilled water.
c. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 85%, 95%,
and 100%) and clear in xylene.
d. Mount with a suitable mounting medium and cover slips.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include a positive control slide known to express P57
alongside patient slides.
◦ Include a negative control slide processed without the
primary antibody to check for non-specific staining.
◦ Document any deviations, observations, or issues
encountered during the procedure and notify the supervisor.
7. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all staining runs in the laboratory logbook, including
the date, time, technologist's initials, control results, and any
deviations or observations.
◦ Ensure all slides are properly labeled with patient identifiers
and relevant information.
◦ Maintain records according to laboratory policies and
regulatory requirements.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If staining is too weak or too strong, review antibody titration
and incubation times.
◦ Ensure all reagents and solutions are within their expiration
dates and properly prepared.
◦ Check equipment calibration and maintenance logs to rule
out instrument-related issues.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for P57 (KIP2/CDKN1C) primary
antibody and detection kits.
◦ Laboratory Quality Control Manual.
◦ Relevant literature and guidelines on immunohistochemistry.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
◦ This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on
updates to manufacturer’s guidelines or laboratory
practices.
◦ Any amendments will be documented and approved by the
laboratory supervisor.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of P57 (KIP2/CDKN1C)
immunostain results, supporting effective patient care and diagnosis.
