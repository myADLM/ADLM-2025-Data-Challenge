Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for P62 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for performing
p62 immunostaining on tissue sections to identify the presence and
localization of the p62 protein, ensuring the consistency and reliability
of test results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel responsible for
performing p62 immunostaining in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory technologists trained to carry out
immunohistochemistry procedures are responsible for the
implementation and adherence to this protocol. The laboratory
supervisor will ensure compliance and address any issues that arise.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Drying oven
• Coplin jars or automated staining system
• p62 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
• xylene, ethanol, and water (distilled)
• Slide racks
• Humidity chamber
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Thickness: 4-5 µm
• Place sections on positively charged microscope slides
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut tissue sections at 4-5 µm using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged slides and incubate in
a drying oven overnight at 56-60°C.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize sections by placing slides in xylene twice for 5
minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in a preheated
antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and
heating them in a microwave or water bath at 95-100°C for
20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool slightly before rinsing in distilled water
followed by PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).
Immunostaining: 4. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
• Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to block
endogenous peroxidase activity.
• Rinse in PBS for 5 minutes.
1. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply p62 primary antibody to each tissue section and
incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 1
hour or as per the manufacturer's recommendation.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to each
section and incubate in a humidity chamber at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3. DAB Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB (3,3’-diaminobenzidine) substrate to each
section and incubate until the desired color intensity
develops (3-5 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
4. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
◦ Differentiate in 0.3% acid alcohol for a few seconds and
rinse in water again.
◦ Blue sections in ammonia water (or tap water treated with
ammonia) for 1 minute.
5. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol
(70%, 95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear sections in xylene twice for 5 minutes each.
◦ Mount sections using a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Always include known positive and negative control slides
with each batch of staining to ensure the specificity and
validity of the staining procedure.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all steps in the staining process, including incubation
times, reagent lot numbers, and any deviations from the
standard procedure.
◦ Document and review the staining intensity and localization
of the p62 antigen on the control slides before releasing
patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS Microscopically examine the stained
slides to assess the presence and localization of p62 staining.
• Provide technical results to the pathologist for interpretation.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION This SOP will be reviewed annually
and revised as necessary to ensure compliance with current
laboratory standards and practices.
