Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for P63
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish standardized procedures for
the technical component of performing P63 immunostaining on
histological sections to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable
results are generated.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the technical staff responsible for
performing P63 immunostaining in the pathology laboratory. It
encompasses the preparation, staining, and quality control processes
necessary for generating P63 immunostain results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for executing the
staining procedure and ensuring its accuracy.
• Supervisors are responsible for oversight, training staff, and
ensuring compliance with this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• P63: A protein encoded by the TP63 gene, often used as a
biomarker in pathology.
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC): Technique used to detect specific
antigens in tissue sections by using antibodies tagged with a
visible label.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide stainer
• Light microscope
• Timer
Reagents and Consumables:
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Positive and negative control slides
• Primary antibody (anti-P63)
• Secondary antibody (biotinylated)
• Blocking serum
• ABC reagent (Avidin-Biotin Complex)
• Substrate-chromogen solution (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Cut tissue sections:
◦ Cut 3-µm thick sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath and pick up on positively
charged slides.
◦ Allow sections to air dry and then bake at 60°C for 1 hour.
2. Dewax and rehydrate slides:
◦ Dewax sections by immersing slides in xylene for 2 x 5
minutes.
◦ Rehydrate sections through a series of graded alcohols
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each, ending in distilled
water for 5 minutes.
B. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Antigen retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval by heating slides in a citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in PBS
for 5 minutes.
2. Blocking endogenous peroxidase activity:
◦ Incubate sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3. Apply primary antibody:
◦ Incubate sections with the primary antibody (anti-P63)
diluted in blocking serum for 1 hour at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
4. Apply secondary antibody:
◦ Incubate sections with a biotinylated secondary antibody for
30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
5. Apply ABC reagent:
◦ Incubate sections with ABC reagent for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
6. Develop with substrate-chromogen solution:
◦ Incubate sections with DAB substrate-chromogen solution
until the desired staining intensity is achieved (typically 2-5
minutes).
◦ Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water.
C. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water and dip in 0.1% acid alcohol for
differentiation (if necessary).
◦ Rinse in tap water until sections are blue.
2. Dehydrate and mount:
◦ Dehydrate slides by sequential immersion in graded
alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%).
◦ Clear sections in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining
batch.
• Review control slides under a light microscope to verify staining
quality.
• Record any deviations from expected results and take corrective
actions if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Completed slides are forwarded to the pathologist for evaluation.
• Ensure documentation of all steps in the staining process,
including condition of control slides and any technical issues
encountered.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all reagents and antibodies used.
• Published guidelines and standards for immunohistochemistry
protocols.
