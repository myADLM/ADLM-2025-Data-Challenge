Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
PACIFIC SQUID, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the measurement of IgE
against Pacific Squid antigen in a serum sample using an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This ensures consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for the evaluation of allergen-specific
IgE levels.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all serum samples submitted for analysis of
IgE against Pacific Squid antigen in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase to follow this procedure as outlined. The supervising
technologist ensures adherence to protocol and addresses any
discrepancies or issues.
1. SPECIMEN
4.1. Type of Specimen: - Serum collected in a red or yellow
top tube (SST).
4.2. Specimen Handling and Stability: - After collection, allow
the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature
for 30 minutes. - Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500–2000 x g to
separate the serum from the clot. - Transfer the serum to a
clean, labeled tube. - Store the serum at 2-8°C if the assay will
be performed within 7 days; otherwise, store at -20°C or lower
for longer-term storage. - Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
2. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
◦ Pacific Squid IgE ELISA Kit
◦ Micropipettes and tips (20-200 µL and 100-1000 µL)
◦ Calibrated automatic plate washer
◦ Calibrated ELISA plate reader
◦ Distilled or deionized water
◦ Timer
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Laboratory coat
◦ Biohazard waste container
3. QUALITY CONTROL
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of results, the following QC
steps must be undertaken before sample analysis:
• Run internal quality controls with known positive and negative
serum samples.
• External controls (if available) should be included in each run.
• Record all control results and ensure they are within the specified
ranges before proceeding with the sample analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation: - Allow all reagents and samples to reach
room temperature before starting the assay. - Prepare all
reagents, working standards, and samples as instructed in the
provided ELISA kit insert.
7.2. Assay Procedure: 1. Label the microplate according to the
samples and standards to be tested. 2. Pipette 100 µL of
standards, positive and negative controls, and serum samples
into the designated wells. 3. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to
each well. 4. Cover the plate with adhesive foil and incubate for
60 minutes at room temperature (20-25°C). 5. After incubation,
wash the plate 5 times with the prepared wash solution using
the automatic plate washer. 6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution
to each well and incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature
in the dark. 7. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to
terminate the reaction. 8. Gently tap the plate frame to ensure
thorough mixing.
7.3. Measurement: - Read the absorbance in each well at 450
nm using the ELISA plate reader within 10 minutes after the
addition of stop solution.
2. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance value of each set of
duplicate standards, controls, and samples.
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
obtained for each standard against its concentration.
◦ Determine the IgE concentration of the samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
◦ The results are expressed in kU/L (kilo units per liter).
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review results for consistency and accuracy before
reporting.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific protocols.
◦ Any results indicating potential analytical error or falling
outside the standard curve should be re-assayed.

1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the assay control values fall outside the specified limits, do not
report results, and investigate the issue.
• Common issues and solutions include:
◦ High background: Ensure thorough washing steps.
◦ No color development: Check for expired or degraded
reagents.
◦ Poor standard curve: Verify proper preparation and dilution of
standards.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain a logbook for all assay runs including date, operator, control
results, sample results, and any deviations from the standard
protocol.
By following this protocol, the analysis of IgE against Pacific Squid
antigen will be performed consistently, ensuring reliable and accurate
results for clinical interpretation.
