Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PAIN CLINIC SURVEY 10, CHAIN OF
CUSTODY, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating the results for PAIN CLINIC SURVEY 10, CHAIN OF
CUSTODY, RANDOM, URINE samples. This ensures that all
specimens are handled, processed, and analyzed according to
established protocols to maintain chain of custody and produce
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All staff involved in the analytical phase must adhere to this SOP to
maintain the integrity of the chain of custody and ensure the accuracy
of the results. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure that staff are trained and comply with this protocol.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Acceptance Criteria:
• Specimens must be collected in a secure, tamper-evident
container.
• Each specimen must be accompanied by a properly filled chain of
custody form.
• The specimen must have proper labeling that matches the chain
of custody form (including donor name, identification number, date
and time of collection, and collector’s signature).
• Unacceptable specimens include those that are improperly
labeled, show evidence of tampering, are leaking, or have
incomplete chain of custody documentation.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Secure, tamper-evident specimen containers
• Chain of custody forms and seals
• Urine drug test kits/reagent strips (as specified for PAIN CLINIC
SURVEY 10)
• Analytical instruments (e.g., gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS))
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Log books or electronic logging systems
4. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Verify the integrity of the specimen container and the chain of
custody form.
2. Confirm that the specimen label matches the chain of custody
documentation.
3. Log the specimen into the laboratory information system, noting
date, time, and handling personnel.
4. Aliquot the urine sample into appropriate testing vials under
secure conditions, maintaining the chain of custody.
5. Store aliquots at the designated temperature until analysis
(room temperature as specified or per kit instructions).
B) Analytical Instrument and Reagent Preparation:
1. Perform calibration checks on analytical instruments (GC-MS,
LC-MS) as outlined in the manufacturer’s maintenance
guidelines.
2. Prepare reagents and control materials per manufacturer
specifications, ensuring they are not expired and are stored
properly.
3. Run quality control samples to verify instrument performance.
Document and review results.
C) Analytical Testing:
1. Follow the specific procedures of the urine drug test kit or
analytical method used:
◦ For immunoassay screening: Dip the reagent strip or add
the aliquot to the test kit as specified.
▪ Wait the indicated incubation period.
▪ Read results visually or using an automated reader as
appropriate.
2. For confirmatory testing (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS):
◦ Prepare the sample by appropriate extraction technique.
◦ Ensure all solvent bottles are appropriately labeled.
◦ Inject aliquots of the prepared specimen into the
chromatograph following standard operating parameters.
◦ Run the sample in a batch along with control and calibration
standards.
3. Review chromatograms and identify compounds according to
retention times and mass spectra. Use established cut-off
thresholds to determine positive or negative results.
D) Result Verification and Reporting:
1. Double-check the results against quality control measures to
ensure accuracy.
2. Document test result in the laboratory information system,
clearly indicating if any part of the process flagged an issue
(e.g., QC fail, specimen integrity question).
3. Results should be reviewed and verified by a second
technologist or supervisor.
4. Report results to the requesting entity as per protocol, ensuring
all aspects of the chain of custody remain clear and intact.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Perform routine quality control at the start and end of each
testing day and after instrument maintenance.
2. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken in the
event of QC failures.
3. If any issues arise during testing (e.g., inconclusive results,
instrument errors), promptly notify the supervisor and document
the issue. Investigate and resolve the issue following standard
troubleshooting protocols.
6. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps, observations, and results are thoroughly
documented in the appropriate logbooks or electronic systems:
• Chain of custody forms
• Temperature logs for reagent and specimen storage
• Calibration and maintenance logs for analytical instruments
• Quality control logs
• Specimen accession and result logs
7. REFERENCES
Refer to manufacturer's instructions for the instrument and test kits
used:
• GC-MS and LC-MS user manuals
• Reagent insert instructions for specific test kits (e.g., reagent
strips)
• Laboratory-specific quality control and standard operating
procedures
This SOP must be reviewed annually and revised as needed to
ensure it reflects current best practices and regulatory requirements.
