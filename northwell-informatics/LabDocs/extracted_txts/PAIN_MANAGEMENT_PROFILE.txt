Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for PAIN
MANAGEMENT PROFILE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and timely analysis of
the Pain Management Profile, which includes testing for prescribed
and non-prescribed medications, illicit drugs, and relevant
metabolites. This SOP outlines the procedures necessary for the
correct operation, quality control, and troubleshooting of equipment,
reagents, and methodologies used in the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing and documenting the
procedures described in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with the SOP and addressing any issues that
arise during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Urine
• Serum
• Plasma
Handling and Transport:
• Specimens must be collected using appropriate collection
containers.
• Specimens must be labeled with patient information, collection
date, and time.
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory immediately or
stored at 4-8°C until transport.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without proper labeling.
• Specimens stored at incorrect temperatures.
• Specimens with visible contamination.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Immunoassay analyzers
• Calibrators and controls specific to the pain management profile
• Pipettes, centrifuges, and other general laboratory equipment
Reagents and Supplies:
• Drug-specific reagent kits
• Certified reference materials
• Quality control materials
All reagents must be within expiration dates and stored according to
manufacturer's instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Specimens:
• Verify specimen labeling and acceptability.
• Centrifuge blood specimens if necessary to obtain serum/plasma.
• Aliquot specimens as needed for analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate equipment as per manufacturer's guidelines before
running patient samples.
• Perform quality control checks with low, medium, and high
controls.
• Document all calibrations and QC results.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Immunoassay Screening:
◦ Perform initial screening using immunoassay methods.
◦ Follow kit-specific instructions for each drug/metabolite.
◦ Record results and flag any positive findings.
2. Confirmatory Testing by LC-MS/MS:
◦ Prepare and analyze positive immunoassay specimens
using LC-MS/MS.
◦ Perform extraction if required by method.
◦ Ensure instrument calibration and troubleshooting as per
SOP.
◦ Document results and any deviations from protocol.
D) Data Analysis and Result Interpretation:
• Review analytical data for accuracy and completeness.
• Compare results against reference ranges and cutoff values.
• Flag abnormal or critical results and notify the appropriate medical
personnel.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Monthly intralab comparisons with control samples.
• Document and track control results.
• Troubleshoot and re-run any failed QC samples following the
instrument-specific SOPs.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Technologists review and verify results before final reporting.
• Ensure flagged and critical results are communicated to
physicians promptly.
• Document any issues or deviations during result verification.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to manufacturer inserts and clinical guidelines for specific cutoff
values and reference ranges for each analyte in the Pain
Management Profile.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow equipment-specific troubleshooting guides.
• Document any instrument errors and corrective actions taken.
• For persistent issues, contact equipment manufacturer support
and consult supervisor.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to individual reagent kit inserts for limitations specific to each
test method used. Ensure all staff are familiar with these limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's equipment operation manuals.
• Drug reagent kit inserts.
• Clinical guidelines for pain management drug testing.
Document Control:
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required due to changes in
equipment, methodologies, or clinical guidelines. Ensure all staff is
trained on revisions to the SOP.
All staff must adhere to this protocol to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of the Pain Management Profile results for optimal patient
care.
