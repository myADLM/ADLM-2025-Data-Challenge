Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Testing for PALIPERIDONE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating accurate and precise results for Paliperidone in serum
samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting
the analytical procedure as defined in this SOP. It is the responsibility
of all staff performing these tests to ensure adherence to the protocol
and to report any deviations or issues to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Acceptable: Serum collected in a red-top tube without
anticoagulant.
Specimen Handling:
• After collection, allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1,500 g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the serum into a properly labeled secondary tube if not
analyzed immediately.
• Serums should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7 days. If
longer storage is necessary, freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Specimens received in the laboratory more than 7 days post-
collection if stored at 2-8°C and not frozen.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector or LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry)
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes without
anticoagulant
• Micropipettes
• Paliperidone standard reference material
• Mobile phase components
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high concentrations of
Paliperidone controls)
• Calibration standards for Paliperidone
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare a calibration curve using at least five calibrators,
spanning the expected range of Paliperidone concentrations in
serum samples.
• Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch of patient samples and after every 10 patient samples.
• Ensure that all quality controls are within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
4.2 Sample Preparation
• Label all serum sample tubes with patient identifiers and
accession numbers.
• Prepare samples by adding an appropriate volume (e.g., 500 µL)
of serum to a labeled test tube.
• Add internal standards if required.
• Follow the sample preparation protocol specific to the HPLC or
LC-MS/MS method being used (e.g., protein precipitation, solid-
phase extraction, or liquid-liquid extraction).
4.3 Chromatographic Analysis
• Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS instrument according to the
laboratory protocol.
• Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and quality
control samples into the autosampler.
• Run the samples according to the validated method.
• Ensure that the system suitability criteria (e.g., retention time,
peak shape, and resolution) are met for the Paliperidone analyte.
4.4 Data Analysis and Reporting
• Analyze the chromatograms and integrate the peaks
corresponding to Paliperidone.
• Generate a standard curve using the calibration standards.
• Calculate the concentration of Paliperidone in each serum sample
using the standard curve.
• Review and validate the results. If quality control samples are
outside the acceptable range, identify and rectify the problem
before reanalyzing patient samples.
• Report results in ng/mL, using laboratory information system (LIS)
procedures for result verification and documentation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of HPLC or LC-MS/
MS instruments.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs and inter-laboratory
comparison schemes.
• Review all QC and patient results for trends or deviations before
accepting and reporting results.
• Document any troubleshooting steps taken during the analytical
procedure in the instrument log.
1. LIMITATIONS
• This method is specific for Paliperidone and cannot differentiate
between Paliperidone and its metabolites.
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored samples may give inaccurate
results.
• Analytical interferences may occur due to substances with similar
chromatographic properties.
1. REFERENCES
• Paliperidone product inserts and package inserts provided by
reagent manufacturers.
• Relevant laboratory and instrument manuals.
• Standard textbooks and peer-reviewed literature on the
chromatographic analysis of pharmaceutical compounds.
