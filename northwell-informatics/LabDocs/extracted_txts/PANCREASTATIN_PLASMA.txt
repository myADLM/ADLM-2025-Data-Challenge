Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Pancreastatin, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical phase protocols for generating
results for Pancreastatin in plasma samples. It includes specimen
acceptance, preparation, and analysis guidelines to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All personnel involved in the analytical phase of Pancreastatin testing
are responsible for adhering to the procedures outlined in this SOP. It
is the responsibility of all staff to report any deviations or issues
encountered during the analytical process to the designated
supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• EDTA plasma collected from fasting patients.
• Procedure-specific volume of plasma, typically 1-2 mL.
• Verify collection data and ensure no prolonged contact time with
cells.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA (e.g., heparinized
or SST tubes).
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens arriving with no date/time of collection indicated.
• Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection if not
stored and transported appropriately.
Storage and stability:
• Plasma must be separated from cells immediately within 2 hours
and stored at -20°C or lower until analysis.
• Specimens are stable for up to 3 months at -20°C and up to 6
months at -80°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• EDTA plasma collection tubes
• Specimen storage containers
• Analytical instrumentation specific to Pancreastatin analysis (e.g.,
mass spectrometry, ELISA kit)
• Standard reagents and supplies specified by the instrument
manufacturer’s requirements
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure the plasma specimen is completely thawed if previously
frozen.
2. Vortex the specimen to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove any residual
cellular debris.
Testing Preparation:
1. Load specimens into the appropriate racks for the analytical
instrument.
2. Prepare reagents and calibrate the instrument according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Perform instrument quality control checks prior to running
patient samples.
Analyzing Specimens:
1. Initiate the assay procedure using the standardized protocol for
the instrument.
2. Ensure continuous monitoring of the instrument to identify
errors or deviations.
3. Document individual measurements and calibrations in the
associated log.
Monitoring Results:
1. Collect preliminary data from the instrument and verify against
expected control values.
2. Analyze data using instrument-specific software and produce a
summary report.
Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify each result to ensure accuracy and
completeness.
2. Report results electronically to Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Confirm critical results and flag appropriately as per laboratory
standards.
4. Any questionable results must be documented and reviewed for
potential analysis repeat.
Quality Control:
1. Use commercially available Pancreastatin control material
according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Perform regular calibration and validation of instruments.
3. Document control results and any corrective actions taken if
results fall outside acceptable limits.

manufacturer’s manual for detailed procedures and limitations.
