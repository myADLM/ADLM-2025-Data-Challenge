Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
Determination of Pancreatic Elastase in Feces
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the determination of Pancreatic
Elastase in fecal specimens. Pancreatic Elastase is an enzyme
produced by the pancreas, and its concentration in feces is a reliable
marker for pancreatic function. The assay is performed to evaluate
patients for conditions such as chronic pancreatitis or exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel trained in fecal analysis are
responsible for executing this procedure to ensure accurate and
reliable results. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
adherence to this protocol and addressing any analytical issues.
1. DEFINITION
Pancreatic Elastase: An enzyme that hydrolyzes peptide bonds in
proteins, primarily produced by the pancreas. Measurement of its
levels in feces can indicate pancreatic function.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Feces Preferred Collection Container: Clean, dry,
and leak-proof stool container without preservatives. Volume:
Minimum 5 grams or as indicated per assay requirement. Stability
and Storage: Specimen is stable for 72 hours at 2-8°C. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with preservatives.
• Specimens contaminated with urine or other substances.
• Specimens without a collection date/time or requisition form.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Dedicated Pancreatic Elastase ELISA kit (Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay)
◦ Antibody-coated microtiter plate
◦ Standards and controls
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Dilution buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Plate reader with wavelength settings appropriate for the ELISA
kit (typically 450 nm)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set at optimal temperature as specified by the kit
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenize the fecal specimen to ensure a consistent sample.
2. Weigh out an appropriate amount of feces, as indicated in the
kit insert (usually 100 mg or as specified).
3. Dilute the sample in the provided dilution buffer according to the
instructions in the ELISA kit.
Immunoassay:
1. Add specified volumes of the diluted fecal sample, standards,
and controls to the antibody-coated wells.
2. Incubate wells at the temperature and duration indicated in the
kit instructions.
3. Wash the wells with the provided wash buffer to remove
unbound material.
4. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
5. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
6. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at the specified
wavelength using a plate reader.
7. CALCULATIONS
8. Plot the standard curve using the OD values obtained from the
standards.
9. Determine the Pancreatic Elastase concentration in fecal
samples by comparing their OD values to the standard curve.
10. Apply any necessary dilution factors to obtain the final
concentration.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
Control Samples:
• Run positive and negative control samples provided in the kit with
each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure that the OD values of control samples are within the
expected range as specified by the kit manufacturer.
Troubleshooting:
• If control samples fall outside the expected range, review the
procedural steps for errors and repeat the assay.
• If issues persist, contact the kit manufacturer for technical
support.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reported based on site-specific guidelines.
Reference intervals for Pancreatic Elastase in fecal samples are
typically provided in the kit documentation and should be used as
benchmarks.
Pancreatic Elastase normal range:
• Normal: ≥ 200 µg/g feces
• Mild to moderate pancreatic insufficiency: 100-200 µg/g feces
• Severe pancreatic insufficiency: < 100 µg/g feces
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to reagent
stability, interference factors, and cross-reactivity.
