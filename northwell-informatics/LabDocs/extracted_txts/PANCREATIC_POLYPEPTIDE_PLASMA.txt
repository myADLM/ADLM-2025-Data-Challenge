Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Pancreatic Polypeptide, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the determination of
Pancreatic Polypeptide levels in plasma samples to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting the results, and following procedures
described in this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Collect blood sample in a heparinized vacutainer (light green or
PST).
• Plasma separated by centrifugation within 1 hour after collection.
• Specimens should be kept on ice and stored at -80°C until
analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 2 hours after
collection without prior processing.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or clotted samples.
• Samples with incorrect labeling or without collection date/time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Materials required:
• Heparinized vacutainer tubes (light green or PST)
• Centrifuge
• ELISA kit for Pancreatic Polypeptide
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, safety goggles
Reagents required:
• ELISA wash buffer
• ELISA assay buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Calibration standards
• Control samples
Storage:
• ELISA kits and all reagents should be stored as recommended by
the manufacturer, typically at 2-8°C.
• Plasma samples should be stored at -80°C until analysis.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure plasma samples are properly labelled and stored.
2. Thaw plasma samples at 4°C overnight or at room temperature
for 1-2 hours before analysis.
3. Centrifuge plasma samples at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
4. Aliquot plasma samples into labelled microcentrifuge tubes for
analysis.
B. ELISA Assay
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Remove the ELISA plate from storage and allow it to
equilibrate to room temperature.
◦ Prepare the wash buffer, assay buffer, and substrate
solution according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Standard Preparation:
◦ Reconstitute calibration standards as per the kit’s
instructions.
◦ Generate a standard curve by serially diluting the highest
standard concentration as specified by the manufacturer.
3. Sample and Control Application:
◦ Pipette 100 μL of standards, controls, and plasma samples
into designated wells.
◦ Add 100 μL of assay buffer to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to mix the contents and cover the plate
with adhesive foil or plate sealer.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 1 hour.
◦ Remove the plate cover and wash the plate 3-5 times with
prepared wash buffer using an automatic plate washer or
manually.
◦ After washing, add 100 μL of the substrate solution to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Read the plate immediately using a plate reader set to
measure absorbance at 450 nm.
C. Analysis and Reporting
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Use the plate reader to generate absorbance readings.
◦ Plot the standard curve and interpolate the sample
concentrations using appropriate software.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that control values are within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
◦ Repeat assay if controls are outside acceptable limits and
document corrective actions taken.
D. Documentation
• Record the plate reader data, standard curve, and calculated
sample concentrations in the final laboratory report.
• Document the date, time, and initials of the technologist
performing the assay in the data log.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Use control samples provided in the ELISA kit.
• Perform assay with both positive and negative controls.
Storage and Stability:
• Store control samples as recommended.
• Validate control results for each assay and document accordingly.
Procedure:
• Perform quality control with each ELISA plate and document
results.
• If control fails, troubleshoot and repeat the analysis before
reporting.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) and must be reviewed and verified by the
technologist according to laboratory guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
• Define reference intervals based on established lab data or kit
insert.
Method Limitations:
Refer to manufacturer's guidelines for any limitations related to the
ELISA kit.
