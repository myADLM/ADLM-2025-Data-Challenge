Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PANEL TO WHOLE
EXOME SEQUENCING REFLEX TEST, VARIES
1. PURPOSE To provide a comprehensive protocol for the
processing and analysis of specimens for Panel to Whole
Exome Sequencing (WES) Reflex Test. This protocol ensures
accurate and reliable generation of sequencing data and
identification of genetic variants.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to
perform all steps in the procedure accurately and to ensure that all
quality control measures are adhered to.
1. SCOPE This procedure is applicable to all specimens received
in the laboratory for Panel to Whole Exome Sequencing Reflex
Test.
2. DEFINITIONS Panel Sequencing: Targeted sequencing of a
specific set of genes. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES):
Sequencing of all protein-coding regions in the genome.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens:
◦ Blood: 3-5 mL in EDTA (purple top) or Streck (cell-free DNA)
tube.
◦ Saliva: Collected using an appropriate collection kit.
◦ Tissue: Fresh or flash-frozen samples preferred. Formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples acceptable.
• Specimen labeling must include patient information, collection
date, and time.
• Specimen storage: Blood and saliva samples at 2-8°C, tissue
samples at -80°C or in cryopreservative.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA Extraction Kits: Column-based or magnetic bead-based kits.
• Quantification Instruments: Qubit fluorometer, NanoDrop
spectrophotometer.
• Quality Control Reagents: Genomic DNA standard, PicoGreen
dsDNA quantitation reagent.
• Library Preparation Kits: Enzymes, adapters, ligases.
• Sequencers: Illumina MiSeq/HiSeq, or equivalent.
• Bioinformatics Tools: Alignment software (BWA), variant callers
(GATK, VarScan).
1. PROCEDURE A. DNA Extraction
2. Extract genomic DNA from the specimen using the specified
DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Assess the quantity and quality of DNA using a Qubit
fluorometer or NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
B. Library Preparation
1. Fragment DNA to the desired size (200-300 bp) using shearing
devices.
2. Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation using the
library preparation kit.
3. Purify ligated products and perform PCR amplification to
generate the sequencing library.
4. Validate library size distribution on an Agilent Bioanalyzer.
C. Target Enrichment (Panel)
1. Hybridize capture probes (specific to the gene panel) to the
prepared library.
2. Perform capture hybridization and post-capture PCR
amplification.
3. Purify and quantify the enriched library.
D. Sequencing
1. Pool enriched libraries and load onto a sequencing flow cell.
2. Run the sequencing instrument following the manufacturer’s
protocol for the specified read length.
3. Monitor the sequencing run and assess the quality of the
generated data.
E. Data Analysis
1. Align sequencing reads to the reference genome using BWA or
equivalent software.
2. Perform variant calling using GATK, VarScan, or equivalent
tools.
3. Annotate identified variants with relevant databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, dbSNP).
F. Reflex to Whole Exome Sequencing
1. If additional findings are required or if initial panel results are
inconclusive, proceed with whole exome sequencing.
2. Follow procedures for library preparation, sequencing, and data
analysis as outlined above, adjusting enrichment step for whole
exome target capture.
G. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Interpret identified variants in the context of the clinical
information provided.
2. Generate a comprehensive report detailing the findings, their
clinical implications, and recommendations for further actions.
3. Perform a secondary review and validation of the report before
release.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of DNA
extraction and library preparation.
• Monitor sequencing quality metrics such as Q30 scores, base call
accuracy.
• Verify consistency and reproducibility through replicate analysis.
• Document all activities, observations, and deviations in laboratory
records.
1. SAFETY
• Follow institutional biosafety guidelines when handling human
specimens.
• Use proper PPE (gloves, lab coats, eye protection).
• Dispose of waste according to hazardous waste disposal
guidelines.
