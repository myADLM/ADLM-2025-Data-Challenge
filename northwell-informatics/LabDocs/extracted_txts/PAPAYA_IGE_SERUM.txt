Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PAPAYA, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide comprehensive procedures for
the analysis of PAPAYA (Papain Allergen), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), in
serum specimens. The SOP ensures standardized, accurate, and
reliable results for patient specimens.
1. DEFINITION
PAPAYA, IGE, SERUM refers to the analysis of serum samples for
the detection and quantification of specific IgE antibodies against
Papain allergen (commonly derived from papaya).
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are trained and responsible for
performing, monitoring, and documenting all steps involved in the
analytical phase of PAPAYA, IGE, SERUM testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Container: Serum Separator Tube (SST) or plain red-
top tube
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples, and specimens with less than required volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Centrifuge, refrigerated storage, ELISA or
chemiluminescent Immunoassay analyzer, Pipettes, and
microplate reader (if applicable).
• Reagents: Specific IgE assay kit for Papain (PAPAYA),
Calibrators, Control materials
• Supplies: Microtiter plates, pipette tips, serum separator tubes.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Processing
◦ Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 3,000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate serum.
◦ Carefully aliquot the serum into properly labeled sample
tubes.
◦ Store the serum at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
3. Reagent Preparation
◦ Allow all reagents to come to room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions provided in the specific IgE
assay kit.
4. Assay Procedure
◦ ELISA method:
1. Add the specified volume of serum, calibrators, and
controls to the designated wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Incubate as recommended by the manufacturer.
3. Wash the wells multiple times using the wash buffer to
remove unbound proteins.
4. Add the detection antibody and incubate for the
specified time.
5. Wash the wells again to remove excess detection
antibody.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate until optimal color
development is achieved.
7. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
8. Read the optical density (OD) at the recommended
wavelength using a microplate reader.
◦ Chemiluminescent Immunoassay method:
1. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and
controls onto the analyzer.
2. Follow the analyzer’s program settings specific for
PAPAYA, IGE, SERUM.
3. The analyzer will automatically conduct the incubation,
washing, and signal detection steps.
4. Results are generated and displayed on the analyzer
screen.
5. Quality Control
◦ Run quality control materials alongside patient specimens
with each assay.
◦ Document and review QC results to ensure they are within
the acceptable range before releasing patient results.
◦ Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding
with the patient results.
6. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Compare the OD readings or chemiluminescence signals of
serum samples with calibrators to determine the concentration of
specific IgE in kU/L.
• Report results according to the pre-determined reference intervals
and interpret them as follows:
◦ Undetectable levels of IgE to Papain: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.35-0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: >0.70 kU/L
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
documentation.
• Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before final release.
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider of any critical results
according to the laboratory’s policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <0.35 kU/L
• Borderline: 0.35-0.70 kU/L
• Positive: >0.70 kU/L
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the assay equipment following
the laboratory’s maintenance schedule.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
continued accuracy of PAPAYA, IGE, SERUM analysis.
