Standard Operating Procedure for PAPRIKA IGE,
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for PAPRIKA, IGE, Serum tests to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
The procedures described in this document apply to all laboratory
personnel performing PAPRIKA, IGE, Serum tests in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the procedures as outlined in this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance with the
procedures and addressing any issues or discrepancies.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum collected in SST (Serum Separator Tubes) or plain red top
tubes.
• Specimens should arrive at the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection.
• If immediate processing is not possible, the specimen can be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA, citrate, or heparin.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory beyond the acceptable time
frame or improperly labeled specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• IGE (Immunoglobulin E) test reagents and controls
• PAPRIKA quantitative test kit
• Incubator
• Test tubes and racks
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab coat,
etc.
• Standard laboratory glassware and consumables
6. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Specimen Processing
1. Upon receipt, inspect all specimens for proper labeling and
integrity.
2. Centrifuge the SST tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully transfer the serum into labeled aliquot tubes avoiding
contamination and hemolysis.
4. Store aliquots at 2-8°C until analysis or immediately proceed
with the test.
B. IGE Assay
1. Prepare Reagents:
◦ Prepare the IGE standard curve according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Thaw any necessary reagents and controls to room
temperature.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette 100 μL of standards, controls, and patient samples
into appropriate wells in duplicate.
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme-linked antibody specific to IGE to
each well.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the wells 3 times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Ensure that control results are within the acceptable range
before proceeding with sample analysis.
4. Calculation of Results:
◦ Generate the standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
the standards against their concentrations.
◦ Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
IGE in the patient samples.
C. PAPRIKA Assay
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw all necessary reagents and standards to room
temperature.
◦ Prepare the sample dilutions as needed.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted patient
samples to the corresponding wells in duplicate.
◦ Add 50 μL of enzyme-label reagent to each well and mix
gently by tapping the plate.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
reagent.
◦ Add 100 μL of TMB substrate to each well and incubate for
15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Include low-, medium-, and high-quality control samples with
each run.
◦ Review the control data to ensure they fall within the
manufacturer's specified ranges.
4. Calculation of Results:
◦ Create a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their known concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of PAPRIKA in the unknown
samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Verification:
◦ Verify that all quality control results are within acceptable
ranges.
◦ Review patient results for consistency and flag any outliers
for repeat testing.
2. Documentation and Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are verified and released by the
technologist.
◦ Document any discrepancies, corrective actions, or
deviations in the appropriate logs.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Calibrate equipment and maintain logs as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Ensure all controls, reagents, and kits are within their expiration
dates and stored under the recommended conditions.
3. Perform routine quality control checks and document results as
part of the laboratory quality assurance program.
