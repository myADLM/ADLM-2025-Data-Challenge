Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Paracoccidioidomycosis Study, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish consistent procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Paracoccidioidomycosis serology studies. This
includes the identification, quantification, and confirmation of
antibodies or antigens present in the serum of patients suspected to
have Paracoccidioidomycosis.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
serological analysis of serum samples for Paracoccidioidomycosis in
the designated laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff: Responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensuring that staff adhere to these
procedures and that the results are reviewed and validated
appropriately.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM): A systemic fungal infection
caused by Paracoccidioides species.
• Serum: The fluid portion of blood, obtained after the removal of
cellular components by centrifugation.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection: Blood collected using standard phlebotomy
techniques.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Storage: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24
hours. For long-term storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plates and reader
• Micropipettes and tips
• Washing buffer
• Blocking buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Positive and negative controls
• Sample diluent
• Incubator
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Check Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Verify that all equipment (ELISA reader, incubator, etc.) is
calibrated according to manufacturer’s specifications.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within expiry dates and have been
stored appropriately.
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
B. Testing Procedure
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Label each well of the ELISA plate according to the plate
map.
◦ Dilute patient serum samples as specified in the reagent kit
instructions, typically 1:100 in sample diluent.
2. Adding Samples and Controls:
◦ Add 100 μL of diluted serum sample, positive control, and
negative control to the appropriate wells.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate for the recommended time at
the recommended temperature (typically 37°C for 1 hour).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using the washing buffer as per the kit
instructions. Usually, it involves five washes with the buffer
using an automatic plate washer or manually.
4. Detection:
◦ Add 100 μL of detection antibody/enzyme conjugate to each
well.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes to 1 hour as recommended.
◦ Repeat the washing steps.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark for 10-20 minutes at room temperature
or as specified.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the recommended
wavelength (typically 450 nm with a reference wavelength of
620-650 nm) using the ELISA reader.
C. Results and Reporting:
1. Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the mean OD of the positive and negative
controls.
◦ Determine the cut-off value as per the kit instructions.
◦ Compare the OD of the patient samples to the cut-off value.
2. Reporting:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Positive results: OD higher than the cut-off value.
◦ Negative results: OD lower than the cut-off value.
◦ Equivocal results: OD near the cut-off value; retesting may
be necessary.
3. Validation:
◦ The laboratory supervisor should review the results.
◦ Confirm that positive and negative controls exhibit expected
results before validating patient results.
D. Quality Control:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Run quality control samples (positive and negative) with
each batch of tests to ascertain the validity of the results.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If controls fail, rerun the assay with new reagents.
◦ Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard precautions and biosafety level 2 guidelines
when handling human serum.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses.
• Handle reagents and chemicals according to the Materials Safety
Data Sheets (MSDS).
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ELISA kit used.
• Protocols and guidelines from clinical laboratory standards (e.g.,
CLSI).
