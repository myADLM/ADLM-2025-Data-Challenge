Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
PARAFIBROMIN, IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the technical processing,
staining, and analysis of tissue samples using the PARAFIBROMIN
immunostain. This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability
of the results for the technical component of the test.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the technical processing of tissue samples
for PARAFIBROMIN immunostaining in the laboratory. This includes
the preparation, staining, and preliminary analysis of slides before
being sent for final interpretation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All lab personnel performing the PARAFIBROMIN immunostain must
adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to
ensure the correct execution of the steps outlined in the procedure
and to identify any deviations or technical issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
• 4-5 µm thickness sections mounted on positively charged slides
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissues fixed in a fixative other than formalin
• Overly thick or uneven sections
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• Slide Rack
• Coverslipping machine or manual coverslipping supplies
• Microscope
Reagents:
• Primary Antibody: Anti-ParaFibromin
• Secondary Antibody: HRP or AP Conjugated Secondary Antibody
• Detection System: DAB or AP chromogen and substrate
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Positive and Negative Control Slides
• Mounting Medium
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Sectioning: a. Cut 4-5 µm sections from FFPE tissue blocks on
a microtome. b. Float sections on a water bath at ~40°C and
pick up on positively charged slides. c. Bake slides at 60°C for
30 minutes to adhere sections to slides properly.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 2. Deparaffinize slides in three
changes of xylene or a substitute xylene for 5 minutes each. 3.
Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2
minutes each. 4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval: 5. Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate
buffer and method (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0, heat-induced retrieval
in microwave or steamer).
Immunostaining: 6. Incubate slides in a blocking solution to prevent
non-specific binding. 7. Apply primary antibody (Anti-ParaFibromin) to
the tissue sections and incubate as per manufacturer’s instructions
(e.g., 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C). 8. Rinse slides
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS). 9.
Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 10. Visualize with DAB or AP substrate.
11. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes, followed by rinsing
in tap water. 12. Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in
xylene.
Mounting: 13. Mount coverslips using a suitable mounting medium
and allow slides to dry.
Quality Control: 14. Include known positive and negative control
slides with each staining run. 15. Document any deviations or
anomalous staining.
Slide Review: 16. Perform a preliminary review of the stained slides
under a microscope to ensure adequate staining and specificity. 17.
Note any technical issues and address them prior to sending slides
for pathologist review.
Documentation: 18. Record details of the staining process, including
reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and any deviations in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all controls stain appropriately; positive controls must
show expected staining, and negative controls must show no
staining.
• Record and document all QC results and any corrective actions
taken in case of QC failure.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lab coats, gloves,
and safety goggles.
• Handle all reagents and specimens in accordance with the
laboratory’s chemical and biohazard safety guidelines.
