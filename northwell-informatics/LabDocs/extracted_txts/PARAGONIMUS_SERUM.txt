Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Paragonimus, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the specific
steps necessary for the accurate and precise analysis of
Paragonimus antibodies in serum samples. This procedure
ensures proper testing, maintains the quality and integrity of the
specimen, and verifies the results following best laboratory
practices.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP precisely and to maintain high standards
of data integrity and accuracy throughout the testing process.
Supervisors must ensure all staff are trained and adhere to these
procedures and document any required corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN 2.1. Collection:
◦ Preferred: Serum collected in a plain red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
◦ Volume: Minimum 5 mL of whole blood to yield sufficient
serum for testing.
2.2. Acceptance Criteria: - Properly labeled with patient identification.
- No hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus. - Collected and transported to the
laboratory within the specified timeframe.
2.3. Handling and Storage: - Centrifuge and separate serum from
cells within 2 hours of collection. - Store serum at 2-8° C if analysis is
to be performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum at
-20° C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES 3.1. Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and sterile disposable tips
◦ Microplate reader
◦ Incubator (37° C)
3.2. Reagents: - Paragonimus Antibody Test Kit (per manufacturer
instructions) - Calibrators and controls - Phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) - Substrate solution - Stopping solution
3.3. Supplies: - Microplates (as per test kit requirements) - Microplate
sealing covers - Disposable gloves
1. PROCEDURE 4.1. Preparation
◦ Review the manufacturer’s instructions for the Paragonimus
Antibody Test Kit thoroughly.
◦ Ensure all equipment and reagents are properly calibrated
and within their expiration dates.
◦ Bring reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
4.2. Assay Procedure 1. Sample Preparation: - Dilute serum
samples if required by the test protocol. - Include positive and
negative controls and calibrators in the testing batch.
2. **Assay Procedure:**
- Add appropriate sample or control volume to each well as per the assay protocol.
- Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration.
- Follow the washing steps meticulously to avoid cross-contamination.
- Add conjugate reagent, incubate, wash, and repeat incubation and wash steps as directed.
- Add substrate solution and incubate for the time stated in the protocol.
- Add stopping solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
- Read the plate at the specified wavelength using the microplate reader.
4.3. Calibration and Quality Control - Run calibrators and controls
with each batch of samples to ensure assay validity. - Prepare and
document results in the Temperature Monitoring Log. - Calibrate the
microplate reader and incubator daily or as per the laboratory’s
quality control schedule.
1. REPORTING RESULTS 5.1. Data Analysis
◦ Analyze data as specified by the test kit instructions to
determine the presence of Paragonimus antibodies.
◦ Review quality control data to ensure results are within
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
5.2. Interpretation - Interpret the patient’s results based on calibrator
and control ranges provided in the test kit. - Should results fall
outside the expected range, notify the supervisor immediately and re-
test before reporting.
5.3. Documentation - Record sample identification, assay values,
controls, and calibration results. - Ensure accurate data entry into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). - Supervisors should review
and verify all reported results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING 6.1. Review
internal control data.
◦ Controls expected to fall within specific ranges.
◦ Investigate deviating results.
6.2. Common Issues and Corrective Actions: - Issue: Poor standard
curve - Recalculate and verify dilutions. - Issue: High background
noise - Improve washing steps, increase wash volume. - Issue: High
false positives/negatives - Check calibration, equipment functionality,
and reagent stability.
1. PRECAUTIONS
◦ Wear personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat,
and eye protection.
◦ Handle all samples as potentially infectious.
◦ Dispose of biohazardous material according to institutional
policies.
