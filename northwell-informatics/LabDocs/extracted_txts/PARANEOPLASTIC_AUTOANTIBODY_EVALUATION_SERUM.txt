Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Paraneoplastic, Autoantibody Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Paraneoplastic Autoantibody Evaluation using
serum samples. This procedure ensures the reliability and accuracy
of the results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the proper execution
of this procedure. Supervisors must ensure that all staff adhere to the
protocol and provide the necessary documentation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen type: Serum.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum.
• Specimen stability: Specimen must be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours of collection. For extended storage,
serum should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Laboratory centrifuge.
• Microtiter plates specific for the autoantibody evaluation assay.
• Controls and calibrators provided by the assay manufacturer.
• Automated or manual ELISA reader capable of reading
absorbance values.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Appropriate incubation equipment.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Verify that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within their
expiration dates and have been prepared according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Allow serum samples, controls, and calibrators to reach room
temperature before analysis.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean tube.
C. Assay Setup:
1. Follow the specific microtiter plate layout as determined by the
assay protocol, ensuring appropriate wells for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
2. Add the prescribed volume of each sample, control, and
calibrator to the designated wells of the microtiter plate.
3. Add the specific detection antibody solution to each well
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
D. Incubation and Washing:
1. Incubate the microtiter plate at the specified temperature
(usually 37°C) and duration per the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Wash the microtiter plate using the recommended washing
solution, following the manufacturer's guidelines for the number
of washes.
E. Substrate Reaction:
1. Add the substrate solution to each well.
2. Allow the reaction to proceed as per the manufacturer's
instructions, typically for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Stop the reaction by adding the appropriate stop solution to
each well.
F. Reading and Analysis:
1. Measure the absorbance of each well using an ELISA reader at
the wavelength specified by the manufacturer (commonly 450
nm with a reference wavelength of 620 nm).
2. Calculate the concentration of autoantibodies in each sample
based on the standard curve generated using the calibrators.
3. Validate the run by ensuring the controls are within the
appropriate ranges. If any controls fall outside the acceptable
limits, the run must be repeated.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls and calibrators with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all control values and verify they are within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Maintain a log of all quality control data, including corrective
actions taken for out-of-range controls.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify calculated patient results based on assay-
specific reference ranges.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all abnormal or critical results are flagged as per the
laboratory’s policy and notify the appropriate medical personnel.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for each specific autoantibody will be determined
based on the kit insert and validated in-house according to the
laboratory’s methodology.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND REFERENCES
• All procedural steps, results, and quality control data must be
documented accurately.
• Refer to the manufacturer's product insert for detailed assay
performance characteristics and limitations.

Autoantibody Evaluation Assay.

analytical phase of generating results for Paraneoplastic
Autoantibody Evaluations using serum samples, ensuring high-
quality laboratory results.
