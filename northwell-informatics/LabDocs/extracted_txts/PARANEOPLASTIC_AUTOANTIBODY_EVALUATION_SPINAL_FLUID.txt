STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP): Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Paraneoplastic Autoantibody
Evaluation in Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for the analysis of spinal
fluid (CSF) for paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. This
procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results
for clinical assessment.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The execution and documentation of this procedure are the
responsibilities of designated laboratory technologists trained in
paraneoplastic autoantibody testing.
3. DEFINITIONS
Paraneoplastic autoantibodies: Autoantibodies associated with
paraneoplastic syndromes, which can indicate the presence of
an underlying neoplasm.
CSF: Cerebrospinal fluid collected by lumbar puncture for
diagnostic purposes.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Fresh spinal fluid (ideally 2-5 mL) collected in a sterile
container.
◦ Transport specimen at 2-8°C and process immediately upon
receipt. If processing is delayed, store at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with improper labeling.
◦ Hemolyzed, clotted, or contaminated samples.
◦ Specimens not meeting the transport and storage
requirements.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kit specific
for paraneoplastic autoantibodies.
◦ Incubator.
◦ Micropipettes and tips.
◦ Plate washer.
◦ Plate reader (spectrophotometer).
◦ Calibrators and controls included in the ELISA Kit.
◦ Sterile multi-well plates.
◦ Filter paper/absorbent pads.
◦ 1X PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).
6. PROCEDURE
A) PRE-ANALYSIS
1. Upon receipt, confirm the integrity and labeling of the CSF specimens.
2. If immediate analysis is not possible, store the specimens at -20°C.
B) ANALYSIS
1. Prepare all necessary reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the ELISA kit insert.
2. Thaw and mix the CSF specimen thoroughly before analysis.
3. Set up the multi-well plate for samples, calibrators, and controls in duplicate.
4. Add 100 μL of calibrators, controls, and CSF specimens into designated wells.
5. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration according to the kit protocol.
6. Wash the plate using the plate washer with 1X PBS to remove unbound substances.
7. Add the detection antibody/conjugate as instructed by the kit, incubate and wash as specified.
8. Add substrate solution and incubate for the reaction time specified.
9. Add stop solution to halt the reaction at the precise time.
C) POST-ANALYSIS
1. Read the plate on the plate reader at the recommended wavelength.
2. Record the absorbance values for each well.
3. Calculate the concentration of paraneoplastic autoantibodies in each sample using the provided calibration curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include negative and positive controls in each assay.
2. Verify that controls fall within acceptable limits.
3. Investigate and document any out-of-range control
results, and repeat the assay if necessary.
4. Follow corrective action procedures if control results are
not within specified limits.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document test results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Verify and review results for accuracy before releasing
them to the requesting clinician.
3. Report results which should include the concentration
levels of paraneoplastic autoantibodies detected in the
CSF.
Normal Reference Range: - Each type of paraneoplastic
autoantibody will have specific reference intervals as per the
ELISA kit documentation.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Results may be confounded by hemolyzed or
contaminated samples.
2. Ensure adherence to the assay protocol as variations can
affect results. Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific
limitations.
