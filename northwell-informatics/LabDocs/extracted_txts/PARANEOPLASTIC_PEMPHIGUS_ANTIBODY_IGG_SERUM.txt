Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Paraneoplastic Pemphigus Antibody, IgG, Serum
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Paraneoplastic Pemphigus Antibody, IgG,
Serum. It ensures accuracy, reliability, and timely reporting of
results.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all personnel involved in the testing and
reporting of Paraneoplastic Pemphigus Antibody, IgG, Serum
within the laboratory.
3. Responsibility
◦ Designated personnel are responsible for performing the
assay according to this SOP.
◦ Supervisors ensure proper adherence to the protocol and
address any issues that arise.
4. Specimen Requirements
◦ Preferred: Serum collected from a venipuncture using a red-
top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum.
◦ Stability: Specimen is stable for up to 72 hours at 2–8°C.
For longer storage, freeze at ≤ -20°C.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ ELISA Kit for Paraneoplastic Pemphigus Antibody, IgG
◦ Plate reader with absorbance capabilities at 450 nm
◦ Micro-pipettes and tips
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Distilled water and wash buffer
◦ Tube rack and test tubes for sample preparation
◦ Plate shaker
6. Procedure
A. Preparation
◦ Ensure all reagents from the ELISA kit are at room
temperature before use.
◦ Prepare the wash buffer according to the kit instructions.
B. Sample Preparation
◦ Label the test tubes appropriately for each specimen and
control.
◦ Dilute serum samples as specified by the kit instructions.
◦ Prepare positive and negative controls as indicated in the
kit.
C. Plate Preparation
◦ Add the specified volume of diluted samples, controls, and
standards to the wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended time
period.
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly with wash buffer to remove
unbound substances.
D. Detection & Measurement
◦ Add the detection antibody and substrate solution to the
wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for the
specified time.
◦ Measure absorbance at 450 nm using the plate reader.
E. Data Analysis
◦ Record the absorbance values.
◦ Create a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Paraneoplastic Pemphigus
Antibody, IgG in the serum samples using the standard
curve.
7. Quality Control
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Verify that the controls fall within the expected ranges.
◦ Re-run the assay if the controls are out of range.
8. Reporting Results
◦ Review the computed concentration values for accuracy.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify and review results before final reporting.
◦ Results outside reference intervals should be flagged and
reviewed by a supervisor.
9. Reference Intervals
◦ Provided by the ELISA kit insert.
◦ For IgG antibody presence, interpret against a healthy
control range and flag any abnormal findings.
10. Method Limitations
◦ Any interference noted in the ELISA kit insert should be
taken into account.
◦ Ensure all reagents and equipment are functional to avoid
erroneous results.
11. Troubleshooting
◦ If assay fails due to technical errors or control failures, re-
evaluate preparation procedures, reagent integrity, and
equipment functionality.
◦ Notify supervisor and document corrective actions taken.
