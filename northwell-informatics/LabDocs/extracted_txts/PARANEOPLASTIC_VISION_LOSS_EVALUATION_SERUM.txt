Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for Paraneoplastic Vision
Loss Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Paraneoplastic Vision Loss Evaluation, Serum.
It includes guidelines for sample preparation, equipment, quality
control, assay procedures, and data reporting to ensure accuracy
and reliability.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel trained in handling and processing clinical
specimens are responsible for performing the assay according to this
protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
compliance with these procedures and address any issues that arise.
2. DEFINITIONS
Paraneoplastic Vision Loss Evaluation, Serum: A test performed to
detect autoantibodies associated with paraneoplastic neurological
syndromes that may affect vision.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge: Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL of separated serum.
• Storage: Store serum at 2-8°C if not processed immediately. For
long-term storage, keep frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Note: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set to required assay temperature
• ELISA plates or equivalent assay platform
• Plate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
• Paraneoplastic Vision Loss Evaluation Kit (commercially
available, e.g., ELISA-based)
• Quality control materials (high, normal, and low controls)
• Calibration standards and control sera
• Reagent reservoirs
• Single-use gloves and lab coat
5. ASSAY PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before starting the assay.
2. Prepare standards and controls as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Label test tubes or wells accordingly to avoid any mix-up.
Sample and Reagent Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature and mix well by
gentle inversion.
2. Add appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and samples
into the respective wells of the ELISA plate.
Assay Execution:
1. Follow the assay protocol provided with the Paraneoplastic
Vision Loss Evaluation Kit. This typically includes:
◦ Addition of sample diluent: Pipette the required amount into
each well.
◦ Addition of standards, controls, and samples: Pipette into
designated wells.
◦ Incubation: Allow to react as per manufacturer's specified
time and temperature (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour at 37°C).
◦ Washing: Wash the plate as per instructions to remove
unbound substances.
◦ Addition of detection antibody/secondary reagent: Incubate
as specified.
◦ Addition of substrate solution: Allow color development for
the specified time.
◦ Stopping the reaction: Add stop solution as instructed.
Data Collection:
1. Measure absorbance at the designated wavelength (450 nm)
using the plate reader.
2. Record the optical density (OD) readings for all wells.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (high, normal, and low) with each
batch of patient samples to ensure assay performance.
• Validate results only if control results are within the pre-defined
acceptable ranges.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken in the
quality control logbook.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Calculate the concentration of autoantibodies in patient
samples using the standard curve generated from the
standards.
2. Review the data for consistency and validity.
3. Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
Ensure to include any relevant comments or flags.
4. Report critical values immediately to the medical staff following
standard operating procedures for critical results.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific Paraneoplastic Vision Loss Evaluation Kit insert
for any limitations regarding reagent stability, potential interferences,
and assay-specific constraints.
9. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of all assay runs, including the lot
numbers of reagents, calibrations, control results, and any issues
encountered.
• Store completed assay plates and records as per regulatory
requirements.
