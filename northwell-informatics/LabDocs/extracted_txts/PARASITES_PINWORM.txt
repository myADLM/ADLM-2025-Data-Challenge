Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Detection of Parasites and Pinworm
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidelines for
the detection and analysis of parasites and pinworms in clinical
specimens. This includes the examination techniques and the
reporting of results to ensure accuracy and reliability of laboratory
findings.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist
to follow the instructions outlined in this SOP, and to ensure the
proper documentation and accuracy of results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all clinical specimens received
for parasite and pinworm analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: Preferred Specimens:
• Stool samples
• Cellophane tape or pinworm paddle specimens for pinworm
detection
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not properly labeled with patient identification
• Specimens that are leaking or have been improperly collected
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Light microscope with appropriate magnification (10x, 40x, 100x
objectives)
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Cellophane tape (for pinworm detection)
• Saline solution
• Lugol's iodine stain (optional)
• Applicator sticks
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Stool Examination for Parasite Detection:
1. Direct Wet Mount Preparation: i. Mix a small amount of stool
sample with a drop of saline on a glass slide. ii. Place a
coverslip over the sample without creating bubbles. iii. Examine
under microscope using the 10x and 40x objectives for the
presence of parasites such as protozoa, cysts, ova, or larvae.
2. Concentration Technique (if indicated): i. Use a
concentration method such as Formalin-Ethyl Acetate
Sedimentation or Zinc-sulfate flotation to enhance the recovery
of parasites. ii. Follow the respective method's procedure for
concentrating the stool sample before examining under
microscope.
3. Staining (as needed): i. Apply a drop of Lugol's iodine solution
to the prepared wet mount. ii. Place a coverslip over the sample
and examine under the microscope using the same objectives.
B. Pinworm Detection:
1. Collection Using Cellophane Tape or Pinworm Paddle: i.
Apply the sticky side of the tape/paddle to the perianal region
first thing in the morning before bathing or using the toilet. ii.
Label the tape/paddle with the patient’s information and
transport it promptly to the laboratory.
2. Microscopic Examination: i. Place the sticky side of the tape/
paddle onto a microscope slide. ii. Examine under the
microscope using the 10x and 40x objectives for the presence
of pinworm eggs (Enterobius vermicularis).
6. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND RECORDING:
• Record the findings on the appropriate laboratory result form,
including the type of parasite or pinworm detected, and the stage
(e.g., ova, cyst, trophozoite, larva).
• Include the date, time, and initials of the laboratory technologist
performing the analysis.
7. REPORTING:
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) or
manual logbook as per site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Communicate results to the requesting healthcare provider
promptly, especially if positive.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Prepare and examine known positive and negative control slides
to ensure the accuracy of detection procedures.
• Perform microscopy calibration and maintenance checks as
scheduled.
• Document quality control activities and any corrective actions
taken.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Presence or absence of parasites/pinworm eggs. A positive result
indicates detection, whereas a negative result indicates no
parasites/pinworms found.
10. LIMITATIONS:
• Sample collection and handling play a significant role in the
accuracy of detection.
• Low parasite load may result in a false-negative result. Repeated
testing or different collection times may be recommended for
suspected cases.
