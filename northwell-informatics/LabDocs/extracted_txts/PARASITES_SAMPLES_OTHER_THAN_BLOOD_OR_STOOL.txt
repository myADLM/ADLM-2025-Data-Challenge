SOP Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Identifying Parasites in
Samples Other Than Blood or Stool
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the identification and
reporting of parasites in non-blood and non-stool samples such as
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, sputum, and tissue biopsies. This
protocol ensures accuracy and reliability in the detection and
identification of parasites for diagnostic purposes.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Urine
• Sputum
• Tissue biopsies
Specimen Collection:
• Specimens should be collected using sterile techniques to avoid
contamination.
• CSF: Collect via lumbar puncture in a sterile tube, deliver
immediately to the laboratory.
• Urine: First morning void or random urine sample collected in a
sterile container.
• Sputum: Collect in a sterile container after deep cough.
• Tissue biopsies: Obtain using aseptic techniques, place in a
sterile container with saline if needed.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile slides and coverslips
• Microscopes with brightfield, darkfield, and phase-contrast
settings
• Staining reagents (e.g., Giemsa stain, Trichrome stain, Lugol’s
iodine)
• Centrifuge capable of handling clinical samples
• Pipettes
• Sterile saline
• Appropriate reagents for concentration techniques (e.g., formalin,
ethyl acetate)
• Forceps and scalpels for tissue processing
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. CSF Examination:
◦ Centrifuge at 1000g for 10 minutes.
◦ Decant supernatant, resuspend pellet in a few drops of
sterile saline.
◦ Prepare slides using a drop of resuspended pellet, cover
with coverslip.
◦ Examine under a microscope using low and high power
settings.
2. Urine Examination:
◦ Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes.
◦ Decant supernatant, resuspend pellet in saline.
◦ Prepare slides by placing a drop of sediment onto the slide
and cover with coverslip.
◦ Examine using brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy.
3. Sputum Examination:
◦ Digest sample with equal volume of 10% KOH if mucous is
dense.
◦ Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes.
◦ Decant supernatant, resuspend pellet with sterile saline.
◦ Prepare slides with resuspended sediment, cover with
coverslip.
◦ Examine using brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy.
4. Tissue Biopsy Examination:
◦ Place a small piece of tissue in a drop of sterile saline on a
slide.
◦ Use scalpel or forceps to gently tease apart tissue, cover
with coverslip.
◦ Alternatively, stain thin sections using Giemsa, Trichrome, or
other stains.
◦ Examine using brightfield microscopy.
B. Staining Techniques
1. Giemsa Staining:
◦ Fix prepared slides with methanol for 30 seconds.
◦ Stain with Giemsa working solution for 30 minutes.
◦ Rinse with buffered water, air dry.
◦ Examine under oil immersion (100x).
2. Trichrome Staining:
◦ Fix slides with alcohol for 30 minutes.
◦ Stain with trichrome stain for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse, dehydrate in alcohol, clear in xylene, mount
coverslip.
◦ Examine under oil immersion (100x).
3. Iodine Staining for Wet Mounts:
◦ Add a drop of Lugol’s iodine to the wet preparation before
examination.
◦ Examine using brightfield microscopy.
C. Microscopy
• Begin examination with low power (10x) to locate organisms.
• Switch to high power (40x, 100x) to identify species based on
morphology.
• Use phase-contrast for better visualization of transparent
organisms.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Calibrate microscopes monthly.
• Verify stain performance with control slides.
• Document all observations and findings accurately in laboratory
records.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Include species identification and quantity estimated based on
field counts.
• Note if results are definitive or suggestive, and recommend follow-
up testing if required.
• Contact the physician directly for any critical findings or novel
parasite identification.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Results are compared to standard morphological references.
• Irregularities, such as cryptic organisms, should be addressed
with molecular diagnostics if necessary.

9. RESPONSIBILITIES
• All personnel involved in specimen processing and analysis must
follow SOP guidelines.
• Laboratory supervisors ensure proper adherence to protocols and
documentation.
• Technologists must verify and authorize all findings before
reporting to clinicians.
