Protocol Title: Analytical Phase for Parasite Identification
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures involved in
the analytical phase of generating results for parasite identification.
This ensures precise identification and documentation of parasitic
organisms found in the specimens received in the lab, maintaining
quality control measures, and facilitating appropriate clinical
management of the patient.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this document. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring protocols are adhered to, providing oversight in cases of
abnormal findings, and validating results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen Types:
• Stools
• Blood
• Tissues (biopsy-specific)
• Urine
• Sputum
Acceptable Criteria:
• Specimens must be appropriately labelled with patient
information, collection date, and time.
• Specimens must arrive in the laboratory within specified stability
time based on the collected specimen type.
• Specimens must be stored and transported under appropriate
conditions, preserving the integrity of the sample.
Unacceptable Criteria:
• Mislabelled or unlabeled specimens.
• Specimens not adhering to stability criteria.
• Specimens showing signs of deterioration (e.g., excessive
hemolysis, clotting, contamination).
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Microscopy:
• Microscope (Bright-field, Phase-contrast, or Fluorescence as
required)
• Slides and cover slips
Stains and Reagents:
• Saline
• Iodine
• Methylene Blue
• Giemsa’s stain
• Trichrome stain
• Acid-fast stain
Molecular Tools:
• PCR Equipment (as needed for specific parasite identification)
• DNA/RNA extraction kits
4. PROCEDURE
Microscopic Identification:
A) Stool Specimens:
1. Prepare wet mount slide using saline: Apply a small portion of
the stool specimen to a drop of saline on a slide. Cover with a
cover slip.
2. Examine under a microscope at 10x and 40x magnification.
Look for trophozoites, cysts, eggs, and larvae.
3. Apply iodine if needed to enhance visibility of some structures.
4. Prepare stained slides (e.g., Trichrome or Acid-fast) for specific
identification of protozoans and helminths.
5. Record findings, including the quantity and type of parasites
observed.
B) Blood Specimens:
1. Prepare thin and thick blood smears.
2. Stain smears with Giemsa.
3. Examine under oil immersion on the microscope (100x) for
identification of blood-borne parasites such as Plasmodium
spp. and Trypanosoma spp.
4. Record findings with details of parasitic forms and quantity
observed.
C) Tissue Specimens:
1. Prepare tissue sections using appropriate staining techniques
(e.g., Hematoxylin and Eosin, Silver stain).
2. Examine sections under relevant magnification for identification
of tissue parasites including cysts and larval forms.
3. Include findings in the laboratory records.
D) Urine and Sputum Specimens:
1. Centrifuge specimens to concentrate elements.
2. Prepare wet mount slides and add relevant stains.
3. Examine under appropriate magnification for identification of
parasitic forms.
4. Document any parasites observed.
Molecular Identification:
PCR:
1. Extract DNA/RNA from specimen.
2. Set up PCR reaction using parasite-specific primers.
3. Run PCR and identify amplicons using gel electrophoresis.
4. Compare findings against controls and document.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Regular calibration and maintenance of microscopes.
• Use positive and negative control slides/stains.
• Periodic proficiency testing for laboratory personnel.
• Proper documentation of all identified parasitic forms with cross-
checking.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Use established laboratory information system (LIS) to record
results.
2. Include identification details, quantity, and any pertinent notes
such as abnormal findings or potential interferences.
3. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
and supervisor.
7. REFERENCES
Refer to current clinical parasitology manuals available in the
laboratory and relevant scientific literature for detailed parasite
morphology, identification techniques, and supportive guidelines.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND STORAGE
• Ensure all documentation is accurate and retained for reference.
• Store results as per laboratory archival policy and inform
appropriate clinical personnel of significant findings requiring
urgent attention.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to individual reagent and stain manufacturers' inserts for
specific limitations related to sensitivity and specificity, and molecular
diagnostic kit literature for amplification inhibitors and optimal
conditions.
This protocol aims to provide a structured, consistent approach to the
analytical phase of parasite identification, facilitating high-quality
patient care through accurate laboratory diagnostics.
