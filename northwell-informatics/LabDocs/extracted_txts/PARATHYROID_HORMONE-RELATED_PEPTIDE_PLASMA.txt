Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Parathyroid Hormone-Related Peptide
(PTHrP), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis, quality control, and
reporting of Parathyroid Hormone-Related Peptide (PTHrP) levels in
plasma to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of PTHrP in plasma samples within
a CLIA-certified laboratory setting. It covers all steps from sample
preparation to result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting procedures, and reporting results. Supervisors
must ensure that all procedures are followed and that any deviations
are documented and acted upon promptly.
4. DEFINITIONS
Parathyroid Hormone-Related Peptide (PTHrP): A protein involved in
calcium regulation and produced in various tissues in the body.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Tubes: EDTA (lavender top) tubes
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL
• Stability: Plasma samples are stable when frozen at -20°C or
lower for up to 6 months. Samples should be kept on ice and
processed within 2 hours of collection or frozen immediately for
longer storage.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PTHrP assay kit (e.g., ELISA or immunoassay specific for PTHrP)
• Microplate reader or equivalent detection system
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• EDTA tubes
• Freezer (-20°C or -80°C)
• Ice or cold packs
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, record the sample information in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Centrifuge the EDTA tube at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate the plasma.
3. Aliquot the plasma into appropriately labeled tubes.
4. Freeze aliquots at -20°C or lower if not processing immediately.
B) PTHrP Assay:
1. Bring all reagents, controls, and samples to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare standards and controls as outlined in the assay kit
insert.
3. Add the required volume of standards, controls, and samples to
the microplate wells.
4. Follow the specific assay protocol, including any incubation
steps and washing procedures.
5. Complete the detection step as per kit instructions, ensuring
appropriate incubation times.
6. Read the optical density of each well using a microplate reader
at the wavelength specified in the kit instructions.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with each
batch of patient samples to ensure assay reliability and
accuracy.
2. Reference values for QC should be within the established
acceptable range. If QC results fall outside these ranges,
troubleshoot according to the assay kit instructions and
document all actions taken.
3. Append a note in the LIS regarding any corrective actions
taken.
D) Results Calculation and Reporting:
1. Generate a standard curve using the optical density readings of
the standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of PTHrP in patient samples by
comparing their optical density readings against the standard
curve.
3. Verify result accuracy by comparing control sample results to
their known values.
4. Enter results into the LIS and review for any obvious errors or
discrepancies.
5. Flag and notify the physician or responsible party of any critical
or abnormal results, as required by laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal reference intervals for PTHrP should be established for the
specific population the laboratory serves. Consult the assay kit insert
and relevant clinical guidelines for reference values.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations of the assay,
including potential interferences from other substances, and
document any observed anomalies during analysis.
10. REFERENCES

11. DOCUMENTATION
All records of reagent lot numbers, controls, standards, patient
results, and any deviations from the SOP should be documented in
the LIS or appropriate laboratory logbooks.
12. REVIEW
This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever significant
changes are made to the protocol or equipment used in the analysis
of PTHrP, to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability of test results.
