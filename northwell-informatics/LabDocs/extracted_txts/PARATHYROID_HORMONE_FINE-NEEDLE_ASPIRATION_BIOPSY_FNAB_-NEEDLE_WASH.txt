Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Procedure Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
PARATHYROID HORMONE from FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION
BIOPSY (FNAB) - NEEDLE WASH
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable measurement of Parathyroid
Hormone (PTH) levels from samples obtained through Fine-Needle
Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) and processed as needle wash.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• All designated laboratory personnel trained in the handling and
processing of FNAB samples.
• Laboratory Supervisors and Quality Control Officers are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
STABILITY
Acceptable Specimen:
• Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy needle wash.
• Specimen to be collected in a vial containing sterile saline (0.9%).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not correctly labeled with patient details or date/time
of collection.
• Specimens with visible contamination or hemolysis.
• Samples not transported immediately to the laboratory or delayed
beyond processing stability.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Parathyroid Hormone Assay kit (refer to manufacturer’s
instructions)
• Pipettes and tips
• Micropipettes
• Test tubes
• Sterile saline solution (0.9%)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. PROCEDURE
STEP 1: Specimen Handling
1. Verify specimen labeling (patient identification, date, time of
collection).
2. Document specimen receipt in LIS.
3. Ensure specimens are transported immediately to the
laboratory under controlled temperature conditions (2-8°C) and
processed within 4 hours of collection.
STEP 2: Specimen Preparation
1. Centrifuge the needle wash sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
at 4°C.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube without
disturbing the pellet.
3. Label the test tube with patient ID and unique specimen
number.
STEP 3: PTH Assay Preparation
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the PTH assay kit.
2. Prepare all reagents, calibration standards, and quality control
(QC) materials as instructed.
3. Verify that all reagents and QC materials are within their
expiration dates and stored under recommended conditions.
STEP 4: Assay Execution
1. Pipette appropriate volumes of calibration standards, QC
materials, and patient samples into designated wells of the
assay plate or vials.
2. Incubate the assay plate or vials as per the manufacturer's
protocol.
3. Measure the PTH concentrations using the specified analytical
instrument.
STEP 5: Data Recording and Analysis
1. Document the raw data in the laboratory’s data management
system.
2. Use the calibration curve to convert raw data into PTH
concentration values.
3. Include both the raw data and final concentrations in the
patient’s LIS record.
STEP 6: Quality Control
1. Analyze QC materials with known PTH concentrations
alongside patient samples.
2. Compare QC results against established acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, re-run the assay or
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Document all actions taken and any deviations or corrective
measures applied.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the results for accuracy and consistency with QC
findings.
2. Verify the final PTH results through the LIS.
3. Report the validated results to the requesting healthcare
provider securely and according to laboratory protocols.
7. CRITICAL RESULTS
1. Any results indicating critical PTH values must be immediately
reported to the responsible healthcare provider.
2. Document the communication of critical results in the patient’s
LIS record.
8. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
1. Retain all documentation related to the assay, including raw
data, QC results, and maintenance logs, according to the
laboratory’s record retention policy.
2. Ensure all documentation is easily accessible for future
reference or audits.
