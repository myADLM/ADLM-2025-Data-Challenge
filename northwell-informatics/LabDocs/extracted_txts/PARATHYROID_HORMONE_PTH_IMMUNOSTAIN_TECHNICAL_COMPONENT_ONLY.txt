1. PURPOSE
To outline a detailed, standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) immunostain,
focusing solely on the technical component.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory personnel, including medical laboratory
technologists, are responsible for performing the immunostaining
procedure as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of the lead
technologist or supervisor to ensure compliance with the procedure
and resolve any issues that arise during the process.
3. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the technical component of performing and
documenting the PTH immunostain process in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunostainer or Manual Staining Setup
• PTH Primary Antibody
• Secondary Antibodies (HRP-conjugated)
• Chromogen Substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (Hematoxylin)
• Positive and Negative Control Tissue Slides
• Xylene and Alcohol Grades (70%, 90%, 100%)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Mounting Medium and Coverslips
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Microscope
• Specimen tracking and documentation forms
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment
1. Verify the shelf-life and preparation of all reagents. Ensure that
the PTH primary antibody, secondary antibodies, and
chromogen substrate are prepared as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Pre-warm the automated immunostainer if applicable, or
prepare the manual staining setup area.
5.2. Slide Preparation
1. Retrieve the slides with paraffin-embedded tissue sections from
storage. Ensure that the slides are clearly labelled with patient
identifiers.
2. Deparaffinize the slides by placing them in three changes of
xylene, each for 5 minutes.
3. Rehydrate the tissue by sequentially immersing the slides in
graded alcohol solutions (100%, 90%, and 70%) for 3 minutes
each, followed by a rinse in distilled water.
5.3. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a
commercially available antigen retrieval solution as per the
manufacturer’s instructions and laboratory protocol.
2. Allow the slides to cool down to room temperature and wash
them with PBS for 5 minutes.
5.4. Blocking Non-Specific Binding
1. Incubate the slides in blocking solution to prevent non-specific
binding. Use a protein block as specified by the primary
antibody manufacturer for 10 minutes at room temperature.
2. Blot off excess blocking solution without rinsing.
5.5. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the prepared PTH primary antibody to the tissue
sections. Ensure even coverage.
2. Incubate the slides in a humidified chamber for the time
specified by the antibody manufacturer, typically ranging from
30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature.
5.6. Washing
1. Wash the slides in PBS for 5 minutes to remove any unbound
primary antibody.
5.7. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the secondary antibody conjugated to HRP to the slides
ensuring even coverage.
2. Incubate the slides in a humidified chamber for the time
specified by the antibody manufacturer, typically 30 minutes.
5.8. Washing
1. Wash the slides again in PBS for 5 minutes.
5.9. Chromogen Development
1. Apply the chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) to the slides and
incubate until the desired color intensity develops, typically for
5-10 minutes.
2. Rinse the slides under running tap water to stop the reaction.
5.10. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain the slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to
provide contrast.
2. Rinse the slides in running tap water and dip briefly in a weak
ammonia solution to blue the hematoxylin.
3. Dehydrate the slides by sequentially passing them through
graded alcohol solutions (70%, 90%, 100%) and xylene.
5.11. Mounting
1. Apply mounting medium to the slides and place coverslips to
preserve the stained tissue.
2. Allow the slides to dry and cure.
5.12. Quality Control and Documentation
1. Examine the stained slides under a microscope. Verify the
quality of the staining in both positive and negative control
tissues.
2. Document the staining procedure, including any issues
encountered and corrective actions taken, in the specimen
tracking form.
3. Ensure that the slides are labelled correctly and sent to the
pathologist or appropriate personnel for interpretation.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Weak Staining:
◦ Verify antibody concentration and incubation time.
◦ Check antigen retrieval procedure.
2. Non-Specific Staining:
◦ Ensure proper blocking steps are taken.
◦ Verify wash steps are thoroughly performed.
3. Absence of Staining:
◦ Confirm that primary and secondary antibodies are viable
and functional.
◦ Ensure tissue sections are properly fixed and processed.
