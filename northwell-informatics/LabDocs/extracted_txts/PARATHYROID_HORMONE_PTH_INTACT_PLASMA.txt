Standard Operating Procedure: Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
Intact, Plasma Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of intact Parathyroid
Hormone (PTH) in plasma. It includes proper handling of the
specimen, use of equipment, and documentation to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel conducting PTH
testing in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately to ensure the integrity of the test results. The
Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP and addressing any issues that arise during testing.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• EDTA plasma.
• Collect the blood specimen and immediately mix by gentle
inversion to prevent clotting.
• Centrifuge and separate the plasma within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Clotted samples.
• Specimens not separated from cells within 2 hours.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 24 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411).
• PTH Assay kit with calibrators and controls (e.g., Roche Elecsys
PTH assay).
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Sample racks.
Storage and Stability:
• Reagents and controls: Store at 2-8°C.
• Calibrators: Store as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Specimens: Plasma specimens stored at 2-8°C are stable for up
to 24 hours, and up to 6 months frozen at -20°C.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation and Calibration:
1. Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Ensure the instrument is calibrated using the PTH calibrators
provided in the assay kit.
3. Run calibration verification at the beginning of each batch and
post-maintenance or significant troubleshooting.
6.2 Quality Control:
1. Analyze two levels of quality control material (low and high) at
the beginning of each batch, after every 20 patient samples,
and at the end of each batch.
2. Document QC results. If QC results fall outside the acceptable
range, troubleshoot, and rectify the issue before proceeding
with patient samples.
6.3 Sample Analysis:
1. Label the sample racks and ensure the patient identifiers on the
specimens match the labels on the request forms.
2. Load specimens into the analyzer.
3. Input patient data and test requests into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4. Analyze the samples following the instructions for use provided
in the PTH assay kit insert.
5. Upon completion of the analysis, review the raw data generated
by the analyzer.
6.4 Verification and Validation:
1. Compare the obtained results to previous patient results for
consistency (if applicable).
2. Validate the results after passing quality control checks.
3. Transfer validated results to the LIS for final reporting.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the designated
technologist.
• Critical values should be reported immediately to the ordering
physician as per laboratory policy.
Reference Range:
• The expected reference interval for PTH Intact should be
documented and periodically reviewed against updated clinical
guidelines.
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
Handling Compromised Samples:
• If sample integrity is compromised (e.g., hemolysis), do not
proceed with analysis. Document the issue and request a
recollection of the sample.
• If the results appear inconsistent with clinical presentation,
consider sample re-analysis or discuss with the medical team.
9. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Perform regular maintenance as outlined in the analyzer’s user
manual.
2. Document all maintenance activities, calibrations, and
troubleshooting actions.
3. Follow manufacturer's guidelines for troubleshooting any errors
or issues that arise during the analytical process.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s assay kit instructions.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
method validation.
• Laboratory Quality Manual.
11. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough records of all samples tested, QC results,
calibration data, maintenance logs, and any deviations from the
standard procedure.
