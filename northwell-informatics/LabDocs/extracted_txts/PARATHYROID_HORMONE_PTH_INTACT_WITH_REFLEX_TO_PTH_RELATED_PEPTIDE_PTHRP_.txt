Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Results for Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Intact with
Reflex to PTH Related Peptide (PTHrP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures and
responsibilities for the analysis of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Intact
with reflex to PTH Related Peptide (PTHrP) to ensure consistency,
reliability, and accuracy of test results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing, monitoring, and documenting the analysis of PTH Intact
and PTHrP within the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory technologists and technicians performing the
analysis of PTH Intact and PTHrP.
• Supervisors and Quality Control personnel overseeing the testing
process.
• Designated personnel responsible for maintenance and
calibration of the analytical instruments.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Handling: Specimens must be separated and processed within 2
hours of collection. Store specimens at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately. Frozen specimens are acceptable and should be
stored at -20°C or colder.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Icteric or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens not labeled properly or without date/time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche cobas e411,
Abbott Architect i2000, etc.)
• Refrigerators and freezers for storage
• Centrifuge
5.2 Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific for PTH Intact and PTHrP
• Manufacturer-specific reagent kits for PTH Intact and PTHrP
5.3 Supplies:
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sample cups
• Labels and barcode printer
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Verify and accession the received specimens.
2. Centrifuge the serum specimen at 1000-1500 g for 15 minutes
at room temperature to ensure proper separation.
3. Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled sample cups if
necessary.
6.2 Analytical Steps for PTH Intact:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using the provided calibration
materials.
2. Load the samples, calibrators, and controls into the analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer using the PTH Intact assay protocol.
4. Start the analysis.
5. Review the analyzer-generated results and ensure QC and
calibration within acceptable limits.
6.3 Reflex Testing for PTHrP:
1. If the PTH Intact result is above the predetermined threshold (>
40 pg/mL), the reflex test for PTHrP must be initiated.
2. Calibrate the analyzer for PTHrP if not already set.
3. Prepare a new aliquot of the initial specimen if additional testing
is required.
4. Load the samples, calibrators, and controls for PTHrP.
5. Program the analyzer for the PTHrP assay and initiate the test.
6. Review the results from the analyzer for accuracy and QC
compliance.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run two levels of control materials (low and high) at the beginning
of each shift and with each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure all controls are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
• Document all QC results in the appropriate log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verifiable PTH results should be electronically transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results exceeding critical values should be reviewed manually
and critical values reported immediately to the ordering physician
as per laboratory policy.
• Ensure PTHrP results are reflex tested only when criteria are met,
and results are accurately documented and communicated.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• PTH Intact: 15-65 pg/mL
• PTHrP: < 2 pmol/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, icteric, or lipemic samples may interfere with assay
results.
• Ambient temperature, storage conditions, and sample handling
can impact integrity and accuracy.

to October 2023.

Laboratory Scientist.
NOTE: This SOP must be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure
compliance with current best practices and regulatory requirements.
