Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Parathyroid
Hormone (PTH), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish consistent and accurate procedures for the analysis of
Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) in serum specimens using an automated
immunoassay analyzer. This protocol ensures the quality and
integrity of the results provided to healthcare providers for diagnosing
and managing parathyroid-related disorders.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis of PTH in serum specimens according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained
in and follow this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Specimen Stability: Serum specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up
to 48 hours. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or below. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or delayed in
transport beyond stability limits.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer compatible with PTH assays
(e.g., Roche cobas, Abbott Architect, Siemens Centaur).
• Calibrators and controls specific to the PTH assay.
• Pipettes and tips as required by the analyzer's manufacturer.
• Quality control (QC) materials.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Pre-Analysis
1. Verify that the serum specimens are labeled correctly and meet
the acceptance criteria.
2. Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature before
analysis.
3. Prepare the automated immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions, including loading reagents,
calibrators, and QC materials.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform a calibration of the analyzer with PTH calibrators as
required by the manufacturer.
2. Run multi-level QC materials, typically including low, medium,
and high levels, at the beginning of each shift, after any
maintenance, and whenever troubleshooting analyzer
performance.
3. Document QC results, ensuring they fall within the established
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
C) Analysis of Patient Specimens
1. Load the serum specimens onto the analyzer in the designated
sample racks or holders.
2. Enter the patient information and sample IDs into the analyzer's
software.
3. Initiate the PTH assay run according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
4. Review the generated results for any flags or error codes that
indicate issues with the assay or specimen integrity.
5. In case of flagged results or out-of-range controls, troubleshoot
according to standard procedures and repeat the analysis if
necessary.
D) Post-Analysis
1. Document and review all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Verify results according to laboratory protocols, ensuring all QC
and calibrator checks are within acceptable limits.
3. Release validated results for reporting to healthcare providers.
4. Store specimens at 2-8°C for potential retesting. If further
testing is anticipated beyond 48 hours, freeze specimens at
-20°C or below.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
• Enter the validated results into the LIS for automatic transmission
to the electronic medical record.
• In case of critical or significantly abnormal results, follow the
laboratory's protocol for notifying the healthcare provider
immediately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks with each new lot of reagents, after any
maintenance on the analyzer, and as specified by the analyzer's
operational guidelines.
• Document all QC results and maintain records for monitoring and
auditing purposes.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures promptly to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of patient results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay manufacturer's insert for specific limitations,
interferences, and cross-reactivity information.
• Avoid analysis of specimens from patients undergoing PTH
therapy without proper consideration of potential interferences.
