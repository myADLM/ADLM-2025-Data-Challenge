Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Parechovirus Detection by PCR
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a standardized procedure for the detection of
parechovirus in clinical specimens using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) technology. This method is used for the qualitative detection of
parechovirus RNA to aid in the diagnosis of parechovirus infection.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the procedure as described, documenting results, and maintaining
quality control.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP
and addressing any issues that arise during the process.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical specimens submitted for
parechovirus detection by PCR in the molecular diagnostics
laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIRMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Throat swab
• Nasopharyngeal swab
• Stool
• Other relevant clinical specimens as indicated Specimen
Collection:
• Specimens must be collected using aseptic techniques and
placed in viral transport media if applicable.
Specimen Storage and Transport:
• Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and transported to the
laboratory as soon as possible.
• If there is a delay exceeding 24 hours in transport, the specimens
should be frozen at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Biosafety Cabinet
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and sterile aerosol barrier tips
Reagents:
• Viral RNA extraction kit
• Parechovirus-specific PCR primers and probes
• PCR Master Mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control (parechovirus RNA)
• Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
Supplies:
• PCR tubes or plates
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coats
• RNAse-free tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction
1. Process specimens using a viral RNA extraction kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Elute RNA in the specified volume of elution buffer.
3. Store RNA at -70°C until used, if not proceeding directly to
PCR.
B. Preparation of PCR Reaction Mix
1. Thaw all reagents on ice and mix gently by vortexing; then
briefly centrifuge to collect contents at the bottom of the tubes.
2. Prepare the PCR reaction mix on ice, according to the following
example:
◦ X µL of PCR Master Mix
◦ Y µL of forward primer
◦ Y µL of reverse primer
◦ Y µL of probe
◦ Z µL of nuclease-free water
◦ M µL of extracted RNA (added last)
3. Mix the PCR reaction mix gently and distribute into PCR tubes
or plate wells.
4. Include appropriate positive and negative controls.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Place the tubes or plate in the thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial activation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Cycling (40 cycles): • Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds •
Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
D. Detection and Interpretation of Results
1. Following completion of the PCR run, analyze the amplification
plot and determine the cycle threshold (Ct) values for each
specimen.
2. Compare the Ct values to the defined threshold to determine
positivity or negativity for parechovirus RNA.
◦ Positive: Specimens with Ct values below the defined
threshold
◦ Negative: Specimens with no detectable Ct value or a Ct
value above the defined threshold
3. Record all results and verify data entry in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to monitor
the test's accuracy.
• If the controls do not yield expected results, the entire batch is
considered invalid, and the specimens must be retested.
Equipment and Reagents Calibration:
• Regular calibration and maintenance of the PCR thermal cycler
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
• Use of reagents within their expiry dates and following proper
storage conditions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Results will be documented and reviewed before entry into the
LIS.
3. Positive and negative results will be communicated according
to the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
4. Clinical significance must be interpreted by a qualified
healthcare professional.
