Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Parental Sample Preparation for Prenatal Microarray Testing
(Blood)
Effective Date: October 2023
Purpose: This document outlines the procedure for preparing
parental blood samples for prenatal microarray testing. Prenatal
microarray testing utilizes comparative genomic hybridization to
detect chromosomal abnormalities using DNA from parental blood
samples.
Scope: This SOP is intended for use by trained laboratory personnel
in the analytical phase of prenatal microarray testing in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
ensuring adherence to this protocol, verifying the accuracy of the
process, and reporting any discrepancies to the supervisor.
Definitions:
• Prenatal Microarray Testing: A method of genomic analysis to
identify copy number variations in DNA derived from parental
blood samples.
• Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH): A molecular
cytogenetic method for analyzing copy number variations (CNVs)
in DNA samples.
Procedure:
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability
1. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Specimen type: Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD
tubes.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 5 mL per parent.
◦ Specimen status: Must be received within 72 hours of
collection.
◦ Specimen handling: Transport at 4-25°C. Ensure blood is
thoroughly mixed with anticoagulant by gentle inversion.
2. Unacceptable Conditions:
◦ Specimen age: Greater than 72 hours post collection.
◦ Specimen collection details: Missing collection date/time or
inadequate volume.
◦ Contaminated or hemolyzed samples.
B. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies
• EDTA or ACD blood collection tubes.
• DNA extraction kits according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Nuclease-free water.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Microcentrifuge tubes.
C. Procedure
1. Sample Receipt and Verification:
◦ Verify specimen with collection details (date, time, parent
identity).
◦ Log sample into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with accession number.
◦ Inspect sample for integrity and volume compliance.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Perform DNA extraction using the designated kit following
the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma and buffy coat.
◦ Transfer buffy coat layer into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Follow DNA extraction steps as detailed by the kit
manufacturer.
◦ Quantify DNA using spectrophotometric analysis to ensure
concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio).
3. Quality Control during DNA Extraction:
◦ Include positive and negative control DNA samples in each
extraction batch.
◦ Ensure no cross-contamination between samples using
control DNA outcomes.
4. Preparation for Microarray Analysis:
◦ Normalization of DNA concentration to specified range for
microarray chip.
◦ Aliquot DNA into appropriate tubes for microarray analysis
ensuring proper labeling.
D. Quality Control
• Perform internal quality checks using known control samples.
• Document all QC steps in the lab's QC logbook and digital
system.
• Validate concentration and purity checks for each DNA sample,
documenting any discrepancies.
E. Reporting Results
• Upload parental DNA concentration and purity data into the LIS.
• Prepare documentation and shipment for microarray analysis as
per laboratory guidelines.
F. References
Utilize appropriate manufacturer’s product insert and laboratory
standards for DNA extraction and microarray testing protocols.
Note: This SOP must be reviewed annually or whenever there are
updates to protocols or instrumentation. Ensure compliance with all
regulatory standards for laboratory testing and reporting.
