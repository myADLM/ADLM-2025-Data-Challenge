Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Results for Parietal
Cell Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and timely results for Parietal Cell Antibodies,
IgG in serum samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this procedure and ensuring the results are
accurately documented and validated.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable:
• 1-2 mL of serum collected in a red or SST tube
• Specimen should be processed and tested within 7 days of
collection if stored at 2-8°C; if stored at -20°C, testing can be
delayed up to 3 months.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric will not be
suitable for analysis.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled will be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA Reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Parietal Cell Antibodies, IgG reagent kit (commercially available,
refer to manufacturer’s instructions)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Supplies:
• ELISA Microplate
• Gloves
• Lab coat
• Timer
• Distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before use.
• Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated.
Testing:
1. Perform initial dilution of the serum samples as indicated in the
reagent kit instructions.
2. Pipette the required amount of diluted serum into the
designated wells of the microplate.
3. Add the specific reagent for Parietal Cell Antibodies, IgG to
each well and incubate the plate for the specified time as per
the reagent kit instructions.
4. Wash the plate using the wash buffer as specified in the kit
instructions.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
6. Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
7. Read the absorbance using an ELISA reader at the appropriate
wavelength as indicated in the kit instructions.
Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls as indicated in the reagent
kit to ensure assay validity.
• Record and validate the control results before proceeding to
evaluate patient samples.
• If controls are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and repeat
the assay.
1. RESULT GENERATION AND VALIDATION
• Calculate the antibody concentration using the calibration curve
provided in the kit.
• Cross-check results with controls and ensure they fall within the
expected range.
• Manually review each result for plausibility and consistency before
entering them into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• If any result is found to be questionable, repeat the assay.
Critical Values:
• No critical values are defined for Parietal Cell Antibodies, IgG.
However, significant deviations from expected ranges should be
flagged and reviewed by a supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the validated results into the LIS.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Any anomalies must be documented and communicated to the
requesting physician.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions included in the Parietal Cell
Antibodies, IgG reagent kit.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines and instrument manuals.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all procedural steps, results, and any corrective actions
taken in the laboratory logbook.
• Maintain records as per laboratory and regulatory requirements.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will generate accurate
and reliable results for Parietal Cell Antibodies, IgG, ensuring high-
quality data for patient care.
