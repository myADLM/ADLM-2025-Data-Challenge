Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
PARIETARIA JUDAICA, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantitative determination of
Parietaria Judaica IgE in human serum using an automated
immunoassay system.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff responsible for performing and reporting
results of Parietaria Judaica IgE testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure proper procedure adherence, including calibration and
maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer, quality control, and
reporting results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube)
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum
• Stability: Unopened serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at
2-8°C or up to 1 month at -20°C. Once thawed, do not refreeze.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens ADVIA Centaur
XP, Roche Cobas e411)
• Parietaria Judaica IgE assay-specific reagents and calibrators
• Quality control materials for IgE
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Centrifuge (for serum separation)
• SST Tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Perform calibration as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Use calibrators specific to Parietaria Judaica IgE.
• Document the calibration results in the Calibration Log.
Quality Control:
• Run high and low IgE quality control materials daily.
• Ensure the quality control results are within the manufacturer’s
specified range.
• Document QC results in the Quality Control Log.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Pre-analytical Preparation:
◦ Verify specimen integrity and labelling.
◦ Centrifuge SST tube at 2,000-3,000 rpm for 15 minutes.
◦ Aliquot serum into a labeled sample tube if necessary.
2. Loading Specimen:
◦ Load the serum sample onto the immunoassay analyzer as
per manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the Parietaria Judaica IgE test on the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Follow the prompts on the analyzer to start the test.
4. Result Verification:
◦ Review the results generated by the analyzer.
◦ If results are within the acceptable range, proceed to
reporting.
◦ If results are flagged by the system for being out of range or
questionable, repeat the test for verification.
5. Troubleshooting:
◦ Refer to the instrument’s error codes and troubleshooting
guide.
◦ Re-run samples if necessary and document any deviations
or interventions.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Confirm results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify result accuracy before reporting.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish reference intervals based on historical data or
manufacturer’s guidelines.
10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times during the analytical phase: lab
coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Handle all biological specimens and reagents as potentially
hazardous.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Record calibration and QC results in their respective logs.
• Document any troubleshooting steps and deviations in the
instrument maintenance records.
• Ensure all records are kept according to CLIA guidelines for
traceability and audits.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for the specific
Parietaria Judaica IgE immunoassay kit.
• Laboratory Safety Guidelines.
• CLIA regulations and standards.
