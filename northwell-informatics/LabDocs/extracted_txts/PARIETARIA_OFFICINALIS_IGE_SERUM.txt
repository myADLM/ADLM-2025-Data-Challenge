Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: PARIETARIA OFFICINALIS, IGE, SERUM Analysis
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: [Date]
Review Date: [Date]
Prepared by: [Name]
Approved by: [Name]
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for the accurate and reliable analysis of IgE
specific to Parietaria Officinalis (IgE), serum using the [Name of the
Analyzer/Instrument]. This SOP ensures that analytical results will be
produced in a consistent manner to maintain laboratory quality and
compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Parietaria Officinalis, IgE, serum analysis within the clinical laboratory
using [Name of the Analyzer/Instrument].
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all qualified and trained laboratory personnel
to perform and document the procedures outlined in this SOP. It is
the responsibility of supervisors to ensure compliance with this SOP
and address any issues arising during the operation.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Red-top or serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL serum
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 48 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): 30 days
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens
◦ Lipemic specimens
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume
◦ Specimens older than stability limits
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• [Name of Analyzer/Instrument]
• Controls and calibrators specific to Parietaria Officinalis, IgE
• Serological pipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• DI water
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, lab bench pads, etc.)
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1 Preparation for Analysis:
1. Ensure that the analyzer has been properly maintained and
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Check expiry dates on reagents, controls, and calibrators.
Do not use expired materials.
3. Ensure that all required quality controls (QCs) are within
acceptable ranges before running patient samples.
6.2 Sample Processing:
1. Allow serum specimen to reach room temperature if stored
refrigerated or frozen.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at [appropriate g-force] for
[duration] to ensure cellular components are separated.
3. Transfer the clear serum to a labeled secondary tube if
necessary.
6.3 Analytical Procedure:
1. Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for instructions
specific to your analyzer.
2. Load the calibrators and controls into the analyzer.
3. Load the patient specimens into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Run the assay as specified by the instrument manual.
Ensure all samples and controls are properly documented.
6.4 Post Analysis:
1. Review and verify the results to ensure validity and
compliance with QC before reporting.
2. If controls are not within acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s troubleshooting
guide, and re-run the assay.
7. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT REPORTING:
• The analyzer will determine the specific IgE concentration
and express it in kU/L (kilo Units per liter).
• Report the final results generated by the analyzer into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review and
verification.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Run at least two levels of controls (low and high) with each
batch of samples or as specified by the manufacturer.
Maintain documentation of acceptable control ranges and
any deviations.
• Monthly calibration checks and preventive maintenance must
be documented and reviewed regularly.
9. LIMITATIONS:
• Calibration and control failure must be resolved before patient
sample analysis proceeds.
• Dilution should be performed if the IgE levels are out of the
reportable range, and result calculations must account for dilution
factors.
• High lipid or hemolyzed samples can interfere with the test
results. Handle with care, avoiding these interferences.
10. RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain logs of equipment calibration, maintenance, and QC
results.
• Ensure all patient result reports are verified and stored in the LIS
according to laboratory policies.
