Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Testing of
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) via PI-Linked
Antigen in Blood Specimens
1. Purpose
To define the protocol for the analysis and detection of Paroxysmal
Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) using Flow Cytometry, specifically
targeting the PI-linked antigens in blood specimens.
Responsibility:
• The Medical Laboratory Technologist (MLT) is responsible for
performing and documenting the testing as per this SOP.
• It is also the responsibility of the technical supervisor to ensure
testing accuracy and validity.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Whole blood
• Volume: 3 to 5 mL
• Anticoagulant: EDTA (Lavender top tube) or Heparin (Green top
tube)
• Stability: Specimens must be processed within 24 hours of
collection to ensure cell viability.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II, Beckman Coulter
Navios)
• 96-well microtiter plates
• PI-Linked Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (e.g., CD55,
CD59)
• Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies
• Red blood cell lysis buffer
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Fixative solution (e.g., 1% paraformaldehyde)
• Quality Control (QC) material specific for PNH testing
1. Procedure
A. Specimen Preparation
• Step 1: Check for specimen integrity and labeling. Reject
unsatisfactorily labeled or damaged specimens.
• Step 2: Mix the whole blood sample well by inverting the tube
gently 8-10 times.
B. Staining Procedure
• Step 3: Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into a well of a 96-well
microtiter plate.
• Step 4: Add 20 µL of the PI-linked antigen-specific monoclonal
antibody to the blood sample. Include an appropriate isotype
control.
• Step 5: Incubate for 15-30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
C. Red Cell Lysis and Washing
• Step 6: Add 2 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer and incubate for 10
minutes at room temperature in the dark.
• Step 7: Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes, discard the
supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of PBS.
• Step 8: Repeat the wash step once more.
D. Fluorochrome Staining (optional)
• Step 9: Add fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody if
required. Incubate for 15-30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
E. Fixation and Analysis
• Step 10: Add fixative solution to the resuspended cells (e.g., 300
µL of 1% paraformaldehyde).
• Step 11: Proceed to flow cytometry analysis.
F. Flow Cytometry Analysis
• Step 12: Set up flow cytometer according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Step 13: Run the QC material to ensure the system is functioning
correctly.
• Step 14: Analyze the prepared samples. Record a minimum of
30,000 events for accurate population gating.
G. Data Interpretation
• Step 15: Analyze the data for the expression of PI-linked antigens
(CD55, CD59) on red blood cells and granulocytes.
• Step 16: Identify the percentage of cells lacking PI-linked
antigens, which are indicative of PNH cells.
1. Quality Control
• Perform the QC check with each batch of samples tested.
• Record and analyze QC data to ensure the testing system is
performing within established parameters.
• Take corrective actions as necessary if QC materials do not meet
the predefined criteria.
1. Reporting Results
• Report all findings as per laboratory policies.
• Include anomalies or unusual findings in the report.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the supervising
technologist.
1. Reference Intervals
• An assumption of less than 1% PNH cells may be considered
within the normal range. Values greater than 1% are indicative of
PNH and should be flagged for further clinical correlation.
1. Method Limitations
• Ensure that proper sample handling and processing are followed
to avoid cell loss and ensure accurate results.
• Cross-reactions and non-specific bindings must be minimized.
• Reference method insert for detailed reagent limitations.

Note: This SOP should be reviewed periodically and revised
appropriately as per advancements in techniques and technologies
and changing regulatory requirements.
