Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Paroxysmal Nocturnal
Hemoglobinuria (PNH) Profile
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Paroxysmal
Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) using flow cytometry to ensure
accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory scientists are responsible for performing the
PNH profile analysis, documenting all processes, and maintaining
quality control throughout the procedure.
2. DEFINITION
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired, life-
threatening disease of the blood characterized by complement-
mediated hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs), leading to
hemoglobinuria.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Sample: Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD
(yellow-top) tube.
• Volume: 4-6 mL.
• Stability: Store specimen at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable Samples: Clotted samples, hemolyzed samples,
or samples not stored as required.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II or similar)
• Control and test antibodies (e.g., CD55, CD59, CD14, CD157)
• FACS lysing solution
• FACS washing buffer
• CBC analyzer (for initial patient overview)
• Quality control material
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Place 100 µL of whole blood into appropriately labeled flow
cytometry tubes.
2. Addition of Antibodies:
◦ Add 5 µL of each fluorescent-conjugated antibody (e.g.,
CD55-FITC, CD59-PE, CD14-APC, CD157-PerCP) to the
respective tubes.
◦ Vortex gently to mix.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate tubes in the dark at room temperature (20-25°C)
for 15-20 minutes.
4. Lysing Red Blood Cells:
◦ Add 2 mL of FACS lysing solution to each tube.
◦ Incubate for an additional 10 minutes in the dark.
5. Washing:
◦ Centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell
pellet.
◦ Resuspend cell pellet in 2 mL of FACS washing buffer and
vortex to mix.
◦ Repeat the wash step.
◦ After the final wash, resuspend cells in 500 µL of FACS
buffer.
B) Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Calibrate and set up the flow cytometer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run quality control beads to ensure the instrument is
functioning properly.
2. Running Samples:
◦ Run unstained and single-color compensation controls for
each antibody to set up the flow cytometer compensation
settings.
◦ Acquire at least 50,000 events for each patient sample to
ensure an adequate number of cells are analyzed.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Set appropriate gates to include lymphocytes, monocytes,
and granulocytes.
◦ Record the percentage of cells that are negative for CD55
and/or CD59 (PNH clones).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each new batch of reagents and once
daily when samples are analyzed.
• All quality control results must fall within the manufacturer-
specified range.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all data and annotate any anomalies observed during the
analysis.
• Use appropriate software to analyze flow cytometry data and
generate a detailed report.
• Verify abnormal findings with a secondary technologist or
pathologist.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
For the identification of PNH clones, reference intervals will depend
on the laboratory’s validation studies, but generally, a minimum of
0.01% PNH Type III cells in RBC and 0.1% in WBCs is considered
positive for PNH.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The accuracy of flow cytometry can be affected by improper
sample handling, inadequate staining, or machine calibration
errors.
• Only properly validated antibodies and reagents should be
utilized; any deviation from protocols may affect results.

• International Clinical Cytometry Society (ICCS) guidelines
• Manufacturer manuals for the specific flow cytometry equipment
used
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of sample processing, instrument calibration,
quality control, and result reporting according to the laboratory's
standard procedures.
