Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Measurement of IgE for Parrot (Budgerigar) Feathers Allergy
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the analysis and measurement
of IgE antibodies specific to Parrot Australian (Budgerigar) feathers in
patient serum samples. This SOP details the laboratory handling,
processing, and interpretation steps necessary to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to serum samples received by the [Laboratory
Name] for the purpose of testing for IgE antibodies specific to Parrot
Australian (Budgerigar) feathers.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document the analytical procedures according to this SOP. The
Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and approving
test results and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected from a SST (serum
separator tube).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum should be processed and tested within 2 hours
of collection if stored at room temperature (15-25°C). If delayed,
store serum at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or at -20°C for longer
storage.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Automated or manual Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP,
ADVIA Centaur, or similar platform).
• Reagents specific to Parrot (Budgerigar) Feathers IgE
(commercially available kits).
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls).
• Calibrators.
• Standard laboratory safety equipment (gloves, lab coat, eye
protection).
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Calibrate the Immunoassay Analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using provided calibrators.
• Run quality control samples to ensure the analyzer is properly
functioning.
Sample Processing:
1. Identification: Confirm the identification of the serum sample
using the laboratory information system to match the patient
information.
2. Preparation: Centrifuge the SST tube at 1,500 x g for 10
minutes to obtain clear serum.
3. Load Sample: Load the serum samples into the analyzer as
per the manufacturer’s instructions, along with controls and
standards.
4. Analysis: Select the assay specific for Parrot (Budgerigar)
Feathers IgE and follow the manufacturer’s operating
procedures to initiate the run.
Measurement:
• The automated analyzer will process the sample and measure the
IgE concentration.
• Upon completion, the results will be displayed and/or printed by
the analyzer.
Quality Assurance:
• Review the control results to ensure they are within the
acceptable range. If controls fall outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot the cause (reagent issues, calibration errors,
equipment malfunction) and repeat the assay as necessary.
• Document all quality control results and corrective actions taken
in the laboratory record.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify the integrity of the results according to lab
protocols. Any questionable results should be reanalyzed.
• Report the IgE concentration in kU/L with the following
interpretation criteria:
◦ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative
◦ 0.35 - 0.69 kU/L: Borderline
◦ 0.70 - 3.49 kU/L: Low positive
◦ 3.50 - 17.49 kU/L: Moderate positive
◦ 17.50 - 50.00 kU/L: High positive
◦ 50.00 kU/L: Very high positive
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance checks on the
immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Follow internal and external quality assurance programs to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of test results.
• Recalibrate the analyzer and repeat quality control checks with
each new lot of reagents.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the accuracy of
the test results.
• Heterophilic antibodies or other interferents in the patient serum
may lead to erroneous results.
• Refer to the reagent and analyzer-specific product inserts for
detailed information on assay limitations.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for immunoassay kits and analyzers.
• Laboratory internal procedure manuals and guidelines.
• Relevant clinical and scientific literature on immunoassays and
IgE measurement.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate, reliable,
and timely measurement of IgE specific to Parrot (Budgerigar)
feathers, aiding in the diagnosis and management of allergic
conditions.
