Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Parsley Specific IgE Testing in Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis of serum
samples for specific IgE antibodies against Parsley using
immunoassay technology.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps of the analytical process
accurately, ensuring valid and reliable test results. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and addressing issues that
may arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred specimen: Serum
collected in a red-top tube or a serum separator tube (SST).
Minimum volume: 1 mL. Note: Ensure specimens are clearly
labeled with patient identification details, collection date, and
time.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or significant visible
contamination.
• Specimens not properly labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP 250, Phadia 100/250)
• Specific IgE test reagents for Parsley (e.g., ImmunoCAP
reagents)
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, and high levels)
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (if applicable)
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL Quality control (QC) checks must be
performed at the beginning of each testing run using
commercial QC materials for IgE assays. Documentation of QC
results must be maintained. If QC fails, troubleshoot according
to the analyzer manual and repeat the QC testing until results
are within acceptable limits.
2. PROCEDURE
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge SST or red-top tube at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer serum to appropriately labeled aliquot tube,
avoiding cellular debris.
4. Loading onto Analyzer:
◦ Load prepared serum samples onto the immunoassay
analyzer according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Ensure sample identifiers in the analyzer match manually
recorded patient details.
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the
analyzer’s requirements.
5. Running the Test:
◦ Initiate the run program for Parsley specific IgE, setting
appropriate parameters for analysis duration and
temperatures.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any error messages and ensure
proper calibration checks are completed.
6. Reviewing Results:
◦ Once analysis is complete, retrieve data and review each
result for accuracy.
◦ Ensure all controls are within acceptable ranges.
7. Troubleshooting:
◦ If a patient result is flagged by the analyzer, review the
corresponding control results.
◦ Repeat analysis or perform necessary troubleshooting steps
in cases of ambiguous or failed runs.
8. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Notify the medical provider of abnormal and critical results
per laboratory protocol.
◦ Ensure manual data entry errors are corrected before
verification.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Specific IgE level: <0.35 kU/L - Negative
• Specific IgE level: ≥0.35 kU/L - Positive
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer's product
insert for limitations specific to the Parsley IgE assay, including
potential cross-reactivity, interference from other substances,
and assay sensitivity.
2. REFERENCES Product inserts from reagent manufacturers
and user manuals for immunoassay analyzers (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP system user manual).
3. RECORD KEEPING Maintain a record of all sample identifiers,
control results, calibrations, and test outcomes in both physical
and electronic formats as applicable.
4. SUPERVISORY REVIEW Supervisors are required to review all
QC data monthly and ensure all staff are compliant with the
SOP.
5. CONTACT INFORMATION For technical issues or procedural
clarification, contact the laboratory supervisor or technical
support for the immunoassay analyzer.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate, reliable,
and timely results for Parsley specific IgE testing in serum samples.
