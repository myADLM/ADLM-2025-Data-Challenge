SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Parsley
IgG
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis, generation, and reporting
of Parsley IgG results in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing all
analytical procedures as described in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedures,
ensuring compliance, and addressing any issues that arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow the
blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and
centrifuge to separate serum.
Acceptable Specimen:
• Plasma: Collect blood in a tube containing EDTA or heparin.
Immediately mix and centrifuge to separate plasma.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Incorrectly labeled specimens or specimens without a collection
date/time.
• Serum or plasma samples stored for more than 48 hours at room
temperature.
Specimen Storage:
• Serum or plasma samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately and are stable for up to 7 days.
• For prolonged storage, serum or plasma should be frozen at
-20°C and is stable for up to 6 months.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Parsley IgG ELISA kit (or equivalent)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (adjustable volume)
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
• Distilled or deionized water
• Graduated cylinders and appropriate labware
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents as per kit instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(approximately 20-25°C) before use.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Prepare and run quality control samples (positive and
negative controls) along with patient samples to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Label microplate wells for standards, quality controls, and
patient samples.
2. Add 50 µL of standards, quality controls, and patient samples to
corresponding wells.
3. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
4. Mix gently by tapping the side of the plate and incubate for 60
minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash the plate 3 times with the provided washing buffer.
6. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well and incubate
for 15 minutes in the dark.
7. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
8. Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Calculations
1. Plot the standard curve using the OD values of the standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of Parsley IgG in the patient
samples by comparing their OD values to the standard curve.
3. Use software or manual calculations to ensure accuracy in
determination.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Repeat the analysis if the controls do not fall within the
established range.
• Document all results and quality control data in the appropriate
logs and records.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include any relevant comments regarding the assay or sample
integrity.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish and validate reference intervals within the laboratory, or
use those provided by the kit manufacturer if applicable.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the kit insert for assay-specific limitations and cross-
reactivities.
• Potential interference from hemolyzed or lipemic samples should
be noted.
10. REFERENCES

By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure the reliable and
accurate generation of Parsley IgG results, maintaining the highest
standards of laboratory practice and patient care.
