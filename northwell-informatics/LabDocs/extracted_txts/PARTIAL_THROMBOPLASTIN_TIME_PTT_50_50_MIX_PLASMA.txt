Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Partial
Thromboplastin Time (PTT), 50:50 Mix, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
ensure accurate and reliable measurement of Partial Thromboplastin
Time (PTT) in plasma samples using a 50:50 mix with normal pooled
plasma. This SOP details the procedures for sample preparation,
analysis, and result reporting to provide consistent and reproducible
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing PTT
analysis following these procedures. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure all staff are trained and adhere to this
SOP, including taking corrective actions when necessary.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected citrated plasma samples from patients. Samples
should be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection and plasma
separated.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Samples that have not been properly centrifuged or have visible
clots.
• Samples collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PTT reagent (commercially available)
• Normal pooled plasma (NPP)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (37°C)
• Timer
• Automated coagulation analyzer
• Sample cups
• Plasma separating filters (if necessary)
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result reporting
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of NPP:
1. Thaw the normal pooled plasma at room temperature if frozen.
2. Mix gently by inverting several times to ensure homogeneity.
3. Transfer into aliquots if necessary and store at 2-8°C if not used
immediately.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the citrated blood samples at 3000 rpm for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Carefully pipette the plasma into labeled sample cups, avoiding
the transfer of any blood cells.
C. 50:50 Plasma Mix:
1. Pipette 0.5 mL of patient plasma into a clean sample cup.
2. Add an equal volume (0.5 mL) of normal pooled plasma to the
same cup.
3. Mix gently and thoroughly by inverting several times.
D. Analysis:
1. Pre-warm the 50:50 plasma mix at 37°C for at least 2 minutes.
2. Load the sample cup into the automated coagulation analyzer.
3. Follow the analyzer's instructions to perform PTT testing using
the appropriate PTT reagent.
E. Interpretation of Results:
1. The automated coagulation analyzer will display the clotting
time (PTT) for the 50:50 mix.
2. Compare the PTT results of the patient sample to established
reference ranges.
F. Quality Control:
1. Run commercial quality control materials at the beginning of
each shift and after a reagent change.
2. Record QC results in the LIS. Ensure QC results fall within
acceptable limits before patient testing.
3. Perform recalibration if control results fall outside the
acceptable range and notify supervisor.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Verify all PTT results in the LIS.
2. Transmit results to the laboratory information system (LIS) for
clinician access.
3. Any critical results should be communicated directly to the
clinician and documented.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult and use site-specific reference intervals for PTT based on
established laboratory guidelines.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer's reagent insert for potential limitations and
interferences affecting PTT measurement.

This SOP guide ensures accurate and reliable testing of Partial
Thromboplastin Time (PTT) using a 50:50 mix with normal pooled
plasma. Adherence to these guidelines will promote consistency and
confidence in generated test results.
