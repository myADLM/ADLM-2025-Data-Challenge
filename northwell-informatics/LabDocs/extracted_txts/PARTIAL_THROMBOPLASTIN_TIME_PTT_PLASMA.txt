Time (PTT), Plasma:
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), Plasma Analysis
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
Version: 1.0
Prepared by: [Name]
Approved by: [Name]
PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) in plasma to ensure accuracy,
precision, and reliability of test results.
SCOPE: This procedure applies to laboratory personnel trained in the
analysis of PTT using automated coagulation analyzers.
RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing PTT
analysis according to this procedure.
• The Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that
laboratory personnel are trained and competent in this procedure.
DEFINITION: Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) is a blood test that
measures the time it takes for blood to clot. It is used to evaluate the
intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation.
EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• Automated Coagulation Analyzer (e.g., [Insert Model])
• Consumables (e.g., sample cups, pipette tips)
• Reagents (e.g., phospholipid prepared Coagulation Reagents)
• Calibration and control materials
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection: Draw blood into a citrated collection tube (light blue
top) and invert gently to mix.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL plasma
• Processing: Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 1500 x g for
15 minutes to separate plasma. Aliquot plasma into a labeled
sample tube and store at 2-8°C until analysis.
• Stability: Plasma samples for PTT analysis are stable for up to 4
hours at room temperature or up to 24 hours if refrigerated.
PROCEDURE:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure the automated coagulation analyzer is calibrated
and quality control (QC) is performed at the start of each
day.
◦ Verify the availability of reagents, consumables, and control
materials.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Label all sample tubes with the patient's ID and test details.
◦ Carefully load the centrifuged plasma samples into the
sample cups of the coagulation analyzer.
3. Running the PTT Test:
◦ Access the programmed PTT test assay on the analyzer.
◦ Enter patient information and specify the test protocol.
◦ Follow analyzer-specific instructions for initiating the assay.
◦ Ensure reagents are dispensed accurately and the
instrument's dispensation needle is free of clogs.
4. Monitoring the Analysis:
◦ Monitor the instrument during the testing process to ensure
it runs without errors.
◦ Be vigilant for any instrument alerts or errors that may
indicate a problem with the assay or equipment.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run the quality control materials alongside patient samples
at intervals as recommended by the QC program.
◦ Document all QC results. If any QC result deviates from
established criteria, investigate and undertake corrective
actions before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
6. Data Review:
◦ Once the test is complete, review the data generated by the
analyzer.
◦ Verify that all results fall within the instrument's measurable
range.
7. Result Interpretation:
◦ Refer to the specific reference intervals for PTT and assess
if the patient's values fall within the normal range or indicate
any abnormalities.
8. Reporting Results:
◦ Verify the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for patients.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of results in the patient's
medical record.
◦ Critical or abnormal results should be communicated to the
provider promptly according to the laboratory’s critical
results policy.
REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal PTT: [Insert laboratory specific reference range]
• Critical PTT: [Insert critical range]
QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Perform regular maintenance of the coagulation analyzer as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Participate in external proficiency testing to validate the accuracy
and reliability of PTT results.
• Ensure that all personnel involved in PTT testing receive
continuous education and competency assessments.
TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If the instrument fails QC or reports unexpected errors, recalibrate
the instrument and run QC again.
• Check for common issues such as air bubbles in reagents, dirty
probes, or clotted samples.
• Contact technical support for persistent or unresolved issues.
