Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Parvovirus B19 Antibodies, IgG and IgM,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and reporting of Parvovirus
B19 antibodies, IgG and IgM in serum samples, ensuring consistent,
accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of serum samples for
Parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM antibodies in the clinical laboratory
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) techniques.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the assay as
per the protocol, documenting results, and ensuring internal quality
control.
Supervisors: Responsible for reviewing and ensuring the
documentation and corrective actions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• ELISA Reader or Chemiluminescence Analyzer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if applicable)
• Parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM antibody test kits
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Serum samples
• Laboratory timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Handling:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500-2000
x g to separate serum.
• Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
• If not analyzed immediately, store the serum at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls as specified
by the manufacturer.
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
◦ Mix reagents gently to avoid foaming.
2. Instrumentation Preparation:
◦ Turn on the ELISA Reader/Chemiluminescence Analyzer
and allow it to warm up according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure proper calibration of the instrument.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Control Loading:
◦ Label the required number of microwell strips or other assay
format as outlined in the kit insert.
◦ Add the required volume of samples, calibrators, controls,
and blanks to the wells/assay plate as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add the specified volume of conjugate reagent to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time
(follow manufacturer’s instructions).
◦ Wash the wells as outlined by the kit instructions to remove
unbound antibodies.
3. Detection:
◦ Add the substrate solution to the wells.
◦ Incubate in the dark for the time specified by the manufactu
rer.
◦ Stop the reaction with the appropriate stop solution.
4. Reading the Result:
◦ Read the absorbance (for ELISA) or chemiluminescence
(for CLIA) within the timeframe specified by the
manufacturer using the appropriate instrument.
C. Quality Control
1. Run appropriate quality control samples (positive and negative
controls) with each batch of tests.
2. Document the results of quality control samples and ensure
they fall within the acceptable range before reporting patient
results.
3. Repeat the assay if the quality control results are outside of the
acceptable range.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Interpretation:
◦ Compare the sample absorbance values to the calibration
curve to determine the concentration of IgG and IgM
antibodies.
◦ Follow the result interpretation chart provided in the kit insert
to classify results as negative, equivocal, or positive.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all patient results, QC results, and repeat analyses
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing.
3. Critical Results:
◦ Any critical results should be communicated following the
standard laboratory protocol for notification of critical values.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Out-of-range QC Results:
◦ Verify reagent preparation and instrument settings.
◦ Repeat the assay if necessary.
◦ Contact the manufacturer if issues persist.
2. Inconsistent Patient Results:
◦ Re-evaluate specimen integrity and test conditions.
◦ Consider re-testing the specimen to confirm results.
