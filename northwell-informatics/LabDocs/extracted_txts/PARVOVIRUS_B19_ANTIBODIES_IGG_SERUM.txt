Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Parvovirus B19 Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure and guidelines
for the analytical phase of generating results for Parvovirus B19
Antibodies, IgG, Serum testing. This SOP ensures the quality and
accuracy of test results are maintained according to clinical
laboratory standards.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory staff performing Parvovirus
B19 IgG antibody testing. The procedure encompasses the
preparation, analysis, interpretation, and documentation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all authorized laboratory personnel to adhere
to this SOP while performing Parvovirus B19 IgG antibody testing.
Supervisors must ensure compliance with the procedure and address
any issues that may compromise test integrity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
Minimum volume 1 mL required.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens containing hemolysis, lipemia, or non-serum matrix.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader and washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Microtiter plates (pre-coated with Parvovirus B19 antigen)
• Parvovirus B19 IgG ELISA kit
• Calibrators and controls (negative, weak positive, strong positive)
• Disposable gloves
• Timer
• Laboratory incubator (37°C)
• Distilled water or wash buffer
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify specimen identity and ensure proper labeling.
2. Allow specimens to come to room temperature before analysis.
Assay Setup:
1. Begin by arranging microtiter wells according to the ELISA kit
insert. Include calibrators, controls, and patient specimens.
2. Pipette appropriate volumes of patient serum and controls into
designated wells.
3. Add conjugate per manufacturer instructions and incubate at
37°C for the recommended time.
4. Wash wells thoroughly using distilled water or wash buffer to
remove unbound material.
5. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate until color
develops.
6. Stop reaction by adding stop solution.
Measurement:
1. Read the plate using an ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength as per kit instructions.
2. Record optical density (OD) values for each well.
Analysis:
1. Compare patient OD values against calibrators and controls to
determine IgG antibody levels.
2. Apply the formula provided by the kit to transform OD readings
into semi-quantitative or quantitative values.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Positive: Indicate presence of Parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies.
2. Negative: Indicate absence of Parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies.
3. Equivocal: Repeat testing or recommend additional
confirmatory testing.
Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality controls with each batch of tests to ensure
assay reliability.
2. Document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
3. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed for accuracy and verified by authorized
personnel. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure proper documentation in patient records.
Reportable Results:
• Positive, Negative, or Equivocal.
Critical Results:
• Not applicable for Parvovirus B19 IgG.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations, including potential
interference factors.
