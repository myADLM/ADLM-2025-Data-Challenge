Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Parvovirus B19 Antibody, IgM, Serum
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis
and interpretation of Parvovirus B19 Antibody, IgM, Serum samples
to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the assay according to this protocol. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing the results and ensuring compliance with
SOPs.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Vortex Mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Disposable gloves
• Parvovirus B19 IgM ELISA Kit (or equivalent)
• Reagent tubes, micropipette tips
• Plate washer (or manual washing supplies)
• Incubator at 37°C
• Laboratory timer
• Distilled water
• Quality control material for Parvovirus B19 IgM
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 2-3 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube
or serum separator tube.
• Handling: Serum specimens must be centrifuged and separated
from clot within 2 hours of collection. Store specimens at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours; for longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly
labeled specimens.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Verify specimen labeling and storage conditions.
2. Allow serum specimens and reagents to reach room
temperature before testing.
3. Designate well positions for standards, controls, and patient
samples on a microplate layout sheet.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparing the assay
reagents including washing buffer, substrate solution, and stop
solution.
2. Vortex-mix each patient serum sample to ensure homogeneity.
C. Sample and Reagent Addition:
1. Pipette provided standards and controls into their respective
wells.
2. Add 100 µL of patient serum sample into designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes as per manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Wash the microplate wells 3-5 times with the prepared washing
buffer using a plate washer or manual washing technique.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Perform another wash cycle as described earlier.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate the
plate at room temperature for 15 minutes protected from light.
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
D. Reading and Interpretation:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using
an ELISA reader.
2. Calculate the concentration of IgM antibodies using the
standard curve generated from the known standards.
3. Compare patient results and control values to determine the
presence or absence of Parvovirus B19 IgM antibodies as per
the manufacturer's evaluation criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples provided with the ELISA kit
alongside patient specimens.
2. Ensure that controls are within the expected range before
interpreting patient results.
3. Document any deviations from expected control results and
take corrective actions as necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review results for accuracy and completeness before
verification.
3. Alert attending physician or clinician immediately if critical
results are obtained.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <Cut-off value per manufacturer's instructions
• Positive: ≥Cut-off value per manufacturer's instructions
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Only suitable for serum specimens; other specimen types may
lead to inaccurate results.
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with assay performance.
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may occur and needs
consideration in interpreting results.

11. DOCUMENTATION Maintain records of assay runs, including
calibration curves, sample specific results, quality control outcomes,
and any deviations or corrective actions taken.
This protocol must be followed strictly to ensure the reliability and
accuracy of results. Regular updates and validations are required to
keep the procedure effective and in line with current standards.
