Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Parvovirus B19 Antibody, Technical
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps for the analytical phase of generating
results for Parvovirus B19 antibody, including both IgG and IgM
antibodies. The procedure ensures accuracy and consistency in
testing, as well as proper documentation and quality control
measures necessary for reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the
procedures outlined in this SOP accurately, to document results
correctly, and to take any necessary corrective actions. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring compliance,
and addressing any deviations or issues.
1. DEFINITIONS
Parvovirus B19 Antibodies:
• IgG Antibody: Indicates past infection or immunity.
• IgM Antibody: Indicates current or recent infection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred specimen is serum collected in a red-top or SST
vacutainer tube.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume required is 1 mL of serum.
Specimen Storage:
• Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or fluoride tubes
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader with appropriate filters
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Precision pipettes and disposable tips
• Microplate washer
• Parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM ELISA kits
• Deionized water
• Parvovirus B19 antibody positive and negative controls
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
2. Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and functioning.
Assay Procedure:
1. Label ELISA plate wells according to the test layout (e.g.,
blanks, standards, positive and negative controls, samples).
2. Add an appropriate volume of samples, standards, and controls
to the designated wells according to the kit instructions.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (refer to kit
protocol).
4. Perform washing steps as described in the kit instructions using
a microplate washer.
5. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
6. Perform additional washing steps as described in the kit
instructions.
7. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark for
the specified time.
8. Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
9. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using an
ELISA plate reader.
10. Record the optical density (OD) values for all wells.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Calculate the average OD value for the negative control wells.
2. Determine the cut-off value according to the kit instructions.
3. Compare the OD values of the samples to the cut-off value.
◦ IgG/IgM Positive: OD value higher than the cut-off.
◦ IgG/IgM Negative: OD value lower than the cut-off.
4. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
7. Ensure control results fall within the acceptable ranges
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
8. Any deviation in control results must prompt investigation and
resolution before reporting patient results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Review and verify results for accuracy.
11. Enter the results into the LIS.
12. Flag any critical results and notify appropriate clinical personnel
following laboratory protocols.

1. DOCUMENTATION
2. Record all test procedures, control results, and patient results in
the laboratory logbook or electronically in the LIS.
3. Document any troubleshooting and corrective actions taken
during the testing process.
4. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
5. Follow standard laboratory biosafety guidelines when handling
biological specimens.
6. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
7. Dispose of all waste materials in accordance with local, state,
and federal regulations.
By following this SOP, laboratory technologists will ensure accurate
and reliable testing for Parvovirus B19 antibodies, maintaining high
standards of quality and compliance.
