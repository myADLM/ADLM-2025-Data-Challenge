Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
PARVOVIRUS B19 DETECTION BY PCR
1. PURPOSE To establish standard procedures for accurately
detecting Parvovirus B19 DNA in clinical specimens using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods in an analytical
phase.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of qualified laboratorians
trained in molecular diagnostics to adhere to and execute this
protocol, ensuring the integrity and validity of test results.
1. SPECIMEN
◦ Acceptable: Whole blood, serum, plasma, bone marrow,
amniotic fluid, or fetal tissues. Specimens should be stored
and transported under recommended conditions to preserve
nucleic acid integrity.
◦ Unacceptable: Specimens improperly collected, transported,
or stored leading to nucleic acid degradation. Hemolyzed,
lipemic, or otherwise contaminated samples.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ PCR thermal cycler (validated for the procedure)
◦ Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
◦ Micropipettes and sterilized tips
◦ Nucleic acid extraction kit (validated for PCR use)
◦ Parvovirus B19 primers and probes (validated and batch-
tested)
◦ PCR master mix (contains Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2,
and buffer)
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive control template (known Parvovirus B19 DNA)
◦ Negative control (nuclease-free water or appropriate no-
template control)
3. PROCEDURE
A) Nucleic Acid Extraction: - Follow manufacturer instructions for
the nucleic acid extraction kit. - Ensure that the sample volume and
reagents match specified requirements. - Perform extraction under
sterile conditions to prevent contamination. - Verify concentration and
purity of extracted DNA using spectrophotometry or equivalent
method.
B) PCR Setup: - Prepare PCR master mix according to manufacturer
specifications. - Add required volumes of forward and reverse
primers, probe, and template DNA. - Typical final concentrations: -
Primers: 0.1-0.5 µM - Probe: 0.1-0.2 µM - Template: 1-10 ng - Ensure
minimal handling and rapid preparation to prevent degradation and
contamination. - Include positive and negative controls with each
batch of PCR reactions.
C) PCR Amplification:
• Place the reaction tubes in the PCR thermal cycler.
• Set the thermal cycler with the following cycle conditions (may
require optimization based on primers/probe):
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (temperature may vary
based on probe specifications)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Repeat cycles: 40 cycles
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
• Analyze amplification through real-time PCR or endpoint detection
methods.
D) Result Analysis and Reporting: - Verify amplification curves or
endpoints, ensuring control reactions performed as expected. -
Positive control must demonstrate expected signal. - Negative control
must show no amplification signal. - Analyze the Ct values or
endpoint fluorescence. - Confirm the presence of Parvovirus B19
DNA from positive specimens and compare to reference values. -
Document findings, including any unusual observations or
discrepancies.
E) Quality Control: - Perform regular maintenance and calibration of
PCR equipment. - Use batch-tested, validated reagents—store and
handle per manufacturer instructions. - Run internal and external
controls periodically to monitor assay performance. - Maintain QC
logs reflecting reagent expiry dates, control results, and corrective
actions taken upon detection of anomalies.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Interpret PCR positive results as indicative of Parvovirus B19
presence in the specimen.
• Negative results indicate no detectable Parvovirus B19 DNA
under assay conditions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure all specimens are suitable for PCR, free from
inhibitors or contaminants.
◦ PCR sensitivity ranges may vary; suboptimal storage or
handling may impact result accuracy.
