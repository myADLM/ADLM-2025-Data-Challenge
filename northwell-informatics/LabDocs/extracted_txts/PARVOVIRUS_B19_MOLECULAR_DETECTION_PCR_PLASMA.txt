Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PARVOVIRUS B19, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the molecular detection of
Parvovirus B19 in plasma samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) methodology to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in PCR
techniques and responsible for performing Parvovirus B19 molecular
detection in plasma specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP. Supervisors must ensure all staff are trained and proficiency-
tested in the procedure.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstation
• Biological Safety Cabinet (Class II)
• Microcentrifuge
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Vortex Mixer
• Micropipettes (0.5-10 µL, 10-100 µL, 100-1000 µL)
• Sterile filter tips
• DNA/RNA Extraction Kit for plasma
• Parvovirus B19 PCR Master Mix
• Parvovirus B19 Positive Control
• Parvovirus B19 Negative Control
• Nuclease-free water
• Plasma samples (previously accessioned and stored)
• 1.5 mL Microcentrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat and safety goggles
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-Analytical Phase
Ensure plasma samples are properly accessioned and documented.
All samples should be stored at -20°C or below until analysis.
Before starting, confirm that:
• Equipment is calibrated and functional.
• All reagents and supplies are within their expiration dates.
• Pipettes are calibrated.
5.2 Sample Preparation
1. Thaw plasma specimens at room temperature.
2. Mix specimens by gentle inversion for 15 seconds. Avoid
foaming.
3. Centrifuge specimens at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
debris.
4. Aliquot 200 µL of the plasma into a labeled 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
5.3 Nucleic Acid Extraction
Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the DNA/RNA extraction kit:
1. Add appropriate volume of lysis buffer to the sample.
2. Vortex briefly and incubate as per kit instructions.
3. Perform wash steps as described in protocol.
4. Elute nucleic acids in nuclease-free water or elution buffer.
5. Store extracted nucleic acids at -20°C until PCR setup.
5.4 PCR Setup
1. Thaw all PCR reagents on ice, including PCR Master Mix,
Positive Control, and Negative Control.
2. Prepare PCR Master Mix according to the following
specifications (adjust volumes as required):
◦ X µL of PCR Master Mix
◦ Y µL of Nuclease-free Water
◦ Z µL of Primers/Probes mix
3. Dispense equal volumes of the PCR Master Mix into individual
PCR tubes or a PCR plate (e.g., 20 µL per well for a 25 µL
reaction).
4. Add 5 µL of extracted nucleic acid from each sample to the
corresponding PCR tube or well.
5. Include Positive Control and Negative Control wells.
6. Seal PCR tubes or plate with appropriate sealing film.
5.5 Thermal Cycling Conditions
Program the PCR Thermal Cycler as follows:
1. Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 mins
2. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 secs Annealing/Extension: 60°C for
60 secs (40 cycles)
3. Final Extension: 72°C for 5 mins
5.6 Post-PCR Analysis
1. After PCR cycling is completed, confirm amplification by
visualizing results using a gel electrophoresis system or a real-
time PCR detection system, if applicable.
2. Analyze the data:
◦ Positive Control should show expected amplification.
◦ Negative Control should show no amplification.
◦ Sample results are determined against control results.
5.7 Quality Control
Regularly perform quality control as follows:
1. Run Positive and Negative Controls with every batch of
samples.
2. Document and review Control results to ensure proper assay
performance.
3. Investigate and document any Control failures or unusual
findings.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Technologists must review and verify all results before final
reporting.
3. Document and communicate critical results according to
laboratory protocol.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Follow standard biosafety guidelines when handling specimens
and performing PCR.
2. Use appropriate PPE: gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
3. Disinfect work surfaces before and after use.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If no amplification is observed:
◦ Check PCR reagent integrity.
◦ Verify thermal cycler settings.
2. If contamination is suspected:
◦ Re-assess workspace cleanliness.
◦ Review recent runs for potential contamination sources.
