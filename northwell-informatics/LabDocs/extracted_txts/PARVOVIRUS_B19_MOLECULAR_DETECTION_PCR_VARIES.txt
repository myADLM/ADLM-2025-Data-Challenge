STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for PARVOVIRUS
B19, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for performing molecular
detection of Parvovirus B19 using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
to ensure accurate, consistent, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to the determination of Parvovirus
B19 in clinical specimens using PCR. This SOP is valid for all
laboratory personnel trained to perform this analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory
personnel to ensure that all steps in this SOP are followed.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and updating this SOP as
necessary. Laboratory staff must notify their supervisor if any issues
arise during testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS A. Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA or heparin tubes.
• Serum or plasma separated and stored at -20°C or lower.
• Bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA.
• Amniotic fluid.
B. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination (e.g., fecal matter).
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens received in containers not meeting standard collection
requirements.
• Specimens that have been thawed multiple times.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT A. Reagents:
• PCR master mix (commercially prepared or validated lab-mixed
reagents)
• Oligonucleotide primers and probes specific for Parvovirus B19
• Nuclease-free water
• DNase/RNase-free tubes and tips
B. Equipment:
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and Pipette tips
• Biological safety cabinet
• Calibrated thermal cycler
• Computer with relevant software for data analysis
6. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
• Work within a designated area to avoid contamination.
• Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature prior to
use.
• Prepare the PCR master mix within a biological safety cabinet.
B. PCR Master Mix Preparation:
• Thaw all reagents on ice and mix by gentle vortexing.
• In a clean microcentrifuge tube, combine the following:
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTPs
◦ MgCl2
◦ Forward primer
◦ Reverse primer
◦ Probe specific for Parvovirus B19
◦ DNA polymerase
◦ Internal control (optional)
• Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
C. Sample Preparation:
• Extract DNA from clinical specimens using a DNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA.
• Add the appropriate volume of extracted DNA to the PCR tubes/
plates containing the master mix.
D. PCR Amplification:
• Place PCR tubes/plates in the real-time PCR instrument.
• Set up the PCR run using the following thermal cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification: 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
E. Data Analysis:
• After PCR completion, analyze the data using the software
associated with the PCR instrument.
• Ensure the threshold cycles (Ct) are within the expected range for
positive and negative controls.
• Evaluate amplification plots for all specimens and controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL A. Positive Control:
• Include a known Parvovirus B19 positive control in each PCR run.
B. Negative Control:
• Include a no-template control (NTC) with nuclease-free water in
each PCR run. C. Internal Control:
• If available, include an internal control to monitor PCR inhibition.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS A. Positive Result:
• A positive result is indicated by a Ct value within the set threshold
for the positive control. B. Negative Result:
• A negative result is indicated if no Ct value is observed within the
set number of cycles and controls validate the run. C. Invalid
Result:
• If positive or negative controls fail, the run is considered invalid,
and the test must be repeated.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include comments regarding the validity of the controls and any
potential inhibitors observed.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Variability in specimen collection and handling can affect results.
• Incomplete extraction or poor quality DNA can lead to false
negatives.
• PCR inhibitors in clinical specimens can hinder amplification.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction and PCR reagent
kits.
• Relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature on Parvovirus B19
PCR testing.
12. REVIEW
• This SOP is reviewed annually or when changes to procedures or
equipment occur.
