STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP): PARVOVIRUS
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the technical component of generating results for parvovirus
immunostain in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This SOP outlines the
tasks undertaken from the time the specimen is processed until the
results are generated and documented.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all trained laboratory personnel who are
responsible for performing parvovirus immunostain tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to:
• Adhere strictly to this SOP for parvovirus immunostain testing.
• Ensure that all testing processes are documented accurately.
• Report any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure to a supervisor immediately.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microscope slides with patient samples
• Positive and negative control slides
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Parvovirus primary antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated with a detection marker (e.g.,
horseradish peroxidase)
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate solution
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Humidity chamber
• Pipettes and tips
• Slide rack
• Incubator
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Labeling:
◦ Label all slides with unique identifier (e.g., patient ID,
control) using a permanent marker.
2. Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative control slides for each batch
processed.
B. Immunostaining Protocol
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene for 3 minutes,
repeat twice.
◦ Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%,
70%) 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval by incubating slides in heated
antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) at 95–
100°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Rinse with PBS two times for 5 minutes each.
3. Blocking:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse with PBS two times for 5 minutes each.
◦ Apply blocking solution (e.g., serum block) and incubate in
humidity chamber for 30 minutes.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute the parvovirus primary antibody as per manufacturer
instructions.
▪ Apply primary antibody to the slides.
▪ Incubate in the humidity chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
▪ Rinse slides with PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody and incubate in the humidity
chamber for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides with PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
6. Visualization:
◦ Incubate slides in DAB substrate solution until desired
staining is achieved (typically 3-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in running tap water.
◦ Blue slides in a mild alkaline solution (e.g., 0.1% ammonia
water) for 1-2 minutes.
8. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) 2
minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 3 minutes, repeat twice.
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
C. Quality Control
1. Review results of control slides:
◦ Controls must demonstrate appropriate staining patterns
(positive control showing staining, negative control without
staining).
6. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps in the logbook, including the antibodies and
reagents used, incubation times, and any deviations from the
protocol.
• Record results of positive and negative controls.
• Enter preliminary results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) following internal verification procedures.
7. RESULT REPORTING
• Submit the stained slides for pathologist review and interpretation.
• Pathologist will document the final interpretation in the LIS.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results occur (e.g., no staining, excessive
background), verify that all reagents are within expiration, check
protocol adherence, and repeat the staining process if necessary.
• Report any consistent issues with reagents or equipment to the
supervisor for further investigation.
