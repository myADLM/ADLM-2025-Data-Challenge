Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
PASSION FRUIT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Passion Fruit
IgE antibodies in serum samples, ensuring consistency, reliability,
and accuracy of the results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all serum samples submitted for the
determination of Passion Fruit, IgE in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this procedure and
ensuring the accurate and timely analysis of samples. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing any issues
that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Storage & Stability: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if
testing is to be performed within 48 hours. For longer storage,
samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP System or equivalent automated immunoassay
analyzer
• Allergosorbent reagents specific for Passion Fruit IgE
• Calibrators and controls for Passion Fruit IgE
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if required by the analyzer)
• Quality control materials
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals specific to Passion Fruit IgE should be
established based on population studies and analyzer
manufacturer recommendations.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the SST tube at 1,100-1,300 x g for 10-15
minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately
labeled tube avoiding any cellular components.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ If the sample is to be stored before testing, ensure proper
storage conditions as defined in section 4.
B. Analytical Procedure using the ImmunoCAP system
1. Initial Setup:
◦ Turn on the ImmunoCAP system and follow manufacturer's
instructions for daily maintenance and calibration checks.
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at room
temperature before use.
◦ Load the serum samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the IgE assay specific to Passion Fruit from the
analyzer’s assay menu.
◦ Follow the analyzer prompts to initiate the assay.
◦ Ensure proper calibration with each new lot of reagents or at
the recommended frequency.
C. Maintaining Quality Control:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to ensure assay accuracy.
◦ Record and review control results in the quality control log.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Control results must fall within the specified range provided
by the manufacturer.
◦ If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to
manufacturer’s guidelines and do not report patient results
until the issue is resolved.
D. Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Data Review:
◦ After the assay is completed, review the results for
calibration and controls.
◦ Verify that all results fall within the expected ranges and that
there are no flags or messages indicating potential issues.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
or manual log.
◦ Ensure that results entered into the LIS are verified by a
technologist according to laboratory policy.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report the results in quantitative units (e.g., kUA/L) as per
the analyzer’s output.
◦ Reference intervals and interpretation guidelines should be
included with the results to assist the clinician.
E. Post-Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Storage:
◦ Store any remaining serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours after testing. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
2. Quality Assurance:
◦ Regularly review quality control logs and participate in
proficiency testing as required by regulatory bodies.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific limitations
associated with the Passion Fruit IgE assay. Interfering substances or
cross-reactivity with other allergens should be noted.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP is subject to review and revision annually or as required by
new regulations, scientific advancements, or instrument manufacturer
updates.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
reliable and accurate measurement of Passion Fruit IgE antibodies in
serum samples, contributing to the effective diagnosis and
management of allergic conditions.
