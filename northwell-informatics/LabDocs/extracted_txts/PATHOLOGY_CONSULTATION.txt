Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Pathology Consultation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the detailed process involved
in the analytical phase of generating results for pathology
consultations. This procedure ensures that all steps are documented
and followed meticulously to provide accurate and reliable results to
the requesting pathologists.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory technologists are responsible for performing,
documenting, and ensuring the accuracy of all analytical processes.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure,
troubleshooting issues, and ensuring adherence to quality control
standards.
1. DEFINITION
Pathology consultation refers to the examination and analysis of
clinical specimens to provide a comprehensive report on the
pathological findings. This includes histopathological, cytological,
molecular, and microbiological analyses.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Processing
i) Histopathology:
• Gross examination: The sample received in the laboratory is
examined visually and described. Any noticeable lesions or
notable features are documented.
• Tissue fixation: Samples are fixed in 10% buffered formalin to
preserve pathological details.
• Tissue processing: Fixed tissues are dehydrated through graded
alcohols, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin wax.
• Microtomy: Thin sections (4-5 microns) are cut using a microtome
and placed on glass slides.
• Staining: Routine staining (e.g., Hematoxylin & Eosin) and special
staining techniques (e.g., PAS, Trichrome) are applied as
required.
ii) Cytology:
• Preparation of smears: Specimen (e.g., fluid, fine needle
aspirates) is centrifuged, and cell pellets are smeared onto glass
slides.
• Fixation & Staining: Smears are fixed with alcohol-based fixatives
and stained using techniques such as Papanicolaou or Giemsa.
iii) Molecular Pathology:
• Nucleic acid extraction: DNA/RNA is isolated from the sample
using commercially available kits or protocols.
• PCR/Sequencing: Specific genetic markers or sequences are
amplified and/or sequenced for mutation analysis.
• In Situ Hybridization: Probes are used to identify RNA or DNA
sequences in tissue sections.
iv) Microbiology:
• Culture & Sensitivity: The sample (e.g., sputum, tissue) is cultured
on selective media to isolate pathogens. Sensitivity tests are
performed to determine appropriate antimicrobial treatments.
• Direct Microscopy: Specimens are examined for microorganisms
using Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen, and other staining techniques.
B) Quality Control:
i) Internal Controls:
• Daily calibration of staining solutions and processing equipment.
• Verification of staining protocols against established control
slides.
• Routine performance of internal quality controls for molecular
assays to ascertain reliability.
ii) External Controls:
• Participation in external quality assurance programs.
• Regular audits to conform with national pathology competency
standards.
C) Generating Results:
i) Documentation:
• Ensure all findings are thoroughly documented in laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Include comprehensive descriptions of microscopic observations,
molecular findings, and microbiological results.
ii) Verification:
• Pathology consultation reports must be reviewed and verified by
senior pathologists.
• Ensure results are consistent with clinical history and specimen
details.
iii) Reporting:
• Complete pathology report is generated, documenting all findings
and providing a diagnostic conclusion.
• Reports must be delivered promptly to the requesting physician
through electronic medical records systems or secure email.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
Upon verification, results are communicated to the requesting
pathologist/physician. Each result must be reviewed for accuracy and
integrity prior to final reporting.
