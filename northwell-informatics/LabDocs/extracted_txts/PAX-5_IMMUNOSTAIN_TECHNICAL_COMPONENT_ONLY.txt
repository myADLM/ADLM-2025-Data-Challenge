Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase: PAX-5
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the technical component of performing
PAX-5 immunostain on histological tissue sections to ensure accurate
and reproducible results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
technical processing of specimens for PAX-5 immunohistochemical
staining.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform this
procedure accurately and to document all steps and observations as
detailed in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the
personnel are adequately trained and that the equipment and
reagents are maintained according to the manufacturer’s and
laboratory requirements.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
• Paraffin sections cut at 3-4 microns thickness mounted on glass
slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens fixed in inappropriate fixatives (e.g., gluteraldehyde).
• Poorly processed tissue resulting in compromised morphology.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Autostainer or manual staining setup
• Incubator or oven
Reagents:
• Primary antibody PAX-5
• Detection kit (HRP-conjugated secondary antibody)
• DAB substrate kit
• Appropriate positive and negative control slides
Supplies:
• Microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Mounting medium
• Xylene and alcohol series for deparaffinization and rehydration
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-staining Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut tissue sections at 3-4 microns thickness.
◦ Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C.
◦ Pick up sections onto glass microscope slides and place
vertically to drain.
◦ Bake slides in an oven at 60°C for a minimum of 1 hour to
ensure firm adhesion.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate sections through graded alcohols:
▪ 100% ethanol for 2 x 2 minutes
▪ 95% ethanol for 1 x 2 minutes
▪ 70% ethanol for 1 x 2 minutes
▪ Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
B. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate retrieval
buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and method (e.g.,
microwave, pressure cooker) as per antibody datasheet
instructions.
◦ Allow to cool, then rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
2. Blocking:
◦ Incubate sections with a blocking solution to prevent non-
specific binding for the duration specified by the blocking
solution manufacturer.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the PAX-5 primary antibody on the tissue sections and
incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight
at 4°C (duration based on antibody datasheet
recommendations).
4. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 3 x 5 minutes to
remove unbound primary antibody.
5. Secondary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate as
per the instruction manual, typically for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 3 x 5 minutes.
7. Substrate Development:
◦ Incubate slides with DAB substrate to visualize the antigen-
antibody reaction. Monitor the color development under a
microscope to avoid overdevelopment. Typically develop for
5-10 minutes.
8. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water, followed by brief differentiation in
acid alcohol, then blueing in ammonia water or tap water.
9. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols:
▪ 70% ethanol for 1 minute
▪ 95% ethanol for 1 x 2 minutes
▪ 100% ethanol for 2 x 2 minutes
◦ Clear in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Mount with a coverslip using permanent mounting medium.
C. Quality Control
1. Positive Control:
◦ Include a known PAX-5 positive tissue section in each
staining run to confirm antibody specificity and staining
efficiency.
2. Negative Control:
◦ Include a section with the primary antibody omitted to check
for non-specific binding or background staining.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all information in the laboratory log, including
antibodies used, lot numbers, incubation times, and any
deviations from the protocol.
4. RESULT REVIEW AND REPORTING
Technical Component Only:
• Review slides for staining quality and appropriateness.
• Confirm that control slides demonstrate correct staining patterns.
• Notify the pathologist if there are any quality issues or if repeat
staining is needed.
• Submit the slides to the pathologist for interpretation and final
reporting.
