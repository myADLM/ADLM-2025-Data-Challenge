Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PAX2 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for performing the technical
component of PAX2 immunostaining on tissue sections to ensure
accurate, consistent, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedures to follow this SOP
accurately and report any discrepancies to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
PAX2 is a transcription factor expressed in specific tissues and is
used as a biomarker for certain types of cancers and other diseases
in immunohistochemical diagnostic processes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
◦ Tissue sections should be cut 3-5 micrometers thick and
mounted on positively charged slides.
◦ Ensure all slides are clearly labeled with the appropriate
patient information and accession number.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Immunostaining platform (e.g., automated stainer such as
Ventana BenchMark, Leica Bond, or other)
◦ PAX2 primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody (appropriate for the detection system
used)
◦ Detection system (e.g., HRP-polymer detection kit)
◦ DAB substrate
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (various concentrations)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Cover slips
3. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation of Tissue Slides
- Cut tissue sections at 3-5 micrometers and mount on positively charged slides.
- Dry the slides thoroughly at 37°C overnight or incubate at 60°C for 1-2 hours.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
- Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene for 3 changes of 5 minutes each.
- Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
- Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval
- Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) by heating in a microwave or pressure cooker or using a pre-programmed antigen retrieval protocol on an automated staining platform.
- Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
5.4 Immunostaining Procedure
- Load slides onto the automated staining platform.
- Apply PAX2 primary antibody according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (optimal dilution and incubation time).
- Rinse slides using the automated washer or manually if needed.
- Apply secondary antibody according to the detection system used and incubate as recommended by the manufacturer.
- Rinse slides thoroughly.
- Apply the chromogen, DAB, and incubate until desired stain intensity is achieved, usually 5-10 minutes.
- Rinse slides under running tap water.
5.5 Counterstaining and Mounting
- Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
- Rinse slides in tap water and then in distilled water.
- Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
- Apply mounting medium and cover slips.
5.6 Quality Control
- Include a known positive control slide with each batch of staining to ensure the staining procedure is performing correctly.
- Verify that negative controls (slides where the primary antibody is omitted) do not show non-specific staining.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ The technical component of PAX2 staining only includes the
proper staining of the tissue sections.
◦ Stained slides are forwarded to the pathologist for
interpretation.
◦ Document the completion of the procedure, including any
deviations or issues encountered, in the laboratory
information system.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Not applicable for the technical component. The pathologist
will provide interpretation.
3. LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within the expiry date and
properly stored.
◦ Incubation times and temperatures must be accurately
adhered to.
◦ Inconsistencies in fixation and tissue processing can affect
staining results.
4. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for PAX2 antibody.
◦ Laboratory’s general IHC protocol documentation.
◦ Relevant literature on PAX2 staining in diagnostic pathology.
