Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PAX8
Immunostain (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the technical
component of generating results for PAX8 immunostain, including
specimen preparation, staining, and quality control in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Laboratory Technologists/Scientists: Responsible
for performing the PAX8 immunostain procedure according to this
SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to the procedure, review quality
control, and document any deviations or corrective actions.
3. DEFINITION
PAX8 (paired box gene 8) is a transcription factor commonly used as
a diagnostic marker in pathology to identify renal, Müllerian (including
ovarian and endometrial), and thyroid origin tumors.
4. SPECIMEN

• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Slide racks
◦ Automated or manual staining system
◦ Microscope
• Reagents:
◦ Xylene

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Use a microtome to cut 3-4 µm thick sections from FFPE
tissue blocks.
◦ Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and mount onto
positively charged glass slides.
◦ Allow sections to air dry overnight or dry in an oven at 60°C
for 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 3 minutes, repeat twice.
◦ Transfer slides through a graded series of ethanol: 100% (3
minutes x2), 95% (1 minute), 70% (1 minute).
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a
microwave or pressure cooker according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
6.2 Immunostaining
1. Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
◦ Apply blocking serum (e.g., 1-2% BSA in PBS) and incubate
for 10 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Drain excess serum but do not rinse.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply PAX8 primary antibody to the tissue sections and
incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight
at 4°C.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) for 5
minutes, repeat twice.
3. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) and incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, repeat twice.
4. DAB Substrate Development:
◦ Apply DAB substrate solution and monitor the reaction
under a microscope until the desired staining intensity is
achieved (generally 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water once the suitable staining
intensity is reached.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to
counterstain.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
◦ Differentiate in acid alcohol (1% hydrochloric acid in 70%
ethanol) briefly if necessary and rinse in distilled water.
◦ Bluing in lithium carbonate solution or tap water for 2-5
minutes.
6. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate slides through ethanol series: 70% (1 minute),
95% (1 minute), 100% (1 minute x2).
◦ Clear slides in xylene (2 minutes x2).
7. Mounting:
◦ Coverslip slides using a mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include known positive control tissue sections for PAX8.
◦ Include a negative control by omitting the primary antibody
on one section per staining run.
2. Review and Documentation:
◦ Examine control slides under a microscope to ensure
appropriate staining.
◦ Document any deviations, follow-up actions, and results in
the QC log.
3. Corrective Actions:
◦ If controls fail, troubleshoot the staining procedure (e.g.,
reagent preparation, incubation times).
◦ Repeat staining with new sections.
8. REPORTING AND INTERPRETATION
1. Technical Component Only:
◦ Provide stained slides to the pathologist for interpretation.
◦ Include staining protocol and any QC issues in the
accompanying documentation.
2. Record Keeping:
◦ Maintain records of all slides stained, including specimen
identification, date, and technologist initials.
