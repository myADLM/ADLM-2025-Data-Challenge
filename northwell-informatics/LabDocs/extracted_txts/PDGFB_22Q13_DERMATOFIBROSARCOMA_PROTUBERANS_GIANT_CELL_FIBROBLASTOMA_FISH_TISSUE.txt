1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect PDGFB gene
rearrangement at chromosome 22q13 in patients with
Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP) or Giant Cell
Fibroblastoma (GCF) using tissue samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the certified technologist to perform the
PDGFB (22q13) FISH assay following this protocol. The supervising
laboratory personnel shall ensure that all quality control measures
are met and documented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of
tumor.
Quantity:
• At least one paraffin-embedded tissue block or 6-8 unstained
tissue sections (4-5 microns thick) mounted on charged slides.
Storage Conditions:
• Store FFPE tissue blocks at room temperature.
• Unstained slides should be stored at 2-8°C and used within 6
months of sectioning for optimal results.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Poorly fixed or decalcified tissue samples.
• Samples with inadequate tumor cells or poor tissue morphology.

Reagents:
• FISH probe specific to PDGFB (22q13) region.
• 20X SSC Buffer.
• HCl (0.02N).
• Pepsin solution.
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%).
• Formamide solution.
• DAPI counterstain.
• Wash buffers and hybridization buffer.
Supplies:
• Charged slides.

1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Hybridization:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 3 x 10 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanol (100%, 95%,
85%, 70%) for 2 x 2 minutes each and rinse in 2X SSC for 5
minutes.
2. Pretreatment:
◦ Incubate slides in 0.02N HCl for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Digest slides with 0.5 mg/ml Pepsin in 0.01N HCl for 10
minutes at 37°C.
◦ Rinse slides in 2X SSC for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydration:
◦ Sequentially dehydrate slides in ethanol (70%, 85%, 100%)
for 2 minutes each.
◦ Air dry slides completely.
B) Hybridization:
1. Probe Preparation:
◦ Denature the FISH probe at 75°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Chill probe rapidly on ice for 2 minutes.
2. Denature Target DNA:
◦ Apply 10 µL of the probe mixture to each slide.
◦ Cover with a cover slip and seal with rubber cement or
hybridization covers.
◦ Denature slides on a heat block at 73°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Place slides in a humidified hybridization chamber at 37°C
overnight (16-18 hours).
C) Post-Hybridization and Washing:
1. Remove cover slips and wash slides in 0.4X SSC/0.3% NP-40
at 73°C for 2 minutes.
2. Further wash in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1
minute.
D) Detection and Counterstaining:
1. Apply DAPI counterstain, cover with a cover slip.
2. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
E) Microscopy and Analysis:
1. Visualize slides using a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filters.
2. Analyze and count signals in a minimum of 100 non-
overlapping interphase nuclei to determine the presence of
PDGFB rearrangement.
3. Capture images of representative fields for documentation.
4. Report Results:
◦ A positive result indicates evidence of PDGFB gene
rearrangement.
◦ A negative result indicates no evidence of the
rearrangement.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control slides in each batch.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated, and instrument maintenance
logs are up to date.
• Document reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
1. REFERENCES:
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instruction manual for probe-specific
information.
• Follow CLSI guidelines for FISH procedures (CLSI MM07-A2)
Note: This protocol should be reviewed and updated periodically to
ensure compliance with current standards and technologies.
