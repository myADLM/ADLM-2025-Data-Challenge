Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PEACH, IGE, Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the processes and procedures
involved in the analytical phase of generating results for
PEACH, IGE, and serum specimens. The protocol ensures that
all tests are conducted correctly, accurately, and consistently,
adhering to CLIA guidelines.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for processing and analyzing PEACH, IGE, and
serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis according to the protocols defined herein.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the SOP is followed,
and any deviations are documented and corrected.
• The Quality Assurance (QA) team is responsible for auditing and
updating the SOP as necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
• PEACH: Stands for specific analyte panels such as Pepsinogen I
and II, which are measured to assess certain gastric functions.
• IGE: Immunoglobulin E, a type of antibody measured to assess
allergic responses.
• Serum: The component of blood that is collected, processed, and
analyzed to measure various biochemicals.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Automated analyzers
• Reagent kits specific to PEACH, IGE, and serum
• Test tubes and containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Temperature and humidity-controlled environment
1. PROCEDURE
A. PRE-ANALYSIS
1. Specimen Identification and Preparation:
◦ Confirm that specimens are properly labeled with patient
information.
◦ Ensure specimens meet the acceptance criteria (e.g., no
hemolysis, proper volume).
◦ Store specimens at the appropriate temperature until
analysis begins.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include quality control samples in each batch of tests to
ensure accuracy.
◦ Record and review QC results before proceeding with
patient samples.
B. ANALYSIS
1. Calibration:
◦ Ensure all analyzers are calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Record calibration data in the logbook and verify the
performance.
2. Testing Procedure for PEACH:
◦ Load the reagent kit specific to PEACH into the analyzer.
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of serum into the designated
test wells.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for incubation, reaction,
and measurement.
◦ Record results automatically via the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
3. Testing Procedure for IGE:
◦ Prepare the reagent kit specific to Immunoglobulin E (IGE).
◦ Pipette the serum sample into the reaction cuvette.
◦ Incubate and run the analyzer as per the instructions
provided.
◦ Document and review the results in the LIS.
4. Testing Procedure for General Serum Biochemistry:
◦ Centrifuge the blood samples to separate the serum.
◦ Load the serum onto the appropriate biochemistry analyzer.
◦ Follow specific protocols for each assay (e.g., glucose,
electrolytes).
◦ Ensure all results are recorded and reviewed in the LIS.
C. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Investigate any unexpected results or errors flagged by the
analyzer.
• Repeat tests if QC fails or results are questionable, documenting
all actions.
• Consult with a supervisor if persistent issues arise.
1. POST-ANALYSIS
2. Result Verification:
◦ Verify that all results meet the expected reference ranges.
◦ Review QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
limits.
3. Result Entry:
◦ Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure that all entries are double-checked for accuracy.
4. Sample Storage and Disposal:
◦ Store remaining specimens under appropriate conditions as
defined by the lab policy.
◦ Dispose of biohazardous waste according to safety
guidelines.
5. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all steps, including QC, calibration, and testing, are
thoroughly documented.
◦ Maintain records for audit and QA purposes.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Internal QC:
◦ Perform internal QC regularly per established schedules.
◦ Take corrective actions if QC fails and document all steps
taken.
8. External QC:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
◦ Compare results with benchmarks and take corrective
actions as needed.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for each reagent and instrument used.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
• Laboratory quality manual and related SOPs.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
2. Review:
◦ This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as needed.
3. Revision:
◦ Revisions are made when procedures or equipment are
updated or as required by regulatory changes.
◦ Document all changes with revision history for traceability.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accurate
and reliable generation of results for PEACH, IGE, and serum
analytes, supporting high-quality patient care.
