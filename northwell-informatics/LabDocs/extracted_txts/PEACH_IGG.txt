Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
PEACH IGG (Peach IgG Antibodies)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of PEACH IGG
to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP during the analysis of PEACH IGG samples. The supervisor
is responsible for ensuring all protocols are followed and corrective
actions are taken when necessary.
3. DEFINITION
PEACH IGG (Peach Immunoglobulin G) is tested to detect the
presence of specific antibodies against peach allergens in the
patient's blood which may indicate an allergy to peaches.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube or SST
(serum separator tube).
• Sample Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Specimen Labeling: Each sample must be clearly labeled with
the patient's full name, date of birth, collection date, and time.
• Storage and Stability: Samples must be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours. If not analyzed within 48 hours, serum
should be frozen at -20°C and tested within 30 days.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (with necessary calibration).
• PEACH IGG ELISA kit (or equivalent commercial kit).
• Micropipettes and appropriate tips.
• Plate reader compatible with the ELISA kit.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Timer.
• Appropriate wash buffers and diluents (as specified in the ELISA
kit instructions).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Two levels of quality control material (positive and negative
controls) must be run with each batch of patient samples to
ensure the reliability of test results.
• Control materials should be handled and stored as per
manufacturer guidelines.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Test Setup:
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare the workbench and ensure all necessary equipment
and materials are available.
2. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the required number of wells in the ELISA plate
based on the number of controls and patient samples.
◦ Mix all samples, standards, and controls thoroughly before
use.
◦ Prepare washing buffer and other required reagents as per
the kit’s instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Pipette 100 μL of standards, controls, and patient samples
into the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Ensure that each well is documented correctly.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour, covered to prevent
evaporation.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as directed in the kit’s instructions, generally
3-5 times with the prepared washing buffer.
◦ Ensure no residual liquid remains after the final wash.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for a time
specified by the kit (usually 15-30 minutes).
5. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well in the same order
and timing as the substrate addition.
C. Measurement:
1. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at the
appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm) using the plate
reader.
◦ Ensure the reader is properly calibrated and functional.
8. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS REPORTING
• Calculate the concentration of PEACH IGG in each sample using
the standard curve obtained from the standards provided in the
kit.
• Results should be reported in IU/mL or as specified by the
particular assay kit.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Refer to the kit-specific guidelines for interpreting the results.
• Positive result: indicates the presence of PEACH IGG antibodies
and suggests a possible peach allergy.
• Negative result: indicates the absence of detectable PEACH IGG
antibodies.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Document all results, including controls, standards, and patient
samples, in the appropriate logbook or LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• Maintain quality control records, including lot numbers and expiry
dates of kits and reagents used.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
• If quality control results are outside acceptable ranges, do not
report patient results until the issue is resolved.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the immunoassay
analyzer and plate reader as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
