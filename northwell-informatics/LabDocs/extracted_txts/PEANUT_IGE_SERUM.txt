Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PEANUT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the PEANUT IgE (specific Immunoglobulin E)
test in serum samples, ensuring accuracy and consistency of test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will perform the analytical procedures.
• Designated laboratory supervisors will review and verify the test
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL serum collected in a red-top or SST (Serum Separator Tube)
tube.
• The specimen should be collected, centrifuged, and serum
separated within 2 hours post-collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
• Specimens not stored or transported at appropriate temperatures.
• Specimens not labeled correctly or without corresponding
requisition forms.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• If storage exceeds 7 days, freeze serum aliquots at -20°C or
colder for up to 6 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia 250)
• PEANUT IgE reagent kit, including all required calibrators,
controls, and diluents.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles.
• Quality control (QC) specimens (low, medium, and high).
• Calibrators.
1. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and specimens are brought to
room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Mix reagents thoroughly by inversion or gentle vortexing.
3. Prepare the Immunoassay Analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, performing any required
maintenance and calibration.
b) Calibration:
1. Run a full calibration cycle using the provided calibrators from
the PEANUT IgE reagent kit.
2. Validate calibration by running QC specimens. Results must fall
within the manufacturer’s specified ranges before proceeding
with patient samples.
c) Sample Processing:
1. Label each reaction vessel/tube with patient/sample
identification.
2. Pipette 100 µL of serum into the designated reaction vessel.
3. Add the appropriate amount of test-specific reagent as per the
kit instructions.
4. Follow the instrument’s operating procedures to perform the
assay. This typically involves incubation steps, washing steps,
and a final reading of the fluorescence/luminescence/
absorbance signal generated by the test.
d) Quality Control:
1. Add and process QC samples (low, medium, high) in
conjunction with patient samples.
2. Verify the accuracy of the QC results before reporting patient
results. Patient results can only be reported if the QC is within
the expected range.
3. RESULTS AND REPORTING
a) Data Analysis:
1. Review the automated output from the analyzer.
2. Ensure that all sample and QC results meet quality and
accuracy standards.
3. Generate patient results for PEANUT IgE levels, reported in kU/
L.
b) Interpretation:
• Interpretation of the PEANUT IgE concentration should be
performed in accordance with clinical guidelines:
◦ <0.35 kU/L: Negative for peanut-specific IgE.
◦ 0.35–0.70 kU/L: Low level of peanut-specific IgE.
◦ 0.71–3.50 kU/L: Moderate level of peanut-specific IgE.
◦ 3.50 kU/L: High level of peanut-specific IgE.
c) Reporting:
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review the results for accuracy and consistency.
• Mark any critical or unusual results for review by a laboratory
supervisor before patient reporting.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
• Maintain records of calibration and QC data.
• Log temperature data where specimens and reagents are stored
(refrigerator/freezer logs).
• Document any corrective actions taken during the analytical
process.
• Ensure that all records are traceable and stored securely for
compliance and audit purposes.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of biohazard materials and chemicals as per institutional
guidelines.
• Handle all reagents according to manufacturer’s safety data
sheets (SDS).
