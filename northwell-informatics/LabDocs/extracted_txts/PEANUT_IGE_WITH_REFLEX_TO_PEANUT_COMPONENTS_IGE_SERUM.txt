Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
PEANUT, IGE WITH REFLEX TO PEANUT COMPONENTS, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for
performing the analysis of serum samples for the PEANUT, IGE test
with reflex testing to PEANUT COMPONENTS, IGE, ensuring
accurate and reliable results. This document covers all aspects of the
analytical phase including preparation, operation, quality control, and
documentation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in immunoassay techniques are
responsible for performing the assays as per this protocol. It is the
duty of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that staff adhere to these
procedures and that quality control measures are maintained.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood into a red-top tube (or serum separator tube).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30
minutes.
• Centrifuge the tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the serum into a labeled aliquot tube.
Specimen Storage:
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if the assay will be performed within 48
hours.
• Freeze the serum at -20°C for long-term storage if the assay will
be delayed beyond 48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Instrument: Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP
system)
• Reagents: Specific IgE test reagents and calibrators for PEANUT,
IGE, and PEANUT COMPONENTS, IGE
• Controls: Low, medium, and high-level quality control materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform a full calibration of the ImmunoCAP instrument
using manufacturer-provided calibrators.
◦ Refer to the instrument manual for calibration steps.
2. Preparation:
◦ Thaw and equilibrate reagents, calibrators, controls, and
patient samples to room temperature.
◦ Vortex each tube gently for thorough mixing.
3. Instrument Setup:
◦ Load reagents and patient samples onto the instrument
according to the instrument’s loading guide.
◦ Enter patient identification and test requisition details into
the instrument’s software.
4. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the test run on the ImmunoCAP system.
◦ The instrument will automatically process the samples for
PEANUT, IGE.
◦ If the PEANUT, IGE result exceeds the predetermined
threshold, the instrument will reflexively proceed to testing
PEANUT COMPONENTS, IGE.
5. Reading Results:
◦ The instrument displays preliminary results for PEANUT,
IGE.
◦ Review reflex testing results for individual components (e.g.,
Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 8, Ara h 9).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each assay batch or according
to the laboratory's QC policy.
• Acceptable ranges for QC results are defined in the instrument
manual and QC material insert.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• The instrument provides quantitative results for PEANUT, IGE and
PEANUT COMPONENTS, IGE.
• Review internal quality control data to ensure assay validity
before accepting patient results.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Reflex test results must also be reviewed for appropriate
interpretation.
• Flag critical or abnormal results for immediate notification to a
clinician, as per laboratory policy.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Enter detailed records of the analysis, including specimen IDs,
test dates, calibration details, QC results, and any deviations from
the standard procedure, in the laboratory logbook.
• Maintain instrument maintenance logs and validation records for
reagents and controls.
• Document corrective actions taken for any out-of-range QC
results.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s ImmunoCAP system manual.
• Specific IgE test reagent inserts.
• Laboratory Quality Management System policies.
Note: These procedures are subject to periodic review and updates
according to new regulatory guidelines or manufacturer’s instructions.
10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Always wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
• Follow all applicable safety protocols for the handling and
disposal of biohazardous materials.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
reliable and accurate generation of results for the PEANUT, IGE
WITH REFLEX TO PEANUT COMPONENTS, IGE test, assuring
high standards of patient care.
