Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PEANUT IGG
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and procedures to be followed during the
analytical phase for generating results for Peanut Immunoglobulin G
(IgG) in patient sera to ensure accuracy, reliability, and compliance
with CLIA standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps of this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to this
SOP and to address any deviations or issues that may arise during
the analytical process.
1. DEFINITION
Peanut IgG is an immunoglobulin involved in immune responses to
allergens such as peanut proteins. Elevation of specific IgG
antibodies may indicate sensitization or exposure to peanuts.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure that the specimen (serum) meets the acceptance
criteria (not hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic).
2. Allow refrigerated or frozen specimens to come to room
temperature.
3. Mix samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Use only approved reagents and ensure they are within their
expiration dates.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the preparation of all
assay reagents.
C. Assay Setup (ELISA)
1. Label all reagents, plates, and controls as required.
2. Prepare assay plates by coating wells with peanut antigen,
following manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Add controls and samples to appropriate wells, ensuring that
each action is recorded in the assay log.
4. Incubate plates according to the specified time and temperature
requirements.
D. Washing
1. Wash the plates as per the manufacturer’s instructions to
remove unbound substances.
E. Detection
1. Add the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody (specific for
human IgG) to each well.
2. Incubate for the specified time and temperature.
3. Wash plates again to remove unbound conjugate.
F. Substrate Reaction
1. Add the chromogenic substrate to each well and incubate until
color develops, as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
3. Read the optical density at the recommended wavelength,
typically using a spectrophotometer or plate reader.
G. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples with each assay to ensure assay
validity.
2. Controls must fall within the specified ranges. If controls do not
meet criteria, the assay is invalid, and troubleshooting steps
must be followed.
H. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Calculate the concentration of Peanut IgG in samples by
comparing the optical densities to the standard curve.
2. Carefully review and validate each result to ensure accuracy.
3. Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpret results within the established reference intervals provided by
the assay's manufacturer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Use appropriate Positive and Negative controls for each batch
of samples.
3. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of assay
equipment.
4. Document any deviations, corrective actions, or equipment
maintenance performed.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Verify results in the LIS before releasing them to the clinician.
7. Flag any critical or abnormal results as per laboratory policy.
8. Communicate any critical results to the appropriate healthcare
provider directly and document the communication.
9. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
10. Maintain all records of analytical procedures, results, quality
control measures, and any corrective actions taken.
11. Ensure all documentation is complete, accurate, and stored
securely.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the assay manufacturer’s insert for troubleshooting
guidelines.
1. REFERENCES

manufacturer’s inserts for the Peanut IgG assay, relevant literature,
and clinical guidelines.
