Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Peanut
IgG4
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure of analyzing and
generating results for Peanut Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibodies
in patient serum samples using ELISA (Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay) or other validated laboratory methods.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel trained in the ELISA/laboratory
specific method and familiar with this SOP are responsible for
performing the analysis. They are also responsible for ensuring that
all equipment is calibrated, quality controls are within acceptable
limits, and results are accurately reported.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum is required.
• Collection: Serum should be collected in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if they are to be
tested within 7 days of collection. For longer storage, serum
specimens should be kept at -20°C or lower.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Peanut IgG4 ELISA kit (or equivalent)
• Calibrators, controls, and standards as provided in the ELISA kit
• Micropipettes (various volumes)
• Multichannel pipettes (if available)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Distilled or deionized water
• Microplate washer
• Microplate reader equipped with appropriate filters for the assay
(typically 450 nm with 620 nm reference filter)
• Timer
• Laboratory grade detergent
• ELISA plate cover or adhesive film
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-assay preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and patient samples to room temperature
(18-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare all required solutions as indicated in the kit insert,
including washing solution, sample diluent, and substrate
solution.
Assay Procedure:
1. Dilute specimens: Dilute patient serum specimens in the
provided sample diluent according to the kit instructions
(commonly 1:100). Mix well.
2. Add standards, controls, and samples: Pipette the
appropriate volume (often 100 µL) of calibrators, controls, and
diluted samples into the designated wells of the microplate in
duplicates or triplicates as instructed.
3. Incubate: Cover the plate with adhesive film and incubate at
room temperature for the specified duration (usually 1 hour).
4. Aspirate and Wash: Wash wells 3-5 times with the prepared
washing solution. Ensure thorough removal of liquid between
washes to minimize residual wash buffer.
5. Add detection antibody: Add the appropriate volume of
enzyme-conjugate detection antibody into each well. Seal the
plate and incubate as instructed.
6. Aspirate and Wash: Wash wells again as described in step 4.
7. Add substrate solution: Add an equal volume of the substrate
solution to each well. Cover the plate and incubate in the dark
at room temperature for the defined time (usually 15-30
minutes) without disturbing the plate.
8. Stop reaction: Add stop solution to each well in the same
sequence that the substrate solution was added.
9. Read absorbance: Measure the absorbance of each well at
the specified wavelength (450 nm with 620 nm reference
wavelength) using a microplate reader within 30 minutes of
stopping the reaction.
10. RESULT CALCULATION
11. Calculate the average absorbance values for each set of
calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
12. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the calibrators against their known concentrations.
13. Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
Peanut IgG4 in patient samples by interpolating their average
absorbance values.
14. QUALITY CONTROL
15. Quality control specimens should be included in each assay
run. Acceptable ranges for quality control values must be
established and adhered to.
16. If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, the
run is invalid and must be repeated.
17. Maintain a log of all quality control and calibration data.
18. REPORTING RESULTS
19. Document and review results in accordance with laboratory
reporting guidelines.
20. Results that are abnormal or critical should be reviewed by a
supervisor and communicated to the ordering physician
immediately, as per standard laboratory policies.
21. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
clinician review, ensuring units and reference ranges are clearly
indicated.
22. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to kit-specific reference intervals or established laboratory
validation data to interpret results. Generally, reference values should
be provided based on the demographic background and the clinical
context of the patient.
1. LIMITATIONS
2. Samples with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination may
yield erroneous results and should be recollected.
3. The presence of heterophilic antibodies or high levels of
rheumatoid factor in patient serum may interfere with
immunoassays.
4. REFERENCES
Include references to the manufacturer's package insert for the
ELISA kit, and any other relevant laboratory guidelines or peer-
reviewed articles used to establish this SOP.
By following this SOP, standardized and accurate determination of
Peanut IgG4 levels in patient samples can be achieved, ensuring the
reliable interpretation of clinical significance by the healthcare
provider.
