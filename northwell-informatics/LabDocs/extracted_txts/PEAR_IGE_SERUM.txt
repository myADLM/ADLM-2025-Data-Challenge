Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for PEAR, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose
This protocol outlines the steps and procedures for the accurate and
precise analysis of PEAR, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum
samples. These test results are used to diagnose various conditions
such as allergies, immune deficiencies, and general health
assessments.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to ensure that all steps in the analytical phase are carried
out correctly, and to report and address any deviations from standard
procedures.
1. Specimen Requirements and Handling
Specimen Types:
• PEAR: Peripheral blood collected in a designated collection tube.
• IgE (Immunoglobulin E): Peripheral blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or heparinized tube.
• Serum: Peripheral blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
Acceptance Criteria:
• Specimens must be labeled with patient identification, collection
date, and time.
• Blood specimens must be processed within two hours of
collection unless otherwise noted.
• Specimens should be free from hemolysis, clots, and lipemia.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received beyond the specified timeframe.
• Unlabeled or mislabeled specimens.
• Specimens showing signs of contamination, hemolysis, or
improper handling.

1. Procedure
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
• Centrifuge the collected blood at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
• Ensure the separation of serum/plasma without any hemolysis or
clots.
B. Assay for PEAR:
1. Specimen Analysis:
• Use the automated analyzer specific for PEAR analysis.
• Follow the manufacturer instructions for the assay reagents and
loading of the analyzer.
• Initiate the run as per the analyzer's user manual.
1. Result Interpretation:
• Collect the results from the analyzer.
• Analyze the results against the reference range provided.
C. Assay for IgE:
1. Specimen Analysis:
• Prepare the automated analyzer for IgE quantification.
• Load the specimens and IgE assay reagents as per the
manufacturer protocol.
• Initiate the assay run.
1. Result Interpretation:
• Gather the results from the automated analyzer.
• Compare results to the established reference ranges.
D. Assay for Serum Proteins:
1. Specimen Analysis:
• Equip the analyzer with serum protein assay reagents.
• Follow standardized procedures for loading samples, reagents,
and starting the assay.
• Record the results post-assay completion.
1. Result Interpretation:
• Review and validate the results against the reference interval.
1. Quality Control
2. Daily QC:
• Use internal QC materials to check the accuracy of the analytical
system.
• QC specimens should be run at the beginning of each shift or at
least once daily.
• Document and review all QC results before proceeding with the
patient specimens.
1. Troubleshooting QC Failures:
• In case of QC outliers, repeat the QC analysis.
• If errors persist, troubleshoot the analyzer and reagents.
• Document any corrective actions.
1. Reporting Results
2. Validation:
• Ensure results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist.
• In case of critical alerts or abnormal results, notify the appropriate
personnel as per lab policy.
1. Documentation:
• Results must be accurately recorded in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Ensure all data entries are complete with proper patient
identification and test details.
1. Reference Intervals:
• PEAR: Lab-specific range.
• IgE: 0-100 IU/mL (specific reference based on lab calibration).
• Serum Proteins: 6-8 g/dL.
1. Documentation and References
2. Maintain Records:
• Keep detailed documentation of all procedures, results, and QC
logs.
• Records should be stored in compliance with regulatory
standards.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s assay protocol inserts.
• Laboratory QC and procedural manuals.
• Relevant scientific literature and guidelines.
Review and Revision: This procedure will be reviewed annually and
updated as needed to reflect any changes in the assay protocols,
equipment, or regulatory guidelines.
