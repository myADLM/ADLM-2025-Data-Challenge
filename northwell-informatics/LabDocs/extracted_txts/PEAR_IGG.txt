Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PEAR IGG Result
Generation
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating PEAR
IGG results from patient specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable
laboratory results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
and document all analyses according to this procedure. Supervisors
must ensure compliance with SOP and address any issues arising
during the analytical phase.
2. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red or gold-top SST tube
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers (e.g., EDTA,
citrate)
• Specimens not correctly labeled with patient identification and
collection date/time
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 72 hours post-
collection without refrigeration
Specimen Storage:
• Upon receipt, store specimens at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately
• If processing is delayed beyond 72 hours, specimens must be
frozen at -20°C
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PEAR IGG ELISA kit
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Plate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Timer
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Thoroughly mix specimens and reagents by gentle inversion or
vortexing.
Assay Setup:
1. Follow the PEAR IGG ELISA kit protocol for reagent
preparation.
2. Prepare standards and controls according to the kit instructions.
Sample Analysis:
1. Apply 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient specimens to
the appropriate wells.
2. Incubate wells at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash wells three times using a plate washer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash wells three times using a plate washer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
10. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
Data Analysis:
1. Record absorbance values.
2. Generate a standard curve using absorbance values of
standards.
3. Calculate PEAR IGG concentrations of patient specimens using
the standard curve.
4. Ensure all calculations are accurate and all results are within
the acceptable range.
Troubleshooting:
1. If wells show high background absorbance, verify the washing
steps were thorough.
2. If the standard curve calibration fails, repeat analysis with fresh
standards and controls.
3. If inconsistent results are obtained, check the reagents and
equipment calibration.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Two levels of controls (Negative and Positive)
Procedure:
1. Run controls with each batch of specimens.
2. Ensure control results fall within predetermined acceptable
ranges.
3. Document control results in the Quality Control Log.
4. Investigate and resolve any control failures before reporting
patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results based on quality control data.
3. Ensure all results, including any flagged for review based on
control issues, are accurately reported.
4. Notify the ordering physician of any critical results per site-
specific guidelines.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the PEAR IGG ELISA kit insert for specific limitations
regarding reagent stability, assay sensitivity, and specificity.

Note: Changes to this protocol must be documented and approved
by the laboratory supervisor and reviewed periodically to ensure
continued accuracy and compliance with regulatory standards.
