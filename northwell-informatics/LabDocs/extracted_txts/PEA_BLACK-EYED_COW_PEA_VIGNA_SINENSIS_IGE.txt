Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PEA BLACK-EYED/COW PEA (VIGNA
SINENSIS) IGE Testing
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for PEA BLACK-EYED/COW PEA (VIGNA
SINENSIS) IgE testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The objective is
to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable measurement of IgE
levels against PEA BLACK-EYED/COW PEA allergens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all
staff to perform and document the analytical phase accurately and to
report any issues to the supervisor or manager promptly.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia™ 250 system)
• Specific IgE reagent kit for PEA BLACK-EYED/COW PEA (VIGNA
SINENSIS)
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the manufacturer
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if required)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• LaboraAnalyzer's data management software (LIS)
• Temperature monitoring device
• Humidity monitoring device
• Laboratory logbook and report forms
4. SPECIMEN
Specimen type: Serum or plasma Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL
Specimen stability: - At room temperature: Up to 24 hours -
Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours - Frozen (-20°C or lower): Up to
6 months
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens -
Specimens with contaminants or visible particulate matter -
Specimens not properly labeled or without the required patient
information - Insufficient volume of specimen
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within their
expiry date and stored appropriately.
2. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is properly calibrated using
the specific calibrators provided by the reagent kit
manufacturer.
3. Perform a daily auto-calibration of the immunoassay analyzer
as required.
4. Check the room temperature and humidity and log the values
as required.
B. Specimen Processing
1. Centrifuge the specimens at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum/plasma.
2. Label the specimen aliquots with patient identifiers and use
appropriate containers.
3. Load specimens onto the analyzer according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Prepare and load controls and calibrators according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to set up the PEA
BLACK-EYED/COW PEA IgE test on the analyzer.
2. Initiate the assay run:
◦ Ensure the analyzer’s settings (e.g., sample volumes,
incubation times) are accurate as specified in the reagent kit
insert.
3. Monitor the assay’s progress and ensure there are no
interruptions or errors.
4. Upon completion of the assay, review the analyzer’s generated
data for any flagged results which might indicate errors or
invalid results.
D. Result Analysis
1. Ensure proper validation of controls:
◦ Verify that control values are within acceptable ranges.
◦ Troubleshoot any out-of-range control values and repeat the
assay if necessary.
2. Analyze patient results:
◦ Compare the patient IgE results for PEA BLACK-EYED/
COW PEA against the provided reference ranges.
◦ Ensure results are consistent with expected trends and
previous results if available.
E. Documentation and Reporting
1. Document all results accurately in the laboratory logbook or the
LIS.
2. Validate and verify results before releasing them for clinical use.
3. Report results according to the site-specific reporting
guidelines.
4. Communicate any critical or abnormal findings to the requesting
healthcare provider in accordance with established laboratory
policies.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
- Perform quality control with each assay run using positive and negative controls.
- Participate in external proficiency testing as required.
- Maintain records of all quality control and proficiency testing results for review.
