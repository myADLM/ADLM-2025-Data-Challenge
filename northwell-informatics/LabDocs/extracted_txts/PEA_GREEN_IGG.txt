Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PEA GREEN IGG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for PEA GREEN IgG testing in
order to ensure accuracy, precision, and validity of the test results.
Responsibility: • Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing and documenting the analytical procedures as defined in
this SOP. • It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
review and ensure the quality of the test results. • All laboratory staff
must be vigilant for any discrepancies or issues during testing and
report them immediately to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
PEA (Prenatal Early Aspirate) GREEN IgG is an immunoglobulin G
(IgG) test used to measure IgG levels in prenatal samples. This test
is typically performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).
1. PROCEDURE
a. Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure that the specimens have been correctly collected, received,
and accessioned prior to proceeding with the test. • Samples must be
transported and stored as per the laboratory’s specimen handling
protocol, ideally at 2-8°C. • Allow samples to reach room temperature
(20-26°C) before testing.
b. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA Microplate Reader • Pipettes (single and multi-channel) •
Microplate washer • Timer • Vortex mixer • Disposable gloves, lab
coat, and safety glasses • PEA GREEN IgG ELISA Kit (includes
coated microplates, standards, controls, washing buffer, substrate,
and stop solution)
c. Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation: • Remove all reagents, microplates, and
specimens from the refrigerator and allow them to reach room
temperature. • Prepare the wash buffer and all other reagents
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Microplate Setup: • Designate wells for standards, controls,
and patient samples. • Add 100 µL of standards and controls to
the appropriate wells in duplicate. • Add 100 µL of each patient
sample to the designated wells.
3. Incubation: • Incubate the microplate for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Ensure the microplate is covered to avoid
evaporation.
4. Washing: • Wash the microplate four times using the
microplate washer. Ensure proper washing to remove unbound
substances.
5. Detection Antibody: • Add 100 µL of detection antibody to
each well. • Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Substrate Addition: • Wash the microplate three more times. •
Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. • Incubate for 15
minutes at room temperature in the dark.
7. Stopping Reaction: • Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
The color will change from blue to yellow.
8. Reading the Microplate: • Read the absorbance using a
microplate reader set to a wavelength of 450 nm within 30
minutes of adding the stop solution.
d. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate standards,
controls, and patient samples. • Use the standard curve to determine
the concentration of IgG in patient samples. • Validate the results
based on control values falling within the specified range. • Document
and verify the results.
e. Quality Control:
• Perform QC tests using negative and positive control materials with
each assay run. • Results outside the acceptable QC range must
prompt review and troubleshooting. • Record all QC data and take
corrective actions if needed. • Follow internal SOP for managing QC
failures and reporting any deviations.
f. Reporting Results:
• Report the IgG concentration results as per the site-specific
guidelines and ensure timely delivery to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider. • In the presence of any critical results or
abnormal findings, adhere to the established critical value reporting
procedure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges for PEA GREEN IgG levels should be derived
from the product insert of the PEA GREEN IgG ELISA kit, typically
reported in mg/dL or IU/mL. • Reference values may vary depending
on the study population and kit used.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the PEA GREEN IgG ELISA Kit insert for specific
limitations. • Ensure strict adherence to incubation times and
temperatures as deviations may affect the accuracy and precision of
the results.
