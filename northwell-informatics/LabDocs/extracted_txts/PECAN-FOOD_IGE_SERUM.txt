Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PECAN-FOOD, IGE,
SERUM Analysis
1. TITLE PECAN-FOOD, IGE, SERUM Analysis Procedure
2. PURPOSE To provide a standardized, reliable, and accurate
method for the analysis of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
antibodies in patient serum specific to PECAN-FOOD allergens.
3. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the PECAN-FOOD, IGE, SERUM test in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
4. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel trained in and
authorized to perform serum IgE analysis specific to PECAN-
FOOD must adhere to this SOP to ensure test accuracy and
consistency.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 5.1 Specimen Type:
• Serum
5.2 Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood specimens using standard phlebotomy techniques.
• Preferable collection tube: Serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen to separate the serum (typically at
1300-2000 RCF for 10-15 minutes).
• Transfer the serum to a properly labeled, clean tube if the analysis
is not performed immediately.
• Store the serum sample at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For extended storage, freeze the serum at -20°C
or colder.
5.3 Unacceptable Conditions:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens in tubes other than SSTs or without proper labeling.
• Specimens not stored at proper temperatures before analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS 6.1 Equipment:
• Calibrated ELISA reader or other IgE-specific assay analyzers.
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
6.2 Reagents:
• PECAN-FOOD specific IgE testing kits (including controls and
calibrators).
• Appropriate ELISA reagents (buffers, substrates, etc.).
• Quality control materials (low and high IgE controls).
1. PROCEDURE 7.1 Calibration:
• Calibrate the ELISA reader or assay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions before running tests.
7.2 Preparation:
• Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before starting the assay.
• Thoroughly mix all samples and controls before use.
7.3 Testing: 7.3.1 Standard Assay Procedure:
• Pipette a defined volume of Calibrators, Controls, and patient
serum samples into designated wells of the microplate.
• Add PECAN-FOOD specific IgE reagent to each well.
• Incubate the plate as instructed (usually 1 hour at 37°C).
• Wash the plate with wash buffer for specified cycles to remove
unbound substances.
• Add enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies to each well.
• Incubate as specified (usually 30 minutes at room temperature).
• Perform subsequent wash steps to remove unbound conjugate.
• Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the time
recommended.
• Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
calibrated ELISA reader.
7.3.2 Automated Assay Procedure:
• Use the automated immunoassay analyzer following the
manufacturer's instructions for PECAN-FOOD specific IgE testing.
• Load the serum samples, controls, and calibrators into the
designated racks.
• Ensure that reagents are correctly loaded and sufficient for the
number of tests.
• Run the automated assay using the appropriate software analysis
program.
7.4 Quality Control:
• Ensure that quality control materials (positive and negative
controls) are included with each batch of samples tested.
• Control values must be within the acceptable range provided by
the manufacturer to validate the assay run.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Compare patient samples' optical density (OD) results to the
established calibration curve to determine IgE concentration.
• Report results in kapp/L or according to laboratory-specific
reporting units for IgE.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If assay run fails to meet control parameters, repeat the test after
verifying the integrity of reagents and the proper function of
equipment.
• If repeated issues are encountered, contact the on-call supervisor
or technical support for further instructions.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow universal precautions to handle human specimens,
employing gloves and lab coats.
• Dispose of biohazardous materials properly as per laboratory
safety guidelines.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Document all patient results, quality control data, and
maintenance logs for assay equipment per laboratory
accreditation requirements and guidelines.
• Maintain records for a minimum specified duration as outlined by
laboratory policy and regulatory entities.
