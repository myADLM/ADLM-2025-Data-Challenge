Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analysis of PECAN
FOOD IGG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of PECAN FOOD IGG in patient specimens, ensuring the accurate,
reliable, and timely reporting of results. This SOP applies to all
laboratory personnel responsible for performing PECAN FOOD IGG
assays.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
PECAN FOOD IGG analysis according to this SOP. Supervisors must
ensure that staff are adequately trained and compliant with these
procedures. All personnel must identify and report any deficiencies or
deviations from the SOP to their supervisor immediately.
3. DEFINITION AND SCOPE
PECAN FOOD IGG assays measure the level of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibodies against pecan in patient serum or plasma. These
tests are used to assess potential allergic responses to pecan.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PECAN FOOD IGG assay kits
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrated micropipettes (variable volumes as required by assay
protocol)
• Test tubes or microcentrifuge tubes
• Specimen collection tubes (serum or plasma)
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Incubators
• Reagent reservoirs
• Calibrated timers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube. Plasma collected in EDTA or
heparinized tubes can also be used.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples,
or specimens collected in sodium fluoride/oxalate tubes.
• Stability: Serum and plasma specimens should be stored at 2-8°C
if analyzed within 7 days. For longer storage, specimens should
be frozen at -20°C or colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents
1. Reconstitute and prepare all reagents, calibration standards,
and controls as specified in the PECAN FOOD IGG assay kit
insert.
2. Equilibrate reagents to room temperature prior to use.
B. Specimen Preparation
1. Allow serum or plasma specimens to clot (if applicable) and
centrifuge to separate the clear supernatant.
2. Aliquot specimens into appropriately labeled test tubes or
microcentrifuge tubes for analysis.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Ensure all equipment and supplies are prepared according to
the PECAN FOOD IGG assay kit instructions.
2. Pipette specified volumes of specimens, standards, and
controls into designated wells of the microplate, according to
the assay protocol.
3. Add corresponding reagents to each well as directed by the
assay protocol, ensuring accurate and complete mixing.
4. Incubate the microplate for the specified time and at the
specified temperature as outlined in the assay protocol.
5. Wash the microplate wells according to the assay protocol,
ensuring complete removal of wash solution after each wash
cycle.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
instructed duration.
7. Terminate the reaction by adding the stop solution as per the
protocol.
8. Read the absorbance of each well at the specified wavelength
using a calibrated microplate reader.
D. Quality Control (QC)
1. Run quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
with each assay batch.
2. Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range
established by the assay kit manufacturer.
3. Document all QC results along with patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Analyze and interpret the optical density (OD) readings of the
patient specimens against the calibration curve generated from
the standards.
2. Generate patient reports, documenting PECAN FOOD IGG
levels along with reference ranges provided by the assay kit
manufacturer.
3. Review all results and QC data for accuracy before verification.
4. Report verified results electronically or via designated reporting
systems as per laboratory guidelines.
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND CRITICAL VALUES
1. Inspect all specimens for integrity issues (e.g., hemolysis)
before analysis. If specimen integrity is questionable, perform
necessary checks or reject specimens accordingly.
2. Critical values should be reported promptly to the requesting
physician or clinical team following established laboratory
protocols for notification of critical results.
