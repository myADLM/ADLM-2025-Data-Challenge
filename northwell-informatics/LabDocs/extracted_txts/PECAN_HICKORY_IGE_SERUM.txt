PECAN HICKORY, IGE, SERUM SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase for generating results for PECAN
HICKORY, IGE, SERUM, ensuring accuracy, precision, and reliability.
This SOP includes step-by-step procedures from preparing reagents,
calibrating equipment, performing the assay, through result reporting.
Responsibility
Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting the
analysis as specified in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process, ensuring compliance, and managing any
corrective actions if necessary.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: collected in a red top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen should be refrigerated if not processed immediately
and analyzed within 7 days, or frozen for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or turbid serum samples.
• Serum not stored as specified, leading to degradation.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• PECAN HICKORY, IGE, SERUM assay kit.
• Controls: Negative and positive controls supplied with the assay
kit.
• Calibrators: Provided with assay kit.
• Refrigerator and freezer for specimen storage.
• PPE: lab coat, gloves, face shield or goggles.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to come to room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare reagents, controls, and calibrators according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify that the analyzer or ELISA reader is properly calibrated.
Assay Procedure:
1. Labeling: Ensure all samples, controls, and calibrators are
properly labeled.
2. Sample Preparation: Centrifuge serum samples at 1500 RPM
for 10 minutes to separate serum from cells. Only clear, non-
turbid serum should be used for analysis.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and
samples into designated wells of the assay plate or load
them into the appropriate positions in the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Follow the specific assay kit protocol for incubation and
washing steps.
4. Incubation and Detection:
◦ Incubate the assay plate at the specified temperature and
duration as per the kit instructions.
◦ After incubation, conduct the washing steps thoroughly to
minimize nonspecific binding.
◦ Add the detection reagent, such as HRP-conjugated
antibody, and incubate accordingly.
5. Reading and Analysis:
◦ After the final incubation step, add the substrate solution
and allow color development.
◦ Measure optical density (OD) using the ELISA reader or
automated immunoassay analyzer.
◦ The analyzer should display the results and provide a
quantitative measurement of PECAN HICKORY, IGE in IU/
mL.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
Quality Control:
1. Run negative and positive controls with each batch of samples.
2. Document control results to ensure they are within the
acceptable range specified by the assay kit.
3. If controls are out of range, do not report patient results and
troubleshoot the assay as per the kit instructions and laboratory
policies.
Calibration:
1. Calibrate the instrument with the provided calibrators following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Document calibration data.
3. Recalibrate using new calibrators when indicated by the kit
instructions or after specified time intervals or usage.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all quality control data before reporting patient
results.
• Compare patient results against the reference values provided by
the manufacturer.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) or
report manually as per laboratory protocol.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert for PECAN HICKORY, IGE,
SERUM.
• Relevant laboratory quality management documentation.
• Internal laboratory SOPs on equipment maintenance and quality
control procedures.
8. DOCUMENTATION
Document all steps including sample receipt, assay conditions,
calibration, quality control outcomes, and result verification. Ensure
all logs are up to date and properly filed.
This protocol ensures comprehensive and precise measurements of
PECAN HICKORY, IGE, SERUM to guarantee reliable patient results,
following stringent quality controls and standard laboratory practices.
