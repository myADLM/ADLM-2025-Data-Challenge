Standard Operating Procedure: PEDIATRIC ALLERGY SCREEN (3
TO 8 YEARS), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the procedure for
performing a Pediatric Allergy Screen for children aged 3 to 8 years
using serum specimens. The procedure ensures accurate and
reliable test results for effective clinical diagnosis and patient
management.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff members are responsible
for performing the Pediatric Allergy Screen following this procedure. It
is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence
to this protocol and address any discrepancies or issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: 5-10 mL blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube.
• Serum should be separated from the clot by centrifugation within
2 hours of collection.
Specimen Handling and Transport:
• Allow collected blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60
minutes before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
• Aliquot serum into a clean, labeled polypropylene tube if it is not
stored or tested immediately.
• Serum samples are stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C. If longer
storage is required, freeze aliquoted serum at -20°C or lower.
Specimen Rejection:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Samples with missing or inadequate labeling.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Allergen-specific IgE kits (as per manufacturer instructions)
• Calibrators and controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Clean polypropylene tubes for aliquoting
• Incubator (if required by the assay)
• Plate reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
• Disposable gloves and laboratory coat
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
• Run quality control materials (low, high, and negative)
concurrently with patient samples to ensure assay performance.
• Use the manufacturer's QC materials or laboratory-validated
alternatives.
Quality Control Procedure:
• Follow manufacturer instructions for reconstituting and handling
QC materials.
• QC samples should fall within the established ranges for
absorption or concentration.
• Document all QC results, and review them for trends or shifts
before reporting patient results.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Review the test requisition and ensure the specimen meets
the collection and acceptance criteria.
◦ Label reaction wells or tubes appropriately for patient
samples, calibrators, and controls.
3. Assay Setup and Calibration:
◦ Set up the Allergy Screen assay following the kit
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls as indicated in
the kit package insert.
4. Sample Processing:
◦ Pipette the specified volume of each patient serum sample,
calibrator, and control into the designated wells or tubes.
◦ Follow specific steps for incubation times, temperatures,
and washing as described in the assay protocol.
5. Detection and Measurement:
◦ After completing the assay procedure, measure the
absorbance (or other specified signal) using a plate reader
or analyzer.
◦ Ensure that all patient, calibrator, and control signals are
appropriately documented.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Calculation:
• Calculate patient results based on the guidelines provided by the
kit manufacturer.
• Ensure calibrators generate an appropriate standard curve with
acceptable fit criteria.
Result Validation and Verification:
• Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before patient
data validation.
• Compare patient results with historical patient data and clinical
expectation for consistency.
Result Reporting:
• Enter validated patient results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• For results beyond instrument-calculated ranges, report with
appropriate comments indicating > or < values based on
observed readings.
Critical Results:
• Follow laboratory policy for notifying clinicians of critically
significant results, documenting communication details in the
patient’s record.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Certain medications, patient conditions, or improper specimen
handling may affect results.
• Reference the manufacturer's package insert for analyte-specific
limitations and potential cross-reactivity.
