Standard Operating Procedure Pediatric Allergy Screen < 3 Years,
Serum
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedures for the analytical phase
of generating results for Pediatric Allergy Screen for patients
under 3 years of age using serum specimens.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected from a blood draw.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL.
• Specimen must be transported to the laboratory immediately after
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient ID, collection date,
and time.
• Specimens not stored or transported at 2-8°C within 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Laboratory centrifuge.
• Allergy testing assay kit (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia, or
equivalent).
• Serum aliquot tubes.
• Calibrators and quality controls specific for the assay kit.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Reagent storage as per manufacturer’s instructions.
1. PROCEDURE: A. Specimen Processing:
2. Upon receipt, confirm that the specimen meets the acceptance
criteria.
3. Centrifuge blood samples at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
4. Aliquot the serum into labeled tubes.
5. Store serum aliquots at 2-8°C until analysis, if analysis is not
performed immediately.
B. Assay Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
(15-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Mix all reagents gently by inverting before use.
3. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls as directed
by the assay kit manufacturer.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Follow manufacturer’s protocol for the specific allergy screening
assay being used.
2. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into the appropriate assay wells.
3. Ensure proper incubation times and temperature as specified in
the assay protocol.
4. Detect and measure analytes using the appropriate instrument
(e.g., ELISA reader).
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Evaluate the calibration curve, ensuring it meets the
acceptance criteria before interpreting patient results.
2. Compare patient sample absorbance readings to the calibration
curve to determine specific IgE concentration.
3. Ensure that quality control results fall within the acceptable
range; if not, troubleshoot or rerun the assay before reporting
patient results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
5. Run quality controls with each batch of patient samples to
ensure assay reliability.
6. Record and verify quality control outcomes.
7. Follow corrective actions as defined if controls outside of
acceptable range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
9. Document all raw data and calculations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
10. Review and verify results for any critical values; ensure they are
communicated to the clinical team following standard critical
result reporting protocols.
11. Maintain confidentiality and accuracy in recording and reporting
results.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Specific IgE levels are interpreted according to the specified
ranges in the allergy assay manufacturer’s instructions.
• Reference values may vary, so refer to the assay kit insert for
age-specific reference intervals.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the assay kit instruction insert for detailed limitations.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and improper sample handling can affect test
outcomes and lead to erroneous results.

• Phadia/ImmunoCAP Allergy Testing Product Insert.
• Laboratory’s internal Quality Control and Assurance protocols.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the test according to this SOP and maintain quality and
accuracy.
• Supervisors must ensure adherence to the SOP and address any
issues related to testing quality and patient results.
By adhering to this SOP, we ensure the accuracy, reliability, and
timeliness of Pediatric Allergy Screen results for patients under 3
years, contributing to effective clinical management and patient care.
