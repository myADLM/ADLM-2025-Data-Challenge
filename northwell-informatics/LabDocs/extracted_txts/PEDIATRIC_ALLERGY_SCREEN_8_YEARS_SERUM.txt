Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Pediatric Allergy
Screen (>8 Years), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for Pediatric Allergy Screen
for children older than 8 years using serum specimens. This
procedure defines the steps involved in processing and analyzing the
serum for allergy screening, including specific responsibilities,
equipment, and protocols.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for processing, handling,
and analyzing the serum specimens according to the outlined
procedure.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Overseeing that the procedures are
correctly followed and any outliers or peculiar findings are
appropriately handled and documented.
• Quality Control Personnel: Ensuring all equipment is duly
calibrated and maintained. Responsible for executing and
documenting quality control measures.
3. DEFINITION
Pediatric Allergy Screening entails detecting specific IgE antibodies in
the serum to identify allergens causing allergic reactions in children
older than 8 years.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type
• Serum
Collection Container
• Red top tube or serum separator tube (SST)
Volume
• Minimum: 1 mL
• Ideal: 2-3 mL
Stability and Handling
• Specimen should be delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection.
• The serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days if processing is
delayed.
• If storage longer than 7 days is anticipated, freeze the serum at
-20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
• Incubator (37°C)
• ELISA Reader or corresponding analytical instrumentation
specific to the allergy screen used
• Specific allergen panels/reagent kits (as per manufacturer’s
guidelines)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microplates
• Calibrators and Controls
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Allow the whole blood collected in SST or red-top tube to
clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1300-2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
◦ Using a pipette, transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately
labeled tube.
2. Storage:
◦ Store the serum at 2-8°C if the analysis is to be performed
within 7 days.
◦ For long-term storage beyond 7 days, freeze serum at
-20°C.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, serum specimens, and calibrators to
room temperature before testing.
◦ Set up the ELISA reader or appropriate instrumentation as
per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Plate and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow specific manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the
microplates and reagents, including washing and blocking
procedures if applicable.
3. Assay Execution:
◦ Add specific volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples to the appropriate wells.
◦ Add the allergen-specific reagent (as provided in the test kit)
to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C as specified (typically
between 30-60 minutes).
◦ Wash microplate with the provided washing solution to
remove unbound substances.
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate, protecting
from light if required.
◦ Add stop solution to terminate the reaction at the specified
time.
4. Reading and Analysis:
◦ Read the absorbance or signal using the ELISA reader at
the designated wavelength.
◦ Analyze data and compare with calibrators and controls to
determine the presence and concentration of specific IgE
antibodies.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC:
◦ Run internal controls (positive and negative) with each batch
of specimens.
◦ Any out-of-range controls indicate a need for troubleshooting
and potential re-analysis of patient samples.
• Instrument Calibration:
◦ Perform routine calibration checks for the ELISA reader or
other analytical instruments per manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Document all calibration and maintenance activities.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results before reporting.
• Compare patient results to reference ranges for pediatric
allergies.
• Note any significant or critical findings and follow up as per
laboratory protocols by contacting the clinician.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for the specific
allergy screening kit used.
• Laboratory's internal guidelines for specimen handling and
processing.
• Guidelines from regulatory bodies, such as CLIA, on allergy
testing and result interpretation.
