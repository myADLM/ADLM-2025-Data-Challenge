Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Pediatric
Autoimmune Encephalopathy/CNS Disorder Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the
analytical phase of testing for pediatric autoimmune
encephalopathy/CNS disorder evaluation using serum
specimens. This procedure ensures accurate and consistent
results for evaluating and diagnosing CNS disorders in pediatric
patients.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen:
▪ 5 mL serum from a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
▪ Ensure complete clotting of the specimen before
centrifugation.
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Refrigerated: Stable for up to 72 hours.
▪ Frozen: Stable for up to 1 month at -20°C or colder.
▪ Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles to prevent
degradation of analytes.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits specific
for the detection of relevant autoantibodies (e.g., NMDA
receptor antibodies, VGKC complex antibodies, GAD65
antibodies).
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Microplate reader
◦ Incubator
◦ Distilled water
◦ Buffer solutions as specified in ELISA kit instructions
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation: 1. Allow collected blood to clot at room
temperature for 30 minutes. 2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500
x g for 10 minutes to separate serum. 3. Carefully transfer the
serum to a labeled aliquot tube without disturbing the cellular
layer. 4. Store serum at 4°C if analysis will be performed within
72 hours, or freeze at -20°C if analysis will be delayed.
B. Equipment Calibration: 1. Ensure all equipment, including
pipettes and microplate reader, is calibrated according to
manufacturer instructions. 2. Verify calibration using calibration
kits and maintain records for quality control purposes.
C. Detection of Autoantibodies: 1. Follow the specific ELISA
kit protocol for each autoantibody target: - Thaw serum aliquots
at room temperature if frozen. - Dilute serum samples if
necessary as per the kit instructions. - Add the appropriate
amount of serum to the wells in the ELISA plate. - Incubate the
plate at the specified temperature and duration according to the
kit instructions. - Perform washing steps as indicated in the kit
instructions to remove unbound components. - Add detection
antibodies and incubate as described in the protocol. - Add the
substrate solution and allow for color development. - Stop the
reaction after the specified time by adding stop solution.
D. Reading and Interpretation: 1. Measure the absorbance of
the wells using a microplate reader at the wavelength specified
by the ELISA kit. 2. Calculate the concentration of
autoantibodies based on the standard curve provided with the
ELISA kit. 3. Verify that results fall within the acceptable range
for quality control samples.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to verify the accuracy of the assay.
◦ Record and review control results to ensure they fall within
the established ranges.
◦ Any deviation from the control range requires a review of the
assay procedure and possible repeat testing.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Calculate the final concentration of autoantibodies in the
serum samples using the established standard curves.
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring all values are reviewed and verified by a
qualified technologist.
◦ Report critically high or abnormal results to the requesting
physician immediately as per the laboratory protocol.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Refer to the specific ELISA kit insert for reference values
pertinent to each autoantibody being tested.
◦ Critical values should be flagged in the LIS and must follow
the laboratory's policy for critical value reporting.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with
the assay and may require repeat testing.
◦ Ensure serum is free from particulate matter and thoroughly
separated to avoid false results.
◦ Refer to each ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related
to the detection of respective autoantibodies.
