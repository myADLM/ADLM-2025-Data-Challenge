Sure, here's a draft of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
the analytical phase of generating results for Pediatric Autoimmune
Encephalopathy/CNS Disorder Evaluation in spinal fluid:
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for analyzing spinal fluid (CSF) specimens
for Pediatric Autoimmune Encephalopathy/CNS Disorder Evaluation,
ensuring the generation of accurate, precise, and reproducible results
that can aid in clinical diagnosis and treatment.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel responsible for the analysis
of pediatric spinal fluid specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory
setting.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Technologists: Perform the analytical procedures and ensure the
quality and accuracy of the results.
• Supervisors: Oversee the analytical process, review results, and
ensure compliance with SOPs.
• Quality Assurance (QA): Monitor quality control procedures and
maintain records of instrument calibration and maintenance.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL, preferably 3 mL
• Collection: Collected via lumbar puncture in a sterile container
• Transport: Transport to the laboratory immediately on ice
• Storage: Store at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed; avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Capillary electrophoresis instrument or alternate approved
detection system
• Automated immunoassay analyzers
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• CSF collection tubes
• Reagents and controls specific to the assays
• Calibration standards
1. REAGENTS
• Ensure all reagents are within the expiration date and stored as
per manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Prepare reagents and controls according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge CSF samples at 1500 RCF for 10 minutes to
remove any cellular debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled tube.
2. Storage:
◦ If immediate analysis is not possible, store the prepared
sample at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours or freeze at -20°C or
lower for longer storage.
B) Assay Setup
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform instrument calibration using the provided standards
before running patient samples. Record calibration data.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality control (QC) samples at the beginning
of each shift/batch and after instrument maintenance.
◦ Compare QC results to acceptable ranges provided by the
manufacturer. Document any deviations and take
appropriate corrective actions.
C) Assay Performance
1. Capillary Electrophoresis Methodology:
◦ Load the CSF samples and internal controls into the
capillary electrophoresis instrument.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for settings and
operation.
◦ After the run, review electropherograms for abnormal
protein patterns indicative of autoimmune encephalopathy/
CNS disorders.
2. Immunoassay Methodology:
◦ Load CSF specimens and controls into the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Perform tests for relevant autoimmune markers such as
anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, anti-VGKC complex
antibodies, etc.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol strictly for operation and
timing.
◦ Collect and analyze data generated by the instrument.
D) Result Interpretation
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Review assay data for quality control acceptance criteria.
Document all observations and outcomes.
◦ Interrogate the sample results and interpret against
established reference ranges or literature norms.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure all data entries are verified by another technologist
or supervisor before release.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Implement bi-weekly and monthly QC protocols to assess
continuity in test performance.
◦ Track QC results and maintain records. Address QC failures
immediately.
• Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs regularly. Review
and act upon the results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and Verification:
◦ Technologists should carefully review all results. Supervisors
must verify results before they are released to ensure
accuracy.
• Transmitting Results:
◦ Transmit verified results to the requestor or electronic medical
record system following lab reporting protocols.
• Critical Values:
◦ Report any critical findings immediately to the treating
physician as per the established protocol.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Daily/Weekly Maintenance:
◦ Perform daily and weekly maintenance of instruments
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Document maintenance activities and findings.
• Calibration and Validation:
◦ Regularly calibrate all instruments and validate new reagent
lots.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the instrument manual and internal SOPs for
troubleshooting common issues.
• Document any deviations from standard operations and the
corrective actions taken.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manual and package inserts for all reagents and
instruments.
• Current literature on pediatric autoimmune encephalopathy/CNS
disorder evaluation.
• Laboratory's quality control and safety manuals.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain complete records of specimen processing, QC results,
instrument calibration, maintenance logs, and report generation.
• Adhere to all regulatory requirements for data retention.
This SOP ensures that spinal fluid specimens are processed
consistently and accurately, enabling reliable clinical diagnosis and
treatment of pediatric autoimmune encephalopathy and CNS
disorders.
