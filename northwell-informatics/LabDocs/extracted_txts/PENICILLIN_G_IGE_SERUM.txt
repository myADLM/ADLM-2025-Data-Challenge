Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Penicillin G, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides a detailed methodology for the analysis of
Penicillin G specific IgE in serum samples, from sample acceptance
to result generation. This includes steps to ensure accuracy,
reproducibility, and proper documentation in line with regulatory
requirements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the analysis of
Penicillin G specific IgE in serum using the specified immunoassay
method.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel must follow this procedure. It is
the responsibility of the lead technologist and supervisor to ensure
that all staff are adequately trained and adhere strictly to this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Penicillin G specific IgE: Immunoglobulin E antibodies specific
to Penicillin G.
• Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid portion of blood that remains
after coagulation. It is devoid of cells and fibrinogen.
• Immunoassay: A laboratory technique that uses the binding of
antibodies to antigens to identify and quantify specific proteins or
molecules.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Penicillin G-specific IgE assay kit
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the assay kit
manufacturer
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Incubator (if required by assay)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Sample Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood must be collected in SST tubes. After
collection, allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then
centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
• Storage:
◦ Fresh serum: Analyze within 48 hours if stored at 2-8°C.
◦ For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be avoided.
◦ Samples that have been sitting at room temperature for more
than 2 hours.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run low, medium, and high controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Ensure controls fall within the specified range on the assay
insert before proceeding with sample analysis.
• External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs and inter-laboratory
comparisons as required.
• Documentation:
◦ Record lot numbers, expiration dates of reagents, calibrators,
and controls.
◦ Document all control results and review according to
laboratory’s QC protocol.
8. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to warm up
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure that all reagents are equilibrated to room
temperature before use.
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration as per the assay kit instructions.
◦ Record calibration data in the LIS.
3. Sample Loading:
◦ Load patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto
the sample rack.
◦ Ensure sample identifiers correspond correctly with entries
in the LIS.
4. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay run according to the immunoassay
analyzer’s operating manual.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any errors or alerts during the run.
5. Post-Analysis:
◦ Ensure that all samples have been processed.
◦ Print and upload the results to the LIS.
◦ Review the results for any flags or discrepancies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed by
the technologist before final release.
◦ If results are flagged or outside the reportable range,
investigate, repeat analysis if necessary.
◦ Critical results must be communicated to the medical
personnel according to the laboratory's policy for critical value
reporting.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In case of instrument malfunction, refer to the analyzer’s
troubleshooting guide and perform necessary corrective actions.
• If quality control fails, do not report patient results until the issue is
resolved.
◦ Repeat the QC run.
◦ If problem persists, report to the supervisor and arrange for
instrument servicing if required.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs for the temperature of storage units, equipment
maintenance, calibration, and quality control.
• Records of all performed tests must include date, batch number of
reagents, controls, and calibrator results.
