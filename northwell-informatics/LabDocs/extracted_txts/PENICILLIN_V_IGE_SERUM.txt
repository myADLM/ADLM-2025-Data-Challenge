Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Penicillin V IgE,
Serum
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized protocol for the analysis of
Penicillin V IgE in serum samples to ensure consistency, accuracy,
and reliability of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the determination of Penicillin V IgE
concentrations in serum samples in a clinical laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to follow this SOP accurately
and ensure the quality and integrity of results. Supervisory staff are
responsible for overseeing the procedure and ensuring all steps are
followed correctly.
4. DEFINITIONS Penicillin V IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to
Penicillin V, an antibody associated with allergic reactions to
Penicillin.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
- Immunoassay Analyzer (ELISA, CLIA or other designated equipment)
- Calibrators and Controls specific to Penicillin V IgE
- Test reagent kits (for Penicillin V IgE)
- Micropipettes and tips
- Microcentrifuge
- Sample vials and labels
- Deionized water
- Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
5.2 Pre-Analysis Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are from current and not
expired.
2. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
unless otherwise specified by the reagent kit’s instructions.
3. Label all samples, controls, and calibrators appropriately.
4. Set up the equipment according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
5.3 Test Procedure
Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge all serum samples at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
2. Transfer clear supernatant to a clean vial for analysis.
Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare reagents, including washing solutions, substrate
solutions, and stopping solutions, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions included in the kit.
2. Reconstitute calibrators and controls following kit instructions.
Assay Procedure
1. Add calibrators, controls, and serum samples in duplicate into
the appropriate wells of the microplate.
2. Add the prepared assay buffer and Penicillin V reagents into
each well as per kit instructions.
3. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time as per
the assay procedure.
4. After incubation, wash the plate using the washing solution, and
repeat the washing step as required by the kit instructions.
5. Add the detection antibody to each well and incubate as
instructed by the kit.
6. Wash the plate again post-incubation.
7. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time ensuring the development of color.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well.
9. Read the microplate absorbance using the plate reader at the
specified wavelength.
5.4 Data Analysis
1. Calculate the mean absorbance values for each set of duplicate
wells for calibrators, controls, and serum samples.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
values of the calibrators against their known concentrations.
3. Determine the concentration of Penicillin V IgE in the serum
samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
4. Ensure all controls are within the acceptable range before
validating sample results.
5. Record all results, ensuring all calculations and interpolations
are done correctly.
5.5 Quality Control
1. Include quality control samples with each run and ensure they
fall within the specified ranges.
2. If controls do not meet acceptance criteria, reject the run and
troubleshoot before repeating the assay.
3. Document all actions taken, including any required
troubleshooting steps.
5.6 Reporting Results
1. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS) only if
quality control criteria are met.
2. Notify the relevant healthcare provider of any critical or
unexpected results following laboratory policies.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for any specific limitations
regarding the assay, such as cross-reactivity, interfering substances,
or lower limit of detection.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Handle all serum samples with caution, assuming them to be
potentially infectious.
2. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment at all times
while performing the assay.
3. Follow laboratory waste disposal regulations for biohazard
materials.
8. REFERENCES
Include all references to manufacturer’s kit inserts and relevant
guidelines.
9. DOCUMENTATION
A complete and accurate log of all assays performed, including
controls and calibrations run, should be maintained in the laboratory’s
record-keeping system.
Ensure that this protocol is reviewed and updated regularly, reflecting
any changes in methodology, equipment, or reagent suppliers.
