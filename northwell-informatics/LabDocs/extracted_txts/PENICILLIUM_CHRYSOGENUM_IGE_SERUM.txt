Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Penicillium Chrysogenum, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol aims to provide standardized procedures for the
analytical phase of measuring Penicillium Chrysogenum-specific IgE
levels in serum, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedure as outlined and documenting the results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring accuracy, overseeing
corrective actions if necessary, and verifying the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 5 mL of venous blood collected in an SST (Serum Separator
Tube).
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen to separate serum within 2 hours of
collection.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or other anticoagulant
tubes.
◦ Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
◦ Specimens that have been at room temperature for more than
2 hours before centrifugation.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250, ImmunoCAP 1000,
or equivalent).
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips.
◦ Refrigerator and Freezer (for reagent and specimen storage
as required).
• Reagents:
◦ Allergen-specific IgE reagents for Penicillium Chrysogenum
(stored and used according to manufacturer’s instructions).
◦ Calibrators.
◦ Control sera (High, Medium, Low).
• Supplies:
◦ Serum Separator Tubes (SST).
◦ Reaction vessels.
◦ Sample cups.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and maintained.
• Confirm that all reagents and supplies are not expired and are
stored appropriately.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
◦ Mix the samples gently without causing hemolysis.
◦ For refrigerated samples, allow them to reach room
temperature before assay.
2. Assay Set-up:
◦ Load the immunoassay analyzer with required reagents,
controls, and calibrators as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Program the instrument according to the specific protocol for
Penicillium Chrysogenum, IgE.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Load the separated serum samples into the sample cups or
directly into the analyzer, depending on the system in use.
◦ Start the assay run ensuring all necessary steps for
incubation, washing, and signal detection per the instrument
and reagent manufacturer’s instructions are followed.
C. Quality Control:
• Run control sera (High, Medium, Low) with each batch of samples
to ensure assay validity.
• Document the control results and ensure they fall within the
established ranges.
• If controls are out of range, do not report patient results; identify
and correct the issue before retesting.
1. RESULTS AND REPORTING
• Review the generated results to ensure they meet quality control
criteria.
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist before release.
• Examine results for any unexpected patterns or anomalies which
may indicate a need for re-analysis.
• Report results as follows:
◦ IgE Level:
▪ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative
▪ 0.35 – 0.69 kU/L: Low positive
▪ 0.70 – 3.49 kU/L: Moderate positive
▪ 3.50 – 17.49 kU/L: High positive
▪ ≥ 17.50 kU/L: Very high positive
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens may affect test results.
• Cross-reactivity with other fungi or allergens may occur; evaluate
results in conjunction with clinical findings.
• Differences in assay sensitivity between instruments may lead to
variations in results.

Appendix: Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
• Control values out of range:
◦ Recalibrate the instrument.
◦ Check reagent integrity and expiration dates.
◦ Repeat the assay with fresh controls.
◦ Document all actions taken in the quality control log.
• Instrument Errors:
◦ Refer to the instrument manual for specific error codes.
◦ Perform instrument maintenance as needed.
◦ If unresolved, contact the instrument manufacturer’s technical
support.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure reliable and
consistent results in the detection and quantification of Penicillium
Chrysogenum-specific IgE.
