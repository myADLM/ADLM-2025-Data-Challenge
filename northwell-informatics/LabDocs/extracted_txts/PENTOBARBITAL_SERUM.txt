Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generating
Results for PENTOBARBITAL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and reporting of
pentobarbital levels in serum. This SOP ensures accurate, reliable,
and timely results that assist in the therapeutic monitoring and
diagnosis of pentobarbital levels in patients.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff will be responsible for
performing the analysis, documenting results, undertaking any
necessary corrective actions, and reporting findings according to this
SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Pentobarbital: A barbiturate that is used primarily as a sedative and a
hypnotic. Serum levels of pentobarbital are monitored to ensure
therapeutic levels and to avoid toxicity.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) or GC-MS
(Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) instrument
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage
• Analytical balance
• Volumetric pipettes and micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Pentobarbital reference standard
• Mobile phase (for HPLC)
• Extraction solvents
• Calibration standards
• Internal standards
• Quality control samples
• Serum pentobarbital assay kit (if applicable)
• Deionized water
• Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen: Preferred: 5 mL venous blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) Unacceptable: Specimens received more than
72 hours after collection; hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
Preparation:
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 2000-2500 x g for 10-15 minutes.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled polypropylene tube.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours or at -20°C for
longer periods.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Calibrator Preparation:
◦ Prepare calibration standards using the pentobarbital
reference standard at varying concentrations (e.g., 1, 5, 10,
50, 100 µg/mL).
3. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze QC samples at the beginning, midpoint, and end of
each batch to ensure accuracy and reliability.
4. Sample Extraction:
◦ Pipette 1 mL of serum into a clean extraction tube.
◦ Add internal standard.
◦ Add extraction solvent, vortex for 1 minute, centrifuge at
3000 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the organic layer to a clean tube and evaporate
under nitrogen.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in mobile phase buffer (for HPLC)
or appropriate solvent (for GC-MS).
5. Instrumental Analysis:
◦ Set up the HPLC or GC-MS instrument according to
manufacturer's instructions, ensuring proper calibration.
◦ Inject aliquots of the reconstituted sample.
◦ Run a blank solvent, calibration standards, and QC
samples.
6. Data Analysis:
◦ Use software associated with the HPLC or GC-MS to
analyze chromatograms.
◦ Quantify pentobarbital concentration by comparing the
sample peak area with calibration curve.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Document results in LIS (Laboratory Information System).
◦ Review and verify for accuracy.
◦ Report pentobarbital serum levels in μg/mL.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include at least two levels of control material (low, high) with each
batch analysis.
• Document control results and take corrective actions in case of
any deviation from acceptable limits.
• Perform periodic instrument maintenance and calibration.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with analysis; ensure
the sample integrity.
• Be aware of potential drug interaction that may affect serum levels
of pentobarbital or interfere with chromatographic analysis.
• Ensure proper handling and storage of samples to prevent
degradation.

• Manufacturer’s protocol for HPLC or GC-MS.
• Relevant literature on pentobarbital serum monitoring.
• Internal laboratory procedural documents on specimen handling
and processing.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel ensures that the
testing for pentobarbital serum levels is consistent, accurate, and
reliable, thus supporting the clinical management of patients under
pentobarbital therapy.
