SOP for Pepper Bell/Paprika IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures required for
the accurate and timely analysis of Pepper Bell/Paprika IgG levels in
the laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay, documenting results, and ensuring adherence to the
procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process,
addressing deviations, and validating results.
1. DEFINITION
Pepper Bell/Paprika IgG testing measures the levels of IgG
antibodies against Pepper Bell and Paprika in patient serum.
Elevated levels of IgG may suggest a food sensitivity to these
substances.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability
1. Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum. Collect blood in a red-top (no additive) or SST
(serum separator tube).
1. Specimen Stability:
• Serum is stable for 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
1. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not properly labeled or lacking necessary patient
identification.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
1. Equipment:
• ELISA plate reader
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (37°C)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
1. Reagents:
• ELISA kit for Pepper Bell and Paprika IgG (store as per the
manufacturer's instructions)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
1. Supplies:
• ELISA plates
• Reservoirs for reagents
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
C. Testing Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge the blood collection tubes at 2000-3000 RCF for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
• Carefully pipette the serum into a labeled storage vial.
1. Assay Procedure: a. Bring all reagents and samples to room
temperature (18-25°C) before use. b. Prepare wash buffer and
other required reagents according to the ELISA kit instructions.
c. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples into
the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate. d. Incubate the plate at
37°C for 60 minutes. e. Wash the wells five times with wash
buffer. f. Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well and
incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. g. Wash the wells
five times with wash buffer. h. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate
solution to each well and incubate at room temperature for
10-15 minutes in the dark. i. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each
well to stop the reaction. j. Read the absorbance at 450 nm
using an ELISA plate reader within 15 minutes of adding the
stop solution.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to ensure assay reliability.
2. Results from controls should fall within the manufacturer's
specified range; if not, do not report patient results and repeat
the assay.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Calculate the IgG levels for Pepper Bell and Paprika using the
data analysis software linked to the ELISA plate reader.
2. Report results in U/mL, following site-specific guidelines for
units and reference intervals.
3. Document any critical values and follow the appropriate
procedure for reporting critical results to the clinician.
F. Troubleshooting:
1. If the absorbance values are outside the expected range, check
for potential errors in sample and reagent preparation.
2. Ensure all incubation times and washing steps were followed
precisely.
3. Verify the integrity and expiration date of the reagents.
G. Method Limitations:
1. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay are as per the
manufacturer's insert. Cross-reactivity and interference from
other substances can affect results.
2. Refer to the assay kit insert for detailed information.
