Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PEPPER BLACK IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary for
the analytical phase of generating results for PEPPER BLACK IgG
testing. This process ensures accurate, reliable, and timely results for
the detection of IgG antibodies specifically against PEPPER BLACK
extract.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of PEPPER BLACK IgG
testing in the laboratory. It includes procedures for handling specimen
integrity, assay setup, operation of instruments, quality control, and
result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as defined in this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the procedure and
addressing any issues that may arise during the execution of this
protocol.
4. DEFINITION:
PEPPER BLACK IgG: Immunoglobulin G antibodies specifically
targeting PEPPER BLACK extract, detected to diagnose or monitor
specific immune reactions.
5. PROCEDURE:
5.1. Sample Preparation and Handling:
5.1.1. Ensure the collected specimen is serum or plasma.
5.1.2. Confirm specimen is properly labeled and received in
appropriate condition.
5.1.3. Centrifuge the specimen to separate the serum/plasma if not
already done.
5.1.4. Aliquot the necessary volume of serum/plasma into labeled
tubes for testing.
5.1.5. Maintain specimens at 2-8°C until ready for assay. If
specimens need to be stored for longer periods, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
5.2. Reagents and Supplies:
5.2.1. PEPPER BLACK IgG ELISA kit (or equivalent) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5.2.2. Calibration reagents and quality control materials.
5.2.3. Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips.
5.2.4. Microplate washer.
5.2.5. Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm).
5.3. ELISA Assay Setup:
5.3.1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use.
5.3.2. Prepare the microplate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
5.3.3. Add standards, controls, and specimens to the designated
wells.
5.3.4. Add the appropriate amount of conjugate reagent to each well.
5.3.5. Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and
duration as per the kit instructions.
5.3.6. Wash the microplate multiple times using the microplate
washer.
5.3.7. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time without exposure to direct light.
5.3.8. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
5.4. Measurement and Analysis:
5.4.1. Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength using the microplate reader.
5.4.2. Calculate the concentration of PEPPER BLACK IgG in the
specimens by comparing the absorbance readings to the standard
curve.
5.5. Quality Control:
5.5.1. Run quality control samples (both negative and positive) with
each batch of tests.
5.5.2. Ensure that quality control results fall within the manufacturer's
specified ranges before validating any patient results.
5.5.3. Document and address any quality control failures
immediately; do not report patient results until quality control criteria
are met.
5.6. Reporting Results:
5.6.1. Enter the concentration values for PEPPER BLACK IgG into
the laboratory information system (LIS).
5.6.2. Review and verify results based on quality control and assay
performance criteria.
5.6.3. Report results in the designated format as per laboratory
protocol. Include any pertinent notes regarding the integrity of the
sample or deviations from expected control results.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Reference intervals for PEPPER
BLACK IgG will be established based on laboratory-specific
validations and referenced ranges provided by the assay
manufacturer.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the assay kit insert for detailed
limitations related to the PEPPER BLACK IgG assay. Factors such as
cross-reactivity, interfering substances, and sensitivity must be
considered.
