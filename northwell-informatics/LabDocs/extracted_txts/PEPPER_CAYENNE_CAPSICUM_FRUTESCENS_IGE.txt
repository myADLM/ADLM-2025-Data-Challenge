Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Pepper Cayenne (Capsicum frutescens)
IgE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analysis and generation of
results for Pepper Cayenne (Capsicum frutescens) IgE to ensure
consistent, accurate, and reliable test outcomes.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all assigned MLS staff to perform and
document the analysis for Pepper Cayenne IgE accurately according
to this SOP, and to bring any issues or deficiencies to the immediate
attention of the supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (such as Phadia 250)
• Pepper Cayenne (Capsicum frutescens) IgE-specific reagent kits
• Calibrators and Controls
• Microcentrifuge
• Specimen rack
• Reaction cuvettes
• Pipettes and tips
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
Reagents and Storage:
• Pepper Cayenne IgE Reagent Kits: Store at 2-8°C
• Calibrators and Controls: Store as per manufacturer’s instructions
• Wash Solution and Substrate: Store as per manufacturer’s
instructions
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Human serum or plasma
• Collection: Specimens should be collected in a serum separator
tube (SST) or a plasma separator tube (PST).
• Volume: Minimum volume required is 0.5 mL.
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 7 days refrigerated
(2-8°C), and up to 1 year frozen (-20°C or lower).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Samples that are improperly labeled or collected in incorrect
containers.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow all reagents, calibrators, and samples to reach room
temperature before use.
• Inspect all reagents and calibrators for expiration dates and
integrity of content.
Instrument Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer at the frequency
recommended by the manufacturer.
• Utilize Pepper Cayenne IgE-specific calibrators to generate a
calibration curve.
Sample Analysis:
1. Loading: a. Place the patient samples, calibrators, and controls
into appropriate positions on the analyzer specimen rack. b.
Label reaction cuvettes according to the sample identification
numbers.
2. Programming: a. Input the test method for Pepper Cayenne
(Capsicum frutescens) IgE into the instrument, selecting the
appropriate assay from the menu. b. Program the run
configuration including sample IDs, control IDs, and calibration
standards.
3. Running the Assay: a. Run the calibration curve first, ensuring
that all calibrators produce valid results within expected ranges.
b. Load the patient samples and controls. c. Start the assay run
as per analyzer instructions, ensuring all steps (e.g., incubation,
washing, measurement) are completed by the instrument.
4. Review Controls: a. Verify that all controls are within
established quality control ranges. b. If controls are out of
range, stop the analysis, troubleshoot the cause, and repeat the
controls.
5. Result Generation: a. Review the obtained patient results,
ensuring calibration curve and control results validate the run.
b. Print or transfer results to the LIS for report generation.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality controls with each batch of patient samples.
• Document control results and validate acceptability before
releasing patient results.
• If any QC failure occurs, troubleshoot according to established
guidelines and do not report patient results until QC criteria are
met.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Labor Information
System (LIS).
• Review and verify all patient results in the LIS.
• Report results with reference ranges or interpretation codes as
specified.
Reference Ranges:
• Specific reference ranges for Pepper Cayenne IgE levels should
be cited from the manufacturer's package insert or established
laboratory guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Acknowledge potential cross-reactivity with other Capsicum
species or related allergens.
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations about the
assay sensitivity and specificity.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Instrument errors: Refer to the instrument manual for
troubleshooting.
• Reagent issues: Replace reagents, rerun calibration and controls
if necessary.
• QC out of range: Re-evaluate the assay performance, rerun
controls, and inform a supervisor if persistent issues occur.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of PPE.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of waste as per institutional biosafety protocols.
