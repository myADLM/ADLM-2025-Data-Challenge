1. PURPOSE
To describe the analytical procedure for the measurement of
Pepsinogen I (PG I) in serum samples using an Immunoassay
analyzer to ensure the reliability, reproducibility, and accuracy of test
results.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting
tests as described in this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedure and addressing any issues with the assay performance
or equipment.
1. DEFINITION
Pepsinogen I (PG I) is a precursor enzyme produced by the chief
cells of the gastric mucosa, which is converted to the active enzyme
pepsin. Measurement of PG I levels assists in diagnosing gastric
atrophy, which is associated with various gastric diseases, including
gastritis and gastric cancer.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen:
• Preferred: 3 mL of serum from a blood sample collected in a SST
(Serum Separator Tube).
• Stability: Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 5 days. For long-
term storage, it should be frozen at -20°C or below for up to 6
months.
Acceptance Criteria:
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimen arriving without a proper label or collection date/time
indicated.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens ADVIA Centaur XP, Roche
Cobas 8000).
• Pepsinogen I (PG I) Kit specific to the analyzer.
• Control and calibration materials provided by the reagent
manufacturer.
• Microcentrifuge, micropipettes, and appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE).
Calibration:
• Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to manufacturer’s
instructions with each new lot of reagents or as indicated by
quality control results.
Quality Control:
• Utilize appropriate QC material (Negative and Positive controls)
as per manufacturer protocols.
• Perform QC with each new batch of reagents and with each run.
• Maintain QC log documenting lot number, expiry date, date and
time of QC run, and acceptance criteria for control values.
• If control measurements are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and recalibrate the instrument, then repeat QC
before running patient samples.
Detailed Testing Procedure:
1. Pre-Analytical Phase:
◦ Verify the proper identification of the sample and
documents.
◦ Inspect the suitability of the sample (e.g., no hemolysis).
◦ If sample is refrigerated, allow it to come to room
temperature.
◦ Ensure all equipment and reagents are set up and
calibrated per manufacturer instructions.
2. Analytical Phase:
◦ Load samples and reagents onto the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument-specific steps for setting up the PG I
assay. Typically, this includes entering sample identifiers,
selecting the PG I protocol, and starting the run.
◦ Ensure reagents and samples are loaded correctly.
◦ Upon assay completion, check the analyzer's printout for
result generation.
3. Post-Analytical Phase:
◦ Verify the results for all QC controls to ensure they fall within
the specified acceptance ranges.
◦ If QC results are valid, proceed with patient sample result
review.
◦ Document test results and ensure they are uploaded to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for further review by a
qualified lab technologist.
◦ If results are abnormal or need verification, perform
appropriate confirmatory testing or repeat analysis.
Reporting Results:
• Report PG I results using the site-specific format.
• Note the reference intervals:
◦ Normal Range: Refer to kit insert for specific ranges, which
may vary depending on the population studied.
◦ Any critical values or abnormalities should be flagged and
reviewed.
Sample Integrity and Handling:
• Ensure proper handling and disposal of samples and reagents as
per laboratory safety protocols.
• In case of any discrepancies in results or suspected sample
degradation, re-analysis may be required.
• Retain aliquots of processed samples for potential re-testing until
results are verified.
Method Limitations:
• Results may be affected by certain interfering substances such as
high levels of triglycerides, hemoglobin, or bilirubin. Refer to the
specific interferents listed in the reagent insert.
• Ensure technicians are aware of these limitations and consider
them during result interpretation.
