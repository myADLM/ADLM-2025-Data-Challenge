Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
PERAMPANEL, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the qualitative and quantitative
analysis of Perampanel in serum. This process includes sample
preparation, instrumentation, data analysis, and result reporting,
ensuring accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel performing serum
Perampanel analysis within our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately and ensure any deviations are documented and
brought to the supervisor's attention. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for maintaining and updating this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Serum collection is typically done using serum separator tubes
(SST) or red top tubes without anticoagulants.
• Recommended volume: At least 1 mL of serum.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• After collection, allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes and
then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm to separate the serum.
• The serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Specimens not labeled with collection date/time, patient
identification, or requisition details.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a UV
detector or LC-MS/MS system
• Micro-pipettes: 1-10 µL, 10-100 µL, 100-1000 µL
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Water Bath (optional)
Reagents:
• Mobile phase (e.g., Methanol, Acetonitrile, Water with final
composition optimized for the HPLC system)
• Internal Standard (if applicable)
• Calibration standards of Perampanel
• Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum specimens at room temperature.
2. Vortex the serum sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 0.5 mL of the serum into a clean, labeled test tube.
4. If using a protein precipitation method:
◦ Add 1 mL of cold acetonitrile to the serum sample.
◦ Vortex for 1 minute and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10
minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new tube without
disturbing the pellet.
◦ Evaporate the supernatant to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen or in a vacuum evaporator.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in 0.5 mL of the mobile phase and
vortex.
5. If using a liquid-liquid extraction method:
◦ Add 2 mL of the extraction solvent such as Hexane or Ethyl
Acetate.
◦ Vortex for 2 minutes and centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 5
minutes.
◦ Transfer the upper organic layer to a new tube and
evaporate to dryness.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in 0.5 mL of the mobile phase and
vortex.
Instrumental Analysis:
1. Calibrate the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system with prepared
calibration standards ranging from the lower limit of
quantification to the upper limit.
2. Load the sample extracts and calibration standards into the
HPLC/LC-MS/MS autosampler.
3. Set the instrument parameters as follows:
◦ Column: C18 or equivalent, 150 x 4.6mm, 5µm particle size
◦ Mobile Phase: Gradient elution of Water/Methanol or Water/
Acetonitrile
◦ Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Injection Volume: 10-20 µL
◦ Detection: UV at 220 nm or MS/MS set to appropriate MRM
transitions.
4. Run the prepared serum samples along with blank and quality
control samples in the same sequence to ensure system
performance.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control samples (low, medium, and high concentrations of
Perampanel) must be analyzed with each run of clinical specimens to
validate the assay's accuracy and precision. Acceptable limits must
be determined based on validation data.
Calibration Curve:
• Assess the calibration curve for linearity. Each curve must have a
correlation coefficient (r²) of 0.990 or higher.
Within-Run and Between-Run:
• Perform quality control tests on each batch/run, verifying that the
results are within the defined acceptable limits.
• Repeat testing if out-of-range values are observed, including a
review of the batch for potential errors.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting:
• Perampanel results are reported in ng/mL or μg/mL as
appropriate.
• Results must be reviewed by a technologist for potential analytical
issues before verification.
• Critical values or abnormal results must be communicated
promptly to the requesting physician as per our laboratory's
communication policy.
Documentation:
• All results, calibration curves, and quality control data must be
documented in the laboratory’s LIS.
• Instrument logs and method validation records must also be
maintained.

10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure to refer to the package insert for method-specific limitations
and potential interferences. Certain medications or metabolic
conditions may affect the accuracy of Perampanel measurements in
serum.
Adherence to this SOP will ensure the reliability and accuracy of
Perampanel test results, consequently supporting therapeutic drug
monitoring and optimized patient care.
