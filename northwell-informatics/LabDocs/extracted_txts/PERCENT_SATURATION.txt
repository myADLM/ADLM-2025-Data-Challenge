LABORATORY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generation of Results for Percent
Saturation
Effective Date: [Insert Date] Review Date: [Insert Date] Version:
1.0 Approval: [Insert Name]
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase procedure
for generating results for Percent Saturation (Transferrin Saturation)
in the laboratory. Percent Saturation is a measurement used to
assess iron levels and iron-binding capacity of transferrin in the
blood. This procedure ensures accurate, reproducible results and
consistent reporting practices according to CLIA standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis and reporting of Percent Saturation results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis of Percent Saturation following this SOP. Supervisory staff
are responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure and for
addressing any discrepancies or issues that may arise during the
analytical phase.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or appropriate analytical instrument
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Reagent kits for iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) assays
• Quality control materials
• Specimen collection and storage tubes (e.g., SST or heparinized
vacutainer)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from SST or heparinized vacutainer
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples should be analyzed within 48 hours of collection if
stored at 2-8°C.
• For extended storage, samples can be frozen at -20°C for up to 2
months. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Iron Analysis
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, equipment, and samples are at room
temperature.
◦ Prepare the spectrophotometer/calibration according to
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Load serum samples into appropriate cuvettes or sample
wells.
◦ Perform iron concentration analysis using the specified
reagent kit.
3. Reading:
◦ Record absorbance values at the specified wavelength.
◦ Use the calibration curve to determine iron concentrations.
4. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the LIS.
◦ Perform quality checks with control materials to validate
results.
B. TIBC Analysis
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and ensure all necessary equipment is
ready.
◦ Pre-treat serum samples as specified in the reagent kit
instructions.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Load treated serum samples into cuvettes or sample wells.
◦ Analyze TIBC using the specified reagent kit.
3. Reading:
◦ Record absorbance values at the specified wavelength.
◦ Use calibration curve to determine TIBC values.
4. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the LIS.
◦ Perform quality checks with control materials to validate
results.
C. Calculation of Percent Saturation
1. Formula:
◦ Percent Saturation (%) = (Iron / TIBC) x 100
2. Calculation:
◦ Calculate Percent Saturation for each sample using the iron
and TIBC values obtained.
◦ Enter Percent Saturation results into LIS.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Verify all results in the LIS.
• Ensure Percent Saturation values are reported within acceptable
reference intervals.
• Document any discrepancies or issues during the analytical
phase and notify a supervisor.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze internal quality control materials alongside patient
samples each day of testing.
• Review and document quality control results to ensure accuracy.
• Follow corrective actions if quality control results fall outside
acceptable limits.
