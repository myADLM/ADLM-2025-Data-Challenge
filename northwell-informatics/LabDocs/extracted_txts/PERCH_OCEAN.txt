1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results using PERCH OCEAN, ensuring accuracy,
consistency, and reliability of the test results.
Responsibility:
The laboratory technologists are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this document. The laboratory supervisors are
responsible for verifying and ensuring adherence to this protocol. Any
deviations or issues encountered during the process should be
reported to the lab manager immediately.
1. DEFINITION
PERCH OCEAN refers to the analytical equipment and process
designed to perform high-throughput molecular or biochemical
assays.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
PERCH OCEAN analytical instrument Calibrated pipettes and tips
Calibrated microcentrifuge Reagents and assay kits specifically
validated for use with PERCH OCEAN Positive and negative control
samples Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
Disposable gloves, lab coats, goggles Laboratory notebook and data
recording sheets Sterile, nuclease-free water
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
Ensure all specimens have been properly collected, received, and
accessioned according to laboratory protocols. Prepare the
specimens as per the specific assay requirements, including but not
limited to centrifugation, dilution, or reagent addition. Use appropriate
controls (both positive and negative) in each batch of assays to
ensure the reliability of the results.
B) Instrument Calibration and Initialization
Turn on the PERCH OCEAN instrument and perform a daily system
check. Ensure the instrument has passed all internal self-checks
before proceeding. The instrument must be calibrated as per the
manufacturer’s instructions using calibration standards. Record
calibration results in the instrument logbook.
C) Setting Up the Assay
Load the prepared samples, controls, and reagents into the PERCH
OCEAN instrument as per the assay protocol. Ensure that all wells or
slots are appropriately filled, and there are no air bubbles or
contaminants. Program the PERCH OCEAN instrument with the
required assay parameters including sample IDs, assay type, and
control setup.
D) Running the Assay
Start the assay run as per the PERCH OCEAN software instructions.
During the run, monitor the instrument readings and system outputs
periodically for any discrepancies or errors. If an error is detected,
stop the run, troubleshoot the issue as per the troubleshooting guide
provided by the manufacturer and reinitiate the process if necessary.
E) Post-Run Analysis and Quality Control
Upon completion of the run, review and save the generated data.
Verify the results of the controls to ensure they fall within the
predetermined acceptance criteria. Any assay run failing control
validation should be flagged and the respective samples re-analyzed.
F) Documentation and Result Reporting
Document all steps performed during the sample analysis including
reagents lot numbers, calibration data, and any deviations
encountered. Transfer the validated results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for further verification and reporting. The
technologist verifies and approves the results in the LIS before
releasing them for clinical interpretation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
Daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance checks should be performed
on the PERCH OCEAN instrument as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines and documented appropriately. Internal quality control
samples (e.g., known standards or control materials) should be run
regularly to monitor the assay’s accuracy and precision. Participation
in external quality assurance programs is recommended to ensure
the laboratory maintains a high standard of analytical performance.

1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Follow the PERCH OCEAN operational capacity and avoid
overloading the instrument. Be aware of any specific assay
limitations as documented in the respective assay kit inserts. Errors
due to sample quality, reagent degradation, or improper handling can
lead to inaccurate results.
