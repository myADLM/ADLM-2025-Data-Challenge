Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Periodic Acid-Schiff
(PAS) Stain
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for performing the Periodic Acid-
Schiff (PAS) stain on tissue sections. This stain is used for the
demonstration of polysaccharides, such as glycogen and mucins, in
various tissues sections.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all tissue samples received in the
histopathology laboratory that require PAS staining.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel who have been trained in the PAS
staining procedure are responsible for executing and documenting all
steps accurately.
4. DEFINITIONS
PAS Stain: A staining technique used to highlight polysaccharides
and mucosubstances in tissue sections.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer or oven
• Staining jars or dishes
• Coplin jars
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Periodic acid solution (0.5-1% aqueous)
• Schiff reagent
• Hematoxylin (optional for counterstain)
• Distilled water
• Sulfurous acid solution (sodium metabisulfite in HCl)
• Running tap water
Supplies:
• Microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Mounting medium
• Labeling markers
6. SPECIMEN HANDLING
1. Ensure tissue samples are properly processed, embedded, and
sectioned before starting staining.
2. Cut tissue sections at 3-5 micrometers and mount on
microscope slides.
3. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 30 minutes or overnight at
room temperature.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Deparaffinization and Hydration:
◦ Deparaffinize sections by placing slides in two changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate in two changes of absolute ethanol for 3 minutes
each.
◦ Follow with 95% and 70% ethanol for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
2. Oxidation:
◦ Place slides in 0.5-1% periodic acid solution for 5-10
minutes.
◦ Rinse thoroughly in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Schiff Reagent Staining:
◦ Immerse slides in Schiff reagent for 15-30 minutes.
◦ Rinse in sulfurous acid solution (three changes, 2 minutes
each) to remove excess reagent and stop the reaction.
◦ Wash slides under running tap water for 5-10 minutes until
sections turn pink.
4. Counterstaining (optional):
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
◦ Wash in running tap water for 5 minutes to blue nuclei.
5. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate sections through 70%, 95%, and absolute
ethanol (two changes of each for 1 minute each).
◦ Clear sections in xylene (two changes, 5 minutes each).
6. Mounting:
◦ Mount slides with a compatible mounting medium and cover
slips.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Include known positive and negative control slides with each staining
run. Examine the stained control slides under a light microscope to
ensure staining quality and consistency.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive PAS Reaction: Polysaccharides (glycogen, mucins, etc.)
will stain magenta.
• Negative PAS Reaction: Tissues will show no magenta staining.
Veterinary or pathologist must review and interpret stained slides.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDING
Record the completion of each specimen's staining process in the
stain log book or Laboratory Information System (LIS) alongside
associated controls.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Wear laboratory coats, gloves, and safety goggles at all times.
• Handle all chemicals and solvents in a well-ventilated area.
• Follow all manufacturer safety data sheets (SDS) and dispose of
used reagents and tissues according to laboratory waste disposal
protocols.
