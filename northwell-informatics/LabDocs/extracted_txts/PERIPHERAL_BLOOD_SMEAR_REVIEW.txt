Peripheral Blood Smear Review Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a standardized procedure
for reviewing peripheral blood smears in the laboratory. The
peripheral blood smear review aids in diagnosing and monitoring
various hematological conditions and abnormalities. This protocol
ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency in generating results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the peripheral blood smear review according to this procedure. All
laboratory staff is responsible for identifying any issues in the smear
preparation or review that may affect the test results and bringing
them to the attention of a supervisor. Supervisors must ensure that
the smear review is performed and documented according to the
procedures, including any corrective actions that may be required.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Freshly collected whole blood in EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples that are clotted.
• Samples that are hemolyzed.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Peripheral Blood Smear:
1. Specimen Collection:
◦ Ensure you have a properly labeled EDTA blood collection
tube.
◦ Mix the specimen gently by inverting the tube several times.
2. Slide Preparation:
◦ Place a drop of blood (2-3 mm in diameter) approximately
1-2 cm from the edge on a clean glass slide.
◦ Use a second slide (spreader slide) to gently spread the
blood drop across the first slide at a 30–45° angle. Move the
spreader slide forward rapidly.
◦ Ensure the smear has a feathered edge and covers
approximately half the slide.
3. Drying the Smear:
◦ Allow the blood smear to air dry completely before staining.
B) Staining the Smear (Wright-Giemsa Stain):
1. Stain Preparation:
◦ Fix the smear by briefly dipping (or flooding) it in methanol
for about 1-3 minutes.
◦ Lay the smear flat on a staining rack.
2. Staining Procedure:
◦ Apply Wright-Giemsa stain to the smear and let it act for 1-3
minutes.
◦ Add an equal amount of buffer (or distilled water) to the
smear and gently mix the stain-buffers on the slide for 4-6
minutes.
3. Rinsing:
◦ Rinse the slide thoroughly with buffer or distilled water until
the stain residue is washed off.
◦ Allow the slide to air dry in an upright position.
C) Microscopic Examination:
1. Equipment:
◦ Ensure the microscope is calibrated and clean.
◦ Use light microscopy with a magnification of 10x, 40x and
100x.
2. Procedure:
◦ Examine the feathered edge at 10x magnification for overall
cell distribution.
◦ Focus on the monolayer region for detailed evaluation at
40x and 100x magnification (using immersion oil).
◦ Evaluate the red blood cell morphology, white blood cell
differential count, and platelet estimation.
3. Parameters to Assess:
◦ RBC morphology: shape, size, color, inclusions.
◦ WBC differential: count the types of white blood cells and
note abnormalities.
◦ Platelets: estimate number and morphology.
◦ Identify and record any unusual or abnormal cells.
D) Documentation and Reporting:
1. Recording Results:
◦ Record findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
including:
▪ RBC morphologic observations.
▪ WBC differential count.
▪ Platelet count and morphology.
▪ Any abnormal findings.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Technologists must review all entries for accuracy.
◦ Verify results according to defined laboratory guidelines.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Generate and communicate results to the requesting
physician or healthcare provider.
◦ Include any pertinent comments or observations.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Standard Quality Control Measures:
◦ Use control slides for comparison to ensure staining quality.
◦ Review the accuracy of equipment calibration periodically.
2. QC Documentation:
◦ Document all QC activities in the corresponding log.
