Peripheral Nerve Pathology Consultation SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of processing
and interpreting peripheral nerve biopsy specimens to generate
accurate and timely pathology results for peripheral nerve pathology
consultations.
Responsibility: Designated pathologists and laboratory technologists
are responsible for following the procedures outlined in this document
to ensure accurate and consistent results. It is also the responsibility
of the staff to identify any variances or deficiencies during the
process and report them to the designated supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE AND PREPARATION
Specimen Collection:
• Specimens must be collected in the operating room or clinic
following standard sterile protocols.
• Preferred specimen: Segments of peripheral nerves placed in
appropriate fixatives (e.g., glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy
or 10% buffered formalin for light microscopy).
• Ensure proper labeling of specimens with the patient's name,
identification number, date, and time of collection.
Specimen Receipt:
• Upon receipt of the specimen in the laboratory, immediately log
the specimen into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
assign a unique accession number.
• Verify that the specimen is accompanied by a completed
requisition form with relevant clinical information and consultation
request.
Specimen Processing:
1. Fixation:
◦ Fix the nerve segments in glutaraldehyde (for electron
microscopy) or formalin (for light microscopy) for specified
durations.
◦ Ensure the fixative volume is sufficient to fully cover the
specimen (approximately 10-20 times the volume of the
tissue).
2. Sectioning:
◦ Grossly inspect the fixed specimen for suitable areas for
sectioning.
◦ Trim the fixed nerve segment into appropriate sizes for
further processing.
◦ Process the trimmed specimens for paraffin embedding for
light microscopy and for resin embedding for electron
microscopy.
3. Staining: Paraffin-embedded sections:
◦ Perform standard Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining on
paraffin-embedded sections.
◦ For special stains, perform appropriate protocols (e.g., Luxol
fast blue, Congo red).
Resin-embedded sections:
◦ Perform toluidine blue staining for thick sections.
◦ Prepare ultrathin sections for electron microscopy and stain
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
4. MICROSCOPE EVALUATION
Light Microscopy:
• Examine H&E and special stained slides under light microscopy.
• Identify and document pathological features such as axonal
degeneration, demyelination, inflammation, fibrosis, and other
relevant findings.
Electron Microscopy:
• Examine ultrathin sections under a transmission electron
microscope.
• Identify ultrastructural details such as myelin integrity, axonal
changes, Schwann cell abnormalities, and abnormal inclusions.
• Capture representative micrographs for documentation and
reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control measures must be adhered to at each step of the
process, including:
• Verification of specimen identifiers before fixation.
• Regular calibration and maintenance of histological and electron
microscopy equipment.
• Inclusion of control tissues in staining procedures to ensure
consistency and reliability.
• Detailed logging of all specimens, protocols, and findings in the
LIS.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Diagnostic Interpretation:
• The assigned pathologist reviews all findings from light and
electron microscopy.
• Compile a comprehensive diagnostic report that includes the
following:
◦ Patient information and clinical history.
◦ Gross and microscopic descriptions.
◦ Summary of pathological findings and interpretations.
◦ If necessary, recommendations for additional studies or follow-
up.
Communication of Results:
• The finalized report is entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Results are communicated to the requesting clinician(s) via
secure electronic means or printed reports.
• Any significant or critical findings must also be communicated
promptly via phone or other direct communication methods.
1. REFERENCES
Provide references to standard pathology textbooks, manuals, and
peer-reviewed literature relevant to peripheral nerve pathology for
further reading and cross-referencing.
1. UPDATES AND REVISIONS
This SOP must be reviewed and updated periodically, at least
annually or as new information and techniques become available, to
ensure consistency with current best practices.
This SOP is intended to ensure high-quality, reproducible, and
accurate results in the evaluation and diagnosis of peripheral nerve
pathology consultations.
