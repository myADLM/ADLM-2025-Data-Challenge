Peripheral Nervous System Demyelinating Neuropathy,
Autoimmune Evaluation, Serum: Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for analyzing serum samples to evaluate
autoimmune markers associated with peripheral nervous system
demyelinating neuropathy. This includes the preparation, testing,
quality control, and reporting of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube or gel-
barrier tube.
• Volume requirements: Minimum of 5 mL of serum.
• Specimens must be clearly labeled with patient identifiers,
including name, date of birth, and collection date/time.
Acceptable specimens:
• Serum that is adequately separated from the clot or cells without
visible hemolysis.
• Specimens collected within the acceptable timeframe and under
standard conditions.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
• Specimens that are not labeled properly with patient identifiers.
Handling and Storage:
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
• Specimens should be brought to room temperature before
analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units
• Pipettes
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA,
chemiluminescence)
• Microplate reader or equivalent analytical instrumentation
Reagents:
• Specific ELISA kits or chemiluminescent immunoassay kits for
detecting autoantibodies associated with demyelinating
neuropathy (e.g., Anti-GM1, Anti-MAG, Anti-SGPG).
• Calibrators and controls for autoantibody assays.
• Wash buffer, substrate solution, and stopping solution (per assay
requirements).
Supplies:
• Microtiter plates
• Plastic scintillation vials
• Lab coats, gloves, safety goggles
4. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment calibrations and maintenance checks are
performed.
2. Prepare the workspace with the necessary reagents and
supplies.
3. Verify patient information and specimen integrity.
Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Centrifuge specimens to separate serum.
◦ Aliquot the required volume of serum into labeled
microtubes.
2. Autoantibody Detection:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the specific ELISA or
chemiluminescent immunoassay kits.
◦ Prepare the microtiter plates according to the kit insert.
◦ Pipette calibrator, controls, and patient samples into the
appropriate wells.
◦ Apply reagents in the specified sequence (e.g., primary
antibodies, enzyme conjugate, substrate solution).
◦ Incubate for the recommended periods and wash as
directed.
◦ Detect and record outcomes using a microplate reader or
equivalent.
Post-analytical:
1. Verify the integrity of the results, checking for adherence to
standard calibration curves and control limits.
2. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
making sure to include detailed notes regarding any anomalies.
3. Ensure proper documentation and storage of tested materials.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
QC Materials:
• Utilize both positive and negative controls per batch analyzed.
• Perform daily quality control checks on analytical instruments.
• Ensure results fall within acceptable ranges before reporting.
QC Protocol:
1. Run quality control samples with every new batch of patient
samples.
2. Document any deviation and initiate troubleshooting steps if
controls fall outside the acceptable range.
3. Follow manufacturer's guidelines for recalibration and
maintenance of assays.
Dealing with QC Failure:
• Investigate the source of the failure (instrumentation, reagent, or
handling error).
• If QC failure persists, discontinue testing for affected analytes and
notify the supervisor.
• Perform dilutions or repeat testing as necessary for accuracy.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are transmitted automatically to LIS post-analysis.
• The technologist reviewing the data must verify and validate the
results before final reporting.
• Positive findings for autoantibodies must be flagged for
comprehensive review and further clinical correlation.
• Critical results (if defined by site-specific criteria) should be
escalated according to standard operating policy.
