Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Peripheral Neuropathy
Screen
Title: Peripheral Neuropathy Screening
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to establish the procedure for the
accurate and timely preparation, analysis, and result generation for
peripheral neuropathy screening. This protocol should ensure that
results are reliable, reproducible, and reported in a standardized
manner.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel conducting peripheral
neuropathy screening tests are responsible for adhering to this
procedure. It is also the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
protocol adherence and to address any issues arising during the test
procedure.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen Type:
• Blood sample
• Biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) if required
Collection:
• Blood should be collected in a red-top or yellow-top tube (serum
separator tube).
• For CSF, follow specific collection procedures as appropriate.
Post-collection:
• Blood specimens should be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and
centrifuged at 3500 RPM for 10 minutes.
• CSF should be processed immediately or stored at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA or immunoassay analyzer
• Electrophoresis equipment for serum/CSF protein analysis
• Reagents specific to detecting markers of peripheral neuropathy
(e.g., antibodies to neural components)
• Calibrators and controls
1. Reagent Preparation
• Prepare reagent solutions according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Store reagents as recommended, typically at 2-8°C.
• Check and document the expiration dates of all reagents.
1. Procedure
A) ELISA/Immunoassay for Anti-Neuronal Antibodies:
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare ELISA plate and reagents.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add prepared sample dilutions to each well.
◦ Add standards and controls.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for incubation times and
washing steps.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate as specified.
◦ Terminate the reaction with stop solution and read the
results at the appropriate wavelength.
3. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate results based on the absorbance values of the
samples and calibration standards.
◦ Generate a standard curve if applicable.
B) Electrophoresis for Protein Analysis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare gel electrophoresis equipment and reagents.
◦ Equilibrate running buffer and other components to room
temperature.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load prepared samples onto the gel.
◦ Run electrophoresis under specified conditions.
◦ Stain and destain the gel to visualize protein bands.
3. Result Analysis:
◦ Compare bands for sample and control to identify abnormal
proteins indicative of peripheral neuropathy.
◦ Document and interpret findings.
4. Quality Control
• Include internal quality controls (positive and negative controls)
with each run.
• Ensure quality control results fall within the established
acceptable range.
• Any run failing quality control criteria must be recalibrated and
repeated.
1. Reporting Results
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification.
• Review results for consistency and validity before final approval.
• Report critical or unexpected findings immediately to the treating
physician.
• Document observations in detail, specifying any anomalies.
1. Reference Intervals
• Refer to manufacturer guidelines and established laboratory
reference intervals for each specific test.
• Compare patient results with reference intervals to determine
normal or abnormal findings.
1. Method Limitations
• Potential interference from hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
• Specific limitations as per each reagent or test method insert.
• High titers of autoantibodies or cross-reacting substances may
cause false-positive results.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for use (IFU) for all reagents and
instruments.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards and guidelines (e.g., CLSI,
CLIA).
Note: This SOP must be reviewed and validated periodically to
accommodate advancements in methodologies and ensure
continued reliability.
