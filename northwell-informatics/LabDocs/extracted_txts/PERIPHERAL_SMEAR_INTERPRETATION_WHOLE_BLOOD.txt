Peripheral Smear Interpretation, Whole Blood Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide standardized procedures
for the preparation, examination, and interpretation of peripheral
blood smear slides to ensure quality and consistency in the results
generated by the laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for preparing and staining the
peripheral blood smears following established procedures.
• Hematologists or trained technologists are responsible for
examining and interpreting the peripheral blood smears.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure quality control
measures are followed, identifying any issues that may affect test
results, and bringing them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Whole blood collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) anticoagulant, ideally within 2 hours of collection.
• Acceptable: EDTA whole blood sample within 24 hours of
collection, stored at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable: Clotted blood samples or samples that are older
than 24 hours.
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Ensure proper identification and labeling of specimen.
• Mix specimen well immediately before preparing the smear.
• Inspect the sample for clots and hemolysis before use.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Clean glass microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Manual/Electronic slide stainer
• Microscope (oil immersion)
• Peripheral blood smear charts (reference)
• Wright-Giemsa stain or equivalent
• Immersion oil
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Smear:
1. Place a small drop of whole blood (approximately 2-3 mm diameter) near one end of a clean glass slide.
2. Hold a second slide (spreader slide) at a 30-45° angle and back it into the drop of blood allowing it to spread along the edge of the spreader slide.
3. Move the spreader slide forward with a steady motion to produce a thin, even smear.
4. Air dry the slide completely before staining.
Staining the Smear:
1. Immerse the dried smear in Wright-Giemsa stain or equivalent for the duration indicated by the stain manufacturer.
2. Rinse the smear gently with buffer solution or distilled water.
3. Air dry the slide after rinsing.
Microscopic Examination:
1. Place a cover slip on the stained smear and add a drop of immersion oil.
2. Examine the slide under 100x magnification (objective) oil immersion lens.
3. Perform a systematic examination, starting with the edges and moving toward the center, covering the entire smear.
Interpretation:
1. Evaluate the overall quality of the smear including proper staining, distribution, and morphology.
2. Perform differential count of white blood cells, assess red blood cell morphology, and platelet evaluation.
3. Identify and note any abnormalities or significant findings.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality checks on staining reagents and equipment.
◦ Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the
microscope.
◦ All findings should be reviewed by a second trained
technologist or hematologist.
◦ Utilize peripheral blood smear charts for reference
standards.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings accurately including white blood cell
differential count, red blood cell morphology, and platelet count.
• Note any anomalies or details in morphology and include clinical
interpretations where applicable.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified before being reported to
the physician or included in the patient’s medical record.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• White blood cells differential count:
◦ Neutrophils: 40-70%
◦ Lymphocytes: 20-40%
◦ Monocytes: 2-10%
◦ Eosinophils: 1-4%
◦ Basophils: 0-1%
• Red blood cell morphology: Normocytic, normochromic
• Platelets: 150,000-450,000/mm³
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure timely use of samples to prevent artifacts from aging.
• Recognize limitations of manual differential counts; some subtle
anomalies may require flow cytometry or additional testing.
