Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Pernicious Anemia Cascade, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for the Pernicious Anemia
Cascade, Serum test. This includes the proper handling of samples,
performing the specific test procedures, interpreting results, and
ensuring accurate data documentation.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for performing the
Pernicious Anemia Cascade tests according to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol
and addressing any issues that may arise during testing.
2. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a red-topped or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Stability:
◦ Serum specimens should be transported and stored at 2-8°C if
not analyzed immediately.
◦ Specimens must be centrifuged, and serum should be
separated within 2 hours of collection.
◦ Measure and keep serum aliquots at -20°C if storage for an
extended period is necessary.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens stored in incorrect containers.
• Specimens with missing or incorrect collection and labeling
information.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units
• Pipettes
• Vials for aliquoting serum
• Test-specific reagents and assay kits (e.g., vitamin B12 assay kit,
intrinsic factor antibody test kit)
• Necessary laboratory instruments such as immunoassay
analyzers
Procedure:
A) Vitamin B12 Assay:
1. Verify specimen acceptability according to the criteria outlined
above.
2. Pipette the serum into the test-specific vials.
3. Adhere to the kit manufacturer’s guidelines for performing the
assay:
◦ Prepare reagents.
◦ Calibrate the instrument.
◦ Load specimens and reagents.
◦ Start the assay run.
4. Document the assay run including specimen IDs, lot numbers,
and reagent use.
B) Intrinsic Factor Antibody Test:
1. Setup and calibration:
◦ Prepare the instrument according to manufacturers’ specific
guidelines.
◦ Calibrate using standards provided in the assay kit.
2. Analyze the specimen:
◦ Follow manufacturer protocols for reagent preparation,
mixing, incubation, and loading into the analyzer.
◦ Run a control sample prior to running patient samples to
ensure accuracy.
3. Document data:
◦ Record the test date, time, results, and any observations in
the laboratory log.
Quality Control:
• Perform regular control tests using both positive and negative
controls supplied by the kit manufacturer.
• Document all control test results.
• If any control results fall outside acceptable ranges, perform
troubleshooting steps and notify the supervisor.
Reporting Results:
1. Results should be reviewed comprehensively by the
technologist to ensure accuracy.
2. Enter the patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Ensure the results are verified and sign off documentation as
per standard procedures.
4. Send verified results to the ordering physician or appropriate
referral system.
Reference Intervals:
• Vitamin B12: 200-900 pg/mL
• Intrinsic Factor Antibodies: Negative
Critical Results:
• Any values significantly outside the reference range should be
flagged immediately.
• Follow the procedure for reporting critical values, including
contacting a responsible clinician directly for urgently critical
results.
• Document the call, name of the person reporting, and receiver,
date, and time.
Method Limitations:
Refer to the insert of each specific kit for detailed limitations
regarding reagent sensitivity, potential interferences from substances,
issues of specificity, etc.

Factor Antibody Test.
Notes:
1. Ensure regular calibration and maintenance of laboratory
instruments.
2. Keep detailed logs of equipment upkeep, reagent lot numbers,
and control results.
3. Follow laboratory safety standards and guidelines for handling
biological specimens.
This protocol ensures that accurate, reliable, and timely results are
generated for the Pernicious Anemia Cascade, Serum test, ultimately
aiding in the effective diagnosis and management of patients.
