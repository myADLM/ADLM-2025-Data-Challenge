4. Definitions
PEROXISOMAL DISORDER GENE PANEL: A molecular diagnostic
panel used to detect mutations in genes associated with peroxisomal
disorders.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Thermal Cycler (PCR machine)
• Next-Generation Sequencer (NGS)
• PCR reagents (primers, DNA polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
• NGS reagents (library preparation kits, sequencing reagents)
• DNA extraction kit
• Quantification tools (spectrophotometer, fluorometer)
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• Bioinformatics software
6. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from patient specimen using a validated
DNA extraction kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer. Ensure the concentration is within the range
suitable for subsequent steps.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring the correct primers for the Peroxisomal
Disorder Gene Panel are included.
2. Add the patient DNA to the master mix in a PCR tube or plate.
3. Load the PCR plate into the thermal cycler and run the
appropriate PCR protocol:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Followed by 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: temperature specific to primers for 30
seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
4. Verify the amplification success by running the PCR products
on an agarose gel.
C. Library Preparation for NGS
1. Perform library preparation using the NGS library preparation
kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions meticulously.
2. Quantify and assess the library quality using a fluorometer and
gel electrophoresis or an automated electrophoresis system.
3. Pool libraries, if necessary, for multiplex sequencing as per the
kit’s protocol.
D. Next-Generation Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS instrument according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Initialize the sequencing run and monitor for any errors or
deviations from the expected performance.
3. Upon completion, ensure all generated data are securely
transferred to the data analysis workstation.
E. Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Utilize bioinformatics software to analyze raw sequencing data.
2. Perform read alignment against the reference human genome,
variant calling, and annotation.
3. Ensure the coverage and depth of sequencing meets the
required thresholds for reliable variant detection.
4. Curate and interpret identified variants with reference to
databases and clinical guidelines.
7. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing run to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
2. Perform periodic proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assurance programs.
3. Review internal quality control data regularly and document any
corrective actions taken if deviations from expected results are
observed.
8. Reporting Results
1. Validate and verify the analysis results by a qualified laboratory
director or supervisor.
2. Document and report results within the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Ensure results are communicated to the appropriate healthcare
providers with all necessary interpretations and
recommendations.
