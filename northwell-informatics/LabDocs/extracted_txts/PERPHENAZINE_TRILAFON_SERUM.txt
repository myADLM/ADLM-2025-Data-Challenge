Protocol for the Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
Perphenazine (Trilafon) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to accurately determine
the concentration of perphenazine (Trilafon) in serum using high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV)
detection. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable results for
therapeutic drug monitoring and clinical decision making.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained in HPLC
procedures and responsible for performing and verifying
perphenazine assays.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory Technologists: Perform the assay according to
the protocol, document results, and notify a supervisor if
there are any issues or deviations.
◦ Supervisors: Ensure adherence to the protocol, address
any issues that arise, and verify and approve the final
results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST), allowed to clot, and centrifuged.
◦ Storage Conditions: Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up
to 72 hours. For longer storage, serum should be frozen at
-20°C.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. Samples collected in EDTA, sodium citrate, or
other anticoagulant tubes are also unacceptable.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ High-performance liquid chromatograph with UV detector
◦ HPLC Column suitable for perphenazine determination
◦ Mobile phase: Acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (pH 3.0)
◦ Calibration standards of perphenazine
◦ Internal standard
◦ Laboratory glassware and pipettes
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Laboratory sample tubes
◦ Micropipettes and tips
4. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Thaw the serum sample if previously frozen.
2. Vortex the serum sample to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 1 mL of serum into a clean, labelled sample tube.
4. Add 100 µL of the internal standard solution to the sample
tube.
5. Vortex the sample for 30 seconds to mix thoroughly.
6. Centrifuge the sample at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate any precipitates.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC vial for
analysis.
6.2 Calibration and Control Preparation
1. Prepare calibration standards of perphenazine by spiking
drug-free serum with known concentrations of
perphenazine.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and
high concentrations by spiking drug-free serum with
known amounts of perphenazine.
3. Process calibrators and QC samples in the same manner
as patient serum samples.
6.3 HPLC Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase at a
flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for at least 30 minutes.
3. Inject 20 µL of the calibration standard into the HPLC
system and record the chromatogram.
4. Repeat step 3 for all calibration standards and QC
samples.
5. Inject 20 µL of the patient serum sample and record the
chromatogram.
6. Analyze the samples using UV detection at the
appropriate wavelength for perphenazine (typically around
254 nm).
7. Identify the perphenazine peaks based on the retention
time of the calibration standards.
5. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
◦ Calculate the concentration of perphenazine in the serum
sample by comparing the peak area of the sample to the
calibration curve.
◦ Report the results in ng/mL or µg/L.
◦ Review and validate the results according to laboratory’s
quality control and documentation practices.
◦ Reference therapeutic range for perphenazine: 0.5 – 2.5 µg/
mL. Values outside this range should be flagged for clinical
review.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples alongside patient samples with
each batch of analyses.
◦ Acceptable QC ranges must be within ±15% of the target
value.
◦ Document all QC results and ensure they meet the
established criteria before reporting patient results.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If a sample or QC fails, check for potential issues such as
instrument malfunction, contaminated reagents, or sample
preparation errors.
◦ Address and resolve any issues, and re-run the assay if
necessary.
◦ Notify a supervisor if persistent problems are encountered.
