Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase:
Measurement of Persimmon IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and precise
measurement of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to Persimmon
allergen in serum samples.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to
perform and document the assay as described in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for the training of personnel and
ensuring the adherence to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN
◦ Type of specimen:
▪ Serum
◦ Collection and handling:
▪ Collect blood specimen in an SST (Serum Separator
Tube).
▪ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes.
▪ Centrifuge the SST at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
▪ Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled polypropylene
tube.
▪ Store serum at 2-8°C if assay is performed within 24
hours; otherwise, aliquot and freeze at -20°C or lower for
longer storage.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Specific IgE assay kit for Persimmon allergen
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Test tubes or micro-well plates as specified in the kit
instructions
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Incubator set to 37°C
◦ Plate washer (if micro-well plate method is used)
◦ Plate reader capable of reading at the appropriate optical
density (e.g., 450 nm with 620 nm reference)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Assay Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, serum samples, calibrators, and controls
to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution as
per the assay kit instructions.
B. Assay Execution:
◦ Step 1: Pipette the calibrators, controls, and patient serum
samples into designated wells or tubes.
◦ Step 2: Add the allergen-specific IgE antibody reagent as
per the kit instructions.
◦ Step 3: Incubate the wells/tubes at 37°C for the
recommended time (usually 60-120 minutes).
◦ Step 4: Wash the wells/tubes with wash buffer to remove
unbound antibodies.
◦ Step 5: Add the enzyme conjugate and incubate for the
specified time.
◦ Step 6: Repeat washing step.
◦ Step 7: Add the substrate solution and incubate in the dark
for the recommended time.
◦ Step 8: Add the stop solution to terminate the reaction.
◦ Step 9: Measure the optical density (OD) on a plate reader
at the appropriate wavelengths.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use at least two levels of controls (positive and negative)
with each assay run.
◦ The results of the quality controls must fall within the
specified ranges provided by the manufacturer of the assay
kit. If the controls are outside the predefined ranges, the run
is invalid and must be repeated.
◦ Document all QC results with each assay run.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Compare the optical density readings of the patient samples
to the standard curve generated from the calibrators.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Persimmon-specific IgE in the
serum samples using the assay's software or manually as
described in the assay kit instructions.
◦ Results are typically reported in kilo units per liter (kU/L).
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure that results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist before they are released.
◦ Notify the requesting clinician if there are any critical values
as per laboratory policy.
7. REFERENCE INTERVAL
◦ Report the results with reference to the normal range
provided by the assay kit manufacturer.
◦ Typical reference intervals may vary based on the specific
population and assay used.
8. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the assay
results and should not be used.
◦ Ensure that frozen samples are thoroughly mixed and
visually inspected for any signs of degradation before use.
◦ Refer to the assay kit insert for any additional specific
limitations and interferences related to the assay.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow universal precautions and biosafety guidelines while
handling human samples.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste in accordance with regulatory
guidelines.
