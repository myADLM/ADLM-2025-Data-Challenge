Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PEUTZ-JEGHERS
SYNDROME, STK11, FULL GENE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for the accurate and
reliable analysis of the STK11 gene in patients suspected of having
Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS). This full gene analysis includes the
detection of known and novel variants that may be associated with
the condition.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting the results, and ensuring the proper
maintenance of all equipment and reagents as outlined in this
procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure compliance with this SOP and to address any deviations or
unexpected findings.
2. DEFINITIONS
STK11 (serine-threonine kinase 11) is a gene associated with Peutz-
Jeghers Syndrome. This condition is characterized by the
development of noncancerous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and
pigmented macules on the skin and mucous membranes. Full gene
analysis involves sequencing all exons and exon-intron boundaries of
the STK11 gene to identify pathogenic mutations.
3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA extraction kits
• Microcentrifuge
• Nucleic acid quantification equipment (e.g., Nanodrop, Qubit)
• Thermal cycler for PCR
• PCR reagents and primers for amplification of STK11 exons
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Real-time PCR system (if required)
• Sanger sequencing equipment or Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) platform
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Bioinformatics software for sequence alignment and variant
annotation
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for documentation and
reporting
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Use peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes or buccal
swabs as the starting material.
◦ Store blood samples at 4°C if not processed immediately
and do not keep beyond one week.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Quantify the DNA using spectrophotometry (e.g., Nanodrop)
or fluorometry (e.g., Qubit) and record the concentration.
◦ Ensure the DNA purity (A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.0 is
acceptable).
B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
1. Primer Design:
◦ Design or order primers flanking each exon and exon-intron
boundary of the STK11 gene. Ensure specificity and proper
GC content.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Set up PCR reactions using standardized protocols.
◦ Include negative (no DNA) and positive controls (known
STK11 variant or wild-type template).
◦ Verify the amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis.
C. Sequencing
1. Preparation:
◦ Purify PCR products to remove excess primers and
nucleotides using a suitable purification method (e.g.,
ExoSAP-IT).
2. Sanger Sequencing:
◦ Follow the standard procedure for cycle sequencing.
◦ Include proper controls to monitor sequencing quality.
◦ Perform capillary electrophoresis to separate and visualize
the sequencing products. OR
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
• Create a sequencing library following the NGS platform protocol.
• Perform sequencing on the NGS instrument, ensuring adequate
coverage and quality control.
D. Data Analysis
1. Alignment:
◦ Align sequencing reads to the reference STK11 gene
sequence using bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, Bowtie).
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Identify variants using appropriate software (e.g., GATK,
VarScan).
◦ Annotate variants using databases and tools (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP).
3. Interpretation:
◦ Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines (American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics).
◦ Review and interpret any pathogenic or likely pathogenic
variants in the context of PJS.
E. Reporting
• Verify all results within the LIS.
• Provide detailed reports of findings, including variant descriptions,
classification, and clinical significance.
• Include recommendations for further testing or family studies if
appropriate.
• Ensure the report is reviewed and signed by a qualified medical
geneticist or pathologist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform all analytical steps with stringent quality control
measures.
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Cross-check sequencing results with an independent method or
replicate sequencing as necessary.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment, recording this in
the equipment log.
6. LIMITATIONS
• False-negative results could arise due to low-level mosaicism or
large deletions/duplications not detected by PCR/Sanger
sequencing.
• NGS-based methods may have limitations in detecting low-
frequency variants.
7. REFERENCES
• Refer to the latest literature, technical manuals, and guidelines
including those from the CDC, ACMG, and other relevant
organizations.
• Online databases such as ClinVar and dbSNP for variant
interpretation.
8. RECORDING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all procedures, results, and quality controls in
compliance with CLIA regulations.
• Ensure all patient information is handled according to HIPAA
guidelines.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory can ensure the accurate and
reliable analysis of the STK11 gene in patients suspected of having
Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome. This enables appropriate clinical
interpretation and patient management.
