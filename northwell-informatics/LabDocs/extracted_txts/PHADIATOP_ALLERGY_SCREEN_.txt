Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PHADIATOP (ALLERGY
SCREEN)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the analytical phase of generating results for PHADIATOP (ALLERGY
SCREEN) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis as described in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory staff to ensure adherence to this
protocol and report any deviations to the laboratory supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in performing
PHADIATOP (ALLERGY SCREEN) tests within the designated
laboratory areas.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Requirements: Collect blood in a Serum Separator
Tube (SST).
• Handling: Allow blood to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge
to separate serum.
• Storage: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For
longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or colder.
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required for analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ImmunoCAP instrument
• PHADIATOP reagent kit
• Controls: Positive and negative controls
• Calibrators provided by the reagent kit manufacturer
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Equipment Preparation
1. Turn on the ImmunoCAP instrument and allow it to complete
the initialization process.
2. Ensure all necessary reagents, controls, and calibrators are
present and within expiry date.
3. Load reagents, controls, calibrators, and samples onto the
instrument as per manufacturer’s instructions.
6.2 Calibration
1. Perform calibration using calibrators provided in the
PHADIATOP reagent kit.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibrator preparation
and loading.
3. Ensure the calibration curve is within acceptable limits.
Document acceptance of the calibration curve.
6.3 Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls at the beginning of each
shift and with each new reagent lot.
2. Document results of controls on the Quality Control Log.
3. Control results must be within the manufacturer’s specified
range. If controls fail, investigate and resolve before proceeding
with patient samples.
6.4 Sample Analysis
1. Verify sample identifiers and match them with the test
requisition forms.
2. Load the patient serum samples onto the ImmunoCAP
instrument as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Initiate the test run on the ImmunoCAP instrument.
4. The instrument will automatically process the samples and
generate results.
6.5 Result Interpretation
1. Review the results generated by the ImmunoCAP instrument.
2. Positive results indicate the presence of allergen-specific IgE
and must be interpreted in the context of clinical history and
other diagnostic information.
3. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
further review.
6.6 Troubleshooting
1. If instrument malfunctions or error messages occur, refer to the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
2. Re-run samples if necessary.
3. Contact technical support if the issue cannot be resolved
internally.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
6. Verified results are automatically transmitted to the laboratory
information system (LIS).
7. Notify the ordering physician of any critical results as per
laboratory policy.
8. RECORD KEEPING
9. Maintain all logs including Calibration Log, Quality Control Log,
and Maintenance Log.
10. Ensure documentation is complete, accurate, and retained as
per laboratory policy.
