Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Phencyclidine Confirmation, Chain of Custody, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a clear and standardized procedure for the confirmation of
phencyclidine (PCP) in urine samples as part of a chain of custody
protocol, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of phencyclidine urine confirmation, following chain of custody
guidelines.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure that PCP confirmation tests are performed accurately and
efficiently. Supervisors must oversee adherence to protocols and
manage any deviations or incidents.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 30 mL freshly voided urine collected in a sterile container.
• Arrival in laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in laboratory greater than 24 hours after
collection without proper refrigeration.
• Specimens without proper labeling (including collection date/time,
patient identification).
Note: If the sample has been refrigerated, bring to room temperature
prior to analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• GC-MS system
• Internal standard for PCP
• Calibrators and controls
• Chemical reagents (solvents, derivatizing agents)
• Urine sample preparation materials (pipettes, centrifuge, labeled
tubes)
• Chain of custody forms and seals
6. PROCEDURE
A. Chain of Custody Protocol
1. Verify the integrity of the sample upon receipt. Ensure the
specimen container is sealed and intact with chain of custody
seals.
2. Document the receipt of the specimen in the chain of custody
log, including time, date, and initials of the receiving staff.
3. Store the sample in a designated refrigeration unit at 4°C until
analysis, ensuring all chain of custody documentation
accompanies the specimen.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Remove the specimen from refrigeration and allow it to reach
room temperature.
2. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
3. Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a labeled centrifuge tube.
4. Add internal standard to urine sample according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
5. Centrifuge the tube at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled tube for analysis.
C. GC-MS Analysis
1. Prepare GC-MS system for analysis, ensuring it is calibrated
with PCP standards and controls.
2. Inject prepared urine sample into the GC-MS system.
3. Run the sample through the method specific for PCP, ensuring
all machine parameters are set according to standardized
protocols.
4. Monitor the analysis, ensuring that the system is functioning
correctly (review calibration, controls).
5. Review chromatograms for PCP presence and quantify based
on internal standard and calibrator response.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include PCP positive and negative controls in each batch of
samples analyzed.
• Document control results and review control charts for
consistency.
• Verify system performance and adherence to calibration
standards.
• Investigate and resolve any discrepancies noted in control data.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify chromatogram results for accuracy.
2. Document the quantitative results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Confirm positive results by repeating the analysis to ensure
reliability and consistency.
4. Report confirmed positive and negative results to the
appropriate parties following the established reporting
guidelines.
5. Ensure chain of custody documentation is complete and
accompanies the reported results.
9. CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on the GC-MS system as indicated
by the manufacturer.
• Clean workspaces and equipment thoroughly after each batch of
analyses.
• Dispose of used reagents and sample waste according to the
laboratory’s environmental and safety protocols.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Address any instrument errors or unexpected results by
consulting the instrument manual and seeking supervisory
assistance.
• Document any incidents or deviations from the SOP and
implement corrective actions.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for GC-MS system and reagents.
• Chain of custody guidelines and forms.
• Internal and external control providers’ documentation.
This SOP must be reviewed annually or when updates are necessary
to ensure it remains accurate and effective. All personnel must
receive training on this SOP before handling PCP confirmation tests.

12. DOCUMENT CONTROL
All documentation, including chain of custody logs, test results, and
QC records, must be securely stored and easily accessible for review
when necessary. Documentation must comply with CLIA and
regulatory requirements.
