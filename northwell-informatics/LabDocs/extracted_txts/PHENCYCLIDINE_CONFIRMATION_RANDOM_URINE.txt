Phencyclidine (PCP) Confirmation, Random, Urine - Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To confirm the presence of Phencyclidine (PCP) in random urine
specimens using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
after receiving a preliminary positive result from initial screening
tests.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel performing analytical
testing of urine specimens for the confirmation of PCP.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
confirmation test according to this SOP. • Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring that technologists are trained and competent to perform
the test, and that QC and maintenance procedures are followed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: • 30 mL random urine sample.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Specimens not labeled properly,
leaking, or with insufficient volume. • Specimens received more than
72 hours post-collection without proper preservative.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) • Internal
standards and calibrators • PCP certified reference materials • Urine
sample containers • Centrifuge • Vials with caps (for GC-MS) •
Pipettes and pipette tips • Gloves, lab coat, and other personal
protective equipment • Logbooks and documentation forms
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Check that the provided sample is properly labeled and
adequately sealed.
2. Measure and transfer 5 mL of urine to a labeled centrifuge tube.
3. Add an appropriate volume of internal standard to each sample.
4. Vortex to mix the contents thoroughly.
5. Centrifuge the urine samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled vial.
B. Calibration and Controls
1. Prepare calibration standards by spiking blank urine with known
concentrations of PCP.
2. Prepare quality control samples, including negative controls
and positive controls at low, medium, and high concentrations.
3. Ensure all calibrators and controls are treated the same as
urine specimens.
C. GC-MS Analysis
1. Set up the GC-MS instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load samples, calibrators, and controls into the GC-MS
autosampler.
3. Ensure that the GC-MS method is set to detect PCP with
appropriate retention time and mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)
settings.
4. Begin the GC-MS run, ensuring that all samples, calibrators,
and controls are processed in the same analytical batch.
D. Data Analysis
1. Verify the presence of PCP in samples by comparing retention
times and mass spectra with those of calibrators and reference
standards.
2. Integrate and quantify the peaks using the GC-MS software.
3. Ensure the concentration of PCP in positive controls falls within
acceptable limits.
4. Validate and document the final results.
E. Reporting Results
1. Review the chromatograms and mass spectra for quality and
accuracy.
2. Confirmatory results will be reported in ng/mL.
3. Any sample with a confirmed concentration of PCP at or above
the cutoff value (usually 25 ng/mL) will be reported as positive.
4. Any sample with a concentration below the cutoff will be
reported as negative.
5. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run calibrators and control samples with every batch of specimens.
• Document quality control data and ensure that all QC results fall
within the predefined ranges. • If QC samples fall outside acceptable
limits, troubleshoot the issue, repeat the analysis, and document
corrective actions.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High-concentration samples may require dilution. • Interfering
substances in urine may affect the accuracy of the results; ensure
proper sample preparation and instrument maintenance routines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for GC-MS. • Certified reference
materials documentation. • Laboratory-specific protocol
documentation.
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain a log of all processed samples, including calibration
curves, control data, and final results. • Retain all instrument
printouts, chromatograms, and related documentation for at least two
years.
