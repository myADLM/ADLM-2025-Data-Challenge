Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Phencyclidine
(PCP) Confirmation, Chain of Custody, Meconium
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for the confirmation analysis of
Phencyclidine (PCP) in meconium samples. It includes the
procedures to be followed to ensure compliance with chain of
custody requirements and the analytical steps from sample
preparation to result reporting.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the clinical laboratory staff involved in the
analysis of meconium samples for the confirmation of PCP.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP,
ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the results, and maintaining
proper chain of custody documentation throughout the entire
process.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
◦ Meconium collection kits
◦ Reagent-grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
◦ Calibration standards for PCP
◦ Internal standards
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Laboratory glassware
◦ Centrifuge
◦ pH meter
◦ Solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
2. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Receipt and Chain of Custody a. Upon receipt of the
meconium sample, verify that the sample is properly labeled with
patient information and collection date. b. Document the receipt of
the sample in the laboratory information system (LIS). c. Complete
and sign the chain of custody form, ensuring that all transfers of
custody are documented and signed by each receiving party.
5.2 Sample Preparation a. Weigh out approximately 1 g of the
meconium sample using an analytical balance. b. Add an appropriate
volume of internal standard solution to the sample. c. Adjust the pH of
the sample to 9-10 using a buffer solution. d. Perform solid-phase
extraction (SPE) to isolate PCP from the meconium matrix. i.
Condition the SPE column with methanol, followed by water. ii. Load
the sample onto the SPE column and wash with water. iii. Elute the
analyte with an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile or methanol. e.
Evaporate the eluent to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas or in
a centrifugal evaporator. f. Reconstitute the residue in a suitable
solvent for GC-MS or LC-MS analysis.
5.3 Instrumental Analysis a. Prepare calibration standards and quality
control samples. b. Inject the sample extract, calibration standards,
and quality control samples into the GC-MS or LC-MS system
according to the instrument's operating procedure. c. Run the
analysis, ensuring that all instrument parameters are set according to
the method validation. d. Analyze the chromatograms or mass
spectra for the presence of PCP, comparing the retention time and
mass spectral data to the calibration standards.
5.4 Data Analysis and Result Reporting a. Quantify the concentration
of PCP in the sample using calibration curve data. b. Review the QC
results to ensure they are within acceptable limits. c. Enter the results
into the LIS and verify the results for accuracy. d. Generate a report,
including the concentration of PCP detected and any relevant
comments regarding the chain of custody. e. Sign and date the
report.
5.5 Quality Control and Assurance a. Perform periodic instrument
calibration and maintenance as per the manufacturer's guidelines. b.
Run quality control samples with each batch of tests to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the analysis. c. Document all QC activities,
including any corrective actions taken when QC results fall outside
acceptable limits.
