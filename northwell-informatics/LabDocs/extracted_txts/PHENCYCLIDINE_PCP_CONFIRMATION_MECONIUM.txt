Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Phencyclidine
(PCP) Confirmation in Meconium
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and consistent testing for the confirmation of
Phencyclidine (PCP) in meconium samples utilizing the designated
analytical techniques.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing PCP
confirmation on meconium samples as defined in this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all laboratory staff
understand and adhere to these procedures.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen Type: Meconium (approximately 1-2 grams)
collected directly and without contamination.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Meconium samples not labeled properly (missing patient
identification, collection date/time).
• Insufficient sample quantity.
• Samples contaminated with foreign materials (urine, blood, etc.)
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes (adjustable volume)
• Sample preparation kits (SPE columns, buffers, reagents)
• Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Calibration standards and quality controls for PCP
• Glassware (e.g., test tubes, beakers)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Weighing and Homogenization:
◦ Weigh approximately 1-2 grams of meconium using an
analytical balance.
◦ Homogenize the meconium sample using an appropriate
homogenizer or vortex mixer.
2. Extraction:
◦ Add a specified volume of extraction buffer (e.g., phosphate
buffer or methanol/water mixture) to the homogenized
meconium sample.
◦ Vortex mix and centrifuge the sample at high speed (e.g.,
3000 rpm) for a specified time (e.g., 10 minutes) to separate
the supernatant.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean container.
3. Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE):
◦ Condition the SPE column with methanol followed by the
extraction buffer.
◦ Load the supernatant onto the SPE column and allow it to
pass through by gravity or under vacuum.
◦ Wash the SPE column with a wash solution (e.g., 5%
methanol in water).
◦ Elute the PCP from the SPE column using an elution solvent
(e.g., methanol or acetonitrile).
B) Analytical Detection
i) GC-MS:
• Inject an aliquot (e.g., 1 µL) of the eluate into the GC-MS
instrument.
• Utilize a validated chromatographic method for separation and
detection.
• Analyze the data and identify/quantify PCP in the sample based
on retention time and mass spectral data.
ii) LC-MS/MS:
• Inject an aliquot (e.g., 10 µL) of the eluate into the LC-MS/MS
system.
• Employ appropriate chromatographic solvents and a validated
method for separation.
• Detect and quantify PCP based on the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)
transitions.
C) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare calibration standards of PCP at various
concentrations.
◦ Construct a calibration curve by plotting the response (peak
area or height) against the concentration of each standard.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, high)
concurrently with patient samples.
◦ Ensure that the QC results fall within acceptable limits.
◦ Re-run any samples that show QC out-of-range results
before reporting.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Confirm the presence of PCP if the sample's retention time, mass
spectra, or m/z transitions match those of the PCP reference
standard within acceptable tolerances.
• Quantify the concentration of PCP in the meconium sample.
• Report results according to the laboratory's standardized reporting
format and guidelines.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Use only calibrated instruments and quality-control tested
reagents.
• Perform periodic instrument maintenance and calibration checks
to ensure accuracy.
• Document and address any deviations from the procedure.
• Investigate and resolve any discrepancies in quality control
results before proceeding with sample analysis.
