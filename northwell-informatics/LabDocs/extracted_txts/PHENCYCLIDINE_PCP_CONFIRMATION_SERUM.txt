Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Phencyclidine (PCP)
Confirmation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
and confirmation of Phencyclidine (PCP) levels in serum using
validated analytical techniques. This SOP ensures accuracy,
reproducibility, and compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
PCP confirmation analysis, following this SOP, and accurately
documenting the results. The supervisor is responsible for reviewing
the results and ensuring compliance with quality control measures.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days
refrigerated at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or
colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Plasma or whole blood specimens.
• Specimens with severe hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens received in EDTA, heparin, citrate tubes, or any
additives other than those specified.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure proper labeling with patient identification, collection date,
and time.
• Refrigerated specimens must be brought to room temperature
before analysis.
• Frozen specimens must be completely thawed and mixed prior to
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and consumables appropriate for serum handling.
Reagents and Supplies:
• PCP calibration standards.
• Quality control materials for PCP.
• Extraction solvents.
• Mobile phase reagents specific for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.
• Data acquisition and analysis software.
1. PROCEDURE
I. Preparation
• Calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system following the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare calibration standards across the dynamic range of the
assay.
• Prepare quality control (QC) samples at multiple concentrations
spanning the assay's range.
II. Extraction of Serum
• Centrifuge the serum specimen at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant serum into a clean tube.
• Perform the extraction using appropriate solvents (e.g., liquid-
liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction).
• Evaporate the solvent under nitrogen and reconstitute in the
mobile phase.
III. Analysis
• Inject the extracted sample into the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system.
• Monitor the specific ions or transitions for PCP.
• Analyze calibration standards, QC samples, and serum
specimens.
• Ensure sample integrity and troubleshoot any discrepancies.
IV. Data Analysis
• Use the software to integrate peaks and quantify PCP levels.
• Compare the patient's result with calibration curves and QC
samples.
• Verify chromatograms for any potential interferences.
V. Reporting Results
• Record patient results on the LIS.
• Ensure results are within the dynamic range. If outside, dilute and
re-inject.
• Review and validate the results based on accepted quality control
criteria.
• Report the confirmed PCP concentration in serum and notify
stakeholders if the result is critical.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks with each batch of samples analyzed.
• Analyze blank, negative, and positive controls to maintain
analytical integrity.
• Review QC trends and address any deviations immediately.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Serum matrix effects.
• Interfering substances present in serum.
• Instrument-related limitations, such as detection thresholds.
• Refer to instrument-specific manuals and reagent inserts for
detailed information.
