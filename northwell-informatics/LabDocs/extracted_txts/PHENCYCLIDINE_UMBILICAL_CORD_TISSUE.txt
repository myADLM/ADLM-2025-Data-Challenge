Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Phencyclidine in Umbilical Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
Phencyclidine (PCP) in umbilical cord tissue to ensure accurate and
reliable results for diagnostic purposes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated staff (including laboratory
technicians, analysts, and supervisors) to perform this procedure
according to the protocol outlined below. The designated Quality
Control Officer is responsible for monitoring adherence to this
procedure and validating equipment and reagents used.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Umbilical cord tissue
◦ Collection: The umbilical cord tissue should be collected at
the time of delivery. A minimum of 6 inches of umbilical cord
is recommended.
◦ Storage: The collected specimen should be stored at 2-8°C
and processed within 24 hours. If immediate processing is
not possible, the specimen can be stored at -20°C or lower
until analysis.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens stored at 2-8°C for
more than 24 hours without freezing, visibly contaminated,
insufficient quantity, or specimens without proper labeling.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) setup
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Homogenizer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ SPE (Solid Phase Extraction) cartridges
◦ Calibration standards for Phencyclidine
◦ Quality Control (QC) materials
◦ Reagents: Methanol, water (HPLC grade), formic acid, and
extraction solvents
◦ Instrument-specific syringes, vials, and other consumables
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Samples
• Prepare calibration standards ranging from 0 ng/g to a suitable
high concentration (e.g., 500 ng/g).
• Prepare at least three levels of quality control samples (low,
medium, and high) within the calibration range.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Homogenization
◦ Accurately weigh approximately 1-2 grams of umbilical cord
tissue.
◦ Homogenize the tissue in an appropriate volume of
methanol: water mixture (e.g., 4:1, v/v) to ensure thorough
tissue breakdown.
2. Extraction
◦ Use the homogenized tissue extract with Solid Phase
Extraction (SPE) cartridges according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Elute the analyte with a suitable solvent (e.g., methanol)
after washing the cartridge.
3. Concentration
◦ Concentrate the eluted extract under a nitrogen stream if
necessary.
◦ Reconstitute in a known volume of the mobile phase or
initial solvent for HPLC-MS/MS analysis.
C. HPLC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Instrument Setup
◦ Set up and calibrate the HPLC-MS/MS system according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Use appropriate columns and mobile phases (e.g., water
containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol containing 0.1%
formic acid).
2. Sample Injection
◦ Inject calibration standards, QC samples, and prepared
specimen extracts into the HPLC-MS/MS system.
◦ Run the samples under the optimized conditions for
phencyclidine.
3. Data Acquisition
◦ Acquire and save data for all runs.
◦ Ensure system suitability by checking the calibration curve
and QC results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform QC measures with each batch of samples to
ensure analytical accuracy and precision.
◦ Acceptable criteria for QC samples should be within ±15%
of the nominal concentration.
◦ Re-calibrate the instrument if the QC fails to meet the
criteria before reporting results.
5. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
◦ Interpret the results based on the calibration curve.
◦ Identify positive specimens with concentrations above the
defined cut-off level.
◦ Document and review all results, providing a detailed report
that includes the concentrations of Phencyclidine found in
each specimen.
◦ Verify results according to the guidelines set forth by the
laboratory’s quality assurance protocols.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ The sensitivity and specificity of the method are subject to
matrix effects and instrumental limitations.
◦ Refer to the instrument manufacturer’s product manual for
detailed limitations and troubleshooting steps.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Refer to relevant scientific literature, regulatory guidelines,
and the manufacturer’s instructions for specific reagents and
equipment used in this procedure.
By adhering to this protocol, the accuracy and integrity of the
analytical results for Phencyclidine in umbilical cord tissue are
maintained, ensuring reliable and valid diagnostic outcomes.
