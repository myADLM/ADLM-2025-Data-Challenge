Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Phencyclidine (PCP) Testing in Random Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of testing random urine samples for the presence of
phencyclidine (PCP) using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or other
approved analytical techniques.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing PCP testing
on random urine samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately to ensure reliable and reproducible results. Lab
supervisors are responsible for overseeing the execution of this SOP
and addressing any deviations or issues.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• PCP (Phencyclidine): A dissociative drug that can be detected in
urine.
• EIA (Enzyme Immunoassay): A common method for detecting
drugs of abuse.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated or manual pipettes
• Urine specimen containers
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
• Certified EIA test kits or another approved PCP assay
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
• Urine controls (negative and positive)
• Microtiter plates and plate readers (for manual EIA)
• Centrifuge
• Reagent storage equipment
• Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) for result entry
6. REAGENTS AND CALIBRATORS:
• PCP calibrators and controls
• Reagents for enzyme immunoassay (as provided with EIA kits)
• Deionized water for reagent preparation (if applicable)
7. PROCEDURE:
7a. Preparation:
1. Urine Sample Handling:
◦ Ensure the urine samples received are properly labeled and
accessioned.
◦ Mix specimens thoroughly before analysis.
◦ If samples are refrigerated, bring them to room temperature
before analysis.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (negative control, positive
control, and calibrators) before testing patient samples.
◦ Document all QC results in the appropriate log.
7b. Testing Process:
1. Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA):
Manual EIA:
◦ Pipette the required amount of standards, controls, and
urine samples into designated wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of enzyme-conjugate reagent to
each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at the specific temperature and duration
as indicated in the EIA kit instructions.
◦ Wash the wells with the provided wash solution to remove
unbound reagents.
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
necessary time.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using a plate reader.
◦ Compare the sample absorbance values to a calibration
curve generated from the standards.
Automated EIA:
◦ Load the calibrators, controls, and urine samples onto the
auto-analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure that all reagents are correctly loaded into the
analyzer.
◦ Initiate the run according to the instrument's operational
manual.
◦ Review and verify the generated results.
2. Interpreting Results:
◦ Evaluate the absorbance or signal values obtained from the
urine samples and compare them to the calibrators.
◦ Positive results indicate the presence of PCP at or above
the cutoff concentration (typically 25 ng/mL).
◦ Negative results indicate the absence of detectable PCP or
levels below the cutoff concentration.
3. Confirmatory Testing:
◦ If an initial screen result is positive, confirmatory testing by
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) should
be conducted.
7c. Post-Analytical Procedures:
1. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure all positive results are reported as "preliminary
positive" until confirmed by GC-MS.
◦ Review and interpret the results following the laboratory's
reporting guidelines.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all steps in the log book or electronic tracking
system, including preparation, testing, QC, and result entry.
◦ Maintain all records as per regulatory requirements.
3. Quality Assurance:
◦ Regularly review and calibrate equipment according to QC
schedules.
◦ Ensure proficiency testing is conducted as required.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If QC results are out of the range, do not proceed with patient
sample testing. Investigate and resolve the issue before resuming
testing.
• Check for pipetting errors, reagent expiration, and equipment
malfunction if inconsistent results are observed.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions and product inserts for the EIA test
kits.
• Laboratory’s Quality Manual and regulatory guidelines from CLIA
and CAP (College of American Pathologists).
10. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document any changes or updates to this SOP, including revision
dates and details of modifications.
