Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Phenobarbital, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of phenobarbital levels in
plasma to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory scientists to perform
the analysis as per this protocol and ensure quality control standards
are maintained.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all samples submitted to the laboratory for
phenobarbital analysis.
1. DEFINITIONS
Phenobarbital: A barbiturate used to control seizures.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or
suitable analytical instrument
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated analytical balance
• Vortex mixer
• Various glassware and plastic ware (e.g., test tubes, syringes,
etc.)
• Phenobarbital calibration standards
• Quality control material
• Reagents and solvents (e.g., methanol, water, extraction solvents)
• Sample tubes for plasma collection
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Plasma collected in EDTA or Lithium Heparin tubes
• Minimum volume: 2 mL
Unacceptable:
• Grossly hemolyzed samples
• Samples with significant lipemia or chylous
• Specimens without proper labeling
• Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STORAGE
• Centrifuge the collected blood specimens at 1500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C to separate the plasma.
• Aliquot the plasma into appropriately labeled tubes immediately.
• Store plasma samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare phenobarbital calibration standards at different
concentrations using certified reference materials.
2. Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw and equilibrate plasma samples to room temperature if
frozen.
2. Vortex to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 200 μL of plasma into a clean test tube.
Protein Precipitation and Extraction:
1. Add 600 μL of methanol (or suitable extraction solvent) to the
plasma sample.
2. Vortex thoroughly for 30 seconds.
3. Centrifuge at 3000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
4. Carefully transfer the supernatant into a clean test tube,
avoiding the precipitate.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Program the HPLC system according to the instrument-specific
parameters.
2. Inject a suitable volume (e.g., 20 μL) of the extracted sample
into the HPLC system.
3. Analyze using an analytical column appropriate for
phenobarbital detection.
Data Acquisition and Processing:
1. Utilize the data acquisition software to monitor analytes and
record chromatograms.
2. Quantify phenobarbital concentrations in plasma by comparing
the peak areas of the samples with calibration standards.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples along with patient samples.
• Ensure QC results are within the acceptable range as per the
laboratory’s criteria.
• If QC fails, investigate and take corrective action before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the chromatograms for each sample to ensure no
interference or anomalies.
• Verify the phenobarbital concentrations calculated via the
software.
• Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring accurate transcription.
• Follow site-specific procedures for result validation and report
generation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal therapeutic range for phenobarbital in plasma: 10-40 μg/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential interference from other compounds must be evaluated.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric samples may affect analysis.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all biological samples with care and appropriate PPE
(gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
• Use solvents and chemicals within a fume hood and follow safety
data sheet (SDS) guidelines.
