Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Phenobarbital, Serum
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of phenobarbital in serum for therapeutic drug
monitoring and management, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis as outlined in this procedure, maintaining
accurate records, and ensuring quality control measures are
followed.

1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Phenobarbital Calibration Standards
• Phenobarbital Control Sera
• Mobile Phase (as specified by the instrument’s operational
manual)
• Internal Standard (if applicable)
• HPLC grade water, methanol, acetonitrile
Supplies:
• Autosampler vials
• Syringes and filters for HPLC sample preparation
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls
• Prepare calibration standards at the following concentrations: 5,
10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL.
• Quality controls should include low, medium, and high levels (15,
40, and 75 μg/mL).
• Store standards and controls as per manufacturer’s instructions.
4.2 Sample Preparation
• Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
• Centrifuge specimen tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant serum to clean, appropriately labeled,
autosampler vials.
4.3 Instrument Preparation
• Initialize HPLC system following manufacturer’s instructions.
• Prime and condition the HPLC column with the mobile phase.
• Configure the UV detector to the appropriate wavelength for
phenobarbital detection (typically 204 nm).
4.4 Sample Analysis
• Load calibration standards, quality control materials, and patient
samples into the HPLC autosampler.
• Inject each sample (e.g., 10 μL) into the HPLC system.
• Ensure each sample run includes at least one blank, standard,
and control per batch.
• Begin the analysis sequence and monitor the chromatographic
run.
4.5 Calculation and Result Verification
• Use the calibration curve to quantify phenobarbital concentration
in each serum sample.
• Verify all control samples fall within the acceptable range (± 20%
of the target value).
• Review chromatograms to ensure there is no interference or
abnormal peaks.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze the quality control materials with each analytical run.
• If control results are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
repeat the analysis.
• Periodically (e.g., monthly) participate in external proficiency
testing to ensure ongoing accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the phenobarbital serum concentration to the nearest 0.1
μg/mL.
• Reference range: Therapeutic: 15 - 40 μg/mL; Critical value: > 60
μg/mL.
• Document and notify the physician of any critical results
immediately, and ensure this communication is documented.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 15 - 40 μg/mL
• Toxic level: > 60 μg/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Severe hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can interfere with accurate
quantification.
• Ensure samples are free from particulates and avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
