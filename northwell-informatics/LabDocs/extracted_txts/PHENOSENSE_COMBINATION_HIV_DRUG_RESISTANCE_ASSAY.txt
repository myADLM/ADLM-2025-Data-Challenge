Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PHENOSENSE
COMBINATION HIV DRUG RESISTANCE ASSAY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for conducting the
PHENOSENSE COMBINATION HIV DRUG RESISTANCE ASSAY,
ensuring accurate and reproducible results for HIV drug resistance
profiling.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, documenting the process, and reporting the results according
to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure compliance with this procedure and address any issues that
may arise during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen type: Plasma.
• Volume: Minimum of 5 mL of plasma.
• Transport and storage conditions: Specimens should be stored at
-70°C if not processed within 24 hours of collection. Thaw
specimens at room temperature before testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PHENOSENSE COMBINATION HIV DRUG RESISTANCE
ASSAY Kit.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge capable of handling plasma samples.
• Freezer (-70°C) for specimen storage.
• Room temperature incubator.
• Analytical instrumentation specified in the assay kit.
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other PPE.
• Temperature and humidity monitoring devices.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Thaw plasma specimens at room temperature.
2. If multiple tests need to be run, aliquot the plasma into separate
tubes to avoid repeat freeze-thaw cycles.
B. Assay Setup
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reagent
preparation as outlined in the PHENOSENSE
COMBINATION HIV DRUG RESISTANCE ASSAY Kit insert.
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates.
2. Specimen Processing:
◦ Prepare the plasma specimens according to the instructions
provided in the kit.
◦ Label all tubes clearly with patient identification and test
identifiers.
◦ Perform a centrifugation step if required by the kit protocol
to clarify plasma.
C. Running the Assay
1. Loading Specimens and Reagents:
◦ Load prepared specimens and reagents onto the analytical
instrument as per the kit instructions.
◦ Follow all safety precautions when handling specimens and
reagents.
2. Incubation and Analysis:
◦ Set the incubation times and temperatures as specified in
the assay protocol.
◦ Ensure all analytical measurements are recorded and
monitor the equipment for any alerts or alarms during the
assay.
D. Documentation and Quality Control
1. Log-keeping:
◦ Document the date, time, and initials of the individual
performing each step of the assay.
◦ Record ambient temperature and humidity for room
conditions, ensuring they are within 15-85% relative
humidity and 20-26°C.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run the appropriate positive and negative controls
according to the instructions.
◦ Document control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding to analyze patient
specimens.
◦ If control results are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's protocol and
notify the supervisor.
E. Result Analysis and Reporting
1. Result Generation:
◦ Review the raw data generated by the assay using the
specified software.
◦ Ensure that the data are correctly interpreted according to
the assay guidelines.
2. Verification and Reporting:
◦ Result data are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
◦ Verify the accuracy and consistency of the results by cross-
referencing control data and analysis protocols.
◦ Supervise critical results to ensure proper documentation
and notification where required.
3. Critical Results Handling:
◦ Report critical values as defined by the assay kit protocol.
◦ Follow the Repeat Critical Values guidelines for results that
have been previously reported.
F. Analyte Unavailability Protocol
1. Reporting Analyte Unavailability:
◦ In cases where an analyte is unavailable, report using the
statement: “Analyte unavailable due to instrument error.”
◦ Notify the supervisor and explore alternative analytical
approaches where necessary.

1. REVIEW AND UPDATE
This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
incorporate new techniques, updated manufacturer guidelines, and
changes in best laboratory practices. Review date and reviewer’s
initials must be documented.:
Reviewer: Laboratory Supervisor or Designated Senior Staff Review
Date: Annually or as required
