SOP for Analytical Phase of PHENOSENSE ENTRY HIV DRUG
RESISTANCE ASSAY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for PHENOSENSE ENTRY HIV
DRUG RESISTANCE ASSAY in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff will perform the assay following the SOP, ensure all
test results are accurately documented, and maintain proper function
and calibration of all equipment used. Supervisors are responsible for
the review and verification of test results and adherence to quality
control guidelines.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• EDTA plasma samples collected and processed according to
standardized protocols.
• Plasma samples should be stored at -70°C or lower after
collection if not processed immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples collected in other anticoagulants (e.g., heparin).
• Samples with significant hemolysis, contamination, or improper
labeling.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Biosafety cabinet/Class II hood
• Freezer (for plasma storage)
• PCR and qPCR machines
• Plate readers
• Microcentrifuges
Reagents:
• PCR Master Mix with enzyme and nucleotides
• Specific primers for HIV drug resistance regions
• Probes for detection
• Control samples (positive and negative controls)
• RNA extraction kits
Supplies:
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR plates
• Gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURE
a) RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw plasma samples on ice.
2. Using the RNA extraction kit, process samples following
manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Quantify extracted RNA using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
or equivalent.
b) cDNA Synthesis:
1. Prepare cDNA synthesis reaction mix.
2. Follow thermal cycling parameters for cDNA synthesis as per kit
instructions.
3. Store synthesized cDNA at -20°C until use.
c) PCR Amplification of Target Regions:
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix with properly diluted primers and
probes.
2. Aliquot the reaction mix into PCR plates or tubes.
3. Add cDNA samples and controls to the respective wells/tubes.
4. Run PCR using specific cycling parameters.
d) Detection and Quantification:
1. Post-PCR, run qPCR to detect amplified HIV regions
associated with drug resistance.
2. Collect data on amplification curves and Ct values for all
samples and controls.
e) Data Analysis:
1. Calculate the resistance rates based on Ct values and
predefined thresholds.
2. Use software to interpret susceptibility patterns across a variety
of HIV drugs.
3. Perform duplicate or triplicate runs to ensure reproducibility.
f) Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Ensure all equipment is calibrated as needed.
3. Document any deviations or anomalies and troubleshoot as
required.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reviewed and verified by designated technologists.
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Generate clinical reports including interpretation for drug
resistance.
4. Store data securely and maintain records per laboratory
protocols.
