SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
PHENOSENSE HIV Drug Resistance and Replication Capacity
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for carrying out the analytical phase of
generating results for PHENOSENSE HIV Drug Resistance and
Replication Capacity assays to detect drug resistance and replication
capacity of the HIV virus. This includes appropriate handling, testing,
quality control, and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
Authorized laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
PHENOSENSE HIV Drug Resistance and Replication Capacity
assay, documenting all observations and results, and ensuring all
quality control procedures are followed.
2. DEFINITION
The PHENOSENSE HIV Drug Resistance and Replication Capacity
assay is designed to precisely determine the resistance of HIV-1 to
antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and assess the replication capacity of the
virus. This test involves cell culture-based phenotypic analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Plasma.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect whole blood in EDTA tubes.
• Plasma should be separated within 6 hours of collection.
• Centrifuge tube for 15 minutes at 1500g and carefully separate
plasma.
• Transfer plasma to a polypropylene transport tube and store at
-70°C if not tested immediately.
Specimen Handling and Transport:
• Keep specimens on dry ice if transportation is required.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Ship specimens to the testing laboratory with optimal
preservation.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been subjected to multiple freeze-thaw
cycles.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens that were not stored properly (i.e., not stored at
-70°C).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Class II biosafety cabinet
• Centrifuge
• 96-well tissue culture plates
• Cell culture media, serum-free medium, and fetal bovine serum
(FBS)
• PHENOSENSE assay kit including appropriate reagents and
enzymes
• PCR instruments
• Incubator (37°C with 5% CO2)
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples quickly at 37°C in a water bath, and
promptly place on ice. Minimize time samples spend at room
temperature.
2. Prepare necessary reagents from the PHENOSENSE assay kit.
3. Prepare a 96-well plate by adding 100 μL of culture medium to
each well.
B. Virus Culture:
1. Transfer 100 μL of each thawed plasma sample to respective
wells containing culture medium.
2. Add 100 μL of target cells (MT-2 or target cell line specified in
the assay kit) to each well.
3. Incubate the plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours.
4. Monitor the plates for cytopathic effect to confirm virus
replication.
C. Drug Susceptibility Assay:
1. Add antiviral drugs at varying concentrations to respective
experimental wells as indicated in the assay kit protocol.
2. Continue incubation under the same conditions for 72 hours.
3. Employ the appropriate assay kit-reported method to measure
drug susceptibility.
D. Replication Capacity Measurement:
1. Conduct a viability assay for measuring viral replication using
appropriate markers (e.g., luminescent or colorimetric markers)
specified in the assay protocol.
2. Use a plate reader to quantify the replication capacity of the
virus by evaluating the degree of cell viability or metabolic
activity.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run internal controls from the assay kit with each batch of
clinical samples.
2. Analyze positive and negative control samples to check for
consistency.
3. Perform calibration of equipment according to manufacturer’s
instructions and document these processes.
4. Include replicate wells for all samples to ensure precision and
reliability.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Interpretation of Results:
• Compare the inhibition of viral replication in the presence of drugs
with control wells.
• Determine the IC50 values for each drug tested.
• Define drug resistance categories (sensitive, intermediate,
resistant) based on standard criteria provided in the assay
documentation.
• Calculate the replication capacity relative to a wild-type virus
control.
B. Documentation and Review:
• Document all results, including control samples, calculations for
IC50, and interpretation in the laboratory data management
system.
• Review results for accuracy and potential anomalies before
results are reported.
• Cross-check results with a second trained technologist if required.
C. Reporting:
• Record the final interpreted results in the laboratory information
system.
• Report results promptly to the requesting physician, including the
percent inhibition, IC50 values, drug resistance categorizations,
and replication capacity.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Drug Sensitivity:
◦ Sensitive: IC50 < cutoff value defined per drug
◦ Intermediate: IC50 within defined intermediate range
◦ Resistant: IC50 > cutoff value defined per drug
• Replication Capacity:
◦ Expressed as a percentage of wild-type control.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Samples must be handled with care to avoid degradation.
• Adherence to incubation times and temperatures is critical.
• Variability due to biological differences between samples.
