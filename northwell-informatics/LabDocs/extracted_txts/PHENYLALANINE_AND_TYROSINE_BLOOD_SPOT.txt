PHENYLALANINE AND TYROSINE, BLOOD SPOT SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and timely measurement of phenylalanine and
tyrosine levels in blood spot specimens using a specified assay
method. This protocol ensures reliable monitoring for metabolic
disorders such as Phenylketonuria (PKU).
Responsibility:
All technologists and laboratory personnel involved in the receipt,
analysis, quality control, and reporting of phenylalanine and tyrosine
levels are responsible for adhering to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Dried blood spot (DBS) on Whatman 903 filter paper or equivalent
• Collected as per the neonatal screening guidelines: a few drops of
blood collected from a heel prick or finger prick, absorbed onto
the filter paper, and allowed to dry completely at room
temperature.
2.2. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Blood spots significantly contaminated or smeared.
• Insufficient blood volume on the filter paper.
• Blood spots not dried properly or wet during shipping.
• Specimens collected on non-approved filter paper.
• Specimens without appropriate labeling or identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1. Equipment:
• Tandem Mass Spectrometer (MS/MS)
• Puncher for DBS cards (3 mm diameter)
• Centrifuge
• Microtiter plates
• Automated liquid handling system (if available)
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips (0.5—1000 µL range)
3.2. Reagents:
• Phenylalanine and Tyrosine calibration standards
• Internal standards (isotopically labeled phenylalanine and
tyrosine)
• Extraction solution (e.g., Methanol with 0.1% formic acid)
• Mobile phase for MS/MS (e.g., Water with 0.1% formic acid;
Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid)
3.3. Supplies:
• Whatman 903 filter paper
• 96-well plates
• Sealing foil for 96-well plates
• Gloves
• Laboratory markers
• Specimen accession numbering system/logbook
1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify specimen integrity and identification.
2. Punch out a 3 mm diameter disc from the DBS card and place it
in one well of a 96-well plate.
3. Add internal standard solution to each well (volume depending
on assay requirements).
4.2. Extraction:
1. Add the specified volume of extraction solution (e.g., 100 µL of
methanol with 0.1% formic acid) to each well.
2. Seal the plate with sealing foil and mix by vortexing for 2
minutes.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes with
gentle shaking.
4.3. Centrifugation:
1. Centrifuge the plate at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet any
debris.
4.4. MS/MS Analysis:
1. Transfer the supernatant to a clean 96-well plate appropriate for
the MS/MS analysis.
2. Load the plate into the tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Set up the MS/MS using a validated method, including the
setup of guard and analytical columns, mobile phase
composition, and gradient profiles.
4. Analyze the samples using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
to quantify phenylalanine and tyrosine levels.
4.5. Data Analysis:
1. Utilize software for instrument control to process raw data files.
2. Identify and quantify phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations
using internal standards for calibration.
3. Verify the calibration curve and calculate sample concentrations
based on standard responses.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1. Internal Quality Control:
• Run quality control (QC) samples at different concentration levels
(low, medium, high) with each analysis batch.
• Review QC results to ensure they fall within established limits
before accepting patient results.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures by re-calibration,
instrument maintenance, or re-extraction.
5.2. External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in a proficiency testing program to maintain reliable
and accurate performance standards.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1. Results Verification:
• Review all data for quality and accuracy.
• Any result that does not pass internal QC must be reassessed
and re-analyzed if necessary.
6.2. Reporting:
• Report phenylalanine and tyrosine levels in µmol/L.
• Flag results that are outside of the reference ranges or clinically
significant.
• All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being transmitted or reported to the healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Phenylalanine:
• Normal Range: 30—120 µmol/L
• Abnormal Range (indicating PKU): > 120 µmol/L
Tyrosine:
• Normal Range: 20—100 µmol/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ High Hemoglobin concentrations may interfere with analyte
quantification.
◦ Ensure proper drying and storage of DBS to avoid
degradation of amino acids.
