STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
PHENYLALANINE AND TYROSINE IN PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and procedures for the accurate and reliable
determination of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in plasma
samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of phenylalanine and tyrosine in
plasma samples collected and received in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP and ensure all procedures are carried out as described. The
laboratory supervisor will oversee the adherence to this protocol and
address any issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Plasma
Collection: Use EDTA or heparinized tubes.
Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of plasma.
Handling: Centrifuge collected blood at 1,500 x g for 10-15 minutes at
4°C to separate plasma. Transfer plasma to a clean, labeled tube.
Storage: Plasma samples should be stored at -20°C or colder until
analysis. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Stability: Plasma samples are stable for up to one month at -20°C
and up to one year at -70°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system
• Autosampler vials
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Nitrogen evaporator
• Analytical balance
• Reagents:
◦ Phenylalanine and tyrosine standards
◦ Internal standard solution (e.g., deuterated phenylalanine and
tyrosine)
◦ Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, methanol, acetonitrile,
formic acid)
◦ Sample diluent (e.g., 50% methanol)
◦ Quality control materials
6. CALIBRATION AND STANDARDS PREPARATION
1. Calibration Curve Preparation:
◦ Prepare a series of phenylalanine and tyrosine standard
solutions in the sample diluent covering the expected range
of concentrations in patient samples.
◦ Include an internal standard at a fixed concentration in each
standard solution.
◦ Prepare a 7-point calibration curve ranging from low to high
anticipated concentrations.
2. Quality Control (QC):
◦ Prepare high, medium, and low concentration QC samples
from a different lot of phenylalanine and tyrosine standards
to validate the accuracy and precision of the assay.
7. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample for 10-15 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 100 µL of plasma sample into a labeled autosampler
vial.
4. Add 10 µL of the internal standard solution to each vial.
5. Vortex the mixture for 10 seconds.
6. Add 300 µL of cold methanol to precipitate proteins.
7. Vortex for 30 seconds and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C.
8. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean autosampler vial.
9. Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen at room
temperature.
10. Reconstitute the dried residue in 100 µL of the mobile phase.
11. Vortex for 10 seconds and transfer to an autosampler for
injection.
8. LC-MS/MS ANALYSIS
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Ensure the system is calibrated and perform the necessary
maintenance checks (e.g., column conditioning, equipment
calibration).
3. Inject 10 µL of each prepared sample, standard, and QC into
the LC-MS/MS system.
4. Utilize a suitable chromatographic column (e.g., C18) with a
mobile phase gradient consisting of water (with 0.1% formic
acid) and acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid).
5. The typical gradient program might start with 5% acetonitrile
and increase to 90% over 10 minutes, followed by re-
equilibration.
6. Detect the phenylalanine and tyrosine using the mass
spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.
9. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Analyze the chromatography data using the LC-MS/MS
software.
2. Construct a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratios of
phenylalanine and tyrosine to the internal standard against their
respective concentrations.
3. Use the calibration curve to determine the concentrations of
phenylalanine and tyrosine in the plasma samples.
4. Ensure all QC samples are within the defined acceptable limits
before reporting the patient results.
5. Report the concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine in
micromolar (µM) units.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include QC samples in each run to monitor assay performance.
2. Review the QC data to ensure that they are within the
established ranges before accepting the sample results.
3. Perform periodic instrument maintenance and calibration as per
manufacturer recommendations.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Phenylalanine: 35–85 µM (refer to local laboratory-specific
reference ranges)
• Tyrosine: 30–120 µM (refer to local laboratory-specific reference
ranges)
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Low recovery or signal: Check sample preparation steps for
any missed steps or errors. Verify the integrity of the reagents
and solvents.
2. Poor chromatography: Check the condition of the
chromatographic column and mobile phase composition.
Perform necessary system maintenance.
3. Calibration failure: Ensure the standard solutions are
prepared correctly and the internal standard is added
accurately.
