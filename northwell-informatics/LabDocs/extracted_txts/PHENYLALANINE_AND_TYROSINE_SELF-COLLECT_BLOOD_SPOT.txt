Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
PHENYLALANINE AND TYROSINE ANALYSIS IN DRIED BLOOD
SPOTS
1. Purpose
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of
phenylalanine and tyrosine levels in blood collected on filter paper
(dried blood spots - DBS), ensuring accurate, precise and
reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the test as per the protocol.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to ensure
compliance with the procedures, including any corrective actions
that may be required.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: DBS collected on standardized filter paper.
• Collection: Self-collection with instructions provided.
• Storage:
◦ Specimens should be stored at room temperature in a dry,
dark place.
◦ Avoid exposure to direct sunlight.
◦ Specimens are stable at room temperature for up to 14 days.
• Handling: Ensure specimens are appropriately labeled with
patient identifier and date of collection.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Samples not collected on standardized filter paper.
• Specimens with insufficient blood quantity.
• Specimens that are wet, contaminated, hemolyzed, or exhibit
signs of damage.
• Specimens missing collection date or proper identification.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Centrifuge
• Microtiter plates
• Puncher for DBS
• Solvents (methanol, water)
• Extraction buffer
• Standard solutions of phenylalanine and tyrosine
• Internal standards
• Mobile phase (HPLC): Aqueous solution (e.g., 0.1% formic acid in
water) and Organic solution (e.g., acetonitrile)
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with Fluorescence Detector or Mass Spectrometer
1. Preparation of Standards and Quality Control Material
• Prepare standard solutions of phenylalanine and tyrosine at
varying concentrations.
• Prepare and store quality control (QC) samples at low, medium,
and high concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine.
1. Procedure
A. Preparation of DBS Extraction
1. Punch out three 3.2mm diameter discs from each DBS
specimen into microtiter plate wells.
2. Add 100 µL of extraction buffer to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle shaking.
B. Sample Extraction
1. Centrifuge the microtiter plate at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes to
ensure thorough extraction.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean microtiter plate for
analysis.
C. Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Analysis using HPLC
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Condition the column with the mobile phase.
3. Inject 10 µL of each sample extract, standard solution, and QC
sample into the HPLC system.
4. Program the HPLC gradient elution for phenylalanine and
tyrosine separation.
5. Set the detector at the appropriate wavelengths to monitor
phenylalanine and tyrosine peaks.
6. Analyze samples according to the HPLC method developed
and optimized for phenylalanine and tyrosine detection.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Quantify phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations using
calibration curves generated from standard solutions.
2. Verify that QC sample results fall within the established
confidence limits.
3. Compare patient sample results to reference ranges.
4. Quality Control
• Perform QC checks with every batch of samples analyzed.
• Each new lot of reagents and DBS punchers must be validated
prior to use.
• Conduct intra-laboratory QC assessments bi-weekly and inter-
laboratory assessments monthly.
• Ensure the HPLC system passes performance checks before
running patient samples.
• Document all QC data and take immediate corrective action if QC
fails.
1. Reporting Results
• Verify and validate results having ensured all QC checks are
passed.
• Report results to the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review and release.
1. Reference Intervals
The reference intervals for phenylalanine and tyrosine should be
defined based on the population studies and reviewed periodically:
• Phenylalanine: 30–120 µmol/L
• Tyrosine: 40–135 µmol/L
1. Result Limitations
• Ensure samples are properly dried and stored to avoid
degradation.
• Possible hemolysis or contamination issues must be monitored
and samples rejected where integrity is compromised.
Reporting protocol:
Phenylalanine <30 µmol/L: Normal range. Phenylalanine 30–120
µmol/L: Elevated range; potential screening follow-up. Phenylalanine
>120 µmol/L: Critically high; requires immediate clinical attention.

• CLIA regulatory requirements up to October 2023.
• Manufacturer's instructions for HPLC system.
• Published literature on reference ranges for phenylalanine and
tyrosine in blood.
Record keeping:
All records of temperature monitoring, lot validation, QC, and patient
results must be documented and retained for a minimum of two
years.
End of SOP: Review and updates should be in accordance with
regulatory compliance and technological advancements.
