Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PHENYLALANINE DISORDERS GENE
PANEL, VARIES
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed and standardized
procedure for the analysis of the Phenylalanine Disorders Gene
Panel, ensuring accurate, reliable, and reproducible results in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel involved in the analytical phase of the
Phenylalanine Disorders Gene Panel testing are responsible for
following this SOP precisely. It is the responsibility of the supervising
clinical geneticist to review and validate the final reports.
1. Definition
Phenylalanine Disorders Gene Panel: A comprehensive genetic test
designed to detect mutations in genes associated with phenylalanine
metabolism disorders, including phenylketonuria (PKU).
Target genes may include but are not limited to PAH, PTS, GCH1,
and QDPR.
1. Procedure
A. Pre-Analytical Requirements
1. Verify that the specimen is appropriately labeled and has been
accessioned correctly.
2. Review the patient’s demographic information and clinical
history for quality assurance.
3. Ensure that the specimen meets the laboratory’s acceptance
criteria (e.g., type, volume, stability conditions).
B. DNA Extraction
1. Record all patient identifiers and specimen details in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Extract DNA from the submitted specimen using a validated
extraction method (e.g., automated DNA extractor).
3. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer and assess purity
(A260/A280 ratio).
4. Aliquot DNA and store at –20°C until ready for library
preparation.
C. Library Preparation
1. Use a validated library preparation kit compatible with the
sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina).
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions precisely, including steps
for DNA fragmentation, end repair, adaptor ligation, and
amplification.
3. Assess the quality and quantity of the prepared library using a
validated method (e.g., bioanalyzer).
D. Target Enrichment
1. Use a validated gene panel kit to capture the genes of interest.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for hybridization and
enrichment of the target sequences.
3. Purify the enriched DNA using magnetic beads and assess
quality and quantity.
E. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Load the prepared and enriched library onto the NGS platform
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Configure the sequencing run parameters (e.g., read length,
number of cycles) according to the specific requirements of the
gene panel.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality control (e.g., cluster
density, Q30 scores).
F. Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline for
analysis.
2. Perform alignment of reads to the human reference genome
(e.g., GRCh38) using a validated aligner.
3. Identify variants using a validated variant caller.
4. Annotate and prioritize variants based on clinical significance
using an appropriate database (e.g., ClinVar).
5. Apply stringent quality control filters (e.g., read depth, allele
frequency) to ensure accurate variant calls.
G. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the filtered variant list for potential pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance.
2. Interpret the clinical relevance of identified variants considering
the patient's clinical history.
3. Compile the final report including:
◦ Patient identification and clinical history.
◦ Methodology and limitations of the test.
◦ Identified variants with their clinical significance.
◦ Recommendations for follow-up testing or genetic
counseling, if applicable.
4. Have the supervising clinical geneticist review and sign off on
the final report.
H. Quality Control and Assurance
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of results.
2. Participate in external proficiency testing programs for further
validation.
3. Routinely audit the process and update the SOP as required to
reflect the most current best practices and regulatory
requirements.
4. Handling Unexpected Results
5. If a previously undocumented variant of unknown significance is
detected, re-test to confirm the result.
6. Collaborate with geneticists for interpretation of rare variants.
7. Document any troubleshooting steps and corrective actions
taken.
Documentation:
• Temperature logs for all equipment used.
• Quality control logs.
• DNA quantification and purity records.
• Sequencing run reports.
• Bioinformatics analysis logs.
• Final report sign-off sheet.
References:
• Manufacturer’s user manuals for DNA extraction, library
preparation kits, and sequencing platforms.
• Current literature on phenylalanine disorder genetics.
• Relevant clinical practice guidelines and regulatory requirements.
This SOP is to be reviewed and updated annually or when new
relevant information is available.
