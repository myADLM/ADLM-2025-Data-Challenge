Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative Analysis
of Phenylalanine/Tyrosine in Blood
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and
precise quantification of phenylalanine and tyrosine in blood
specimens using appropriate analytical techniques, and to
maintain consistent and reliable results for clinical
assessments.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for following this SOP and recording all necessary information during
analysis to ensure data integrity.
1. DEFINITIONS Phenylalanine and Tyrosine: Amino acids that
are typically quantified for assessing metabolic disorders such
as phenylketonuria (PKU) and tyrosinemia.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Liquid Chromatography with tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) instrument
• Analytical balance
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Phenylalanine and Tyrosine standard solutions
• Quality control samples
• Sample vials
• Dilution solvent (e.g., methanol)
• Internal standard solution (e.g., stable isotope-labeled
phenylalanine and tyrosine)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable:
• Blood collected in EDTA tubes/Heparinized vacutainer tubes
• Volume of 2-4 mL
Unacceptable:
• Samples with hemolysis or clotting
• Specimens not stored under refrigeration if delay in transportation
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
2. Allow blood samples to reach room temperature.
3. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
plasma.
4. Aliquot plasma into labeled vials.
5. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples using
known concentrations.
6. Add internal standard solution to each specimen and vortex to
mix.
B. Extraction
1. To each aliquoted plasma sample, add extraction solvent (e.g.,
methanol).
2. Vortex samples for adequate mixing.
3. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer supernatant to clean, labeled vials.
C. LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Program the instrument to analyze samples for phenylalanine
and tyrosine.
3. Inject the prepared samples, calibration standards, and quality
control samples into the LC-MS/MS.
4. Record the data generated by the instrument.
5. Ensure the instrument is calibrated before sample analysis and
quality controls are within acceptable limits.
D. Data Analysis
1. Review the chromatograms for phenylalanine and tyrosine
peaks.
2. Use software to quantify concentrations based on calibration
curve.
3. Validate the quantification by comparing with quality control
samples.
4. Document the results and any deviations or issues.
E. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples daily and with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Record quality control results and ensure they are within
acceptable limits.
3. Investigate any out-of-range quality control results for
instrument issues or sample handling errors.
4. REPORTING RESULTS Refer to site-specific guidelines for
reporting results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a technologist
before transmitting to the patient's medical record.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Phenylalanine: [Specify range] µmol/L
• Tyrosine: [Specify range] µmol/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to instrument and reagent manufacturer inserts for specific
limitations.
• Review potential interference substances and ensure samples are
appropriately handled.

inserts.
Note: The values, procedures, and specifics should be adjusted
based on the equipment, reagents, and standards used in your
laboratory setup.
