STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE: PHENYTOIN, FREE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the quantitative determination of
free phenytoin levels in serum samples using immunoassay
methodologies. The accurate measurement of free phenytoin is
critical for therapeutic drug monitoring and ensuring effective patient
management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP precisely to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results. Any deviations or anomalies in the procedure must be
reported to the supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube (no gel) is the preferred
specimen type.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 4 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C): 3 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA, citrate, or heparin
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes
Reagents:
• Quality control materials: two levels (Low and High)
• Calibrators: stock solution and working standards for phenytoin
• Phosphate-buffered saline or other appropriate diluent
Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Storage vials and labels
• Waste disposal containers
5. PROCEDURE
A. Reception and Preparation
1. Upon receipt, inspect the specimen for suitability. Reject any
specimens that are hemolyzed or improperly labeled.
2. Centrifuge the serum sample for 10 minutes at 1,500 g to
ensure the sample is clear and free from particulate matter.
3. Aliquot the serum into labeled storage vials if not processed
immediately. Store at the appropriate temperature per the
stability guidelines.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibrators according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Run calibrators to establish a standard curve. Ensure all
calibrator levels fall within the expected concentration ranges.
3. Analyze quality control materials at the start of each run, after
every 25 samples, and at the end of each run to ensure system
performance.
4. Document calibration and quality control results in the
appropriate logs. If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot and resolve the issue before proceeding with
patient samples.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the specific
manufacturer's protocol for phenytoin, free, serum.
2. Load prepared serum samples, calibrators, and QC materials
onto the analyzer.
3. Initiate the run. Monitor the analyzer for errors or flags during
the processing of samples.
4. Once the run is complete, review the raw data and ensure all
instrument checks are within acceptable limits.
D. Reporting Results
1. Calculate the concentration of free phenytoin in patient samples
using the established standard curve.
2. Review and verify all results obtained. All critical results should
be flagged and reported following the laboratory's critical value
policy.
3. Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). Results must be reviewed and authorized by a
qualified technologist before release.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control with each analytical run using the
provided controls.
• If a QC sample fails to meet the established criteria, investigate
the source of error, take corrective actions, and re-analyze the
affected samples.
• Maintain documentation of all QC activities, including lot numbers,
expiration dates, results, and any corrective actions taken.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that samples are free from lipemia and hemolysis as
these can affect assay performance.
• Cross-reactivity with other medications should be reviewed and
considered when interpreting results.
