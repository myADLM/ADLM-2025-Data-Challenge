STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
PHENYTOIN, TOTAL AND FREE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures to be followed for the
quantitative determination of total and free phenytoin levels in serum
using established analytical methods. Phenytoin measurement is
critical for therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure efficacy while
minimizing toxicity.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
procedures described in this protocol. This includes preparation,
analysis, quality control, and result reporting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type:
◦ Preferred: Serum collected in a red top tube (no gel).
◦ Acceptable: Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Volume:
◦ Minimum of 1 mL of serum for both total and free phenytoin.
• Specimen Handling and Stability:
◦ Collect blood by venipuncture.
◦ Allow serum to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge and
separate the serum within 2 hours of collection.
◦ Store separated serum at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed (stable
for up to 7 days refrigerated).
◦ For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Samples that are improperly labeled or where the collection
date and time are not indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or
immunoassay analyzer
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Calibrators and control standards for phenytoin
• Serum separation tubes
• Red top tubes (no gel)
• centrifuge
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Total Phenytoin Measurement:
1. Preparation:
◦ Review the run queue and check for any specific patient
notes or requests.
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at the
required temperature.
◦ Prepare the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ Aliquot the patient serum into appropriately labeled tubes.
◦ Ensure each aliquot meets the required volume.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load the patient samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis run.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control materials along with patient
specimens.
◦ Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
B) Free Phenytoin Measurement:
1. Preparation:
◦ Complete the ultrafiltration process to obtain free phenytoin
from the serum.
2. Ultrafiltration Process:
◦ Place the serum sample into an ultrafiltration device as per
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Centrifuge at recommended speed and duration to separate
free phenytoin.
3. Analysis:
◦ Collect the filtrate containing free phenytoin.
◦ Load the filtrate onto the analyzer following the same
process as for total phenytoin.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Use appropriate QC materials specifically for free phenytoin.
◦ Ensure QC results are within acceptable limits.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the results for each batch, ensuring consistency and
accuracy.
• Validate and approve results for both total and free phenytoin.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Calculate and report results:
◦ Total Phenytoin: Report in µg/mL.
◦ Free Phenytoin: Report in ng/mL.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Total Phenytoin: 10-20 µg/mL
• Free Phenytoin: 1-2 µg/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run control levels (Low, Medium, High) with each batch.
• QC materials are to be stored between 2-8°C and used before the
expiration date.
• Document all QC results in the QC log and address any outliers
immediately following lab policies.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with the accuracy of results.
• Improper specimen handling may lead to degradation of
phenytoin.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for the respective analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature on phenytoin determination.
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required based on
technological advancements and updated practices within the
laboratory.
