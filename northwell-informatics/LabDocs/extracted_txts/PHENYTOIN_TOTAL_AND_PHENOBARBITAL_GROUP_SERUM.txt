Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for
PHENYTOIN, TOTAL AND PHENOBARBITAL GROUP, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to detail the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Phenytoin, Total and Phenobarbital
Group, Serum. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and
consistent results in compliance with CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
Staff authorized and trained to operate the equipment and perform
assays are responsible for adhering to this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable specimens:
• Serum obtained via venipuncture. Blood should be collected in a
plain red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have not been stored or transported at appropriate
temperatures.
• Samples in incorrect collection tubes.
Specimen stability:
• Serum: Stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
• Refrigerated: Stable at 2-8°C for 7 days.
• Frozen: Store at -20°C or lower for long-term storage.
Note: Ensure specimens are properly labeled with patient
identification and collection time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche COBAS or equivalent)
• Phenytoin and Phenobarbital reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls specific to Phenytoin and Phenobarbital
• Quality control materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Checks:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Centrifuge blood specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
◦ Transfer serum to appropriately labeled secondary tubes if
needed.
◦ Ensure specimens are stored or transported as per stability
requirements.
2. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Ensure the analyzer is calibrated according to manufacturer
guidelines.
◦ Conduct routine maintenance checks and record in the
maintenance log.
◦ Load reagent cartridges for Phenytoin and Phenobarbital as
per manufacturer instructions.
Analytical Procedure:
1. Calibration and Control:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators specific
for Phenytoin and Phenobarbital.
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each run
and after every 24 hours of continuous operation.
◦ Ensure control values fall within acceptable ranges provided
by the manufacturer.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Place specimen tubes in the analyzer's sample rack.
◦ Input patient and specimen information into the analyzer
system.
◦ Select the appropriate assay program for "Phenytoin, Total"
and "Phenobarbital Group".
◦ Follow analyzer instructions to start the analysis.
3. Result Verification:
◦ Upon completion, verify the generated results against
expected values to ensure validity.
◦ Check for flags or error messages and resolve any
discrepancies.
◦ Repeat assays if results fall outside of expected ranges or if
any QC fails.
Post-analytical Procedure:
1. Result Recording:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before final release.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document procedural details, including control and
calibrator performance, in the appropriate logs.
◦ Ensure all actions related to resolving discrepancies are
captured.
3. Specimen and Waste Management:
◦ Retain specimens at 2-8°C for a minimum of one week post-
analysis, or longer if instructed.
◦ Dispose of biohazardous waste and used reagents following
environmental health and safety regulations.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Phenytoin, Total:
• Therapeutic Range: 10-20 µg/mL
Phenobarbital:
• Therapeutic Range: 15-40 µg/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC using both high and low-level controls.
• Results must be within 2 standard deviations (±2 SD) of the
mean.
• Document any corrective actions taken for out-of-range QC
results in the QC log.

By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure consistent and
accurate measurement of Phenytoin and Phenobarbital levels in
patient serum samples, maintaining the integrity and reliability of
patient test results.
This protocol should be reviewed periodically and updated based on
new regulations, advancements in technology, and manufacturer
recommendations.
