Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PHENYTOIN, TOTAL, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
This SOP ensures the consistent and accurate analysis of total
phenytoin levels in plasma to aid in monitoring and managing
therapeutic levels in patients.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP when performing the phenytoin, total, plasma analysis. Any
deviations or issues must be reported to the supervising laboratory
technologist or manager.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Acceptable Specimen Types
• Blood collected in plasma separator tubes (PST) containing
lithium heparin.
• Blood collected in serum separator tubes (SST).
• Blood collected in plain red top tubes (no anticoagulant).
3.2 Specimen Volume
• Minimum volume required: 2 mL of plasma.
• Ideally, collect twice the minimum required volume to ensure
sufficient sample for any repeat testing.
3.3 Specimen Collection and Handling
• After collection, invert tubes gently 5-10 times to mix and promote
proper clot formation (for SST/red top tubes) or proper
anticoagulation (for PST tubes).
• Centrifuge specimens within 2 hours of collection at 1000-2000 x
g for 10-15 minutes.
• Separate plasma/serum aliquot and store at 2-8°C if analysis is to
be delayed for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze aliquots at -20°C or colder.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Calibration and Quality Control Materials: Use commercially
available multi-level phenytoin controls, prepared and stored
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Reagent Cartridges: Use validated, commercially available
reagent kits specific for phenytoin, compatible with the analyzer
used.
• Analytical Instrument: HPLC/GC/MS or automated chemical
analyzer validated for phenytoin analysis.
• Miscellaneous: Pipettes, sample cups, gloves, and other
standard laboratory supplies.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Calibration: Perform calibration of the instrument as per the
manufacturer’s instruction before initial use, after maintenance,
and following changes in reagent lots.
• Quality Control: Analyze at least two levels of phenytoin control
materials (low and high) at the beginning of each assay run.
Results must be within the acceptable range defined by the
laboratory’s standard criteria.
5.2 Sample Analysis
• Preparation of Samples: Bring all plasma samples and quality
control materials to room temperature before analysis.
• Loading Samples: Load aliquots of patient samples and quality
control materials into the sample cups.
• Running the Analyzer: Follow the specific instructions for the
chosen analyzer to run the samples.
◦ Pipette appropriate volume of sample into the reagent
cartridge.
◦ Load the cartridge into the analyzer and start the analysis
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
5.3 Result Review and Reporting
• Data Review: Ensure all quality control results fall within the
acceptable range. If a control does not fall within the acceptable
range, do not report patient results and troubleshoot until
acceptable control results are obtained.
• Reporting: Validate and transmit results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). Record results on the appropriate lab
forms as per laboratory protocol.
• Critical Values: Critical phenytoin levels (>20 µg/mL) must be
reviewed immediately and reported to the relevant clinician
promptly. Document all critical result notifications.
◦ Standard therapeutic range for total phenytoin: 10-20 µg/mL
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Routinely perform maintenance and calibration checks as per the
analyzer manufacturer’s guidelines.
• In case of analyte-specific issues (e.g., high or low phenytoin
levels in control samples), follow troubleshooting guidelines
provided by the reagent and analyzer manufacturers.
• If results are outside acceptable limits and cannot be resolved
through standard troubleshooting steps, notify the supervisory
technologist or laboratory manager.
7. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all calibration, quality control, maintenance,
and troubleshooting activities for a minimum of two years or per
regulatory requirements.
• Ensure documentation of manual entries and electronic records
are accurate and complete.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the phenytoin reagent kits and
analyzers.
• Laboratory quality control and maintenance protocols.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards for therapeutic drug
monitoring.
9. NOTES
• Any deviations or modifications to this protocol must be approved
by the laboratory director.
• Continuous improvement and review of the SOP will be
conducted periodically to ensure compliance with the latest
guidelines and technologies.
By following this standard operating procedure, laboratory staff can
ensure reliable and accurate measurement of total plasma phenytoin
levels, essential for effectively monitoring and managing patient
therapy.
