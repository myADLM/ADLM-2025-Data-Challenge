Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PHENYTOIN, TOTAL,
SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed guidance on the steps necessary for the
accurate and consistent analysis of Phenytoin, Total, in serum
samples. This ensures that high-quality results are generated in a
timely and efficient manner.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all trained personnel in the clinical
laboratory responsible for performing and reporting phenytoin, total,
serum analysis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The clinical laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting
the analysis and ensuring it is performed according to this SOP. It is
the responsibility of the designated supervisor to oversee the entire
process, address any problems, and ensure adherence to quality
control measures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 5 mL serum collected in a red-top tube,
without anticoagulant. Allow the blood to clot at room temperature
and then centrifuge to obtain serum.
• Acceptable: Plasma collected in a lithium heparin tube.
• Unacceptable: Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other
than lithium heparin, contaminated, or hemolyzed specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Clinical chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Dimension)
• Phenytoin reagent kit specific to the analyzer
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator, centrifuge
• Latex gloves, lab coat, safety glasses
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Run the quality control samples as per the manufacturer's
recommendations:
• 2 levels of control (normal and elevated ranges) should be tested
with each batch of specimens.
• Control results must fall within specified ranges; if not, re-calibrate
the instrument and re-test controls.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
2. Verify that the clinical chemistry analyzer is properly calibrated
and functioning correctly.
3. Load calibrators, controls, and reagents onto the instrument
according to manufacturer instructions.
4. Centrifuge the collected blood samples at 1500 g for 10
minutes. Carefully transfer the serum to labeled microcentrifuge
tubes.
B. Loading Specimens
1. Arrange serum aliquots in the designated sample racks.
2. Program the analyzer with the appropriate test parameters for
Total Phenytoin.
3. Load the sample racks onto the analyzer in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions.
C. Analyzing Samples
1. Start the run and monitor the analyzer until the completion of
the testing phase.
2. Note any error messages or alerts to be addressed promptly.
3. Check the quality control results. Ensure that controls fall within
the predetermined acceptable ranges.
4. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
accordingly: recalibrate now and repeat testing if required.
D. Calculation and Documentation of Results
1. Once the analysis is complete, review results of the patient
samples for accuracy and consistency.
2. Print the analyzer report and documentation of the sample
results.
3. Verify and document results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
4. Compare results with reference intervals:
◦ Therapeutic range: 10-20 µg/mL
◦ Toxic: >30 µg/mL
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results before verification.
• Document any critical results and notify the referring physician
immediately per laboratory policy.
• Report results electronically via the LIS according to the lab’s
turnaround time guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range of total phenytoin: 10-20 µg/mL
• Critical values should be reported: ≥30 µg/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure no significant hemolysis or lipemia which could affect
results.
• Ensure no anticoagulant other than lithium heparin is used, which
may interfere with the analysis.
