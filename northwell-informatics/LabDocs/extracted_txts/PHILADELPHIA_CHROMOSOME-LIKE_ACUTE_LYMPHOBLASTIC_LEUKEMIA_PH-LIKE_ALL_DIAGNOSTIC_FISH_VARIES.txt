Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Philadelphia Chromosome-like Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia (PH-like ALL), Diagnostic FISH
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing Fluorescence in situ
Hybridization (FISH) to detect Philadelphia Chromosome-like Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia (PH-like ALL). Utilizing FISH to detect
specific genetic aberrations helps in the diagnosis and prognosis of
PH-like ALL.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all certified laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and document results accordingly. Supervisors
are responsible for training staff and ensuring compliance with this
SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Bone Marrow Aspirate or Peripheral Blood
• Minimum Volume: 2-5 mL
• Collected in Sodium Heparin or EDTA tubes
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens
• Specimens not transported at the controlled temperature
• Specimens received more than 48 hours post-collection
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescent microscopes
• FISH probe sets for PH-like ALL-associated genetic aberrations
• Hybridization chamber
• Cytogenetic media and slide preparation reagents
• PBS buffer and washing solutions
• Mounting medium
• Immersion oil
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation
• Prepare specimens by direct harvest of bone marrow or
peripheral blood
• Place cell suspension onto a clean glass slide, allow to air dry for
15 minutes
B) Probe Hybridization
• Apply pretreatment solution to slides for protein digestion; rinse
slides in PBS
• Denature DNA by immersing slides in denaturation solution; follow
with quick rinse in ice-cold ethanol
• Apply the selected FISH probes to the pretreated areas on slides.
Cover with a coverslip and place in the hybridization chamber
• Hybridize overnight at 37°C
C) Post-Hybridization Wash
• Remove coverslip and wash slides with appropriate stringency
wash buffer to remove unbound probes
• Allow slides to air dry
D) Counterstaining and Visualization
• Apply a drop of DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
counterstain; coverslip and allow it to dry
• Place slides on fluorescence microscope set to appropriate
excitation/emission wavelengths to visualize specific FISH signals
E) Scoring and Interpretation
• Analyze at least 200 interphase nuclei per specimen
• Record number of cells showing normal and abnormal FISH
signals
• Interpret findings using the specific scoring criteria for PH-like ALL
rearrangements
• Anomalies to include: CRLF2 rearrangement, ABL1
rearrangement, PDGFRA/B rearrangement, JAK2 rearrangement
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform FISH analysis under normal QC conditions including
appropriate control samples (positive and negative controls)
• Validation of new probe lots: test new lots on set of established
normal and abnormal samples
• Documentation of QC results and any corrective actions taken if
necessary
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings on standardized reporting form
• Report significant rearrangements and any other diagnostic
findings
• If no PH-like ALL-associated rearrangements observed, specify in
report
• Include interpretation and diagnostic relevance
• Ensure report accuracy: review and verification process prior to
release
• Transmit results to attending physician and relevant healthcare
provider teams as dictated by laboratory policy
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpret results according to established reference intervals and
compare against clinical diagnostic and prognostic criteria for PH-like
ALL.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• FISH analysis may produce ambiguous results if specimen quality
is compromised or hybridization efficiency is suboptimal
• Limited resolve to visualize cryptic chromosomal rearrangements
may necessitate supplementary diagnostic testing
