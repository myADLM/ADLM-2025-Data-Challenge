1. PURPOSE
The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
describe the analytical process for the quantitation of Immunoglobulin
E (IgE) levels in serum using the PHOMA BETAE assay. This SOP
ensures accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test results for
patient care and diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing IgE
determinations in serum using the PHOMA BETAE kit assay.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP. It is also the responsibility of the supervising laboratory
manager to ensure that laboratory staff are informed and trained to
follow this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Serum
• Collection:
◦ Preferred: Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifugation: After clotting, centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10
minutes at room temperature to separate serum.
• Handling:
◦ Transport serum samples in a cool condition, avoiding
exposure to heat.
◦ Serum must be refrigerated (2-8°C) if not analyzed
immediately; for prolonged storage (more than 72 hours),
freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• PHOMA BETAE, IgE Detection Kit
• 96-well microtiter plate reader
• Adjustable micropipettes and pipette tips
• Distilled or deionized water
• Calibrated microcentrifuge
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Timer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
• A. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, serum samples, and kit standards to room
temperature (20-25°C) prior to starting the assay.
◦ Prepare and label required number of wells on the 96-well
microtiter plate.
• B. Assay Steps:
1. Standards and Samples:
▪ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples as required.
▪ Add 100 µL of each standard or control into their
respective wells.
▪ Add 100 µL of serum samples (diluted if necessary) into
the designated wells.
2. Incubation:
▪ Cover the plate with an adhesive strip and incubate the
plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash:
▪ After incubation, aspirate the contents of the wells.
▪ Fill each well with washing buffer (300 µL) and repeat
the aspirating process three times.
4. Addition of Enzyme Conjugate:
▪ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well, cover,
and incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Final Wash:
▪ Repeat the wash step as described.
6. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for
10-15 minutes.
7. Stop Reaction:
▪ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well. The color in the
wells should change from blue to yellow.
8. Measurement:
▪ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm
using a microtiter plate reader.
• C. Calculations:
1. Create a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their corresponding concentration.
2. Use the standard curve to determine the IgE concentrations
in the patient samples.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run all controls with each assay to ensure accuracy and
precision.
• The results for controls must fall within the specified range
provided by the kit manufacturer.
• Failure to meet control specifications indicates the need for assay
repeat and investigation of potential procedural or reagent issues.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference Range for Serum IgE: Refer to standards provided by
the PHOMA BETAE assay kit manufacturer or the laboratory's
established reference range.
• High levels of IgE may suggest allergic responses, parasitic
infections, or other immunologic conditions.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all data in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure all values are accurately transcribed and reviewed.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
10. SAFETY
• Follow all relevant laboratory safety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate PPE including gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection.
• Handle biological samples and reagents with caution, as they may
be infectious.
