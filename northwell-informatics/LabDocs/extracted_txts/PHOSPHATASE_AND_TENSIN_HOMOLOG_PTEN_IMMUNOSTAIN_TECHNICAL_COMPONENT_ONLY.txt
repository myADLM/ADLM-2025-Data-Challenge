STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
TITLE: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Phosphatase and Tensin
Homolog (PTEN) – Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the technical component of the immunostain for PTEN to
ensure consistent and accurate staining of tissue sections in
the laboratory. This SOP is intended for the analytical phase of
testing, assuming specimen collection, receipt, and accession
have been completed.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to
ensure that the following procedures are strictly adhered to,
maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the immunostaining
process.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS:
• PTEN primary antibody
• Secondary antibody link
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated polymer)
• 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate
• Haematoxylin for counterstaining
• Xylene, ethanol, and buffering solutions
• Antigen retrieval buffer (citric acid or tris-EDTA)
• Positive and negative control tissue sections
• Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) or another blocking agent
• Microscope slides, cover slips, mounting media
• Automated IHC/Slide Stainer (if available) or manual staining
setup
1. EQUIPMENT:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Oven/incubator
• Coplin jars or staining troughs
• Forceps and slide racks
• Light microscope
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimens must be formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections cut to a thickness of 3-4 micrometers.
• Sections should be mounted on charged glass slides and allowed
to dry overnight at 37°C or incubated at 60°C for 1-2 hours.
1. PROCEDURE: A. Preparing Tissue Sections:
2. Deparaffinization: i. Heat slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour if
not already done. ii. Deparaffinize sections by immersing in
xylene for 2 x 5 minutes. iii. Rehydrate sections by passing
through a graded series of ethanol solutions: - 100% ethanol for
2 x 3 minutes - 95% ethanol for 2 x 3 minutes - 70% ethanol for
1 x 3 minutes - Rinse in distilled water.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Preheat the retrieval buffer to 95-99°C.
2. Place slides in a coplin jar containing the preheated antigen
retrieval buffer.
3. Incubate for 20 minutes at 95-99°C.
4. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
5. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS or TBS.
C. Blocking:
1. Use a hydrophobic pen to circle each section on the slides.
2. Apply blocking serum (e.g., 5% BSA) to cover the tissue
sections and incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Blot off excess blocking solution without rinsing.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply PTEN primary antibody to the sections at the dilution and
incubation time recommended by the antibody provider,
generally overnight at 4°C.
2. Rinse slides with PBS or TBS.
E. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Rinse slides with PBS or TBS.
3. Apply enzyme-conjugated detection solution for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
4. Rinse slides with PBS or TBS.
F. Chromogen Development:
1. Apply DAB substrate to the sections and incubate for 5-10
minutes or until desired stain intensity develops.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
G. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for counterstaining for 1-2
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water and then in distilled water.
3. Dehydrate the slides by passing through graded ethanol
solutions and finally in xylene.
4. Mount coverslips with suitable mounting media.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control tissue sections with each
staining run to validate the assay.
• Monitor staining intensity and nonspecific background staining for
consistency across all runs.
1. REPORTING:
• This procedure does not cover result interpretation; slides are
sent to pathologists for reading and diagnostic reporting.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain documentation of all staining runs, including lot numbers
of reagents, dates of assays, and any deviations or issues
encountered.
