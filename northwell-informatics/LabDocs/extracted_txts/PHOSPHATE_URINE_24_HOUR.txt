Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PHOSPHATE, URINE, 24 HOUR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of phosphate in a 24-hour urine sample. This procedure ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results that meet clinical
laboratory standards.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• A complete 24-hour urine collection in a clean, leak-proof
container. The container should be labeled with the patient’s
name, date and start/end times of collection.
• The specimen must be kept refrigerated during collection and
transported to the laboratory immediately following the collection
period.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens not collected for the complete duration of 24 hours.
• Specimens received without proper labeling or important
collection information such as start/end times.
• Specimens that have been contaminated or not properly stored.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Spectrophotometer or appropriate analyzer for phosphate
measurement
• Pipettes
• Test tubes
• Diluent (if required)
• Phosphate reagent kit
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Steps:
1. Verify specimen integrity, confirm proper labeling, and ascertain
that the complete 24-hour urine collection was properly
conducted.
2. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen thoroughly to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
collection using a graduated cylinder.
Preparation:
1. Aliquot 10 mL of the mixed 24-hour urine specimen into a
labeled test tube.
2. Centrifuge the aliquoted sample at 1500-2000 RPM for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
Analytical Steps:
1. Prepare the phosphate reagent kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up the spectrophotometer or analyzer and perform initial
calibration and quality control checks using control materials
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
Phosphate Measurement:
1. Using pipettes, add the appropriate volume of urine sample to
the reaction mixture as specified in the phosphate reagent kit
insert.
2. Start the timer and allow the reaction to proceed for the time
indicated in the reagent instructions.
3. Measure the absorbance or phosphate concentration using the
spectrophotometer/analyzer.
4. If a dilution is necessary due to high concentration, repeat the
measurement using diluted aliquots while recording the dilution
factor.
Post-analytical Steps:
1. Verify and review results obtained against quality control and
patient demographic data.
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for final verification and reporting.
Reporting Results:
1. Laboratory technologist must review results before verification.
2. If any result exceeds established critical values or reference
ranges, follow the laboratory’s policy for handling and reporting
critical results.
3. Results are reported as mg/dL or mmol/L, depending on the
standard units used in the laboratory.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal Range: 400-1300 mg/24 hours (values may vary
depending on laboratory standards; consult reagent
manufacturer's documentation for specific intervals applicable)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control checks using low, normal, and
high controls as per manufacturer’s instructions with each batch
of tests.
• Document and troubleshoot any deviations or non-conformities
within the quality control results.
• Maintain records of temperature, humidity, and equipment
calibration validation checks.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interfering substances such as certain medications and dietary
phosphate intake may affect the analytical results.
• Ensure the sample is free from contaminants and has been
correctly collected over the 24-hour period for accurate results.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the phosphate reagent kit.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature for phosphate analysis in urine.
8. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection) when handling urine specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of biological waste and chemical reagents according to
the laboratory’s biohazard and chemical safety policies.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all logs, controls, calibration records, and patient results
are documented accurately and stored securely.
• Maintain and review SOP periodically to ensure adherence to
current laboratory standards and regulatory requirements.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results are out of range or control failures are noted, repeat the
analysis starting from sample preparation.
• Consult with the supervisor or technical specialist if issues persist
or if there are any analyzer malfunctions.
