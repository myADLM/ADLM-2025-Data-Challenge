Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures required for generating results for
Phosphate in random urine samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technicians and analysts are responsible for carrying out
the procedures outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that all staff are trained in these procedures and for verifying
the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Random urine sample collected in a sterile container.
• Specimen must arrive in the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection. If there is a delay in transportation, the specimen
should be refrigerated and transported on ice.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are not properly labeled with patient identification.
• Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Spectrophotometer or equivalent analytical instrument.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Reagent kits for the analysis of urine phosphate.
• Quality control materials.
• Sterile containers for urine collection.
1. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Specimen Preparation
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly before aliquoting to ensure
homogeneity.
• Aseptically transfer a sufficient volume of urine to a test tube for
analysis.
Step 2: Calibration
• Calibrate the spectrophotometer or analytical instrument
according to the manufacturer’s instructions using phosphate
standards.
• Ensure the calibration curve is linear and within acceptable limits.
Step 3: Quality Control
• Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch of patient samples.
• Include at least two levels of quality control (normal and high) to
ensure accuracy.
• Document the results of the quality control measurements.
Step 4: Analysis
• Follow the reagent kit instructions for the assay of urine
phosphate.
• Pipette appropriate volumes of reagents and urine samples into
the test tubes.
• Incubate the mixture as specified in the reagent kit instructions.
• Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using the
spectrophotometer.
Step 5: Calculation and Reporting
• Calculate the concentration of phosphate in the urine samples
using the calibration curve.
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and verify all results before releasing them.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control samples should be run with each batch of patient
samples.
• If quality control results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
the issue before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for urine phosphate should be verified for the
specific population served by the laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that specimens are free from gross hematuria as this may
interfere with the assay.
• High concentrations of ascorbic acid or other reducing substances
in the urine may cause interference.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the reagent kit used.
• Spectrophotometer operating manual.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all temperatures, calibration data, quality control results,
and patient results in appropriate log books or electronic records.
• Ensure all data is traceable and retrievable for audit purposes.
By following these procedures, the laboratory ensures accurate and
reliable results for the analysis of phosphate in random urine
samples.
