Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Phosphate in Timed Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analysis of
inorganic phosphate in timed urine samples to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
by following the outlined procedures. The supervisor is responsible
for ensuring that all staff are trained and competent in performing the
assay and for addressing any issues that may arise during testing.
3. DEFINITION
This SOP outlines the steps necessary for the quantitative
determination of inorganic phosphate in timed urine samples using
an appropriate automated or manual analytical method.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Container: Clean, leak-proof plastic
container.
• Specimen Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of urine is required.
• Collection: The specimen must be a timed urine collection,
typically over 24 hours. Ensure that the collection time is clearly
indicated on the specimen label.
• Storage and Stability: Store the specimen refrigerated at 2-8°C
during the collection period and until analysis. The specimen is
stable at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours post-collection.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents:
◦ Phosphate standard solution
◦ Molybdate reagent
◦ Reducing agent (e.g., stannous chloride)
◦ Deionized water
• Equipment:
◦ Automated chemistry analyzer or spectrophotometer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Test tubes and rack
◦ Timer
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Mix the Sample Thoroughly: Ensure the urine sample is well-
mixed to distribute any sediment evenly throughout the sample.
2. Aliquot Preparation: Pipette an aliquot of 2 mL urine into a
labeled test tube. If using an automated analyzer, follow the
manufacturer’s instructions for sample preparation.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration: Prepare a series of phosphate standards as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines to generate a standard curve.
2. Quality Control: Prepare and analyze quality control materials
at low, medium, and high levels of phosphate to ensure the
assay performance is within acceptable limits. Record the
results in the Quality Control log.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Automated Method:
◦ Load the reagents and samples into the automated
chemistry analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure the instrument is calibrated, and perform an auto-
check for any errors.
◦ Start the analysis run.
2. Manual Method:
◦ Pipette 1 mL of the molybdate reagent into the test tube
containing 2 mL of urine sample.
◦ Add 1 mL of reducing agent and mix well.
◦ Incubate the mixture at room temperature (20-25°C) for 10
minutes for color development.
◦ Measure the absorbance of the resulting solution at 340 nm
using the spectrophotometer.
◦ Read and record the absorbance values for each sample.
D. Calculations
1. Standard Curve Construction: Plot the absorbance values of
standards against their corresponding phosphate
concentrations to create the standard curve.
2. Sample Concentration Calculation: Use the standard curve
to determine the phosphate concentration in the urine sample.
3. Adjust for Dilution and Collection Period: Multiply the
phosphate concentration by the total volume of the timed urine
collection and normalize per 24 hours.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation: Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Verification: Results must be reviewed and verified by a
technologist before final reporting. Ensure critical values are
flagged and rechecked.
3. Units: Report the phosphate concentration in mg/24h or mmol/
24h as requested.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal QC: Perform regular internal quality control checks
using control materials to ensure ongoing assay accuracy.
2. Inter-lab Comparison: Participate in proficiency testing or
inter-laboratory comparison programs.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Dealing with Outliers: Re-run any sample that yields an
unexpected result.
2. Instrument Errors: Consult the analyzer’s troubleshooting
guide and contact technical support if necessary.
10. REFERENCES
Include references to the manufacturer’s instructions, relevant clinical
guidelines, and internal laboratory protocols for quality assurance.
11. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain detailed records of calibration, quality control results, and
any corrective actions in a dedicated logbook or electronic system.
