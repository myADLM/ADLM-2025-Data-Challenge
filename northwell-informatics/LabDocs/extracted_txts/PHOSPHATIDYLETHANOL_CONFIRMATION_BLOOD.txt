Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) Confirmation, Blood
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for Phosphatidylethanol (PEth)
confirmation in blood samples. This procedure ensures
accurate and reproducible results for clinical assessment of
chronic alcohol consumption.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP accurately:
• Perform and document all steps correctly.
• Identify and address any issues affecting the test results.
• Report results to the appropriate medical staff.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING Specimen
Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes (lavender top) or ACD tubes
(yellow top).
Specimen Stability:
• Maintain specimens at 2-8°C.
• Specimens are stable for up to 14 days when refrigerated and up
to 1 year when frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or visibly contaminated specimens.
• Specimens received in non-recommended tubes or with clots.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Equipment:
• Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Ultra-pure water system.
• Refrigerator and freezer.
Reagents:
• Methanol (LC-MS grade).
• Acetonitrile (LC-MS grade).
• Ammonium formate.
• PEth internal standard stock solution.
• PEth calibration standards.
Supplies:
• LC-MS/MS vials.
• Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) syringe filters, 0.2 μm.
• Disposable gloves.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL Safety Precautions:
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) according to the
laboratory’s safety policies.
• Handle reagents and samples in a biological safety cabinet when
necessary.
Calibration:
• Prepare PEth calibration standard curve using at least 5 non-zero
standards.
• Dispense calibration standards into LC-MS/MS vials and seal.
Quality Control (QC):
• Use QC materials at two levels (low and high concentrations).
• Perform QC checks with every batch of samples analyzed.
• Ensure QC results are within acceptable limits before reporting
patient results.
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
2. Label all required LC-MS/MS vials appropriately.
3. Obtain 200 μL of each whole blood specimen using a pipette.
4. Add 800 μL of methanol containing the internal standard to
each sample and vortex mix for 30 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
precipitate proteins.
6. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new LC-MS/MS vial.
7. Filter the supernatant using 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filters into LC-
MS/MS vials.
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the LC-MS/MS
system as per manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Set the LC-MS/MS parameters as outlined in the instrument’s
operating manual.
3. Inject an appropriate volume of each prepared sample,
calibration standard, and QC material into the LC-MS/MS
system.
4. Record and analyze the chromatographic and mass
spectrometric data.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Utilize the LC-MS/MS software to integrate the
chromatographic peaks for PEth and internal standard.
2. Construct a calibration curve for PEth using the calibration
standards.
3. Quantify the concentration of PEth in each patient and QC
sample by comparing the peak area ratio of PEth to the internal
standard.
4. Check that QC results fall within the acceptable range.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer the validated results from the LC-MS/MS system to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify correct transcription of results from the analytical instrument
to the patient report.
• Notify the appropriate medical personnel of any critical values or
discrepancies.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference interval for PEth: [Provide appropriate limits based on
established laboratory data].
• Results above the reference interval may indicate chronic alcohol
consumption.
• Consult the laboratory’s reference guide or a clinical pathologist
for further interpretation and guidance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or sample contamination may affect the
accuracy of results.
• Ensure proper specimen handling and storage to minimize pre-
analytical errors.
• PEth quantification is specific to the methods and reagents used.
