Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Phosphatidylserine/Prothrombin
Antibody, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the reliable and accurate analysis of
Phosphatidylserine/Prothrombin Antibody, IgG, in serum specimens,
ensuring standardized testing conditions and accurate results
interpretation.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff should conduct the assay and ensure proper
documentation of results.
• Supervisors should ensure adherence to the SOP and act
promptly to resolve any issues that may arise during the testing
process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum sample.
• Collect the blood sample in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample within 2 hours of collection to separate
serum from cells.
• Use of serum samples only. Plasma or whole blood is not
acceptable.
Specimen Storage:
• Once separated, serum specimens should be refrigerated at
2-8°C if not immediately analyzed.
• If testing is delayed beyond 48 hours, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens received in plasma tubes or other anticoagulants.
• Specimens that have been frozen and thawed more than once.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microplate Reader capable of measuring absorbance at specified
wavelengths.
• Calibrated adjustable micropipettes and tips.
• Reagents specific for Phosphatidylserine/Prothrombin Antibody,
IgG (e.g., ELISA Kit).
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Calibrators, controls, and sample diluents as provided in the
assay kit.
• Properly labeled test tubes, microplate wells, and other necessary
laboratory supplies.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for reconstituting and preparing
all reagents, standards, and controls.
• Bring all reagents, calibrators, controls, and samples to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
B) Assay Procedure
• Label microplate wells as required for standards, controls, and
samples.
• Pipette specified volume (e.g., 100 µL) of standards, controls, and
diluted patient samples into the appropriate wells.
• Add the conjugated reagent as per kit instructions.
• Incubate the microplate as specified (e.g., 30 minutes at room
temperature or as per kit instructions).
• Wash the wells to remove unbound conjugate using washing
buffer (typically 3-5 wash cycles).
• Add substrate solution to each well and incubate as per kit
instructions (e.g., 15-30 minutes at room temperature in the dark).
• Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction, ensuring
uniform mixing.
• Measure the absorbance within 15 minutes at the specific
wavelength recommended by the kit (typically 450 nm with a
reference at 620 nm).
C) Interpretation and Calculation
• Obtain the absorbance for each sample and control.
• Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Determine the IgG concentration in each sample by interpolating
its absorbance on the standard curve.
• Verify the quality control results to ensure assay validity. The
assay run must be accepted or rejected based on control data.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Controls:
◦ Include at least one low, one medium, and one high control in
each assay run.
◦ Controls should fall within the manufacturer's established
range; any deviation necessitates troubleshooting and
possibly repeating the assay.
• External Quality Controls:
◦ Periodically ensure accuracy through participation in external
proficiency testing programs.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results:
◦ Report the Phosphatidylserine/Prothrombin Antibody, IgG
concentration in standard units (e.g., U/mL) as defined by the
assay kit manufacturer.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the designated
reviewing technologist before reporting.
• Reference Intervals and Interpretation:
◦ Negative: Below the cutoff value specified by the assay kit.
◦ Borderline: Values around the cutoff may require retesting or
clinical correlation.
◦ Positive: Typically above the specified cutoff value, indicating
the presence of the antibody.
◦ Use kit-specific reference ranges for reporting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure awareness of kit-specific limitations, including potential
cross-reactivity and interfering substances.
• Follow manufacturer recommendations and consult reference
material for troubleshooting and validation.
