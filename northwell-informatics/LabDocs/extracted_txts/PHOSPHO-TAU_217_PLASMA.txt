STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) PHOSPHO-TAU
217 Analysis in Plasma
1. PURPOSE: To provide a step-by-step procedure for the analysis of
PHOSPHO-TAU 217 in plasma samples to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure is applicable to all trained laboratory
personnel involved in the analysis of PHOSPHO-TAU 217 in plasma
samples at the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Personnel: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis as described in this SOP.
• Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring that the analysis is
conducted according to this SOP and for addressing any issues
that arise during the process.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• PHOSPHO-TAU 217 assay kit (validated for use in plasma)
• Calibrated micropipettes (10 µL - 1000 µL range)
• Microcentrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or -80°C)
• Vortex mixer
• Plate reader capable of detecting appropriate wavelengths (as per
assay kit instructions)
• Laboratory timer
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
• Collect blood samples using standard venipuncture technique into
EDTA plasma collection tubes.
• Centrifuge tubes at 2000-3000 x g for 10-15 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
• Aliquot plasma into appropriately labeled polypropylene tubes.
• Store plasma samples at -80°C until analysis.
6. CALIBRATORS AND CONTROLS:
• Use calibrators and controls provided with or recommended by
the PHOSPHO-TAU 217 assay kit.
• Store calibrators and controls according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Preparation:
• Equilibrate all reagents, calibrators, and control materials to room
temperature before use.
• Prepare all assay reagents and buffer solutions as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
7.2 Sample and Control Preparation:
• Thaw plasma samples, calibrators, and controls at room
temperature.
• Vortex samples to mix thoroughly.
• Aliquot required volume of each sample, calibrator, and control
into individual wells of the assay plate according to the assay kit
protocol.
7.3 Assay Procedure:
• Add the assay buffer, detection antibody, and other required
reagents to each well as per the assay kit instructions.
• Seal the plate and incubate it at the specified temperature and
duration mentioned in the assay protocol.
• Wash the wells as directed using an automated plate washer or
manually with wash buffer.
• Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the time
specified in the assay kit protocol.
• Measure the absorbance (or fluorescence/chemiluminescence) at
the appropriate wavelengths using a calibrated plate reader.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform the PHOSPHO-TAU 217 assay with both positive and
negative controls.
• Record all control results to ensure they fall within the
manufacturer’s specified ranges.
• Any deviation must be addressed before proceeding with the
sample assays.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Calculate the concentration of PHOSPHO-TAU 217 in plasma
samples using the standard curve generated from the calibrators.
• Result must be reviewed and verified by a technologist before
reporting.
• Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals will be provided based on the assay kit and
validated against the laboratory population or provided by the kit
manufacturer.
11. LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to PHOSPHO-TAU 217 assay kit insert for method-specific
limitations.
• Improper sample handling or deviation from the protocol can
result in erroneous results.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If control results are outside the acceptable range, do not proceed
with the sample analysis. Identify and correct the issue before re-
analysis.
• Consult the assay kit troubleshooting guide or contact technical
support if persistent issues occur.
13. DOCUMENTATION:
• Document all assay run details, including any deviations or issues
encountered, in the appropriate laboratory records.
• Maintain records of all temperature logs, quality control data,
calibration plots, and any corrective actions taken.
