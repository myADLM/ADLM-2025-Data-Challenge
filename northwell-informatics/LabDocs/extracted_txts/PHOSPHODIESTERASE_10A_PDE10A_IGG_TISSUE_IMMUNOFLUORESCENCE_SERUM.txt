Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
PDE10A IgG Tissue Immunofluorescence, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides the methodology for the analysis and
generation of results for Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) IgG,
Tissue Immunofluorescence in serum specimens.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory scientists are responsible for performing
the analysis and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the test
results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
approving these results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phases of PDE10A IgG, Tissue Immunofluorescence testing in serum
specimens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL serum collected in SST (Serum
Separator Tube), centrifuged, and aliquoted.
• Acceptable Specimen: Any serum specimen stored and
transported to the laboratory under appropriate conditions.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic serum
that may compromise test results; specimens with incomplete or
missing identification/testing requisition details.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• PDE10A IgG antibody kit
• PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline)
• 4% Paraformaldehyde
• Fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody
• Mounting medium with DAPI
• Glass slides, cover slips
• Fluorescence microscope
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Disposable gloves and protective equipment
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure serum samples are free from particulates and
hemolysis before proceeding.
◦ Aliquot the serum if necessary and store at -20°C until
analysis.
3. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare PBS and dilute the fluorescent-labeled secondary
antibody according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Tissue Section Preparation:
◦ Section tissue samples appropriately and fix slide-mounted
tissue sections in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse twice with PBS and allow to air dry.
5. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking buffer to the tissue sections to prevent non-
specific binding of antibodies.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature.
6. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate the tissue sections with the primary PDE10A IgG
antibody diluted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Incubate for one hour at room temperature in a humidified
chamber.
7. Washing:
◦ Rinse the slides three times with PBS to remove unbound
primary antibody.
8. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate the tissue sections with a fluorescent-labeled
secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature in the
dark.
9. Washing:
◦ Perform three additional washes with PBS to remove
excess secondary antibody.
◦ Rinse briefly with deionized water.
10. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium with DAPI to the tissue sections
and cover with coverslips.
◦ Seal edges of the coverslip with clear nail polish or
mounting medium to prevent drying out.
11. Microscopy:
◦ Observe stained sections under a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Capture images for qualitative and quantitative analysis.
12. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative control tissues with each batch
of samples processed.
• Document quality control results in the QC log.
• If controls do not perform within expected ranges, troubleshoot
and repeat the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze the fluorescence intensity and localization pattern of
PDE10A IgG staining.
• Interpret results based on fluorescence intensity relative to the
control.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
further verification.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Report results as positive or negative based on the presence of
characteristic immunofluorescence.
• Include a comparison to reference controls.
• Reference interval: Specific to laboratory and assay used.
