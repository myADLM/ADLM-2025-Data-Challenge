Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Analytical Phase of
PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A
(PDE10A) IGG, TISSUE
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and reliable analysis
of PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A (PDE10A) IgG in spinal fluid using
tissue immunofluorescence.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff performing the analytical phase of
PDE10A IgG, tissue immunofluorescence for spinal fluid in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis. The laboratory supervisor is responsible
for ensuring that the procedures are followed and that any
discrepancies or issues are addressed promptly.
4. DEFINITIONS
PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A (PDE10A) IgG: An antibody that may
be present in spinal fluid, detected using tissue immunofluorescence
techniques.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope
• Microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Specific antisera for PDE10A IgG
• Secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorescent dye
• Tissue sections (commercially procured or prepared in-house)
• Spinal fluid samples
• Washing buffer (e.g., PBS)
• Mounting medium with antifade reagent
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred Specimen: Spinal fluid collected in a sterile container.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1.0 mL.
• Transport Conditions: Specimens should be kept refrigerated
(2-8°C) and transported to the laboratory immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are clotted, hemolyzed, or contain particulate
matter.
• Specimens not labeled with patient identifiers.
• Specimens not transported under the required conditions.
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thawing: If the samples are frozen, thaw them at room
temperature.
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the spinal fluid samples at 1500 x g
for 10 minutes to remove any cellular debris. Use the
supernatant for analysis.
Tissue Immunofluorescence Staining:
1. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
◦ Place tissue sections on microscope slides and allow them
to dry.
◦ Fix the tissue sections in cold acetone for 10 minutes.
◦ Allow the slides to air-dry.
2. Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
◦ Incubate the slides with blocking buffer (e.g., 1% bovine
serum albumin in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute the PDE10A IgG primary antisera according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Incubate the slides with the primary antisera for 1 hour at
room temperature in a humidified chamber.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the slides 3 times with PBS, each wash lasting 5
minutes.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute the fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Incubate the slides with the secondary antibody for 45
minutes at room temperature in the dark.
6. Final Wash:
◦ Wash the slides 3 times with PBS, each wash lasting 5
minutes.
◦ Rinse briefly in distilled water.
7. Mounting:
◦ Place a drop of mounting medium with antifade reagent on
each slide.
◦ Carefully place a cover slip over the tissue section, avoiding
air bubbles.
Microscopy:
1. Examination:
◦ Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Use appropriate filter settings for the fluorophore used.
2. Documentation:
◦ Take representative images of positive and negative
controls along with patient samples.
◦ Record the fluorescence intensity and localization of
staining in the lab logbook.
Interpretation:
1. Positive Result:
◦ Specific, bright immunofluorescence signal in appropriate
tissue structures.
2. Negative Result:
◦ Lack of specific immunofluorescence signal or non-specific,
dim staining.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
• Perform equipment calibration and maintenance as per the
laboratory’s equipment SOP.
• Record any deviations from the procedure and report them to the
supervisor.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include interpretation and any comments regarding unusual
findings.
• Review and verify results before releasing them to the referring
physician.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive Control: Bright, specific staining.
• Negative Control: No specific staining or background
fluorescence.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inadequate sample volume or poor-quality tissue sections may
affect results.
• Non-specific binding or cross-reactivity may lead to false-positive
results.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s protocol for PDE10A IgG antisera and fluorescent
secondary antibodies.
• Laboratory equipment manuals.
• Current literature on immunofluorescence techniques and spinal
fluid antibody testing.
13. REVIEW AND DOCUMENT CONTROL
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or when any significant
changes occur in the procedure.
• Document any changes made to this SOP and ensure that all staff
are trained accordingly.
