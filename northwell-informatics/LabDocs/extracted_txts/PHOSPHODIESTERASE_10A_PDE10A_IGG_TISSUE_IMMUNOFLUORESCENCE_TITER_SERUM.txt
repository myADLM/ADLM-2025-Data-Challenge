STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A (PDE10A) IGG, TISSUE
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TITER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results for
PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A (PDE10A) IGG, TISSUE
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TITER, SERUM in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This procedure ensures accuracy, reliability, and timely
delivery of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
analyzing PDE10A IGG, Tissue Immunofluorescence Titer, Serum
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel performing PDE10A IGG, Tissue
Immunofluorescence Titer, Serum analysis.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Fluorescence microscope
• Appropriate control slides (positive and negative control)
• Immunofluorescence reagent kit specifically for PDE10A IGG
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
• Microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Mounting media
• Buffered saline wash solution
• Latex gloves
• Pipettes and reagents specific for preparing samples
• Specimen Accession Log sheet or LIS for tracking
5. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Preparation
Specimen Requirements:
• 5-10 mL of properly collected and labeled serum.
• Ensure specimen integrity by maintaining correct storage
conditions (refrigerate at 2-8°C).
Specimen Preparation:
• Bring specimen and reagents to room temperature before
beginning if they were stored at refrigeration temperature.
• Label slides appropriately with patient identification and place
control serums on separate slides.
Test Procedure:
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Place a drop of patient serum and positive and negative
controls onto separate prepared tissue sections.
◦ Incubate slides with the reagents specific for PDE10A IGG
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Wash out residual serum using buffered saline solution.
2. Application of Immunofluorescent Reagent:
◦ Apply fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG reagent.
◦ Incubate slides as per kit instructions, generally about 30
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides thoroughly with wash solution to remove
unbound reagent.
3. Mounting:
◦ Rinse slides briefly with distilled water.
◦ Apply mounting medium and cover slips to each slide.
◦ Allow slides to dry in the dark to prevent quenching of
fluorescence.
4. Microscopy:
◦ Assess slides using a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Evaluate staining pattern and intensity compared to
controls.
◦ Determine the titer by observing the highest dilution of
patient serum which produces consistent fluorescence.
5. Recording Results:
◦ Record the titer and qualitative interpretation (positive/
negative) in the Lab Information System (LIS) and on the
test worksheet with your initials, date, and time.
◦ Cross-check results for discrepancies by comparison with
control results.
Quality Control
• Carry out quality control procedures using positive and negative
controls with each batch of patient samples.
• Document that control results fall within acceptable reference
ranges. If controls are out of range, reassess reagents and
procedure prior to reporting results.
Reference Ranges:
• Positive Control: Expected to show specific fluorescence
indicating the presence of PDE10A IGG.
• Negative Control: Expected not to show fluorescence.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Confirm and verify results in the LIS.
• Document any discrepancies and notify the supervisor
immediately for further review.
• Report results to the ordering physician/provider via the LIS,
ensuring confidentiality and compliance with HIPAA regulations.
