Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A (PDE10A) IgG,
Tissue Immunofluorescence Titer, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analysis of Phosphodiesterase
10A (PDE10A) IgG in spinal fluid using tissue immunofluorescence
titer methodology.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform and
document the analysis according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all staff members are adequately trained and follow this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen: - Spinal fluid collected in a sterile
container. - Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL.
Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimens with visible contamination
(e.g., blood, particulates). - Specimens that have been improperly
stored or transported.
Note: Ensure that the specimen has been properly accessioned and
is fit for analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - Fluorescence Microscope - Laboratory Centrifuge -
Incubator - Pipettes and Tips
Reagents: - Anti-PDE10A antibodies - Fluorescent secondary
antibodies - Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS) - Mounting medium - Control
slides (positive and negative)
Supplies: - Immunofluorescence slides - Coverslips - Kimwipes
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Slides: 1. Label each slide with the corresponding
specimen identifier. 2. Apply the spinal fluid sample onto the prepared
immunofluorescence slides. 3. Allow the specimen to air dry.
B) Fixation and Blocking: 1. Fix the slides in cold acetone for 10
minutes. 2. Let the slides air dry completely. 3. Block non-specific
binding sites by incubating the slides with blocking solution for 1 hour
at room temperature.
C) Primary Antibody Incubation: 1. Prepare the primary antibody
solution against PDE10A (according to manufacturer’s instructions).
2. Incubate the slides with the primary antibody solution for 1 hour at
room temperature or overnight at 4°C. 3. Wash the slides three times
for 5 minutes each with PBS.
D) Secondary Antibody Incubation: 1. Prepare the fluorescent
secondary antibody solution (according to manufacturer’s
instructions). 2. Incubate the slides with the secondary antibody for 1
hour at room temperature in the dark. 3. Wash the slides three times
for 5 minutes each with PBS.
E) Mounting: 1. Add a drop of mounting medium to each slide. 2.
Place a coverslip over the drop and allow it to set.
F) Microscopic Analysis: 1. Examine the prepared slides under a
fluorescence microscope. 2. Observe and document the presence
and intensity of fluorescent signals. 3. Use control slides (positive
and negative) to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Measures: 1. Use positive and negative control slides
with each batch of tests to validate results. 2. Verify reagent
performance by checking expiration dates and storing reagents as
specified by the manufacturer. 3. Ensure instrument calibration is
current and maintained as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
Result Interpretation: - Positive Result: Presence of specific
fluorescent signal indicative of PDE10A IgG. - Negative Result:
Absence of specific fluorescent signal. - Invalid Result: Inconsistent
or inconclusive signals requiring re-analysis or troubleshooting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Report the titers and ensure all data is reviewed and
verified before releasing the final report.
3. Critical results should be communicated to the physician
immediately and documented accordingly.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure sample integrity to avoid false-negative or false-
positive results.
◦ Deviations from the protocol may affect the accuracy of the
results.
◦ Perform troubleshooting steps if unexpected results are
encountered.
3. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's Instructions for Anti-PDE10A primary and
secondary antibodies.
◦ Laboratory’s internal quality control guidelines.
◦ Relevant scientific literature for immunofluorescence
techniques.
This SOP is to be reviewed and updated annually or as new
information and technologies become available.
