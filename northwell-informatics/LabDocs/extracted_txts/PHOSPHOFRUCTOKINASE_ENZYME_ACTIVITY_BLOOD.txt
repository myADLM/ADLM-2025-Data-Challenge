1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedure for measuring
phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme activity in blood samples. This
enzyme assay is used to detect and quantify the activity of PFK in
patient blood samples, which can aid in diagnosing inherited
disorders related to glycolysis and muscle function.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
perform the PFK enzyme activity assay according to this procedure
and document results appropriately. All staff must identify and report
any deviations from the protocol or any issues that may affect the
accuracy of the assay to their supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen type: Whole blood Preferred: - Collected in a heparinized
vacutainer (dark green or PST). - Transport the sample on ice
immediately after collection to the laboratory.
Unacceptable: - Blood samples collected in sodium citrate, sodium
fluoride/oxalate, or EDTA tubes. - Clotted specimens or specimens
received at room temperature. - Samples with more than 10% air
bubbles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge (refrigerated)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Heparinized vacutainers or appropriate collection tubes
• Cold chain equipment (ice packs, insulated containers)
• Assay buffer (composition specified in enzyme assay kit manual)
• PFK enzyme assay kit (specific manufacturer instructions must be
obtained and followed meticulously)
• Spectrophotometer or plate reader
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation
1. Upon arrival, ensure the blood sample is on ice. Immediately
aliquot the required volume for the assay and use the
remainder for possible repeat testing.
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 2000-2500 RPM for 10 minutes
at 4˚C to separate the plasma.
3. Transfer the plasma aliquot into appropriately labeled tubes,
keeping them on ice.
4.2 Enzyme Assay Procedure
1. Prepare the assay buffer and other reagents as indicated in the
PFK enzyme assay kit insert. Ensure all reagents are
equilibrated at recommended assay temperature (usually room
temperature or as specified by the manufacturer).
2. Set up reaction wells according to the assay protocol:
◦ Include wells for blanks, controls, standards, and patient
samples.
◦ Use appropriate volumes of reagents and samples as
indicated by the manufacturer's protocol.
3. For each reaction well, add the assay buffer, PFK substrate,
and plasma sample. Mix gently by pipetting up and down or
using a vortex mixer.
4. Incubate the reaction mixture at the specified temperature and
for the specified duration as per the assay kit instructions
(typically 30 minutes to 60 minutes at 37˚C).
5. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength (usually
340 nm) using a spectrophotometer or plate reader. Record the
absorbance readings.
4.3 Quality Control
1. Include quality control samples (positive and negative controls)
in each assay run to validate the assay's performance.
2. Record all results, including standards, controls, and patient
sample absorbance values.
3. Acceptable control ranges must be pre-defined, and any control
value outside this range must trigger a repeat assay or an
investigation.
4.4 Data Calculation and Interpretation
1. Calculate the PFK enzyme activity in patient samples using the
provided formulae in the assay kit, comparing absorbance
changes relative to standards.
2. Express the results as U/L (units per liter) of plasma.
4.5 Reporting Results
1. Enter the calculated PFK activity values into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results before releasing them.
3. Method Limitations
4. Ensure all reagents and samples are at the correct temperature
and pH to avoid false results.
5. Hemolysis or improper storage of samples can lead to
inaccurate enzyme activity readings.
6. References
Refer to the PFK enzyme assay kit insert and the instrumentation
manual for additional details and troubleshooting guidelines.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory staff can ensure the accurate
and reproducible measurement of phosphofructokinase enzyme
activity in blood samples, providing reliable diagnostic assistance to
clinicians.
