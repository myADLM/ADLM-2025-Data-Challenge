Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Phosphoglycerate Kinase
Enzyme Activity, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for measuring
Phosphoglycerate Kinase (PGK) enzyme activity in blood specimens.
This assessment is critical for the diagnosis and management of
disorders associated with PGK deficiency.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to perform the analysis following the steps laid out in this SOP.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the staff are
trained and that quality control measures are implemented.
1. DEFINITION
Phosphoglycerate Kinase (PGK) is an enzyme involved in the
glycolytic pathway, playing a key role in energy production within
cells. A deficiency in PGK can lead to various metabolic disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Fresh whole blood collected in EDTA or heparin tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• At least 5 mL of whole blood is required for the assay.
Specimen Handling:
• The specimen should be kept on ice and processed within 2
hours of collection to ensure enzyme stability.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Specimens that have been at room temperature for more than 2
hours.
• Hemolyzed samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Spectrophotometer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Reagent reservoir
Reagents and Supplies:
• ADP
• 3-phosphoglycerate
• NADH
• Tris buffer (pH 7.8)
• Magnesium sulfate
• Pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase reagent
• Distilled or deionized water
• Microfuge tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Hemolysate:
1. Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to separate plasma and cells.
2. Discard the plasma and wash the red blood cells twice with
0.9% NaCl.
3. Lyse the washed red blood cells by suspending in Tris buffer
(pH 7.8) in a 1:3 ratio (cells:buffer).
4. Centrifuge the lysed cells at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
5. Collect the supernatant, which contains the hemolysate, for
enzyme activity analysis.
Measurement of PGK Activity:
1. Prepare reaction mixture containing the following in a total
volume of 1.0 mL:
◦ 50 µL of hemolysate
◦ 500 µL of Tris buffer (pH 7.8)
◦ 10 µL of ADP (10 mM)
◦ 10 µL of 3-phosphoglycerate (100 mM)
◦ 10 µL of NADH (10 mM)
◦ 10 µL of magnesium sulfate (100 mM)
◦ 420 µL of distilled or deionized water
◦ 5 µL of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase reagent
2. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 5 minutes.
3. Measure the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm over 5 minutes
using a spectrophotometer. The decrease in absorbance
corresponds to the oxidation of NADH, which is directly
proportional to PGK activity.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal controls should be included in each assay run.
• Use commercially available PGK deficiency positive and negative
control hemolysates.
• Perform the assay on control samples to ensure the reliability and
accuracy of the test.
• Document all QC results in the QC log. If controls fall outside of
the acceptable range, troubleshoot and repeat the test.
Allowable Limits:
• The acceptable range for QC samples should be established
based on the laboratory's validation data.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the enzyme activity using the change in absorbance at
340 nm (ΔA340) using the formula: Activity (U/g Hb) = (ΔA340/
min)/ε × sample volume (mL) × total hemoglobin (g) where ε
(molar extinction coefficient of NADH) is 6220 L/mol/cm
• Report the results as U/g hemoglobin.
Critical Values:
• Report any critical or significantly abnormal values to the
requesting physician immediately.
Reference Intervals:
• Establish reference intervals based on the population served by
the laboratory. Typically, normal ranges for PGK activity may vary
slightly based on population and instrumentation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that the specimen is processed within the specified
timeframe to maintain enzyme activity.
• Any hemolysis can interfere with the assay and should be avoided
during blood collection and processing.
• The accuracy of the measurement depends on the proper
calibration and maintenance of the spectrophotometer.
