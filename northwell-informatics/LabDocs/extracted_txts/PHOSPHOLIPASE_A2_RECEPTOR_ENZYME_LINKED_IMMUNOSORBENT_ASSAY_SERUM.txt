PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 RECEPTOR (PLA2R) ENZYME LINKED
IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA), SERUM: STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE To standardize procedures for performing the
Phospholipase A2 Receptor (PLA2R) Enzyme Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) on serum samples for the
detection of anti-PLA2R antibodies, which are clinically
significant in diagnosing primary membranous nephropathy.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
◦ Preferred Specimen: 5-10 mL of serum collected in a
serum separator tube (SST) or plain red top tube.
◦ Handling: Centrifuge and separate serum from cells within
2 hours of collection. Store at 2-8°C if testing will be
conducted within 48 hours or freeze at -20°C for longer
storage.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
◦ ELISA microplate reader (capable of reading at 450 nm with
a 630 nm reference filter)
◦ Micropipettes and tips (20-200 µL, 200-1000 µL)
◦ Multi-channel pipette and tips
◦ Laboratory timer
◦ Plate washer (optional)
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Distilled or deionized water
◦ PLA2R ELISA kit (including coated microplate, standards,
controls, wash buffer, sample diluent, enzyme conjugate,
substrate solution, stop solution)
◦ Laboratory-grade incubator set at 37°C
4. PROCEDURE a) Preparation:
◦ Take the PLA2R ELISA kit out of refrigerated storage and
allow it to reach room temperature (20-25°C).
◦ Prepare wash buffer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Label the microplate wells according to the assay plan,
including standards, controls, and patient samples.
b) Standard and Sample Preparation:
◦ Prepare standards by diluting the standard solution provided
in the kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 with the sample diluent
provided in the kit.
c) Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted patient
samples to the designated wells.
◦ Cover the microplate with adhesive plate sealer and
incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Aspirate and wash the wells three times with 300 µL of
prepared wash buffer. If using a plate washer, follow its
specific instructions.
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well, cover the
plate, and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Aspirate and wash the wells five times with 300 µL of wash
buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate
at room temperature in the dark for 10-15 minutes.
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
The color will change from blue to yellow.
d) Reading Results:
◦ Within 15 minutes, measure the optical density (OD) of each
well using the microplate reader set to 450 nm with a 630
nm reference filter.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their known concentrations. Determine
the concentration of anti-PLA2R antibodies in patient
samples by interpolating the sample OD values from the
standard curve.
◦ Refer to the kit insert for the interpretative criteria, including
cut-off values for positive and negative results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run kit controls with each batch of tests to ensure assay
performance. Controls should fall within established ranges
provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Any deviation of control values from the expected range
requires investigation and repeat testing.
◦ Document all quality control checks in the Quality Control
Log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Review and verify patient results prior to release.
◦ Flag any results that are outside the normal range according
to laboratory policy.
8. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, or significant bilirubin presence in the
sample may interfere with results.
◦ The test is specific for detecting anti-PLA2R antibodies;
refer to other diagnostic criteria and patient clinical history
for a comprehensive diagnosis.
