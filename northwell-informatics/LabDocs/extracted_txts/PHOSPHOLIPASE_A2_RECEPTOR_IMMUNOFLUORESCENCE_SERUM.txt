Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Phospholipase A2 Receptor,
Immunofluorescence, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the analytical procedure for
detecting phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) in serum using
immunofluorescence.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing and validating immunofluorescence tests for PLA2R in
serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform this
procedure, ensure its accuracy and completeness, and report any
discrepancies to the supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a SST (serum separator tube).
• Specimens must be centrifuged and the serum separated within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in non-serum tubes (e.g. EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens received more than 48 hours post-collection without
refrigeration.
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis or contamination.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope with immunofluorescence capabilities
• Immunofluorescence slides and coverslips
• PLA2R-specific primary antibody
• Fluorescent secondary antibody
• PBS buffer solution
• Fixative (e.g., Methanol/Acetone)
• Mounting medium with antifade properties
• Tubes, pipettes, and protective gear
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation
1. Confirm the serum samples are properly labelled with patient
identification and collection time/date.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1500g for 10 minutes. Separate serum
and store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours if testing cannot be
performed immediately.
Immunofluorescence Staining
1. Prepare immunofluorescence slides:
◦ Place a drop of serum onto the slide.
◦ Air dry slides completely at room temperature.
2. Fix slides in Methanol/Acetone (1:1 ratio) for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS buffer solution for 5 minutes.
4. Incubate slides with PLA2R-specific primary antibody diluted in
PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Wash slides in PBS buffer solution three times, each for 5
minutes.
6. Incubate slides with fluorescent secondary antibody diluted in
PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.
7. Wash slides in PBS buffer solution three times, each for 5
minutes.
Mounting and Observation
1. Mount slides with antifade mounting medium and cover with
coverslip.
2. Observe slides under the immunofluorescence microscope.
Use appropriate filter sets for the fluorescence detection.
Interpretation
1. Examine slides for specific fluorescence patterns indicative of
PLA2R presence.
2. Compare fluorescence intensity and pattern with positive and
negative controls.
Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of slides
tested.
2. Record any deviations from the expected control outcomes and
consult with the supervisor if discrepancies arise.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reported as either positive or negative for PLA2R:
• Positive: Specific fluorescence pattern observed.
• Negative: No specific fluorescence pattern observed.
Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following verification by the technologist:
• Ensure all results match the observations noted from the
immunofluorescence microscope.
• Critical results must be communicated promptly according to the
laboratory’s critical result policy.
8. LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolyzed or contaminated samples may yield inaccurate
results.
2. Specimens older than 48 hours or improperly stored may
degrade and result in false negatives.
3. Quality control deviation invalidates the test batch and requires
re-processing.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s inserts for the PLA2R-specific primary
antibody, secondary antibody, and immunofluorescence equipment
maintenance guides.
