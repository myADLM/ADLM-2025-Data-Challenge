Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Phospholipase A2 Receptor (PLA2R), Monitoring, Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Serum
1. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the necessary steps for the analytical phase of generating
results for the measurement of serum levels of Phospholipase A2
Receptor (PLA2R) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). These procedures ensure the accurate and reliable
assessment of PLA2R levels for monitoring purposes.
Responsibility:
All designated lab personnel must follow this SOP to ensure
consistency and accuracy in PLA2R ELISA testing. Supervisors must
ensure adherence to this SOP and address any performance issues.
1. Definitions
Phospholipase A2 Receptor (PLA2R): A receptor protein involved
in various autoimmune diseases, particularly associated with
idiopathic membranous nephropathy.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA): A plate-based
assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying soluble
substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, and hormones.
Serum: The component of blood obtained after the removal of
clotting factors.
1. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: Up to 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): Long-term storage up to 6 months.
Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with insufficient volume
• Samples with inappropriate labeling (missing or unclear collection
date/time)
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• ELISA reader capable of measuring optical density at specified
wavelength
• Multi-channel pipette for dispensing reagents
• Single-channel micropipettes for accurate serum measurement
Reagents and Supplies:
• PLA2R ELISA kit (including plate, standards, controls, buffers,
enzyme conjugates, and substrate solution)
• Deionized water for washing
• Wash bottles and absorbent paper towels
• Pipette tips
• Serum vials and storage tubes
1. Procedure
A) Preparation:
1. Reagents Preparation: Prepare all reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Ensure all reagents are properly
labeled and stored as indicated.
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Allow the ELISA plate to come to room temperature if
previously refrigerated.
◦ Wash the plate wells with wash buffer as specified in the kit
instructions.
B) Sample and Control Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples as needed.
◦ Pipette the requisite volume of each serum sample into the
designated wells.
◦ Include all controls and standards arranged according to the
kit layout.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of enzyme conjugate to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate according to the manufacturer's
instructions, ensuring the correct temperature and duration
are maintained.
◦ Perform washes between incubation steps as described in
the kit instructions.
3. Detection and Reading:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Allow the color reaction to develop for the specified duration.
◦ Stop the reaction with the provided stop solution.
4. Plate Reading:
◦ Measure the optical density using an ELISA reader.
◦ Record the optical density values at the specified
wavelength.
C) Result Analysis:
1. Calculation:
◦ Compare the sample optical density values to the standard
curve generated from the kit standards.
◦ Calculate the PLA2R concentration in each sample using
the standard curve equation.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure control values fall within the pre-determined
acceptable range.
◦ Repeat any assays that do not meet quality control criteria.
3. Reporting Results
Reference Intervals: Provided in the reagent kit insert details.
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS for review and
verification by the technologist.
• Ensure all results are reported with the relevant unit (e.g., ng/mL).

1. Review and Quality Assurance
Regular review of this SOP should be conducted to ensure
compliance and incorporate any updates from the latest literature or
kit modifications. An annual audit should be performed by designated
personnel to ensure adherence and identify areas for improvement.
By following this detailed SOP, the laboratory will ensure that PLA2R
ELISA testing is performed accurately, consistently, and reliably, thus
providing dependable data for clinical monitoring and decision-
making.
