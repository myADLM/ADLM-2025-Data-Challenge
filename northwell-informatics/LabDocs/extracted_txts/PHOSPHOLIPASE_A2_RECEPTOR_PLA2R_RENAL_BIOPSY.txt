SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for PHOSPHOLIPASE A2
RECEPTOR (PLA2R) Testing on Renal Biopsy
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed steps required to
perform Phospholipase A2 Receptor (PLA2R) testing on renal biopsy
specimens. This testing is crucial for the diagnosis and management
of idiopathic membranous nephropathy and other related renal
conditions.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the analysis according to the protocol and to ensure the
accuracy and integrity of the data.
2. DEFINITION
PLA2R Testing: An immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry
assay performed on renal biopsy specimens to detect the presence
of Phospholipase A2 Receptor, a biomarker for certain glomerular
diseases.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Receive and Accession Specimen: i) Confirm receipt of the
renal biopsy specimen. Ensure proper labeling and requisition
forms accompany the specimen. ii) Accession the specimen in
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Fixation and Embedding: i) Fix the renal biopsy tissue in 10%
neutral buffered formalin for 24-48 hours. ii) Dehydrate, clear,
and embed the tissue in paraffin wax using an automatic tissue
processor. iii) Cut 3-4 micron thick sections on a microtome and
mount them on charged glass slides.
B. Staining Procedure
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: i) Place slides in a series
of xylene baths for 5 minutes each to remove paraffin. ii)
Rehydrate the sections by passing them through descending
concentrations of ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%) and rinse in
distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval: i) Immerse slides in a preheated retrieval
solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and incubate in a
microwave or pressure cooker as per standard protocol. ii)
Allow the slides to cool to room temperature and wash
thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
3. Blocking of Non-specific Binding: i) Incubate sections with
blocking solution (e.g., 5% BSA in PBS) for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation: i) Incubate sections with anti-
PLA2R primary antibody (dilution as per manufacturer’s
instructions) for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C
in a humidified chamber.
5. Washing: i) Wash slides with PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation: i) Incubate sections with a
suitable fluorophore-conjugated or enzyme-conjugated
secondary antibody (dilution as per manufacturer’s instructions)
for 1 hour at room temperature.
7. Washing: i) Wash slides with PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each.
8. Counterstaining (if required): i) If using immunofluorescence,
counterstain nuclei with DAPI or an equivalent for 5 minutes. ii)
If using immunohistochemistry, develop color with chromogen
solution (e.g., DAB) following standard protocol, then
counterstain with hematoxylin.
9. Mounting: i) Mount sections with an appropriate mounting
medium and cover with a glass coverslip.
C. Microscopic Analysis
1. Examine Stained Slides: i) Review the slides under a
fluorescence or bright-field microscope as appropriate. ii)
Document the presence, pattern, and intensity of PLA2R
staining.
2. Image Capture: i) Capture representative images using a
microscope-linked camera for documentation and reporting
purposes.
D. Quality Control and Troubleshooting
1. Run Controls: i) Include positive and negative controls with
each batch of staining to ensure the integrity of the staining
process. ii) Document control results in the Quality Control log.
2. Troubleshoot Any Issues: i) If controls do not perform as
expected, review and troubleshoot the procedure. Possible
corrective actions include checking reagent integrity, verification
of antibody concentrations, and reevaluating antigen retrieval
steps.
E. Reporting Results
1. Review and Interpret Results: i) A trained pathologist or
laboratory technologist should review the slides and interpret
the results. ii) Document findings in the LIS.
2. Communicate Findings: i) Compile a report detailing the
presence or absence of PLA2R staining, including the intensity
and localization of the signal. ii) Communicate results to the
ordering physician in a timely manner.
F. Sample Storage
1. Archive Slides: i) Store stained and unstained slides in a
designated archive area for future reference.
4. REFERENCES
i) Manufacturer's instructions for primary and secondary antibodies.
ii) Standard laboratory protocols for immunohistochemistry and
immunofluorescence staining procedures. iii) Relevant peer-reviewed
literature on PLA2R testing in renal biopsy samples.
5. DOCUMENTATION
i) Maintain records of accessioning, quality controls, and all
performed tests and interpretations in the LIS. ii) Ensure proper
documentation of any deviations from the standard protocol and
corrective actions taken.
By following this SOP, the laboratory aims to ensure accurate and
reliable detection of Phospholipase A2 Receptor in renal biopsy
specimens, aiding in the effective diagnosis and management of
renal diseases.
