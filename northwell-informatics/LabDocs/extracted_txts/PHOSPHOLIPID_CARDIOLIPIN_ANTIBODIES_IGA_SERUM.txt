Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analysis of Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgA, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for the analysis of Phospholipid
(Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgA in serum samples. This test is used for
diagnosing autoimmune conditions such as Antiphospholipid
Syndrome (APS).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedure as described and ensuring accurate results.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify and report
any deficiencies that may affect the test results to a supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the monitoring and
validation of the test processes.
1. DEFINITION
Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgA are specific autoantibodies
associated with autoimmune disorders, primarily APS. Elevated
levels typically indicate an immune response against cardiolipin, a
component of the cell membrane.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Microplate washer (optional)
• Reagents and supplies:
◦ Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgA ELISA kit
◦ Serum samples (properly accessioned and identified)
◦ Quality Control (QC) materials: High-positive and negative
sera
◦ Deionized water
◦ Laboratory timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling
• Serum is the preferred specimen. Ensure that the specimen is
properly collected, handled, and stored.
• Store the collected serum at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours.
For long-term storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
• Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix well before
analysis.
B. Reagent Preparation
• Follow the ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions for the
preparation of reagents, standards, and controls.
• Equilibrate all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before use.
C. Plate Preparation
• Label the microplate wells to ensure appropriate organization of
test samples, standards, controls, and blanks.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and patient sample to
the designated wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of the provided dilution buffer to blank wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature
(20-25°C).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate three times with the provided wash buffer.
Aspiration (manual or automated) should be thorough to
ensure complete removal of liquid.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate three times with the provided wash buffer.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well in the same
sequence and timing as the substrate addition.
8. Reading:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using
a microplate reader within 15 minutes of stopping the
reaction.
E. Quality Control
• Run the high-positive and negative QC sera with each set of
samples.
• Validate the run by ensuring that QC results fall within the
acceptable range as specified by the kit manufacturer.
• If QC results are not within acceptable limits, troubleshoot, and
repeat the assay.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and samples.
• Generate the standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance for
each standard against the known concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of Phospholipid (Cardiolipin)
Antibodies, IgA in patient samples using the standard curve.
• Results should be recorded and entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification by a qualified
technologist.
Reference Ranges: - Negative: < 20 IU/mL - Borderline: 20-39 IU/mL
- Positive: ≥ 40 IU/mL
Critical Values:
• Ensure to follow specific clinical indications and report any critical
value (e.g., ≥ 80 IU/mL) to the requesting physician immediately.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for limitations related to
sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences.
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay.
