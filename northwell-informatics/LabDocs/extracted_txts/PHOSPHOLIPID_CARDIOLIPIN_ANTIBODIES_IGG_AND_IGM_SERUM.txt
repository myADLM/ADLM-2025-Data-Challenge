Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Phospholipid
(Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgG and IgM, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing Phospholipid (Cardiolipin)
Antibodies, IgG and IgM in serum samples to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all personnel involved in performing the
analysis of Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies (IgG and IgM) in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
and document this procedure according to the SOP.
• It is the responsibility of senior laboratory staff to review and
validate results.
• The designated supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
adherence to this SOP and addressing any issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
Acceptance Criteria:
• Specimen should be properly labeled with patient's identification.
• Specimen should be free of hemolysis and lipemia.
• Specimen should be transported to the laboratory within 2 hours
of collection if kept at room temperature, or within 24 hours if
refrigerated at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens without proper labeling.
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtiter plate reader with 450 nm filter.
• Adjustable pipettes with disposable tips.
• Microtiter centrifuge if necessary.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Commercially available ELISA kits for Cardiolipin Antibodies IgG
and IgM.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Calibrators and Controls (provided in the kit).
• Wash buffer, Substrate solution, Stop solution (provided in the kit).
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples, controls, and calibrators to come to room
temperature.
2. Gently mix samples without causing hemolysis.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Label microtiter strips with patient identifiers, controls, and
calibrators.
3. Add X µL (as per kit instruction) of standards, controls, and
samples into their respective wells.
4. Incubate the plate at XX°C (as per kit instruction) for the
specified time.
5. Wash the plate X times using the wash buffer.
6. Add Y µL of conjugate to each well.
7. Incubate the plate at XX°C for the specified time.
8. Wash the plate X times using the wash buffer.
9. Add Z µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark for the specified time.
10. Add W µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using the microtiter plate
reader.
C. Interpretation of Results:
1. Generate the standard curve using the results from the
calibrators.
2. Calculate the concentration of IgG and IgM antibodies in each
sample using the standard curve.
3. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for cut-off values to
interpret the results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least one positive control, one negative control, and one
calibrator with each batch of tests.
• Document any runs that fall outside of the acceptable range and
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
• If controls do not fall within the acceptable range, do not report
patient results and repeat the assay.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be recorded in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Provide results in U/mL or as specified by the manufacturer.
• Note any discrepancies or issues encountered during testing in
the final report.
9. REFERENCE RANGES
Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for the reference values.
Typical reference ranges may include:
• Cardiolipin IgG: Negative (<10 U/mL), Indeterminate (10-15 U/
mL), Positive (>15 U/mL)
• Cardiolipin IgM: Negative (<10 U/mL), Indeterminate (10-15 U/
mL), Positive (>15 U/mL)
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in serum samples may interfere
with test results.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical
assessment.

• Manufacturer’s Instruction Manual for ELISA Kit.
• Relevant Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of assay runs, including calibrator and control
results, and any corrective actions taken.
• Document review and approval by the laboratory supervisor.
By adhering to this SOP, we ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable
testing for Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgG and IgM,
providing essential information for patient diagnosis and
management.
