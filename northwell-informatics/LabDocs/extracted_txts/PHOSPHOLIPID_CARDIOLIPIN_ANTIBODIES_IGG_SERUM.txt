Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies,
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the protocols for
the analytical phase of testing for Phospholipid (Cardiolipin)
Antibodies, IgG in serum. The procedure ensures accurate and
reliable measurement, documentation of results, quality control, and
appropriate corrective actions if needed.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Staff: Perform and document the analysis, perform
quality control measures, and abide by this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to the SOP, provide guidance
when issues arise, and monitor quality control data for trends or
deviations.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgG: Autoantibodies
associated with Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS).
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay): Common
analytical method used for detecting and quantifying specific
antibodies in the serum.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Collection:
◦ Preferred specimen: Serum, collected in a red-top tube or a
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Optimal volume: 1-2 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Serum must be separated from clot within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C and can be
frozen at -20°C or below for longer storage.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens as they can interfere
with the assay.
◦ Serum that has been heat-inactivated.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm.
◦ Incubator for maintaining the specified reaction temperature.
◦ Precision pipettes and tips.
◦ Washer for microplates (automated or manual).
• Reagents:
◦ Cardiolipin antigen-coated microplates.
◦ Wash buffer, sample diluent, enzyme conjugate (anti-human
IgG-HRP).
◦ Substrate solution (e.g., TMB), stop solution (e.g., 1N Sulfuric
acid).
◦ Calibrators and controls (low, medium, and high).
• Supplies:
◦ Disposable gloves, lab coat, distilled or deionized water.
◦ Storage requirements specified by manufacturer.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Set up the microplate reader and washer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples to
appropriately designated wells.
◦ Run all samples and controls in duplicates.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate wells at least 5 times with wash buffer.
◦ Ensure complete removal of liquid after each wash cycle.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate (HRP-labeled anti-human
IgG) to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate again at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly post-incubation.
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the
dark for 15-20 minutes.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the color
reaction.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
7. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run internal controls (low, medium, and high) with each assay.
2. Verify that the control results fall within the expected range. If
controls are out of range, do not report patient results, and
troubleshoot the assay.
3. Record all control values and calibrator absorbance values in
the QC log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the concentration of Cardiolipin IgG antibodies in
patient samples using the calibration curve generated by the
calibrators.
2. Verify results and ensure they match QC criteria before
reporting.
3. Record patient results in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < 15 GPL (IgG Phospholipid units/L)
• Indeterminate/Borderline: 15-20 GPL
• Positive: > 20 GPL
10. LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations, including
interference and cross-reactivity potential.
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples should be treated with
caution.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Issues with controls or anomalous results should be documented
and brought to the attention of a supervisor.
• Repeat testing if required and document any corrective actions
taken.
