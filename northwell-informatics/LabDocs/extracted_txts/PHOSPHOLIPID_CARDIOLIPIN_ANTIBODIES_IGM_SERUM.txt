Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Phospholipid
(Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgM, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable determination of serum levels of
Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) antibodies, IgM class, using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel who perform the analysis of
Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgM in serum specimens in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis, document results and take corrective actions if
needed in accordance with this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP and to
address any issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Specimen Collection:
◦ Collect blood specimens in a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes and then
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1,000-2,000 x g within 2 hours of
collection.
• Specimen Volume: A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum.
• Transport and Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if the assay is to be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Wash bottle or automated plate washer
• Precision pipettes
• Microplate (96-well) for ELISA
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Timer
• Phospholipid (Cardiolipin) Antibodies, IgM ELISA kit, which
includes:
◦ Coated microplate
◦ Calibrators
◦ Controls (positive and negative)
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(~20-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and other reagents as per the ELISA kit
instructions.
◦ Ensure all materials and equipment are at room temperature
and ready for use.
2. Calibration and Controls:
◦ Run both positive and negative controls to ensure assay
validity.
◦ Use kit-provided calibrators to generate a standard curve.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute serum specimens 1:100 with the sample diluent
provided in the kit.
2. Plate Loading:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted specimen, calibrator, and controls to
the respective wells.
◦ Incubate the microplate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the prepared wash buffer.
Complete removal of liquid at each step is essential for good
performance.
4. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
5. Secondary Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing procedure 3-5 times to ensure unbound
enzyme conjugate is removed.
6. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate for 15 minutes at room temperature
in the dark.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The color will
change from blue to yellow upon the addition of the stop
solution.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C) Calculation of Results
1. Standard Curve:
◦ Plot the absorbance values versus the concentration of the
calibrators to generate a standard curve.
2. Sample Calculation:
◦ Determine the concentration of Phospholipid (Cardiolipin)
Antibodies, IgM in the serum samples by interpolating the
absorbance values from the standard curve.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that controls fall within the acceptable ranges
specified by the kit insert before accepting the results.
4. Results Interpretation:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s reference intervals for
interpretation of the results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run Quality Controls (positive and negative) with every batch of
tests.
• If control values are out of range, do not report patient results until
the issue is resolved.
• Document all quality control measures in the appropriate log.
8. REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Results are to be transcribed into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and checked for accuracy.
• Review results for any discrepancies or unusual values and take
appropriate action if necessary.

Contact your supervisor immediately if you encounter any issues or
inconsistencies during the testing process.
This SOP remains in effect until further notice and must be reviewed
annually to ensure adherence to current guidelines and best
practices.
