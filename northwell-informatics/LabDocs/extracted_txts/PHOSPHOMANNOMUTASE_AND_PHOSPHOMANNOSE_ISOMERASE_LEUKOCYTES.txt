(PMI) enzyme activities.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps outlined in this procedure, including ensuring
quality control is maintained and any deviations are immediately
reported.

6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation
1. Leukocyte Isolation:
◦ Use freshly collected peripheral blood stored in EDTA
anticoagulated tubes.
◦ Isolate leukocytes using a leukocyte isolation kit following
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Collect and count the leukocytes to obtain a concentration
suitable for the enzymatic activity assays.
2. Cell Lysis:
◦ Lyse the isolated leukocytes using the lysis buffer provided
in the enzyme assay kit.
◦ Ensure that cell lysis is complete by vortexing and/or using a
sonicator if necessary.
◦ Centrifuge the lysate at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
cell debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean microtube for the
enzyme activity assay.
Enzyme Activity Measurement
1. Prepare Reagents:
◦ Prepare reagents and buffers as indicated in the kit insert.
◦ Calibrate the microplate reader and incubator to the correct
settings as specified in the assay instructions.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of substrate and buffer to the
microplate wells.
◦ Add a measured volume of leukocyte lysate to each well.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the time specified
by the assay kit.
◦ Ensure all runs include both positive and negative controls.
4. Termination of Reaction:
◦ Terminate the reaction using the stop solution provided in
the assay kit.
◦ Follow the exact timing as indicated to ensure
reproducibility.
5. Measurement:
◦ Measure the optical density of each well using a microplate
reader set to the wavelength specified in the assay kit's
instructions.
◦ Record and analyze the readings.
6. Calculations:
◦ Calculate enzyme activities following the manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Correct for any background absorbance using the negative
controls.
Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality control samples with each batch of tests
to ensure accuracy and precision.
◦ Document all quality control results and take corrective
actions if controls fall outside acceptable ranges.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs as
available.
3. Result Validation:
◦ Review all results to ensure they meet quality criteria before
reporting.
◦ Any suspicious or atypical results should be repeated or
flagged for further review.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) or
equivalent reporting system.
◦ Ensure all data is verified by a second technologist or
supervisor.
2. Reference Ranges:
◦ Report results with reference to established normal ranges
for PMM and PMI enzyme activities.
◦ Include any comments or notes on sample integrity or
deviations observed during the analytical process.
3. Result Communication:
◦ Communicate any critical or significantly abnormal results
promptly according to laboratory policy.
◦ Document all communications with healthcare providers as
per the lab's SOP.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure samples are processed promptly to prevent degradation
of enzyme activities.
• Hemolyzed or clotted samples are unacceptable for analysis and
should be rejected.
• Interpret results within the clinical context, considering patient's
clinical history and other laboratory findings.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• SOP to be reviewed annually by the laboratory supervisor.
• Revisions to be made based on updates to assay kits or
laboratory protocols.
NOTE: This SOP must be strictly followed as outlined to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results for Phosphomannomutase and
Phosphomannose Isomerase enzyme activities in leukocytes.
