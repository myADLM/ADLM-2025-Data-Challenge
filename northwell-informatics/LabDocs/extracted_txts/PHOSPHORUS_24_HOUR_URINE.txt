Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative Analysis
of Phosphorus in 24-Hour Urine Specimens
1. Purpose
◦ To ensure the accurate and precise quantification of
phosphorus in 24-hour urine specimens.
◦ To provide clear and consistent instructions for the analysis
process, ensuring quality control and results traceability.
2. Scope
◦ This procedure applies to all personnel within the laboratory
who are responsible for the analysis of phosphorus in 24-
hour urine samples.
◦ Analysis is to be conducted using the validated analytical
method and specific instrumentation designated for
phosphorus quantification.
3. Responsibilities
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP strictly to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the
test results.
◦ Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring proper
training and adherence to this procedure.
◦ Any discrepancies or issues identified during the analysis
should be reported immediately to a supervisor.
4. Specimen Requirements
◦ 24-hour urine collection with a preservative (typically
hydrochloric acid, unless otherwise specified).
◦ The collected volume must be accurately measured and
recorded.
◦ Acceptable Specimens: Those received within the specified
time window, properly labeled, with no indications of
contamination or degradation.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens lacking proper
collection labeling, showing signs of contamination, or
received outside the storage stability limits.
5. Reagents and Equipment
◦ Reagents:
▪ Molybdate reagent
▪ Ascorbic acid
▪ Standards for calibration
▪ Deionized water
◦ Equipment:
▪ Spectrophotometer
▪ Pipettes and tips
▪ Glass or plastic containers for reaction and dilution
▪ Timer or stopwatch
6. Preparation of Reagents
◦ Prepare the molybdate reagent and ascorbic acid according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare calibration standards from certified reference
materials. Follow lab-specific concentrations as required for
calibration curves.
7. Quality Control
◦ Run QC samples with each batch of patient specimens to
validate the assay.
◦ Use both high and low-level control solutions.
◦ Document and review QC results before verifying patient
results.
◦ Any QC results outside acceptable limits must be
investigated, and corrective actions must be performed and
documented.
8. Procedure
Calibration:
1. Turn on the spectrophotometer 30 minutes before
analysis to ensure warm-up and stability.
2. Prepare calibration standards by diluting the stock
solution to appropriate concentrations.
3. Run the calibration standards on the spectrophotometer.
4. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the absorbance
vs. concentration.
5. Calibration must meet the specified criteria (e.g., R² >
0.99) before proceeding.
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen well before aliquoting.
2. Aliquot a specific volume (e.g., 1-2 mL) of urine into a
reaction container.
3. Follow the dilution or concentration steps as necessary
based on the expected phosphorus concentration range.
Assay:
1. Add molybdate reagent to the urine sample and mix
thoroughly.
2. Allow the reaction to proceed for the specified time (e.g.,
10 minutes).
3. Add ascorbic acid to reduce the molybdic-phosphorus
complex and develop color.
4. After the specified reaction time (and in a specific
sequence if more steps needed), measure the
absorbance at the designated wavelength (e.g., 340 nm)
using the spectrophotometer.
5. Document the absorbance readings.
Calculations:
1. Use the calibration curve to convert absorbance readings
to phosphorus concentrations.
2. Multiply the obtained concentration by the total volume (in
liters) of the 24-hour urine collection to get the total
phosphorus excreted in 24 hours.
3. Document and calculate the phosphorus excretion in mg
or mmol/day as required.
9. Reporting Results
◦ Enter the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify the calculated results and QC data before reporting.
◦ Report any interfering substances or sample issues with
appropriate comments.
10. Reference Intervals
• Establish reference intervals specific to the patient population and
as described in the medical literature.
• Reference intervals for phosphorus in 24-hour urine may vary;
ensure proper documentation and adherence to institution-
specific ranges.
1. Clinical Interpretation
• High phosphorus in urine could indicate conditions such as
hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular damage, or excessive dietary
intake.
• Low phosphorus in urine could be observed in
hypoparathyroidism, severe malnutrition, or chronic antacid use.
1. References
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Instrument and reagent manufacturer’s instructions.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature in clinical chemistry.

Remember to adhere to all safety protocols and properly handle
patient specimens and chemicals. Regularly review this SOP and
update it as necessary to reflect current best practices.
