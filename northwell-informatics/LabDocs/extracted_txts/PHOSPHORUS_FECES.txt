Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Phosphorus Quantification in Feces
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for analyzing
phosphorus in fecal specimens to ensure accurate and reliable
results. This includes preparation, handling, analysis, and
documentation, while adhering to CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
phosphorus analysis in fecal specimens. All staff are responsible for
identifying any deficiencies or issues that could impact test results
and reporting them to the supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh fecal samples collected in a clean, dry container without
any preservatives.
• Stool sample should be free from urine or water contamination.
• Samples should be delivered to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection or stored refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours prior to
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens contaminated with urine or water.
• Samples collected in inappropriate containers.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without
refrigeration or more than 48 hours with refrigeration.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Spectrophotometer
• Analytical balance
Reagents:
• Ammonium molybdate
• Ascorbic acid solution
• Sulfuric acid
• Standard phosphorus solution
Supplies:
• Pipettes
• Volumetric flasks
• Test tubes
• Filter paper
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare ammonium molybdate solution as per manufacturer’s
specification.
• Prepare ascorbic acid solution freshly before use.
• Prepare sulfuric acid and appropriate dilutions as required for the
assay.
Sample Preparation:
1. Weigh approximately 1-2 grams of fecal sample.
2. Homogenize the fecal sample in deionized water.
3. Filter the fecal suspension using filter paper.
4. Make appropriate dilutions based on the expected range of
phosphorus concentrations.
Analysis Procedure:
1. Pipette an aliquot of the prepared fecal extract into a test tube.
2. Add the ammonium molybdate reagent and allow the formation
of the phosphomolybdate complex.
3. Add ascorbic acid reagent to reduce the complex, developing a
blue color.
4. Incubate the reaction mixture at room temperature for 30
minutes to stabilize the blue color.
5. Measure the absorbance of the solution at 880 nm using a
spectrophotometer.
Calculation of Results:
• Calculate the concentration of phosphorus in the feces using a
calibration curve generated with standard phosphorus solutions.
• Report results in mg/dL.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze standard phosphorus solutions and quality control
samples of known concentrations alongside fecal specimens.
• Document the results of the quality control samples to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
• Identify and troubleshoot any out-of-control measures.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation:
• Record assay results, including sample ID, technician initials,
date, and time of analysis.
• Verify results in LIS (Laboratory Information System) and ensure
results meet QC standards before release.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for normal phosphorus
levels in feces.
Method Limitations:
• Ensure all reagent preparation, calibration, and sample handling
procedures adhere to recommended guidelines to avoid
interference and inaccuracies.
