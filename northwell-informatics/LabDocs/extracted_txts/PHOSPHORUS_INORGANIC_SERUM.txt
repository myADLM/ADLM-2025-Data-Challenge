Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PHOSPHORUS (INORGANIC), SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
measuring inorganic phosphorus in serum specimens, ensuring
consistent, accurate, and precise results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the designated clinical laboratory scientists
and technicians to perform the analysis of serum phosphorus levels
according to this procedure, and to maintain accurate documentation
of all results and quality control measures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum collected in a tube with clot activator or plain red-top tube.
• Sample should be centrifuged and serum separated within 2
hours of collection.
• Store separated serum at 2-8°C if analysis is within 48 hours; for
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable:
• Samples collected in EDTA, citrate, or oxalate as these
anticoagulants can chelate inorganic phosphorus.
• Hemolyzed samples, as hemolysis may raise phosphorus levels.
• Samples not properly labeled or without a clear collection date/
time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
Equipment:
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman AU
series, etc.)
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated Pipettes
Reagents:
• Phosphorus color reagent (commercially available, validated by
the laboratory)
• Calibrators
• Controls (two levels, normal and abnormal)
• Deionized Water
Storage Conditions for Reagents:
• Store phosphorus reagent and calibrators as per manufacturer's
instructions, typically at 2-8°C.
• Do not use reagents beyond the expiration date provided by the
manufacturer.
1. PROCEDURE:
2. Preparation: a. Perform daily maintenance and calibration of
the chemistry analyzer as per manufacturer's protocols. b.
Verify that reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored correctly.
3. Calibration: a. Calibrate the analyzer using phosphorus
calibrators according to the manufacturer's instructions. b.
Document calibration results including any actions taken for
out-of-range calibrations.
4. Quality Control: a. Run two levels of quality control material
(normal and abnormal) at the beginning of each shift, after
calibration, and with each batch of patient samples. b.
Document the results of QC material. Acceptable ranges must
fall within the laboratory-determined limits. Any QC failures
must be investigated and resolved before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
5. Sample Analysis: a. Load patient samples into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions. b. Ensure that
samples are checked for proper identification and suitability
before analysis. c. Initiate the analysis run and verify that the
instrument is operating correctly.
6. Result Review and Verification: a. Upon completion of the
analysis, review the instrument printouts or data for any error
messages or flags. b. Verify that results are within acceptable
limits and that QC specimens have passed. c. Any flagged
results or out-of-range QC must be investigated. Repeat the
analysis if required.
7. Reporting Results: a. Enter verified results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). b. For results exceeding the critical
values, follow laboratory procedures for critical value
notification. c. Retain all records, including raw data and
calibration/QC logs, as per laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Reference intervals for serum inorganic phosphorus:
• Adults: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL
• Pediatric reference ranges may vary; refer to laboratory's specific
guidelines for age-related reference values.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed samples may result in falsely elevated phosphorus
levels.
• Lipemic or icteric samples may interfere with the assay.
• Ensure proper collection and handling to avoid pre-analytical
errors.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for phosphorus reagent kits and
chemistry analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
a. Record calibration, quality control, and patient results in
appropriate logs. b. Maintain records and documentation according to
the laboratory's record retention policy.
This SOP ensures that the process of measuring serum inorganic
phosphorus is precise, standardized, and reproducible, providing
reliable patient results.
