Standard Operating Procedure: Analysis of Phosphorus in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard protocol for the analytical phase of measuring
phosphorus levels in plasma specimens. This protocol ensures
consistent and accurate results that adhere to the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations and laboratory quality
standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of phosphorus in plasma specimens using the designated analytical
instruments and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform and document the analysis
according to this protocol and take appropriate actions for any
discrepancies.
• Supervisors: Ensure staff compliance with this SOP and address
any deviations or issues encountered.
4. DEFINITION
Phosphorus (Pi) is an essential mineral in the body critical for various
physiological functions, including bone formation, energy production,
and cellular repair. The concentration of phosphorus in plasma is
measured to help diagnose and monitor various medical conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instrument: ChemAnalyzer XYZ or equivalent
• Reagents: Phosphorus reagent kit (e.g., PhosphaReagent Kit by
ABC Labs)
• Controls: Normal and pathological phosphorus control materials
• Consumables: Pipettes, plasma collection tubes (heparinized),
microcentrifuge tubes
• Quality Control Materials: Commercial phosphorus controls (e.g.
Level 1 and Level 2)
• Calibrators: Phosphorus standard solutions
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma collected in heparinized tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of plasma required.
• Stability: Plasma samples are stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C and for
one month at -20°C.
• Handling: Avoid hemolysis and ensure complete separation of
plasma by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
6.2 Calibration:
• Perform a 2-point calibration using phosphorus standard solutions
before running patient samples.
• Follow manufacturer's instructions for preparation and loading of
calibrators.
6.3 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (Level 1 and Level 2) at the
beginning of each analytical run, after every 20 patient samples,
and at the end of the run.
• Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range. Investigate
and resolve any out-of-range QC results before proceeding with
patient samples.
6.4 Analysis:
• Load plasma samples into the appropriate sample rack based on
the instrument's specifications.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for operating the
ChemAnalyzer XYZ: i. Select the PHOSPHORUS assay on the
instrument's menu. ii. Verify calibrator and QC results are within
valid ranges. iii. Start the analysis run.
• The instrument will automatically aspirate samples, mix with
reagents, and measure the absorbance at the designated
wavelength as per the methodology (e.g., Molybdenum Blue
method).
6.5 Result Verification:
• Review all results for completeness and accuracy.
• Verify QC and calibrator results before releasing patient results.
• Any result falling outside the expected reference range (2.5-4.5
mg/dL) should be reviewed and verified for potential errors or
contamination.
6.6 Result Reporting:
• Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Flag critical values (e.g., <1.0 mg/dL or >7.0 mg/dL) and notify
responsible clinicians according to laboratory policy.
• Document all results and quality control checks in the logbook
and LIS.
6.7 Sample Retention:
• Retain analyzed samples at 2-8°C for at least 48 hours post-
analysis in case re-examination is required.
6.8 Method Limitations:
• Interfering substances such as high bilirubin, lipemia, or
hemolysis may affect the accuracy of phosphorus measurement.
Note any observed interferences and consult with supervisors for
further actions.
7. SAFETY AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPEs
(personal protective equipment) and proper waste disposal
methods.
• Consult the instrument's troubleshooting guide for resolving any
operational issues.
• Contact technical support for equipment malfunctions or reagent
issues.
