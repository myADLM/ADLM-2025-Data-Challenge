Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Phosphorus, Random
Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the analytical phase of generating
results for Phosphorus, Random, Urine to ensure accurate and
reliable measurements.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the analysis of phosphorus in random urine specimens.
3. DEFINITIONS N/A
4. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory technicians are responsible for performing the analysis
following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedure and addressing any issues that arise during the
process.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Random urine
• Container: Clean, sterilized urine container (preferably with no
additives)
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 10 mL
6. SPECIMEN STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is not
performed immediately.
• Stability: Urine samples are stable for up to 24 hours when
refrigerated.
7. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Urine chemistry analyzer (calibrated and maintained as per
manufacturer's instructions)
• Phosphorus reagent kit (store as per manufacturer’s guidelines)
• Calibrators and controls specific for phosphorus measurement
8. PROCEDURE 8.1 Preparation
• Thaw refrigerated samples to room temperature if applicable.
• Gently mix the urine sample to ensure homogeneity.
8.2 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration of the urine chemistry analyzer using
phosphorus calibrators as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Run quality control checks using both high and low phosphorus
controls at the beginning of each day and whenever a new lot of
reagents is used.
8.3 Analysis
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure the sample is well-mixed.
◦ Transfer the required volume of urine to the sample cup
provided with the analyzer or directly into the analyzer as
per its instructions.
2. Analyzer Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for loading the
sample into the urine chemistry analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate program/method for phosphorus
determination on the analyzer.
3. Measurement:
◦ Start the analysis as per the analyzer's operational
procedure.
◦ Allow the analyzer to process the sample and generate
results.
8.4 Post-Analysis
• Evaluate the results given by the analyzer.
• Check that the quality control results are within the acceptable
range prior to reporting patient results.
• Document any observations, deviations, or unexpected results
and notify the supervisor.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the phosphorus results from the analyzer.
• Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• If the results are flagged as critical (based on predefined critical
limits), follow the laboratory's protocol for reporting critical values.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the laboratory's established reference intervals for
phosphorus in random urine samples.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The accuracy of phosphorus measurement may be affected by
hemolysis, contamination, or improper storage of the urine
sample.
• Interfering substances (e.g., high calcium levels, ascorbic acid)
may affect the results.
12. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Ensure QC material is run after every calibration, major
maintenance, and reagent change.
• Maintain records of calibrations and quality control results.
• Perform regular maintenance on the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s schedule.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the urine chemistry
analyzer.
• Phosphorus reagent kit insert.
14. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records for specimen receipt, calibration, quality control,
daily operations, and results in accordance with laboratory
policies.
Note: All laboratory personnel must adhere to safety guidelines and
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during sample
handling and analysis.
