Standard Operating Procedure for PHOSPHORYLATED TDP43
IMMUNOSTAIN (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for phosphorylated TDP43
immunostain in the laboratory, ensuring accuracy and reproducibility
of the test results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemistry and responsible for performing
phosphorylated TDP43 immunostaining on tissue specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
and ensure the accuracy and quality of the test results. Supervisors
are responsible for reviewing the results and ensuring proper
documentation and adherence to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Tissue sections that are improperly
fixed, damaged, or have been stored incorrectly.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Phosphorylated TDP43 antibody.
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate species-specific secondary
antibody conjugated with enzyme or fluorophore.
• Blocking reagent: Specific blocking serum or reagent to prevent
non-specific binding.
• Detection system: Enzyme substrate or fluorophore for
visualization.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin or alternative counterstain.
• Mounting medium: Appropriate medium to preserve stained
sections.
• Positive and negative control slides.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome for cutting tissue sections.
• Slide warmer or oven.
• Humid chamber for incubation.
• Microscope for visualization and documentation.
• Pipettes, tubes, and other laboratory consumables.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Cut tissue sections (3-5 micrometers thick) using a microtome
and mount on charged glass slides.
2. Dry the slides in a slide warmer at 60°C for 1 hour.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 5 minutes (repeat two times).
2. Immerse slides in 100% ethanol for 3 minutes (repeat two
times).
3. Immerse slides in 95% ethanol for 3 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water (two changes).
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat slides in antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0)
using a pressure cooker or microwave method for 10 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D) Blocking:
1. Incubate slides with blocking reagent for 30 minutes at room
temperature in a humid chamber to prevent non-specific
binding.
E) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Dilute the phosphorylated TDP43 antibody according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Apply the diluted primary antibody to tissue sections and
incubate at 37°C for 1 hour or overnight at 4°C.
F) Washing:
1. Wash slides in PBS or appropriate wash buffer for 5 minutes
(three changes).
G) Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the appropriate secondary antibody and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
H) Washing:
1. Wash slides in PBS or appropriate wash buffer for 5 minutes
(three changes).
I) Detection:
1. Apply the enzyme substrate or fluorophore and incubate
according to manufacturer instructions. Monitor coloration
carefully to avoid overdevelopment.
J) Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin or alternative counterstain
for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
2. Rinse slides in tap water followed by distilled water.
3. Dehydrate through increasing ethanol concentrations (70%,
95%, and 100%) and finally xylene.
4. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Ensure the specificity and clarity of the staining by reviewing the
control slides.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and perform
corrective actions as needed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Examine stained sections under a microscope for the presence
and localization of phosphorylated TDP43.
• Record findings in the laboratory information system, indicating
staining intensity and distribution.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a trained pathology
technologist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Insufficient antigen retrieval or inappropriate antibody dilution may
lead to weak or non-specific staining.
• Overdevelopment of the detection step may obscure staining
results.
