STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR THE ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR PHTHALIC
ANHYDRIDE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide detailed steps for the analytical process of generating results
for Phthalic Anhydride-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum.
Ensuring accurate and reliable results for Phthalic Anhydride-specific
IgE aids in the diagnosis of allergic sensitization or occupational
allergy related to exposure to Phthalic Anhydride.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
procedure as described.
• It is the duty of all laboratory staff to identify any deviations from
the procedure and report them to a supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Phthalic Anhydride, IgE, Serum: An immunological response
indicative of allergy to Phthalic Anhydride, quantified in serum.
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay): The preferred
method to measure IgE specific to Phthalic Anhydride in patient
serum.
1. PRINCIPLE OF THE TEST
The ELISA technique is utilized in this procedure to detect and
quantify specific IgE antibodies against Phthalic Anhydride in serum.
The assay involves the binding of specific IgE from the patient’s
serum to Phthalic Anhydride coated on a microplate, followed by
detection using an enzyme-labeled anti-IgE antibody.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen: Serum is the preferred specimen.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) and should be handled as follows:
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the SST at 1,500 g for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum to a new transport tube.
◦ Store the serum at 2-8°C if the analysis will be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C
or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength (e.g., 450 nm with a 620 nm reference
filter).
• Precision pipettes and tips (10 µL to 1000 µL range).
• ELISA washing system or multi-channel pipettor.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
• Phthalic Anhydride IgE-specific ELISA kit.
• Microplate shaker.
1. REAGENTS
• Follow the instructions provided in the Phthalic Anhydride-specific
IgE ELISA kit for:
◦ Coated microplate wells.
◦ Diluent buffers.
◦ Wash solution.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Enzyme conjugate reagent.
◦ Stop solution.
1. PROCEDURE
• Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
◦ Prepare the wash solution by diluting the concentrated stock
according to kit instructions.
• Assay Procedure:
1. Microplate Preparation:
▪ Add 100 µL of standard, control, or patient serum to the
designated wells.
▪ Let the plate incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
2. Washing:
▪ Aspirate and wash each well with 300 µL of wash
solution. Perform this step three times, ensuring to
remove all residual wash buffer by firmly tapping the
plate on absorbent paper.
3. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to all wells and
incubate at 37°C for 1 hour on a microplate shaker.
4. Substrate Solution Addition:
▪ Following another washing step as described above, add
100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for
10-20 minutes.
5. Stop Reaction:
▪ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
6. Reading the Plate:
▪ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm against a
620 nm reference using an ELISA reader.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control samples with each assay to
ensure the test is working correctly and providing accurate
measurements.
• Deviations in control sample values should prompt an
investigation and corrective actions as necessary before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculations:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the absorbance values of the
known standards.
◦ Use the standard curve to calculate the concentration of
Phthalic Anhydride-specific IgE in patient serum samples.
• Units & Reference Intervals:
◦ Report values in IU/mL or corresponding assay units.
◦ Reference interval for Phthalic Anhydride-specific IgE is
typically <0.35 IU/mL, but should be confirmed with kit insert or
institutional standards.
• Verify results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure they are reviewed by a qualified technologist.
