Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Physician Interpretation - Conventional, Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process for generating
results from analytical procedures in the laboratory for
physician interpretation. This ensures all results are accurate,
timely, and ready for clinical decision-making.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel involved in the analytical phase of
testing are responsible for adhering to this SOP. Supervisors
and senior laboratory scientists ensure compliance and proper
documentation.
3. DEFINITION
Results for Physician Interpretation: Data derived from
laboratory tests that clinicians utilize to diagnose, treat, and
manage patients.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis
1. Ensure instruments and equipment are calibrated
according to manufacturer guidelines.
2. Verify that quality controls are within acceptable limits
before beginning any analysis.
3. Prepare reagents and samples according to specific test
protocols.
B. Analytical Testing
1. Follow specific test procedure protocols mentioned in the
laboratory’s SOP manual based on the type of test being
performed.
2. Record all necessary information during testing including:
▪ Sample identification
▪ Date and time of analysis
▪ Initials of the technologist performing the test.
3. Monitor and document the performance of analytical
instruments throughout testing to ensure reliability.
4. Perform any necessary calculations to derive final results
from raw data.
C. Validation of Results
1. Compare results against reference ranges and normal
values.
2. Verify the integrity of results by examining quality control
outcomes and instrument logs.
3. Utilize duplicate or repeat testing in cases of unexpected
or critical values.
4. All critical values should be promptly verified and reported
following the lab policy.
D. Documentation and Review
1. Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by
authorized personnel before release.
3. If discrepancies or inconsistencies are found, troubleshoot
according to the laboratory’s protocol and consult with the
supervisor if needed.
E. Reporting Results
1. Results are reported in a standardized format ready for
physician interpretation.
2. Ensure the LIS transmits results accurately to the
Electronic Health Record (EHR) system or other
designated reporting systems.
3. Include reference intervals and any necessary
interpretative comments in the report.
4. For critical and urgent results, follow the lab’s protocol for
immediate communication to the appropriate healthcare
provider.
F. Sample Integrity
1. Check sample integrity before releasing results. If a
sample's integrity is compromised (e.g., hemolysis, clots),
document and address accordingly.
2. Any compromised results should be flagged, and a
comment should be appended to the report.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Perform quality control measures specific to analytical tests,
including daily, weekly, and monthly checks. B. If a QC result
falls outside of acceptable limits, do not report patient results
until the issue is resolved. C. Document all QC results and
corrective actions taken.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to specific SOP documents for individual reference
intervals related to the tests being performed.
7. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This document and its contents will be reviewed annually by the
laboratory management to ensure adequacy and compliance
with current regulations and standards.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD MAINTENANCE
All records associated with analytical testing—including raw
data, results, and quality control—will be maintained according
to laboratory policy and regulatory requirements.
