STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Physician
Interpretation – Diagnostic, Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating diagnostic results for physician interpretation
from various types of laboratory tests. These procedures ensure the
accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of results reported to healthcare
providers.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of testing, including those performing manual or
automated diagnostic tests across different specimen types and test
categories.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform and document all analytical
procedures, ensure adherence to quality control measures, and
verify test results prior to reporting.
• Supervisors: Oversee the analytical process, address any issues
arising during testing and validate final results.
• Quality Assurance Personnel: Monitor compliance with SOPs,
manage proficiency testing, and implement corrective actions as
needed.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Analytical Phase: The phase in the testing process that includes
all procedures from receipt of a specimen in the laboratory to the
production of test results.
• QC: Quality Control measures to ensure tests are performed
accurately.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System used for the management
and reporting of laboratory test results.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Laboratory Analyzers (hematology, chemistry, immunoassay, etc.)
• Reagents and Controls
• Calibration materials
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Handling
1. Verify the identification of the sample against the test requisition
form and ensure proper labeling.
2. Assess the sample for adequacy and appropriateness for the
requested test.
3. Reject and document any specimens that do not meet the
acceptance criteria as outlined by the laboratory policy.
B) Test Performance
1. Calibration and QC:
◦ Perform instrument calibration as specified by the
manufacturer's guidelines before running patient samples.
◦ Conduct and document Quality Control tests at the
beginning of each shift, and whenever the test system is
recalibrated or reagents are changed.
◦ Review QC results to ensure they are within established
control limits.
2. Running Samples:
◦ Load samples onto the analyzer or prepare for manual
testing according to the specific test protocols.
◦ Initiate the test run, ensuring all instruments are operating
under optimal conditions.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions, standard methods, and
laboratory-specific procedures for each test.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If any errors or issues arise during testing, follow
established troubleshooting protocols.
◦ Document the error and corrective actions taken.
◦ Re-run the affected samples as necessary.
C) Result Verification and Validation
1. Preliminary Examination:
◦ Review the raw data generated from the analyzers for any
flags, alerts, or errors.
◦ Ensure that all control results are within acceptable limits
before validating patient results.
2. Result Validation:
◦ Compare results to established reference ranges and
consider clinical context if applicable.
◦ Utilize delta checks where relevant to detect significant
changes in a patient’s results.
◦ Validate results per laboratory policy before entering them
into the LIS.
3. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter validated results into the LIS.
◦ Include comments, flags, and critical test alerts where
needed.
◦ Ensure that results are promptly and accurately
communicated to the requesting physician or healthcare
provider.
D) Quality Control and Documentation
1. Documentation:
◦ Log the date, time, and initials of the person performing the
tests into the appropriate records.
◦ Maintain all QC, calibration, maintenance, and test run data
as per laboratory records retention policies.
2. Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external quality assessment (proficiency
testing) programs.
◦ Implement corrective actions for any identified deficiencies
in the analytical processes.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that technical and procedural limitations identified in test-
specific SOPs are reviewed and adhered to.
• Monitor for potential pre-analytical and post-analytical influences
that could impact test outcomes.

10. APPROVAL
This protocol is approved by the Laboratory Director and reviewed
annually or upon any major procedural changes.
