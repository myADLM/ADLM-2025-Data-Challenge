Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Physician Interpretation Screen, Varies
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for accurately generating,
reviewing, and reporting laboratory results for the Physician
Interpretation Screen, Varies, ensuring adherence to quality
standards and providing reliable data for physician interpretation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All designated laboratory staff, including
technologists and supervisors, are responsible for adherence to this
protocol, ensuring that all processes are followed accurately and
timely.
3. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION A. Specimen
Requirements
• Specimen type: Blood, urine, or other fluid as specified by the
testing requirements.
• Volume: As specified by the laboratory testing guidelines.
B. Specimen Stability and Storage
• Store specimens at temperature conditions recommended for
specific tests until analyzed.
• Ensure all specimens are properly labeled with patient
information, collection date, and time.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Use appropriate analytical instruments as specified by the test
methods (e.g., analyzers, centrifuges).
• Ensure all reagents and supplies are within expiration dates and
properly stored.
5. QUALITY CONTROL A. Intralaboratory Quality Control
• Run daily quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each
shift and whenever reagents or instruments are changed. Record
the results in the Quality Control Log.
• Utilize QC materials specific to the tests being performed to
confirm the accuracy and reliability of results.
B. External Quality Control
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as mandated by
regulating agencies.
• Document and review external QC results regularly.
6. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE A. General Guidelines
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for operating analytical
instruments.
• Perform calibration checks as required and document results.
B. Patient Testing
1. Verify specimen information matches the test requisition.
2. Centrifuge specimens if necessary for plasma or serum
separation.
3. Load specimens onto the analyzer following the specific
instructions for each type of specimen.
4. Run the tests as per the analyzer’s protocol, ensuring all
required parameters are selected.
5. Document any deviations or troubleshooting steps taken during
the analysis.
7. DATA REVIEW AND VALIDATION A. Validation Process
• Review all test results for discrepancies and ensure QC passes
before validation.
• Compare results with established reference ranges and flag any
abnormal results for further review.
B. Troubleshooting and Repeat Testing
• In case of instrument error or inconclusive results, repeat the test
following the established protocol.
• Document all repeat tests and any corrective actions taken in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
8. REPORTING RESULTS A. Result Entry
• Enter validated results into the LIS promptly. Ensure all data
entries are checked for accuracy.
• Add comments where necessary, especially if results are outside
the normal range or if any procedural deviations occurred.
B. Critical Results
• Promptly notify the physician or designated clinical staff of any
critical results following the Critical Results Notification Policy.
• Document notification details in the patient’s record, including the
name of the person notified, date, time, and any additional
relevant information.
9. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain complete records of all specimens processed, including
patient details, specimen handling, test results, QC logs,
calibration checks, and any troubleshooting performed.
• Ensure records are stored securely and are easily retrievable for
audits or reviews.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for each analyzer and reagent
used.
• Laboratory Quality Control and Proficiency Testing guidelines.
• CLIA regulations and accreditation requirements.
11. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in procedure, equipment, or regulatory guidelines.
• Revisions will be approved by the laboratory director.
