Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for pH, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
measuring the pH in a 24-hour urine specimen.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
processing, analyzing, and reporting pH results for 24-hour urine
specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the pH
analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure that all personnel are trained and competent in
these procedures and that all documentation is complete and
accurate.
4. DEFINITIONS
pH: A measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution,
indicating its acidity or alkalinity.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• 24-hour urine collection in a clean, chemically inert container. The
collection should be kept refrigerated or preserved with an acid
(e.g., HCl) as per standard practice.
• A minimum volume of 100 mL from the total 24-hour urine
collection is required for analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly collected or not labeled with collection
start and end times.
• Specimens not preserved properly or stored at inappropriate
temperatures.
• Specimens with visible contaminants or signs of improper
handling.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• pH meter calibrated for urine analysis
• Calibration buffers (e.g., pH 4.0, pH 7.0, and pH 10.0)
• Clean and dry beakers
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Deionized water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and goggles
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Run daily calibration and quality control checks on the pH meter
using standard buffers before analyzing patient specimens.
Document calibration results in the logbook.
8. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Ensure the pH meter is properly calibrated with pH 4.0, 7.0, and
10.0 buffers.
3. Label all necessary containers and log entries.
B) Specimen Handling
1. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen thoroughly to ensure uniformity.
2. Transfer 10 mL of the urine specimen into a clean, dry beaker
using a pipette.
C) pH Measurement
1. Rinse the pH electrode with deionized water and blot dry with a
lint-free tissue.
2. Place the pH electrode into the urine specimen.
3. Allow the reading to stabilize before recording the result.
4. Rinse and blot the pH electrode between samples to prevent
cross-contamination.
D) Documentation and Reporting
1. Record the pH result in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Verify that the pH value is within the physiological range
(subject to specific laboratory guidelines).
3. Include the pH value in the final report sent to the requesting
healthcare provider.
4. Document any anomalies or deviations from standard operating
procedures.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Normal physiological range for urine pH is typically between 4.5
and 8.0. Values outside this range should be flagged for further
review.
2. Contaminants or improper preservation can affect pH accuracy.
Ensure proper collection and storage protocols are followed.
