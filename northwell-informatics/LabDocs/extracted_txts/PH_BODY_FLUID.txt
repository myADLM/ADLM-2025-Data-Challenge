Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for pH, Body Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the accurate measurement,
documentation, and reporting of pH in body fluids other than blood.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the pH
measurement, documentation, and reporting as defined in this
procedure. All laboratory staff must inform the supervisor of any
deviations or issues encountered during the process. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure and addressing
any issues that arise during the pH measurement.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Pleural fluid
• Peritoneal fluid
• Synovial fluid
• Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
• Other clinically relevant body fluids as requested
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not adequately labelled with the patient information,
collection date, and time
• Specimens exhibiting signs of contamination or hemolysis
• Specimens that have degraded or are older than recommended
stability limits
Stability:
• Specimens should be analyzed as soon as possible after
collection to ensure the accuracy of pH measurement.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if immediate analysis is not possible,
and transport promptly to the laboratory. Avoid prolonged storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• pH meter: calibrated at the beginning of each shift
• Calibrated reference solutions (e.g., pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 buffers)
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Sterile containers for bodily fluid specimens
• Pipettes and pipette tips: for sample transfer
• Record log: for documenting pH meter calibration and sample
results
• Distilled water: for cleaning equipment
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the sample is properly labelled and was transported
under appropriate conditions.
2. Allow the sample to equilibrate to room temperature
(approximately 15-30 minutes) before analysis.
Instrument Calibration:
1. Perform a three-point calibration of the pH meter using pH 4.0,
7.0, and 10.0 buffer solutions.
2. Verify calibration against manufacturer's instructions and record
the calibration results in the logbook.
Measurement:
1. Transfer a portion of the body fluid specimen into a clean, dry
container.
2. Immerse the pH electrode in the container containing the
specimen, ensuring no air bubbles are trapped.
3. Allow the pH reading to stabilize, usually within 2-3 minutes.
4. Record the pH value, along with the patient's information, date,
and time of analysis in the appropriate logbook.
5. Clean the pH electrode thoroughly with distilled water after
each measurement.
Troubleshooting:
1. If the pH meter displays erratic or unstable readings, recalibrate
the instrument using the buffer solutions.
2. Check that the electrode is in good working condition and
replace if necessary.
3. If the specimen is found to be unsuitable (e.g., hemolyzed or
contaminated), discard and request a new sample.
Documentation and Reporting:
1. Ensure all recorded pH values are accurately documented in
the logbook along with corresponding patient information.
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly.
3. Review and verify the results against the site-specific standards
before final reporting to the clinician.
4. Flag and notify the clinician of any critical pH results as per
established guidelines.
Quality Control:
1. Verify and document calibration of pH meter and buffer
solutions according to internal QC protocols.
2. Perform routine maintenance and validation checks on the pH
meter to ensure continued accuracy and precision.
Method Limitations:
1. The accuracy of pH measurements can be affected by
degradation, contamination, or hemolysis of samples.
2. Proper sample handling and timely measurement are crucial to
minimizing alterations to the pH value.
