Standard Operating Procedure for Fecal pH Testing
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the determination of fecal pH in clinical specimens. This
assay is used to assess the acidity or alkalinity of stool samples
and can be helpful in diagnosing various gastrointestinal
conditions.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the pH test on fecal specimens, documenting the results,
and taking corrective actions if necessary. It is the responsibility of all
staff to follow this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Fresh stool specimen collected in a clean, dry container and
received in the laboratory within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Dehydrated or dried stool specimens.
• Specimens mixed with urine or water.
• Specimens received more than 2 hours after collection without
appropriate storage (4°C).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• pH meter or pH test strips (range: 4.0-10.0)
• Deionized water
• Calibration buffers (pH 4.0, pH 7.0, and pH 10.0)
• Stool sample container
• Disposable pipettes
• Gloves and other standard PPE
• Laboratory balance (optional, for consistency)
1. PROCEDURE
For pH meter use: A) Calibration of pH meter:
1. Calibrate the pH meter daily or before performing any tests by
using calibration buffers (pH 4.0, pH 7.0, and pH 10.0)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Adjust the meter to read the buffer solution pH at room
temperature.
3. Document calibration in the calibration log, noting date, time,
and technician initials.
B) Analysis:
1. Homogenize approximately 1 gram (g) of fecal specimen with
10 mL of deionized water in a small beaker or container.
2. Using a clean disposable pipette, transfer a small aliquot of the
homogenized solution into the pH meter’s sample cup.
3. Immerse the pH meter electrode into the sample, ensuring it is
completely covered by the homogenized solution.
4. Allow the pH meter to stabilize and record the pH value.
5. Rinse the electrode with deionized water between samples to
prevent cross-contamination.
6. Document the pH reading in the laboratory information system
(LIS) or as per site-specific guidelines.
For pH test strip use: A) Analysis:
1. Homogenize approximately 1 gram (g) of fecal specimen with
10 mL of deionized water in a small beaker or container.
2. Dip a pH test strip into the homogenized solution and remove
immediately.
3. Compare the color change on the test strip to the color chart
provided by the manufacturer to determine the pH.
4. Document the pH value in the laboratory information system
(LIS) or as per site-specific guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL Include quality control (QC) procedures to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the fecal pH test:
6. Run a positive control (e.g., known pH buffer) and a negative
control (e.g., deionized water) along with patient samples.
7. QC checks should be documented in a QC log, including date,
time, and technician initials.
8. If QC results fall out of acceptable range, recalibrate the pH
meter and re-test QC specimens before proceeding with patient
testing.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Enter fecal pH test results into the laboratory information
system (LIS) or follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
11. If the fecal pH value falls outside the expected range for normal
stool (typically pH 6.0 – 7.5), generate an appropriate comment
for the clinician’s review.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS Normal fecal pH range: 6.0 – 7.5.
13. METHOD LIMITATIONS
14. The pH of a stool sample can be affected by contamination
(e.g., urine, water, chemicals). Ensure samples are collected
and handled properly.
15. The time between sample collection and analysis should be
minimized to avoid changes in pH due to microbial activity.
