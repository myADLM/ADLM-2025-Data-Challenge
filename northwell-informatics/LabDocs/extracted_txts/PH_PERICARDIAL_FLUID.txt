Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of pH in
Pericardial Fluid
1. PURPOSE To outline the steps necessary to accurately determine
the pH of pericardial fluid specimens in a clinical laboratory setting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing, documenting, and ensuring the quality of
the pH analysis of pericardial fluid as per this procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable:
• Pericardial fluid obtained via pericardiocentesis.
• Specimen should arrive in the laboratory immediately after
collection to avoid pH changes.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are not promptly sent or show signs of
contamination.
• Specimens received in anything other than sterile containers.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• pH Meter
• Calibration buffers (pH 4.00, 7.00, and 10.00)
• Beakers or containers for buffers and samples
• Disposable pipettes
• Gloves
• Lab coat
• Logbook for recording results
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Steps:
1. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
◦ Receive pericardial fluid specimens in sterile containers.
◦ Inspect the specimen for proper labeling and volume
adequacy.
◦ Ensure the specimen is free of visible particulates.
◦ Specimen should be maintained at room temperature.
B. Equipment Calibration:
1. Calibration of pH Meter:
◦ Turn on the pH meter and allow it to stabilize according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Rinse the electrode with distilled water.
◦ Calibrate the pH meter using fresh pH 4.00, 7.00, and 10.00
buffer solutions.
◦ Record the calibration details in the logbook.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Testing Steps:
◦ Rinse the pH electrode with distilled water and gently blot
dry before testing each sample.
◦ Immerse the electrode into the pericardial fluid specimen,
ensuring proper electrode coverage.
◦ Allow the reading to stabilize and record the pH value.
◦ Rinse the electrode with distilled water between each
sample and blot dry.
◦ Perform all steps in triplicate to ensure accuracy. Calculate
the average pH from the three readings.
◦ In case of discrepancies across readings (>0.1 pH units),
recalibrate the pH meter and repeat the analysis.
D. Post-analytical Steps:
1. Recording Results:
◦ Document the pH readings in the laboratory information
system (LIS) along with the date, time, and initials of the
technician.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples with known pH values before
and after testing pericardial fluid samples.
◦ Document QC results and take corrective actions if QC
results do not fall within acceptable limits.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the pH meter fails to calibrate correctly, check and replace
buffers if expired. Consult the pH meter manual for further
troubleshooting steps.
• If persistent issues arise with the pH meter, contact the equipment
vendor for support.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be entered into the LIS and must be reviewed and
verified by a certified technologist.
8. LIMITATIONS
• The pH of pericardial fluid must be measured promptly after fluid
collection to avoid alterations due to air exposure or temperature
changes.
• Specimens with excessive blood or other contaminants should be
interpreted with caution.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's pH meter manual.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines.
• Relevant institutional protocols and quality control documents.
10. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• This document will be reviewed on an annual basis or as needed
to ensure compliance with the latest regulations and technological
advancements.
