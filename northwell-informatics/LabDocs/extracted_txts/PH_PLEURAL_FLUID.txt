STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) ANALYSIS OF PH
IN PLEURAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and reliable measurement
of pH in pleural fluid samples using CLIA-certified methods to ensure
result integrity.
RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to
conduct pH testing on pleural fluid samples accurately and
according to the outlined procedure.
• All laboratory personnel must ensure equipment is calibrated,
quality control measures are in place, and any anomalies are
reported to a supervisor immediately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
• Specimen Type: Pleural fluid.
• Collection: Pleural fluid must be collected using aseptic
techniques.
• Acceptable containers: Sterile, heparinized syringe.
• Stability: Must be analyzed immediately upon receipt. If there is
any delay, store on ice for no more than 30 minutes.
• Unacceptable conditions: Specimens received in non-sterile
containers or those with significant air bubbles. Specimens that
show signs of clotting, mislabeled, or inadequately filled
containers should be rejected and the collection should be
repeated.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• pH analyzer (e.g., ABL90 blood gas analyzer or equivalent).
• Automated quality control materials (three levels of quality control:
acidic, neutral, alkaline).
• Calibration solutions (traceable to NIST standards).
4. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration: Perform a full calibration of the pH analyzer every
8 hours or as recommended by the manufacturer.
2. Quality Control: Run three levels of pH control solutions
(acidic, neutral, and alkaline) at the start of each shift (every 8
hours). Document the results. Ensure all QC results are within
the acceptable range before analyzing patient samples.
B) Sample Analysis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Verify that the pleural fluid specimen is cold and has been
properly labeled with the patient ID, collection date, and
time.
◦ Inspect the sample for clots or bubbles. Reject if present.
2. Setup:
◦ Set the analyzer to the pH testing mode.
3. Measurement:
◦ Mix the pleural fluid sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Using a pipette, carefully transfer the sample into the
sample port of the pH analyzer. Ensure no bubbles are
introduced during this step.
◦ Initiate the analysis according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Result Documentation:
◦ Record the pH value provided by the analyzer.
◦ Ensure to document the time of analysis, the analyzer used,
and any relevant details in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results before reporting. If the pH value falls out
of physiological range or if there is any doubt about sample
integrity, conduct duplicate tests.
• Critical results must be immediately relayed to the responsible
clinician and documented, following the laboratory's critical value
policy.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for the interpretation and
reporting of pH values.
6. QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES
• Follow manufacturer’s procedures for all internal quality control
processes.
• Log the quality control results with each run and check to ensure
values fall within pre-defined limits.
• Verify instrument functionality and calibration regularly, and
maintain the equipment log for all maintenance activities.
• Conduct bi-weekly intra-laboratory comparisons with other routine
analyzers if available.
7. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow the analyzer's user manual for routine maintenance and
troubleshooting.
• Document any instrument issues or deviations in the maintenance
log and notify the supervisor immediately for further guidance.

• Manufacturer's user manual for the pH analyzer.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines for laboratory quality control
(latest version).
This SOP ensures accurate and reliable measurement of pH in
pleural fluid samples, ensuring timely and appropriate patient care
decisions based on the results.
