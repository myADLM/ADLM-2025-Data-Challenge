STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase - Generating Results for pH, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE: To define the analytical phase procedure for
measuring pH in a random urine sample using standardized
laboratory practices to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
trained to perform urinalysis tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the laboratory
technologists and supervisors to perform and document urine
pH measurements following this procedure. Any anomalies or
deviations must be reported immediately.
4. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/acceptable: - 10 mL freshly voided random urine sent to the
laboratory within 6 hours of collection.
Unacceptable: - Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 6
hours after collection. - Specimens with no collection date/time
indicated on the sample container. - Specimens that have not been
properly labeled or have visible contamination.
Note: If the sample has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
◦ pH Meter (calibrated)
◦ Urine collection container
◦ Disposable pipettes
◦ Control solutions (for quality control)
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab
coat, and goggles
2. PROCEDURE:
A) Pre-Analytical:
• Ensure the urine specimen is brought to room temperature before
analysis.
• Verify the specimen label against the accompanying requisition to
confirm patient identity.
B) Calibration of pH Meter:
• Calibrate the pH meter at the beginning of each day or before
each batch of tests using standard buffer solutions (pH 4, 7, and
10).
• Record the calibration details in the pH Meter Calibration Log.
C) Measurement Procedure:
• Mix the urine specimen gently by swirling, without creating foam.
• Using a disposable pipette, transfer enough urine into a clean
container to measure pH.
• Rinse the pH probe with deionized water and blot dry with a lint-
free tissue.
• Immerse the pH probe into the urine sample ensuring it is fully
submerged.
• Allow the reading to stabilize, then record the pH value.
• Rinse the pH probe between measurements to prevent cross-
contamination.
D) Post-Analytical:
• Dispose of any used materials and urine samples according to
biohazard waste protocols.
• Document the pH value in the designated log and electronic
medical record system.
• If the pH value is outside the expected range (typically 4.5-8.0),
notify the supervisor immediately for further investigation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
A) Control Solutions:
• Analyze two levels of control solutions (low and high pH) at the
start of each testing session to ensure the accuracy of the pH
meter.
• Record control results in the Quality Control Log.
B) Corrective Action:
• If control results are out of acceptable range, recalibration and
troubleshooting of the pH meter are required.
• Do not report patient results until controls are within acceptable
limits.
• Document any corrective actions taken in the log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Enter the final pH value into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting and verifying
results.
◦ Add relevant comments or flags if the pH value falls outside
the reference range.
2. REFERENCE INTERVAL:
◦ Normal urine pH: 4.5 – 8.0
3. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s Manual for the pH Meter
• CLIA guidelines for urinalysis testing

This SOP is effective immediately and must be reviewed annually or
as required by changes in standard laboratory practices or regulatory
mandates.
