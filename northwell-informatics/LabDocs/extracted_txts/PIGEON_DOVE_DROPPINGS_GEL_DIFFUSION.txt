Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Pigeon/Dove
Droppings Gel Diffusion
1. Purpose
This SOP provides guidelines for the analytical phase involving the
gel diffusion analysis of pigeon/dove droppings to detect the
presence of specific antigens or pathogens. It includes specimen
preparation, conducting the gel diffusion assay, interpreting results,
and ensuring quality control.
1. Scope
This procedure applies to all designated staff performing and
reviewing the results of gel diffusion tests for pigeon/dove droppings
in the laboratory.
1. Definitions
Gel Diffusion Assay: A method used to detect and quantify specific
antigens or pathogens by observing the formation of precipitation
lines in a gel matrix.
1. Responsibilities
Designated staff are responsible for performing the gel diffusion
assay according to this SOP, documenting the results, and identifying
any issues that might affect the accuracy of the test results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all testing follows the
SOP and for addressing any deficiencies or corrective actions
required.
1. Procedure
A. Specimen Preparation i. Collect the specimen of pigeon/dove
droppings ensuring proper handling and containment. ii. Homogenize
the droppings in sterile saline solution to create a uniform sample. iii.
Prepare multiple aliquots of the homogenized sample for replicates
and controls. iv. Use centrifugation or filtration methods to remove
particulate matter if necessary. v. Label each specimen aliquot with a
unique identification number.
B. Gel Preparation i. Prepare the agarose gel with a concentration
suitable for diffusion (typically 1-2% agarose). ii. Pour the gel into a
suitable mold and allow it to solidify. iii. Create wells in the gel using a
template to ensure uniformity. Wells should be appropriately spaced
to avoid overlapping diffusion zones.
C. Assay Setup i. Load the wells with the designated specimen
aliquots and controls (positive and negative). ii. Load the wells with
specific antibodies or antigens as per the test protocol. iii. Cover the
gel and incubate at room temperature or specified temperature to
allow diffusion to occur (typically 24-48 hours).
D. Interpretation of Results i. After the incubation period, observe the
gel for the formation of precipitation lines. ii. Record the presence
and patterns of precipitation lines for each well. - Positive Control:
Ensure it gives expected precipitation lines indicating a valid assay. -
Negative Control: Ensure no precipitation lines to confirm the assay
specificity. iii. Compare the specimen wells to controls to determine
the presence/absence of specific antigens or pathogens.
E. Documentation and Reporting i. Document the results in the
Temperature Monitoring Log, including date, time, specimen ID, and
observed results. ii. Report findings according to site-specific
guidelines. iii. If any results are ambiguous, repeat the assay and/or
consult with a supervisor for further investigation.
1. Quality Control
A. Internal Quality Control i. Perform controls with each assay run to
validate the test. ii. Maintain records of control results and any
corrective actions taken.
B. Equipment Calibration and Maintenance i. Ensure that all
temperature-dependent equipment used in the assay is calibrated
and maintained as per established SOPs. ii. Record calibration data
and perform necessary adjustments or repairs as indicated.
1. Method Limitations
Possible limitations include:
• Specimen contamination.
• Diffusion artifacts due to improper gel preparation.
• Non-specific binding or cross-reactivity in the assay.
