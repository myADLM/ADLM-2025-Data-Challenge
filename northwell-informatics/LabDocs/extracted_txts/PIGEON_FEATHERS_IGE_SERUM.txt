Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Pigeon Feathers IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analysis of pigeon feathers IgE levels in serum samples.
This SOP ensures accuracy, reliability, and quality of the test
results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis, monitoring quality control, and documenting
all relevant information as outlined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory personnel to identify any discrepancies
or issues in the analytical process and report them to their supervisor.
1. DEFINITION Pigeon Feathers IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific
to pigeon feather allergen, measured in serum samples to
assess allergic sensitization.
2. PROCEDURE The following steps outline the procedure for
performing the Pigeon Feathers IgE, serum test:
A) Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
1. Ensure that all reagents and equipment are prepared as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Verify that all reagents are within their expiration date and have
been stored properly.
3. Calibrate the equipment as required and document the
calibration.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that the serum samples have been properly
accessioned and labeled.
2. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum from clot, if not already done.
3. Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled microcentrifuge
tubes or analyte-specific containers.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Load the serum samples, standards, and controls into the
designated wells or sample cups according to the assay kit
instructions.
2. Follow the specific steps outlined in the assay kit package
insert for incubations, washes, and reagent additions.
3. Ensure that all incubation times and temperatures are strictly
adhered to.
4. After the final wash step, add the substrate solution to each well
or sample cup and incubate for the specified time.
5. Measure the optical density (OD) or fluorescence intensity
using an appropriate microplate reader or analyzer.
D) Calculation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve using the OD or fluorescence
values obtained from the standards.
2. Use the standard curve to calculate the concentration of Pigeon
Feathers IgE in each sample.
3. Validate the results by ensuring that the controls fall within the
specified range provided by the assay kit.
E) Quality Control (QC):
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to ensure the accuracy of the assay.
2. Document the results of the controls in the QC log.
3. If the control results are outside the acceptable range, identify
and rectify the issue before proceeding with the sample
analysis.
4. Reporting Results:
5. Review the calculated results for accuracy and consistency.
6. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for verification and validation by the technologist.
7. Include relevant comments or interpretation notes if required.
8. Reference Intervals: Refer to the assay kit insert or the
laboratory’s standard reference ranges for the interpretation of
Pigeon Feathers IgE levels in serum.
9. Method Limitations: Refer to the assay kit insert for any
limitations or potential interferences that may affect the results
of the Pigeon Feathers IgE assay.
10. Corrective Actions:
11. If any part of the procedure fails or if control values fall outside
acceptable ranges, troubleshoot according to the assay kit
instructions and document all corrective actions taken.
12. Notify the supervisor of any persistent issues encountered
during the analysis.
13. Documentation:
14. Complete all required documentation including the temperature
monitoring logs, QC logs, and sample analysis sheets.
15. Ensure that all records are accurate, legible, and stored
according to laboratory policies.
