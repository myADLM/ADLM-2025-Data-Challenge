Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
PIGEON FEATHERS IGG
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and
interpretation of Pigeon Feathers IgG results to ensure accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in the generated data.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in the
analytical methods for determining Pigeon Feathers IgG levels. It
includes reagent preparation, sample processing, assay
performance, data analysis, quality control, and reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the Pigeon
Feathers IgG assay according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and for addressing any issues that arise during the analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm and
630 nm (reference).
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit specific for
Pigeon Feathers IgG.
• Micropipettes and disposable tips.
• Reagents included in the ELISA kit: antigen-coated microplate,
standards, controls, detection antibody, substrate solution, stop
solution, and wash buffer.
• Deionized or distilled water.
• Timer.
• Calibrated laboratory incubator set at 37°C.
• Standard laboratory glassware and consumables (e.g., tubes,
reagent reservoirs).
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Reagent Preparation
• Prepare wash buffer as indicated in the ELISA kit instructions by
diluting the concentrated wash buffer with deionized or distilled
water.
• Reconstitute standards, controls, and detection antibodies as per
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) prior to use.
5.2. Sample Preparation
• Collect and process serum samples as per standard blood
collection protocols.
• Store serum samples at -20°C or below until ready for analysis.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5.3. Assay Performance
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Label the microplate with standards, samples, and controls
as per the provided template.
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to
the designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C to allow antigen-
antibody binding.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
Ensure complete removal of liquid between washes.
4. Detection Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate as described above.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15-20
minutes, or until the blue color is visually detectable.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The color will
change from blue to yellow.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 630 nm using a microplate reader.
5.4. Data Analysis
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their known concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of Pigeon Feathers IgG in the patient
samples by comparing their absorbance values to the standard
curve.
• Calculate and record the results as per the reference ranges
provided in the ELISA kit insert or laboratory guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with
each assay to ensure assay performance.
• QC results must fall within the acceptable range stated in the kit
brochure. If controls are out of range, the run must be repeated.
• Document and review all QC results before reporting patient
results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the calculated Pigeon Feathers IgG concentrations into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and verify all data before issuing patient reports.
• Critical or significantly abnormal results must be communicated to
the requesting physician or healthcare provider as per laboratory
protocols.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples may interfere
with assay results.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other laboratory data.

• Relevant literature on Pigeon Feathers IgG analysis and
interpretation.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all assay runs, including reagent lot numbers,
standard curves, QC data, and sample results.
• Ensure documentation complies with laboratory accreditation and
regulatory requirements.
