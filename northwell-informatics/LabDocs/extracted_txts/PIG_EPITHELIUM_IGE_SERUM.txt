Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Pig Epithelium, IgE,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for pig epithelium-specific IgE in serum samples, ensuring
accurate, timely, and reliable results that contribute to clinical
diagnosis and patient management.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assays, documenting the results, and ensuring all
steps are followed according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing and verifying the results, and assessing any
deviations or issues that may arise during the procedure.
2. DEFINITION
Pig Epithelium, IgE, Serum: This test measures the concentration
of IgE antibodies specific to pig epithelium in a patient's serum,
assisting in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to pig
epithelium.

5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge SST or red-top tubes to obtain serum:
◦ Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully aliquot the serum into labeled microcentrifuge
tubes.
2. Storage:
◦ If not immediately analyzed, store aliquoted serum samples
at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or freeze at -20°C for longer
storage.
B. ELISA Assay Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Dilute wash buffer and substrate solution as per
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for calibrators, controls, and patient samples
in duplicates.
◦ Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and serum samples to
the designated wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature or as
specified by the manufacturer, with gentle agitation.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times with the wash buffer using a
microplate washer or manually.
5. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-labeled anti-IgE conjugate to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature, protected
from light.
6. Second Wash:
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times with the wash buffer.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 15-30 minutes at room temperature,
protected from light.
8. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
The color will change from blue to yellow.
9. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using the plate reader,
with a reference wavelength of 620-650 nm if available.
C. Quality Control
1. Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay performance.
◦ Results for controls must fall within the specified range as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration:
◦ Generate a calibration curve using the absorbance readings
of the calibrators.
◦ Validate the curve for each run of the assay.
D. Data Analysis
1. Calculation of Results:
◦ Derive the concentration of IgE antibodies specific to pig
epithelium in the serum samples using the calibration curve.
◦ Convert absorbance readings to concentration units (kU/L).
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare patient results to reference ranges established by
the laboratory or provided by the assay manufacturer.
◦ Document any abnormal or critical results and follow
established protocols for reporting critical values.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented accurately in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) with any pertinent observations.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
prior to release.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure adequate sample quality and volume for reliable results.
• Avoid hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples as they may interfere
with the assay.
• Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for specific limitations and
interfering substances.
