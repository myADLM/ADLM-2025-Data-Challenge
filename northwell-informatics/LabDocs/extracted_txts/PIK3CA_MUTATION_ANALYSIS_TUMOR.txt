PIK3CA Mutation Analysis, Tumor - Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. Purpose: This procedure outlines the protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for PIK3CA mutation analysis in
tumor specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. Scope: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained
in molecular diagnostics and responsible for conducting
PIK3CA mutation analysis on tumor specimens using validated
methodologies.
3. Definitions:
• PIK3CA: A gene encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in cell
proliferation and survival pathways.
• Mutation Analysis: The process of identifying changes in the
nucleotide sequence of the PIK3CA gene in tumor DNA.
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Accepted Specimen Types:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Fresh frozen tumor tissue.
◦ Cytology specimens processed as cell blocks.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Decomposed tissues.
◦ Specimens with inadequate tumor cellularity (< 10% tumor
content).
◦ Specimens with no accompanying requisition form indicating
the collection date/time.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microtome or cryostat.
• Deparaffinization reagents (e.g., xylene, ethanol).
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen FFPE DNA extraction kit).
• PCR reagents (e.g., primers specific for PIK3CA hot spot
mutations).
• Real-Time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500 Fast).
• Sequencing reagents if applicable.
• Positive and negative control DNA.
• Consumables: Microcentrifuge tubes, pipette tips, gloves, lab
coat, etc.
1. Procedure: A) DNA Extraction:
◦ Deparaffinize FFPE tissue using xylene followed by ethanol
washes.
◦ Digest the tissue with Proteinase K according to the DNA
extraction kit manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Purify the DNA using a column or magnetic bead-based
method.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of the DNA using a
spectrophotometer (A260/A280 ratio).
B) PCR Amplification:
• Design and validate primers specific for hot spot mutations in
exon 9 and exon 20 of PIK3CA.
• Set up PCR reactions using validated reagents and conditions.
Include no-template controls (NTC) and positive control DNA in
every batch.
• Amplify DNA in a thermal cycler following the specific cycling
conditions optimized for PIK3CA.
C) Mutation Detection:
• Real-Time PCR with mutation-specific probes OR
• Direct sequencing (Sanger or NGS) of the PCR products.
• Analyze the data for the presence of mutations in PIK3CA hot
spots, comparing with positive and negative controls.
D) Validation and Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
assay performance.
• Internal quality control with a characterized control sample is
performed with each batch.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if necessary.
1. Reporting Results:
◦ Analyze and interpret data according to standardized criteria
for PIK3CA mutations.
◦ Report the presence or absence of PIK3CA mutations,
specifying the nucleotide change and corresponding amino
acid alteration.
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
◦ Verify results by a second certified molecular scientist
before releasing the report.
2. References:
◦ Refer to the latest peer-reviewed publications and PIK3CA
mutation analysis guidelines.
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for PCR and DNA extraction kits.
◦ Relevant CAP/CLIA guidelines for molecular diagnostic
assays.
Note: Follow laboratory safety protocols and use appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the process.
1. Conclusion: This SOP ensures reliable and accurate results
for PIK3CA mutation analysis in tumor specimens, contributing
to the optimal clinical management of cancer patients.
