Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Analytical Phase for Testing
PINEAPPLE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of testing
for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to Pineapple (PINEAPPLE, IGE,
SERUM) in serum samples. This procedure includes steps for
sample preparation, testing, quality control, and result reporting to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting all steps of the procedure as outlined below.
• All staff members are responsible for identifying any issues or
inconsistencies in the testing process and reporting them to a
supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a type of antibody associated with allergic
responses.
• PINEAPPLE, IGE: Specific IgE antibodies against pineapple
proteins.
• Serum: The liquid portion of blood obtained after clotting and
removing cellular components.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Preparation
1. Specimen Collection:
◦ Serum samples should be collected in SST (Serum
Separator Tubes) or red-top tubes.
◦ After collection, allow blood to clot for 30 minutes to 1 hour
at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500xg for 10 minutes to obtain
serum.
◦ Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled tubes for testing.
2. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if they will be tested within 48
hours.
◦ For long-term storage, store serum samples at -20°C or
lower.
3. Specimen Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Only clear, non-hemolyzed specimens are acceptable.
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric should be
rejected.
B. Reagents and Equipment
1. Equipment:
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerators and freezers
◦ Vortex mixer
2. Reagents:
◦ IgE specific immunoassay kits (PINEAPPLE, IGE reagent
kits)
◦ Quality control materials (low, medium, and high controls)
C. Testing Procedure
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using the calibration reagents
provided in the kit.
◦ Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift
or run. Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges
before running patient samples.
2. Sample Testing:
◦ Prepare the analyzer by loading the prepared serum
samples, calibrators, and controls into the designated
positions.
◦ Follow the immunoassay kit insert for specific instructions
on sample volume, incubation times, and washing steps.
◦ Analyze the samples as per the analyzer’s operational
protocol.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If results deviate significantly from expected values, rerun
quality controls and patient samples.
◦ Document any troubleshooting steps taken and inform the
supervisor if the issue persists.
D. Interpretation and Reporting of Results
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Results are generated by the immunoassay analyzer and
can be printed or directly transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Review results for accuracy and ensure all control values
are within the acceptable range before validating patient
results.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Report results in kU/L (kilo Units per Liter) as per the
manufacturer's reference ranges.
◦ Any critical values should be flagged and reported to the
physician immediately following laboratory protocol.
◦ Results should be reviewed and verified by a technologist
before releasing them to the LIS.
E. Quality Control and Assurance
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests,
and document the results.
◦ If controls do not fall within the specified range, do not report
patient results until the issue is resolved.
2. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs specific
to IgE measurements to ensure accuracy and consistency
of results.
◦ Compare and evaluate proficiency test results with other
participating laboratories.
F. Documentation and Record-Keeping
1. All steps of testing, including sample receipt, preparation,
calibration, quality control results, and patient results, should be
documented in the laboratory log.
2. Maintain records in accordance with laboratory policies and
CLIA requirements.

Director.
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever significant
changes occur in test methods or equipment.
