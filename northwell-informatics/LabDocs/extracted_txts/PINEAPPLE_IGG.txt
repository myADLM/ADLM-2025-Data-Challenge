Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Pineapple IgG Results
1. Purpose: To describe the procedures followed for the analytical
phase of generating results for Pineapple IgG, including the
preparation, calibration, analysis, and documentation to ensure
accurate and precise outcomes.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
the analysis of Pineapple IgG in patient specimens.
3. Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to adhere to this SOP
and ensure accurate testing and documentation.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure staff compliance
with this SOP and to address any issues that arise during the
analysis.
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable specimens include serum or plasma samples.
• The required minimum volume of serum or plasma is 300µL.
• Store specimens at 2-8ºC if testing will be conducted within 72
hours. For storage beyond 72 hours, freeze specimens at -20ºC
or lower.
1. Reagents and Equipment:
• Pineapple IgG assay kit (Ensure that all reagents are stored and
used according to manufacturer guidelines).
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450nm.
• Calibrators, controls, and samples.
• Deionized water for reagent preparation.
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel) and tips.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Plate washer or manual washing equipment.
1. Procedure:
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25ºC)
before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer and other reagents as outlined in the
assay kit inserts.
3. Label all microplates, tubes, and controls as necessary.
B. Calibration:
1. Run appropriate calibrators provided with the assay kit to
generate a standard curve.
2. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
3. Prepare dilutions of the calibrators as instructed in the assay kit
insert.
4. Add appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples to wells following the specific protocol noted in the kit's
package insert.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette 100µL of standards, controls, and diluted specimens
into appropriate wells.
2. Add conjugate reagent to each well (amount as specified in the
kit).
3. Incubate the plate at 37ºC for the specified period (usually
30-60 minutes).
4. Wash the plate 5 times with the prepared wash buffer.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
for 15-20 minutes.
6. Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
7. Read the absorbance at 450nm using the microplate reader.
D. Quality Control:
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each assay run.
2. Verify that the optical density (OD) values of the standards fall
within the expected range provided.
3. If controls are out of specified ranges, the run must be
repeated, and any issues must be documented and addressed.
E. Documentation:
1. Record all specimen identifiers, calibrator results, control
results, and specific absorbance values in a designated
logbook or software.
2. Compute the concentration of Pineapple IgG in patient
specimens using the standard curve plotted from the
calibrators' ODs.
3. Append any corrective actions taken if controls are outside the
defined limits.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Results will be reported in IU/mL.
2. Normal reference range for Pineapple IgG is <20 IU/mL. Values
20-29 IU/mL are considered borderline. Values ≥30 IU/mL are
considered positive for Pineapple IgG.
3. All results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Maintenance:
5. Regularly maintain and calibrate the microplate reader.
6. Document all maintenance and calibration activities.
7. Ensure timely replacement of reagents according to the
manufacturer's expiry dates.
8. Troubleshooting:
9. In case of any technical issues or inquiries about the procedure,
refer to the troubleshooting guide provided in the assay kit
insert.
10. If the issue persists, contact the instrument manufacturer or
technical support for assistance.
11. References:
• Pineapple IgG Assay Kit Package Insert.
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for instrument operation and
maintenance.
1. Review and Revision History: This protocol is reviewed annually
or as needed when new information, methods, or technology
are introduced.

This SOP is intended to ensure the delivery of consistent, accurate,
and timely results for Pineapple IgG determinations, maintaining high
standards of laboratory practice.
