STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Pine Nut, IgE, Serum Assay
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for conducting the Pine Nut, IgE,
Serum assay to ensure consistency, reliability, and accuracy in
generating patient results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, recording observations, and reporting results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• A minimum of 1 mL of serum separated from a properly collected
blood specimen.
Specimen Storage:
• Specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Specimens that have been improperly labeled or transported.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Anti-human Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, specific to Pine
Nut
• Pine Nut allergen-coated wells/assay plates
• Calibrators and controls (negative and positive)
• Assay buffer
• Enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Wash solution
• Microplate reader
5. EQUIPMENT
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at
appropriate wavelengths
• Micropipettes (adjustable volume)
• Multichannel pipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (37°C)
• Calibrated refrigerator and freezer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Initial Checks:
1. Allow all reagents and serum specimens to come to room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Vortex the serum specimens briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Label the assay plate(s) with the appropriate identifiers for
controls, standards, and specimens.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Addition of Samples and Controls:
◦ Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and patient specimen
into the assigned wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour with
gentle shaking.
2. Washing:
◦ Aspirate the well contents and wash each well 5 times with
300 µL of the wash buffer. Ensure complete removal of
liquid from the wells after each wash by tapping the plate on
absorbent paper.
3. Addition of Detection Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody
to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes while
gently shaking.
4. Second Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength (typically 450 nm with reference wavelength at
620 nm) using a microplate reader within 5 minutes.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include negative and positive controls in each assay run.
2. Verify that the controls are within the predefined quality control
ranges.
3. Calibrate the microplate reader regularly and check for the
maintenance logs to ensure accurate readings.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the results according to the assay’s instructions and
the calibration curve generated from standards.
2. Results are reported in kU/L based on the specific assay and
detection system.
3. Reportable units:
◦ <0.35 kU/L: None detected
◦ 0.35 – 0.70 kU/L: Low
◦ 0.71 – 3.50 kU/L: Moderate
◦ 3.51 – 17.50 kU/L: High
◦ 17.51 – 50.00 kU/L: Very High
◦ 50.00 kU/L: Extreme
4. Document the results as described in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
5. Verify and review results by a qualified technologist before
releasing.
9. REFERENCES
Ensure that all users of this SOP refer to the manufacturer's specific
instructions and guidelines provided with the assay kit for detailed
information.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
In the event of any deviations or performance issues noted during the
procedure, report and document the incident following the
established laboratory protocol. Appropriate corrective actions and
troubleshooting steps should be taken as needed:
1. Activity below detectable limit: Check for errors in pipetting
or the preparation of reagents.
2. Uniform high or low background: Ensure the wash solution is
free from contamination and the wells are appropriately
washed.
3. Failed quality control: Review reagent and specimen expiry
dates; ensure all steps conform to the prescribed procedure.
By following these steps, the assay process will ensure high-quality,
reliable results for Pine Nut, IgE testing. Ensure all procedure steps
and deviations are documented appropriately.
