Standard Operating Procedure for PINE PONDEROSA IgE
Testing
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
Pine Ponderosa IgE testing in order to ensure accurate and
reliable results for clinical interpretation.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum specimen collected in a gold-top (SST) or red-top tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
• Specimens from patients who have received radioactive isotopes
within 48 hours of the specimen collection.
• Specimens in tubes other than SST or red-top are not acceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer
• Pine Ponderosa IgE reagent kit (including calibrators and
controls)
• Quality control materials (negative and positive)
• Calibration standard for IgE measurement
• 37°C incubation water bath or heater
• Micropipettes and appropriate tips
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other appropriate personal
protective equipment
• Absorbent bench pad for spills
• Biohazard waste containers
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
• Daily start-up: Turn on the Immunoassay Analyzer and perform
system checks as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Reagent Preparation: Prepare Pine Ponderosa IgE reagents as
per the kit insert instructions at room temperature.
• Ensure that all quality control materials, calibrators, and patient
samples are at room temperature before analysis.
• Inspect all reagents and controls, ensuring no signs of
contamination or expiration.
B. Calibration
• Perform a full calibration sequence with the provided calibration
standards.
• Document the calibration results and verify that all calibration
values fall within the acceptable ranges as per the manufacturer’s
kit insert.
C. Quality Control
• Analyze control specimens (negative and positive) at the start of
the run, after every 20th sample, and at the end of the run.
• Document the quality control results and verify that the values fall
within the established ranges. If control results are outside the
acceptable limits, troubleshoot and resolve the issues before
proceeding with patient samples.
D. Testing
• Label specimen identification conveniently.
• Use micropipettes to dispense the appropriate volume of the
patient serum, calibrators, and control samples into the labeled
test wells or analyzer sample cups.
• Load samples into the analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Initiate the analysis run on the Immunoassay Analyzer ensuring
proper adherence to the programmed assay protocol.
E. Troubleshooting and Re-run protocols
• In case of flagged results or analyzer errors, review
troubleshooting guidelines specific to the analyzer.
• Repeat the test if necessary, using the same specimen, ensuring
correct sample preparation and loading.
F. Review of Results
• Upon completion of the run, visually inspect the output to ensure
clarity and absence of errors.
• Review results ensuring all quality control measures have passed.
• Validate the results, correcting any discrepancies noted in the
analysis. Ensure critical values or unexpected trends are
reviewed according to clinical significance.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and report results using the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and transfer the data accurately to the patient's electronic
medical record.
• Refer to the established reference intervals for interpreting Pine
Ponderosa IgE levels:
◦ Negative: < 0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.35 - 0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: > 0.70 kU/L
Critical results or significantly high IgE levels should be
communicated immediately to the treating physician and documented
accordingly.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MONITORING
• Ensure all analyzers undergo regular maintenance and servicing
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Participate in external quality assessments and proficiency testing
as required.
• Routine review of assay performance, trends, and deviations
should be undertaken periodically.
• Document and address all corrective and preventive actions in the
event of quality control failure.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious materials
using proper PPE.
• Follow established waste disposal protocols for biohazardous
materials.
• Ensure all steps are carried out within biosafety guidelines to
maintain a sterile and clean working environment.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the Pine Ponderosa IgE reagent kit insert for detailed
limitations and interferences that can affect assay performance.

1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain documentation of all calibration, QC, and specimen test
logs.
• Ensure accurate and complete records are stored for future
reference and review.
By adhering to this SOP, we aim to ensure precision and consistency
in the Pine Ponderosa IgE testing process, maintaining high
standards of laboratory practice and patient care.
