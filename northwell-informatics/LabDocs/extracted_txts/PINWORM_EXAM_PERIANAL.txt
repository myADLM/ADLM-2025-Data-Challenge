Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
PINWORM EXAM – PERIANAL
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection and identification
of pinworm eggs using a perianal swab or cellulose tape sample,
ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the assigned medical laboratory scientists or
technicians to perform the pinworm examination according to this
SOP. Supervisors must ensure that personnel are trained and
competent in these procedures.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Clear cellulose tape preparation or perianal
swab.
• Collection time: Recommended early in the morning before
bathing or using the toilet.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope (compound)
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Disposable gloves
• Clear cellulose tape or perianal swabs
• Wooden applicator sticks or tongue depressors (if using tape
method)
• Immersion oil (if applicable)
• Plastic bags or containers (for specimen transport)
• Labeling materials
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Collection (for reference):
• Use a clear adhesive tape or perianal swab to sample the
perianal area early in the morning.
◦ Tape Method:
1. Take a clear adhesive tape (approximately 2 inches
long).
2. Press the sticky side of the tape firmly against the
perianal skin folds.
3. Press the tape, sticky side down, onto a clean glass
slide.
4. Label the slide with patient's information.
◦ Swab Method:
1. Use a sterile perianal swab.
2. Rub the swab on the perianal area in a rolling motion.
3. Place the swab in a sterile, labeled transport tube.
B. Examination:
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear disposable gloves and personal protective equipment
(PPE).
◦ Prepare the microscope by ensuring it is clean and properly
functioning.
2. Microscopy (Tape Method):
◦ Place the slide with the tape on the microscope stage.
◦ Start with low magnification (10x objective) to locate the
presence of pinworm eggs.
◦ Increase magnification (40x objective) for detailed
examination.
◦ If necessary, use immersion oil for high magnification (100x
objective).
3. Microscopy (Swab Method):
◦ Roll the swab onto a glass slide.
◦ Place a coverslip on the sample.
◦ Examine under the microscope with the same
magnifications as above.
C. Identification:
• Identify the characteristic pinworm eggs, which are usually oval,
asymmetrical, and contain a developing larva.
• Note any additional findings.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a known positive control (slide with pinworm eggs) to
verify microscope functionality and examiner proficiency.
• Conduct periodic calibration and maintenance of the microscope.
• Record all QC results and corrective actions if controls fall out of
the acceptable range.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Record the findings on the laboratory worksheet or laboratory
information system (LIS).
• If pinworm eggs are detected, report as "Pinworm ova detected."
• If no pinworm eggs are found, report as "No pinworm ova
detected."
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur if the collection method is not
performed correctly or if the timing of the sample collection is not
optimal.
• Excessive adhesive tape can obscure visibility under the
microscope.
• Specimens collected after bathing or using the toilet may yield
false negatives.
