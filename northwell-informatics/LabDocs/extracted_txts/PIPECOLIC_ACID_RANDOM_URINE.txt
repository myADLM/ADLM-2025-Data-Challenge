SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
PIPECOLIC ACID, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This standard operating procedure (SOP) is designed to outline the
protocol for the analyzed measurement and generation of results for
pipecolic acid in a random urine specimen. The purpose is to ensure
reliable, accurate, and consistent results for clinical diagnosis and
patient care management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP for the analysis of pipecolic acid in random urine samples. It is
their duty to ensure the maintenance of equipment, accurate
documentation, and meeting quality control requirements.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Random urine specimen
• Volume Required: Minimum of 10 mL
• Storage: Store at -20°C if not analyzed immediately
• Specimen Handling: Ensure the urine sample is well-mixed
before aliquoting for the assay
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ HPLC coupled with mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Auto sampler vials
• Reagents:
◦ Pipecolic acid calibration standards
◦ Internal standard solution
◦ Mobile phase reagents (e.g., buffer solutions, acetonitrile)
◦ Extraction solvents
• Supplies:
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge tubes (50mL)
◦ Sample vials
◦ Syringe filters
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration:
• Prepare the calibration curves using pipecolic acid standards
covering the expected range of concentrations in clinical
specimens.
• Prepare quality control (QC) samples at different concentration
levels (low, medium, high).
• Fortify all calibrators and QCs with the internal standard.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the urine specimen at 3000 g for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube.
3. Dilute 1 mL of the supernatant with 4 mL of extraction solvent.
4. Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 g for another 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the clear supernatant to an auto sampler vial via
syringe filter.
C. Instrument Setup:
• Set up the HPLC-MS/MS machine according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Initialize the mobile phase (appropriate buffer and organic
solvent).
• Calibrate the instrument using the external pipecolic acid
calibration standards.
• Verify the system performance by running QC samples.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Load the prepared urine samples, calibration standards, and
QC samples into the auto sampler.
2. Initiate the run sequence in the HPLC-MS/MS to inject and
analyze the samples.
3. Monitor the chromatographic peaks and mass spectra to
ensure proper separation and identification of pipecolic acid.
E. Data Processing:
• Use appropriate data analysis software to evaluate the
chromatographic data.
• Quantify pipecolic acid concentration in urine samples using the
calibration curve.
• Integrate peak areas relative to the internal standard to ensure
accuracy.
6. RESULT REPORTING:
• Results should be reported in μmol/L.
• Verify and review the generated results for each urine specimen.
• Any samples failing to meet quality control criteria must be
reanalyzed.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) checks with each batch of samples
to ensure reliable assay performance.
• Record and monitor QC results, ensuring that QC results are
within the accepted range.
• Use commercially available or prepared internal standards for
validation.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for pipecolic acid concentration in urine will be
defined based on literature and clinical validation studies.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that matrix effects are minimized by using appropriate
sample preparation methods.
• Cross-reactivity with other urine constituents should be evaluated
and reviewed during method validation.
