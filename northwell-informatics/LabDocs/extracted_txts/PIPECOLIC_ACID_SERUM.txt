Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Pipecolic Acid, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of pipecolic acid in serum samples, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and traceability of results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all trained laboratory personnel performing
pipecolic acid analysis on serum specimens within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained technical staff to perform the analysis
of pipecolic acid in patient serum samples according to this SOP. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed and for verifying and validating all results generated.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Container: Red-top tube (without gel) or
serum separator tube (SST)
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL serum
• Processing Requirements:
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 x g.
◦ Aliquot serum into a clean, appropriately labeled tube.
◦ Store serum samples at -20°C or lower until analysis.
◦ Specimens are stable for up to 30 days when frozen.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES

• Mobile phase reagents
• Sample preparation reagents (e.g., acids, bases, derivatization
reagents)
• Clean glass or plastic test tubes
• Labeled storage containers
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards of pipecolic acid in the serum
matrix, typically at concentrations ranging from 0.1 µM to 10
µM.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations using commercial or internally validated
materials.
3. Run a full calibration curve and QC samples at the start of each
analytical batch to ensure instrument performance.
6.2. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex each sample to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 100 µL of the serum into a clean test tube.
4. Add 100 µL of internal standard solution to each sample.
5. Add 100 µL of derivatization reagent (if using a derivatization
method) and vortex to mix.
6. Incubate the samples according to the derivatization protocol
(usually at a specified temperature and time).
7. Add 500 µL of extraction solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) and vortex
vigorously.
8. Centrifuge the samples at 15000 x g for 10 minutes to
precipitate proteins.
9. Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
6.3. Instrumental Analysis
1. Set up and equilibrate the HPLC system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Inject calibration standards, QC samples, and prepared serum
extracts into the HPLC system.
3. Analyze samples using the specified gradient or isocratic
method.
4. Record chromatograms and peak area data.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
1. Evaluate calibration curves and ensure they meet acceptable
linearity and sensitivity criteria.
2. Assess QC sample results against established acceptable
ranges.
3. Calculate pipecolic acid concentrations in serum samples using
standard calibration curves.
4. Review sample data for any anomalies or deviations from
expected results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify results per laboratory verification protocols.
3. Review flagged results (e.g., critical values) and follow up with
appropriate actions such as repeat testing or confirmation.
4. Communicate abnormal results to the requesting clinician
immediately, following the laboratory's policy for critical results
reporting.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Perform internal QC analysis with each batch of samples.
2. Participate in external proficiency testing programs if available.
3. Document all QC results, maintenance logs, and any
troubleshooting performed.
4. Review and update the SOP annually or as required based on
changes in technology or regulations.
