Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
PISTACHIO IgE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, step-by-step procedure for the analysis of
Pistachio IgE levels in serum specimens. This ensures consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for clinical diagnostics.
2. DEFINITION
Pistachio IgE testing involves quantifying the specific IgE antibodies
in the serum that are associated with allergic reactions to pistachios.
This procedure applies to serum specimens collected and prepared
for analysis in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis and ensuring compliance with this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to review the results and
ensure that the procedures are followed accurately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or a plain red-top
tube.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
the serum from the clot.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, appropriately labeled aliquot
tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Keep the serum specimen refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyze
within 7 days.
• For long-term storage, freeze the serum specimen at -20°C or
colder.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Pistachio IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to Pistachio IgE
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units
• Logbooks and documentation tools
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Verify that the immunoassay analyzer is correctly calibrated and
maintained as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Ensure that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at the
required temperature and are not expired.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Thaw all frozen serum aliquots at room temperature.
3. Program the analyzer with the required assay settings for
Pistachio IgE.
C) Sample and Reagent Handling:
1. Label all sample tubes and racks with appropriate identification.
2. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
3. Load the relevant Pistachio IgE reagent cartridge into the
analyzer.
D) Running the Assay:
1. Initiate the assay run on the analyzer, ensuring that it follows
the predefined protocol for Pistachio IgE.
2. Check the analyzer during the run for any alerts or error
messages, taking corrective action if necessary.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high controls) at
the beginning of each assay to ensure the analyzer’s accuracy.
2. Document all quality control results in accordance with
laboratory protocols.
F) Result Documentation and Reporting:
1. Once the assay is complete, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
2. Validate the results by comparing them with the quality control
outcomes.
3. Enter the patient and quality control results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS), noting any deviations or anomalies.
4. All critical and out-of-range results should be promptly reviewed
by a supervisor and communicated to the requesting physician.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• IgE: specific to pistachios, reference ranges should be provided
by the manufacturer of the assay kits used.
A qualitative interpretation of the results must be given according to
the clinical significance of the measured IgE levels, ranging from
'undetectable' to 'highly elevated.'
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Routine quality control processes must be maintained, including:
• Daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance and calibration of
equipment.
• Regular review of control and standard curves as recommended
by the assay manufacturer.
• Adherence to the internal and external quality control measures.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
Failed Quality Controls:
If quality controls fall outside of acceptable limits, re-run the controls.
If they continue to fail:
1. Inspect and troubleshoot the analyzer as per the
troubleshooting guide.
2. Use fresh reagents and controls if necessary.
3. Notify the supervisor and refrain from running patient samples
until all issues are resolved.
10. REFERENCES AND REVIEW
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the immunoassay analyzer.
• Reagent kit package inserts and relevant literature.
This SOP is subject to regular review and updating in response to
technological advancements, regulatory changes, or laboratory
process improvements.
