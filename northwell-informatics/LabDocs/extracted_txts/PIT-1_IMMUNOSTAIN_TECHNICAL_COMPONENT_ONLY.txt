Standard Operating Procedure PIT-1 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps involved in the
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of PIT-1 (Pituitary-specific
transcription factor 1) on tissue sections. This procedure is for the
technical component only and aims to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
Section Thickness: 4-5 micrometers.
Slide Preparation: Tissue sections should be mounted on positively
charged glass slides.

1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Slide Preparation
1. Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 4-5 µm sections using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and pick them up
onto positively charged slides.
3. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour or at room temperature
overnight.
4.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections in xylene or xylene substitutes for
2 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanol (100%, 95%, and
70%) for 2 x 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
4.3. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a Coplin jar containing antigen retrieval solution.
2. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a
microwave, pressure cooker, or steamer for an appropriate
duration (typically 10-20 minutes).
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
4.4. Blocking Procedures
1. Incubate slides in endogenous peroxidase blocker (3%
hydrogen peroxide) for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
3. Incubate slides in protein block solution for 15 minutes.
4. Drain off the blocking solution but do not rinse.
4.5. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply primary antibody (anti-PIT-1) to the tissue sections and
incubate in a humidity chamber for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 3 x 5 minutes.
4.6. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody or HRP
polymer to the sections and incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 3 x 5 minutes.
4.7. Detection and Visualization
1. Apply Streptavidin-HRP or HRP polymer to the sections and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 3 x 5 minutes.
3. Apply chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) and incubate until
desired color intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
4.8. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, and
100%) for 1 minute each.
4. Clear in xylene or xylene substitutes for 2 x 5 minutes.
5. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Include appropriate positive and negative controls with each run to
ensure the reliability of the staining.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review slides under a microscope to verify staining quality and
specificity. Document observations according to laboratory protocols.
Technicians should not interpret clinical results.
