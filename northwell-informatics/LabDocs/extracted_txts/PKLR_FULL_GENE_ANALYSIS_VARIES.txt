Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PKLR Full Gene
Analysis
1. Purpose: This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for PKLR Full Gene Analysis. The
purpose is to ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent results
following standardized laboratory techniques.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to all laboratory staff conducting PKLR
Full Gene Analysis and includes details on equipment, reagents,
sample preparation, PCR setup, sequencing, and data interpretation.
3. Responsibilities: Designated lab personnel are responsible for
following this protocol. Supervisors ensure all personnel are trained
and compliant.
4. Definitions:
• PKLR: Pyruvate Kinase Liver and Red Blood Cell
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
• QC: Quality Control
• LIS: Laboratory Information System
5. Equipment and Reagents:
• Thermocycler
• PCR reagents (buffers, dNTPs, Taq polymerase)
• Forward and reverse primers specific to PKLR gene
• DNA extraction kits
• Sequencing reagents
• Agarose gel electrophoresis setup
• UV transilluminator
• Capillary electrophoresis or sequencing platform
• Quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
6. Sample Preparation:
• Extract genomic DNA from the patient's blood sample using
designated DNA extraction kits.
• Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and dilute
to the required concentration.
7. PCR Setup and Amplification:
• Prepare the PCR reaction mix as follows:
◦ 1X PCR buffer
◦ 200 µM dNTPs
◦ 0.2 µM of each primer
◦ 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase
◦ 50-100 ng of genomic DNA template
◦ Nuclease-free water to make up the final volume
• Follow PCR cycling conditions specific for PKLR gene:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 30-35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: Specific to primer Tm (e.g., 55-60°C) for 30
seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
• Confirm PCR product size using agarose gel electrophoresis.
8. Sequencing:
• Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
• Set up sequencing reactions using the purified PCR product and
appropriate sequencing primers (forward and reverse).
• Perform cycle sequencing following the thermal profile specific for
the sequencing chemistry being used.
• Purify the sequencing products using a commercial kit.
• Load the purified sequence reactions onto the sequencing
platform and run the sequence.
9. Data Interpretation:
• Analyze sequencing data using the appropriate software.
• Compare obtained sequences with the reference PKLR gene
sequence.
• Identify mutations, insertions, deletions, or duplications.
10. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls to validate the PCR and
sequencing processes.
• Monitor all equipment and reagents for performance and
expiration.
• Repeat analysis if QC parameters fall outside acceptable ranges.
11. Reporting Results:
• Verify and validate the results via the LIS.
• Document and review all results, including any deviations from
expected results.
• Report results to the clinician or requesting party, ensuring all
required sections of the report are completed and signed off by a
qualified individual.
12. Documentation and Records:
• Maintain all records of samples, reagents, equipment logs, and
QC checks.
• Store sequencing data and related documentation according to
laboratory retention policies.
13. References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for all DNA extraction, PCR, and
sequencing kits.
• PKLR gene reference sequence databases.
14. Review and Training:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed.
• All lab personnel conducting PKLR Full Gene Analysis will be
trained on this SOP and records of training will be maintained.
15. Appendices:
• Primer sequences and PCR conditions specific to PKLR gene
regions.
• Troubleshooting guide for common PCR and sequencing issues.
