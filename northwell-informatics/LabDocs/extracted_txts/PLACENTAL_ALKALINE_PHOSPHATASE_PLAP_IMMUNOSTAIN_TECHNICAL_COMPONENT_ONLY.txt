Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Results for
Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (PLAP) Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the technical preparation
and analysis of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP)
immunostaining in tissue samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists trained in immunohistochemistry
are responsible for performing and documenting the PLAP
immunostaining procedure, as well as ensuring quality control and
correct operation of all involved instruments and reagents.
2. SPECIMEN
a. Acceptable Specimens:
- Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
- Properly labeled and accompanied by the relevant requisition form.
b. Unacceptable Specimens:
- Unlabeled or mislabeled specimens.
- Specimens not adequately fixed in formalin.
- Samples that do not match the provided requisition form.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
a. Reagents:
- Primary Anti-PLAP antibody.
- Secondary antibody (Biotinylated or conjugated as per protocol).
- DAB (3,3' Diaminobenzidine) substrate.
- Counterstain (e.g. Hematoxylin).
b. Supplies:
- Microtome and water bath.
- Adhesive microscope slides.
- Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup.
- Coverslips and mounting media.
- Positive control tissue slides.
4. PROCEDURE
a. Sectioning and Preparation:
1. Cut 3-4 micron thick sections from FFPE blocks using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a warm water bath and pick up on adhesive microscope slides.
3. Dry slides at 60°C overnight or at 37°C for 2-3 hours to ensure proper adhesion of tissue.
b. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene (2 changes, 5 min each).
2. Rehydrate through decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) to distilled water.
c. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) as appropriate.
2. Heat slides in retrieval solution using a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath.
3. Cool slides to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
d. Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS).
3. Apply blocking serum to minimize non-specific binding (10 minutes).
4. Incubate slides with primary Anti-PLAP antibody (dilution specified in antibody datasheet) for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash slides in PBS/TBS.
6. Apply appropriate secondary antibody (e.g., biotinylated secondary antibody or HRP-conjugated secondary antibody) and incubate for 30 minutes.
7. Wash slides in PBS/TBS.
8. Apply DAB substrate to slides, monitor the color development under microscope (usually 2-10 minutes).
9. Stop the reaction by rinsing in distilled water.
e. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-3 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in water to remove excess stain.
3. Dehydrate through distilled water, and graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%).
4. Clear in xylene (2 changes, 5 min each).
5. Mount with coverslip and mounting media.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Positive and Negative Controls:
- Each run should include known positive control slides to verify correct staining, and negative control slides (omitting primary antibody) to assess background staining.
b. Documentation:
- Record the batch number and expiry date of all reagents used.
- Document any deviations from the protocol and any issues encountered during the staining process.
c. Verification:
- Upon completion, all slides should be reviewed by a qualified pathologist to verify staining quality and specificity.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
- Technical component results will be documented in the laboratory information system (LIS) and released to appropriate medical personnel.
- A stained slide should exhibit brown color in the presence of PLAP while maintaining clear cytoplasmic localization.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
- If the positive control does not stain appropriately, repeat the staining procedure.
- High background staining on the negative control should prompt a review of blocking steps and antibody dilutions.
