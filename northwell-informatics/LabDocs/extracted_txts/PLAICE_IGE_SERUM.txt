Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Quantitative Measurement of
PLAICE, IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standardized procedures for the quantitative
analysis of PLAICE (Pan-Latex Antigen Instigated Chemotactic
Effector) and Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. These
procedures ensure that all steps are followed correctly to generate
accurate and reproducible results for clinical use in patient care and
diagnosis.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform PLAICE and IgE serum analysis using immunoassay
techniques within the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical tests as per the SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the staff are
adequately trained and that quality control and assurance
measures are in place and adhered to.
• All personnel must bring any deviations from the SOP or
unexpected results to the attention of a supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
• PLAICE: Pan-Latex Antigen Instigated Chemotactic Effector, a
marker used to track specific immunoreactions.
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
responses.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA, CLIA)
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microplates
• Reagents and standards specific for PLAICE and IgE assays
• Deionized water
• Controls (high, medium, low)
• Calibrators
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in serum separator tubes
(SST).
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 24 hours at room
temperature and up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-term storage,
samples should be aliquoted and frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. PROCEDURAL STEPS
7.1 Pre-Analytical Phase
a. Verify specimen integrity; reject samples with visible hemolysis or
lipemia. b. Allow serum separator tubes to clot for 30 minutes and
then centrifuge at 1500g for 10 minutes. c. Transfer the clear
supernatant serum into labeled aliquot tubes for analysis.
7.2 Analytical Phase
a. Calibration and Preparation
• Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform calibration using provided calibrators and ensure results
fall within the specified range.
b. Sample Preparation
• Thaw frozen serum samples and bring all reagents and samples
to room temperature.
• Mix samples gently to ensure homogeneity without causing foam
or bubbles.
c. Assay Protocol for PLAICE
• Pipette specified volumes of samples, controls, and standards
into the wells of the microplate.
• Add the appropriate reagent to each well; incubate based on
manufacturer recommendations (usually 1 hour at 37°C).
• Wash the plate to remove unbound reagents.
• Add substrate solution and incubate (typically 10-15 minutes).
• Add stop solution to halt the reaction and read the absorbance at
the specified wavelength using a microplate reader.
d. Assay Protocol for IgE
• Repeat similar steps as PLAICE for sample loading.
• Follow specific incubation times and reagent additions as per
validated IgE assay kits.
• Perform washing steps meticulously to prevent cross-
contamination.
• Add substrate and stop solutions sequentially and measure
optical density (OD) at the required wavelength.
e. Quality Control
• Include quality control samples in each run (high, medium, low).
• If QC results fall outside of the acceptable range, investigate and
repeat the assay if necessary.
7.3 Post-Analytical Phase
a. Result Calculation and Verification
• Compare absorbance values of samples against the calibration
curve to determine PLAICE and IgE concentrations.
• Ensure automated calculations are consistent with raw data.
b. Result Reporting
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
following laboratory standards.
• Verify results are within reference ranges and/or clinical context.
• Flag any abnormal/critical results and promptly inform the relevant
healthcare provider.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Perform internal quality control regularly and document any
inconsistencies or deviations.
• Validate instruments semi-annually or when specified by the
manufacturer.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs to benchmark
against other laboratories.
1. SAFETY AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Adhere to all laboratory safety procedures, including the use of
personal protective equipment.
• For troubleshooting, consult the instrument’s user manual or seek
technical support if the assay fails to meet performance criteria.
1. PROCEDURE REVIEW AND UPDATES
• The SOP will be reviewed and revised as needed, at least
annually, or in response to changes in analytical methods or
instrumentation.
