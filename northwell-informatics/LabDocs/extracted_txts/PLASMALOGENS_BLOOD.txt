Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
Plasmalogens in Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of plasmalogens in blood
samples using the appropriate analytical methodologies and
instrumentation, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the determination of plasmalogens in blood
samples received and accessioned in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Lab Technicians: Responsible for performing the assay as
outlined in this protocol.
• Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol, verifying results, and addressing any issues or
anomalies that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes or
heparinized (green top) tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Whole blood specimens should preferably be analyzed within 24
hours of collection if stored at 2-8°C.
• Plasma samples separated from whole blood should be analyzed
within 48 hours if stored at 2-8°C or can be stored at -20°C for up
to one month for batch analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in incorrect tubes (e.g., citrate or fluoride/
oxalate).
• Hemolyzed or clotted samples.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents:
◦ Internal standards for plasmalogen quantification.
◦ Solvents for extraction (e.g., methanol, chloroform).
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Automated or manual pipettes with appropriate tips.
◦ Mass Spectrometer or High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) system.
• Supplies:
◦ Glass or plastic tubes for sample preparation.
◦ Assay-specific consumables (e.g., bottles, vials).
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Plasma Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the whole blood at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
◦ Carefully transfer the plasma layer to a new clean tube
without disturbing the buffy coat.
2. Lipid Extraction:
◦ Add internal standard to the plasma sample.
◦ Add methanol and chloroform to the plasma sample in a 2:1
solvent-to-plasma ratio.
◦ Vortex mix the sample for 2 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 2000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature.
3. Phase Separation:
◦ Carefully collect the lower (organic) phase using a pipette
and transfer it to a clean vial.
◦ Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen gas or in a
vacuum concentrator.
B) Plasmalogen Analysis:
1. Preparation for Analysis:
◦ Reconstitute the dried lipid extract in an appropriate solvent
(e.g., isopropanol).
◦ Vortex mix and briefly centrifuge to remove any particulates.
2. LC-MS/MS or HPLC Analysis:
◦ Inject the sample into the LC-MS/MS or HPLC system
according to standard operating conditions established for
plasmalogen analysis.
◦ Ensure calibration with appropriate standard curves and
quality control samples.
3. Data Acquisition and Processing:
◦ Acquire data using instrument-specific software.
◦ Process the chromatograms to identify and quantify the
peaks corresponding to plasmalogens.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with known concentrations of
plasmalogens alongside patient samples.
• Include blanks to check for contamination.
• Analyze the results of control samples to validate the run.
• Record all quality control data in the laboratory logbook.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Review the chromatograms and ensure peak identification is
accurate.
• Calculate the concentration of plasmalogens in each sample
using the internal standard and the calibration curve.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified supervisor
before reporting.
9. REPORTING
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report results in the specified units (e.g., µmol/L).
• Review and verify the results before releasing the final report to
the healthcare provider.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control fails, re-run the controls. If the issue persists,
evaluate the reagents, standards, and instrument performance.
• If unexpected results are obtained, check for sample handling
errors and ensure all procedures were followed correctly.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The sensitivity and specificity of the assay are subject to the
quality of reagents and instrument calibration.
• Limitations are detailed in the instrument and reagent manuals.
12. REFERENCES
• Relevant instrument and reagent manuals.
• Internal and external quality assurance guidelines.
This protocol ensures the accurate and reliable determination of
plasmalogen levels in blood samples, adhering to standard laboratory
practices and guidelines.
