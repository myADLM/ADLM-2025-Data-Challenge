SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Plasmalogens
from Blood Spot Specimens
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis and generation of
results for plasmalogens from blood spot specimens.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing plasmalogen
testing on blood spot samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure the accurate and timely analysis of plasmalogens from blood
spot specimens. Supervisors are responsible for verifying that
personnel are properly trained and that testing is performed
according to this SOP.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS)
• Centrifuge equipped with a microplate rotor
• Micropipettes and pipette tips (10 μL, 100 μL, 1000 μL)
• Extraction plate (96-well)
• Plate sealer film
• Reagents: Methanol, chloroform, water, internal standard (e.g.,
deuterated plasmalogen), quality control material
• Blood spot collection cards
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Blood Spot Specimens
• Ensure that the blood spot collection cards are properly labeled
with patient identification.
• Allow blood spots to dry thoroughly at room temperature for at
least 3 hours before processing.
• Sample punch diameter should be 3.2 mm (approx. 3.14 mm²).
B. Extraction of Plasmalogens
1. Punch a 3.2 mm diameter disc from the dried blood spot (DBS)
and place it into a well of an extraction plate.
2. Add 100 μL of methanol to each well containing a blood spot
disc.
3. Add 10 μL of internal standard to each well.
4. Seal the plate with plate sealer film and vortex at 1200 rpm for
5 minutes.
5. Centrifuge the plate at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a new extraction plate, ensuring no
blood spot material is transferred.
C. Concentration and Reconstitution
1. Evaporate the solvent in the extraction plate under a stream of
nitrogen at 40°C.
2. Reconstitute the residues in 100 μL of methanol.
D. Analysis by GC-MS/LC-MS
1. Set up the GC-MS or LC-MS instrument according to the
manufacturer's instructions and ensure it is calibrated.
2. Inject 10 μL of reconstituted sample extract into the GC-MS or
LC-MS.
3. Perform analysis according to the laboratory's validated method
for plasmalogens.
4. Run quality control (QC) samples and internal standards with
each batch of blood spot specimens.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Analyze the chromatograms obtained from GC-MS or LC-MS.
2. Quantify the concentration of plasmalogens using the internal
standard method.
3. Compare results to established reference intervals.
4. Document any deviations from the expected analytical
performance.
5. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform instrument calibration and QC checks at the start and
end of each batch.
• Analyze QC samples alongside patient samples to ensure assay
performance.
• Criteria for accepting batch runs: Within 2 SD of the mean value
of the QC material.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results before releasing them to the LIS.
• Results outside reference intervals should be reviewed by a
supervisor for accuracy.
• Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Daily: Perform routine instrument maintenance as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Weekly: Check and replace gas supplies if needed for GC-MS.
• Monthly: Perform a full system performance check, recalibrate if
necessary.
• Troubleshoot any deviations in instrument performance, reagent
quality, or extraction issues as per the trouble-shooting guide
provided by the manufacturer.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Manual for GC-MS/LC-MS Instrument
• Internal laboratory QC and calibration protocols
• Reference intervals based on peer-reviewed literature
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all analyses performed, including instrument
calibration, QC results, and any maintenance or troubleshooting
activities.
• Store patient results according to laboratory policy, ensuring
confidentiality and data integrity.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the consistent
and accurate analysis of plasmalogens from blood spot specimens,
contributing to high-quality patient care.
