Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Plasma Cell
Assessment in Blood
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for plasma cell assessment in blood specimens.
This includes the preparation of blood specimens, staining,
microscopic examination, and reporting results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel performing plasma cell
assessments on blood specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technicians: Prepare specimens, perform staining,
and document all processes.
• Laboratory Scientists: Conduct microscopic examination,
analyze results, and verify the final report.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure adherence to the protocol and
maintain quality control.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope
• Staining kits (e.g., Wright-Giemsa stain)
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Centrifuge
• Blood collection tubes (EDTA)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA
anticoagulated tube.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of blood.
• Stability: Specimen should be processed within 24 hours of
collection. If delayed, store at 2-8 °C for up to 48 hours.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Labeling: Ensure specimens are properly labeled with at least
two patient identifiers.
2. Mix Specimen: Gently invert the EDTA tubes 8-10 times to mix
thoroughly.
3. Prepare Smears:
◦ Place a small drop of well-mixed blood near the frosted end
of a clean glass slide.
◦ Using another slide, spread the drop by pulling it to create a
thin smear.
◦ Allow the smear to air dry completely.
B. Staining Procedure:
1. Staining:
◦ Place the air-dried smear on a staining rack.
◦ Flood the smear with Wright-Giemsa stain for 3-5 minutes.
◦ Rinse with distilled water and allow to air dry.
2. Quality Check:
◦ Ensure the smear is evenly stained without overstaining.
◦ Check for any artifacts that may interfere with the
microscopic examination.
C. Microscopic Examination:
1. Examine Smear:
◦ Place the stained slide under the microscope.
◦ Use a 10x objective to scan the smear for overall cell
distribution.
◦ Switch to the 40x and 100x objectives to identify and count
plasma cells.
2. Quantification of Plasma Cells:
◦ Identify plasma cells based on morphology.
◦ Count 200 leukocytes and record the number of plasma
cells found among them.
◦ Calculate the percentage of plasma cells.
D. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Record Findings:
◦ Document the number of plasma cells observed.
◦ Include any abnormal findings such as dysplastic cells or
atypical morphology.
2. Report Results:
◦ Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify and review the report for accuracy.
◦ Ensure that results are communicated to the referring
physician promptly, including critical values.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Control Slides: Run control slides with known plasma cell counts
alongside patient samples to ensure staining consistency and
accuracy.
• Microscope Maintenance: Ensure the microscope is calibrated
and serviced regularly.
• Proficiency Testing: Participate in external proficiency testing
programs and internal competency assessments.
