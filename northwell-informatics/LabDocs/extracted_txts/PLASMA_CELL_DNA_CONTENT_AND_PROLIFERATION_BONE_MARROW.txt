Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for PLASMA
CELL DNA CONTENT AND PROLIFERATION, BONE MARROW
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure accurate and reliable
determination of plasma cell DNA content and proliferation in bone
marrow samples. This involves a clearly defined set of procedures for
processing, staining, and analyzing specimens using flow cytometry.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform all
steps in the analytical phase, documenting their actions where
required.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring compliance with this
protocol and addressing any identified deficiencies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Bone marrow aspirate in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• Specimens should be processed as soon as possible after
collection. If immediate processing is not possible, store at 4°C
and process within 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer
• Fluorescently-labeled antibodies for DNA content and proliferation
markers (e.g., Ki-67)
• DNA staining reagent (e.g., propidium iodide or DAPI)
• Cell fixation and permeabilization kit
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Sample tubes and pipettes
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the bone marrow aspirate gently by inversion.
2. Aliquot 1 mL of bone marrow sample into a sterile sample tube.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 300 x g for 5 minutes. Carefully
aspirate the supernatant.
4. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS.
B) Cell Fixation and Permeabilization:
1. Add 1 mL of fixative solution (from the Cell Fixation and
Permeabilization Kit) to the tube and mix by gentle vortexing.
2. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
4. Resuspend cells with 1 mL of permeabilization buffer (from the
kit) and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
C) Staining:
1. Add the appropriate volume of fluorescently-labeled anti-DNA
and proliferation antibodies according to manufacturer's
recommendations.
2. Mix gently by vortexing and incubate in the dark for 30 minutes
at room temperature.
3. Wash cells twice: Add 2 mL PBS, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5
minutes, and discard the supernatant each time.
4. Resuspend the stained cell pellet in 0.5 mL of PBS.
D) Data Acquisition by Flow Cytometry:
1. Set up the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions and appropriate settings for the fluorochromes
used.
2. Perform instrument calibration using quality control beads.
3. Acquire data, ensuring to collect sufficient events for reliable
analysis (e.g., minimum 20,000 events).
4. Use appropriate gating strategies to isolate plasma cells and
measure DNA content and proliferation.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Use flow cytometry software to analyze the data.
2. Determine the percentage of plasma cells positive for
proliferation markers and assess DNA content histograms.
3. Compare sample data to control samples to validate results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with known DNA content and
proliferation markers with each batch of tests.
• Review quality control results to detect any deviations from
expected values and take corrective action if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure that all results are reviewed and validated before
reporting.
• Enter data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure proper documentation.
• Report critical values immediately to the physician or designated
contact as per laboratory protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High cellular debris or poor sample quality may affect accuracy of
results.
• Ensure proper gating strategies to accurately isolate plasma cells
and avoid non-specific staining.

• Relevant literature and product inserts for antibodies and
reagents used.
• Flow Cytometer operational manual.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes made to the protocol and the
corresponding dates of implementation.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
generation of accurate and reliable results for plasma cell DNA
content and proliferation from bone marrow samples.
