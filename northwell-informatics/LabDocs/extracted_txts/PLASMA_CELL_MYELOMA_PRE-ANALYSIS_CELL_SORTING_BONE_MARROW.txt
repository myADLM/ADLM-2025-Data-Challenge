PLASMA CELL MYELOMA PRE-ANALYSIS CELL SORTING,
BONE MARROW
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the pre-
analytical phase for plasma cell myeloma cell sorting from bone
marrow samples. The purpose of this document is to ensure that
bone marrow samples are processed consistently, efficiently, and to
the best possible standards of accuracy and safety. This SOP applies
to all laboratory staff involved in the processing and sorting of bone
marrow samples for plasma cell myeloma analysis.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the pre-
analytical sorting of bone marrow cells, documenting results, and
taking appropriate corrective actions if necessary. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring
compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMENS
◦ Sample Collection:
▪ Bone marrow aspirate should be collected according to
the established clinical standards.
▪ Use an appropriate anticoagulant, such as heparin or
EDTA, to prevent clotting.
▪ Specimens must be labeled with the appropriate patient
identifiers, collection date, and time.
◦ Unacceptable Samples:
▪ Samples that are clotted or have insufficient volume.
▪ Samples that are unlabeled or mislabeled.
▪ Samples that have been improperly stored or show signs
of degradation.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Flow cytometer
◦ Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) system
◦ Lymphocyte separation medium (e.g., Ficoll-Paque)
◦ Magnetic beads conjugated to anti-CD138 antibodies
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Collection tubes
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Cell strainers
◦ Sterile disposable gloves, lab coats, and protective eyewear
3. PROCEDURE
A. Bone Marrow Processing:
1. Preparation:
◦ Verify the sample against the patient data and label.
◦ Document all relevant information in the laboratory's
information system.
2. Density Gradient Centrifugation:
◦ Dilute the bone marrow aspirate with PBS at a 1:1 ratio.
◦ Carefully layer the diluted bone marrow sample over the
lymphocyte separation medium in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.
◦ Centrifuge at 400 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature
with no brake.
◦ Carefully remove the mononuclear cell layer and transfer it
to a new tube.
3. Washing Cells:
◦ Wash the separated cells twice with PBS by centrifuging at
300 x g for 10 minutes, discarding the supernatant, and
resuspending the cell pellet in fresh PBS.
B. Cell Counting and Viability:
1. Cell Count:
◦ Count the cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell
counter. Record the total cell count.
2. Viability Testing:
◦ Assess cell viability using trypan blue exclusion or a suitable
alternative.
◦ Record the viable cell count and percentage viability.
C. Plasma Cell Sorting:
1. Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS):
◦ Resuspend the cells in MACS buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA,
0.5% bovine serum albumin).
◦ Incubate cells with anti-CD138 magnetic beads according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Wash the cells and pass them through a magnetic column to
isolate CD138+ plasma cells.
◦ Elute the CD138+ cells and collect them in a fresh tube.
2. Flow Cytometry Verification:
◦ Prepare the post-sort fraction for flow cytometry analysis.
◦ Stain the cells with appropriate fluorescent-conjugated
antibodies (e.g., anti-CD138, anti-CD38) as per the flow
cytometry protocol.
◦ Analyze the sorted cells on a flow cytometer to confirm the
purity of the plasma cell population.
◦ Record the results and ensure the purity meets the required
standard (typically ≥85% purity).
3. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include process controls in each batch of samples where
applicable.
◦ Validate the separation process using a known standard or a
previously validated sample.
◦ Implement and document corrective actions for inconsistent
results or deviations from SOP.
4. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all relevant information including sample ID, total
cell count, viability percentage, purity of isolated plasma
cells, and any notes on deviations or issues encountered
during processing.
◦ Store all documentation and data according to laboratory
policy, ensuring it is easily retrievable for future reference.
5. SAFETY AND CONTINGENCY
◦ Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
PPE.
◦ In the event of equipment malfunction, notify the supervisor
and use contingency methods established for sample
preservation and processing.
