Standard Operating Procedure for
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder, FISH,
Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder using Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) on tissue samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All lab personnel conducting the FISH analysis on tissue samples for
Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder are responsible for adhering to this
SOP. The supervisor is responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring compliance with this SOP.
3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Tissue samples (e.g., bone marrow biopsy, lymph node biopsy)
• Fixative (e.g., 10% neutral-buffered formalin)
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%)
• Xylene
• Paraffin
• Microtome
• Adhesive-coated slides
• Hybridization chamber
• Fluorescent probes specific for plasma cell proliferative disorder
markers (e.g., IGH, FGFR3, CCND1)
• Pre-hybridization buffer
• Hybridization buffer
• DAPI (counterstain)
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets
• Image capturing and analysis software
4. SAMPLE PREPARATION
4.1. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Fix tissue samples in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 4-24
hours.
• Dehydrate samples through a graded ethanol series (70%, 85%,
95%, and 100%).
• Clear samples in xylene and embed in paraffin.
• Section the paraffin-embedded blocks at 4-6 microns using a
microtome.
• Mount the sections on adhesive-coated slides.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Step 1: Heat the slides in an oven at 60°C for 15-30 minutes.
• Step 2: Deparaffinize the slides in xylene for 10 minutes, twice.
• Step 3: Rehydrate the slides through a graded ethanol series
(100%, 95%, 85%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
• Step 4: Rinse the slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
5.2. Pre-treatment
• Step 5: Immerse the slides in pre-treatment buffer and heat for
10-20 minutes at 80°C.
• Step 6: Wash slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
• Step 7: Immerse the slides in digestion buffer (e.g., pepsin or
proteinase K) at 37°C for 10-20 minutes.
• Step 8: Rinse the slides in distilled water and then in saline
sodium citrate (SSC) buffer.
5.3. Denaturation and Hybridization
• Step 9: Apply the fluorescent probe mix (denatured probe and
hybridization buffer) to the tissue sections.
• Step 10: Cover the tissue with a coverslip and seal with rubber
cement.
• Step 11: Denature the tissue and probe on a hotplate at 75-80°C
for 5-10 minutes.
• Step 12: Place the slides in a hybridization chamber and incubate
at 37°C overnight (12-18 hours).
5.4. Post-Hybridization Washes
• Step 13: Remove the coverslips and wash the slides in 2x SSC at
37°C for 10 minutes.
• Step 14: Wash the slides in 0.2x SSC at 37°C for 5 minutes.
• Step 15: Immerse the slides in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 5 minutes.
• Step 16: Rinse in distilled water for 1-2 minutes.
5.5. Counterstaining and Mounting
• Step 17: Apply DAPI counterstain to the slides and incubate for 5
minutes at room temperature.
• Step 18: Mount the slides with a mounting medium and coverslip.
6. ANALYSIS
• Step 19: Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope
using appropriate filter sets to visualize the fluorescent signals.
• Step 20: Capture images using image analysis software.
• Step 21: Analyze the fluorescent signals to determine the
presence of specific genetic markers associated with Plasma Cell
Proliferative Disorder.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive control slides with known fluorescent signals to
ensure probe performance.
• Include negative control slides without probe to check for non-
specific fluorescence.
• Document all steps, observations, and any deviations from the
protocol.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Step 22: Record the results of the FISH analysis in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Step 23: Have the results reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific fluorescent probes
used.
• Relevant literature on Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder and FISH
methodology.
• Internal quality control documentation.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all records, including temperature logs, reagent lot
numbers, and any incidents or deviations, are documented as per
laboratory policies.
This SOP ensures the accurate, consistent, and reliable generation of
FISH results for Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder in tissue samples.
Compliance with the protocol will help maintain high standards of
laboratory practice and ensure patient safety.
