Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder, High-
Risk with Reflex Probes, Diagnostic FISH Evaluation, Bone
Marrow
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the analytical procedures for evaluating plasma cell
proliferative disorders using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
on bone marrow specimens to detect high-risk genetic abnormalities.
Reflex probes will be used when necessary based on initial findings.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all approved staff members performing
diagnostic FISH evaluations on bone marrow specimens for high-risk
plasma cell proliferative disorders.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing FISH
analysis, documenting results, and ensuring quality control.
• Supervisors: Ensure technologists are adequately trained, verify
results, and oversee corrective actions when necessary.
• Quality Control Coordinator: Monitor and perform quality control
measures according to the guidelines.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Fluorescence microscope
• FISH probes specific to plasma cell proliferative disorders (e.g.,
del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(11;14), c-MYC)
• Reflex FISH probes (e.g., other chromosomal abnormalities
detected)
• Hybridization chamber
• Incubator set to appropriate temperature
• Cleaned glass slides
• Coverslips
• DAPI counterstain
• Fluorescent signal amplification kits
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol
• Immersion oil
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Bone marrow biopsy slides prepared per standard cytology
protocols.
• Specimens should be stored and transported at 4°C and
processed within 24-48 hours post-collection.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Pre-Analytical Check:
◦ Verify the specimen label and requisition form match.
◦ Ensure specimen quality is adequate (no clots, appropriate
cell density).
2. Slide Preparation:
◦ Ensure slides are properly cleaned and dried.
◦ Prepare bone marrow slides by applying a thin layer of cells
and allowing them to air dry.
B) FISH Probe Hybridization:
1. Denaturation:
◦ Apply the chosen FISH probe mix to each bone marrow
slide.
◦ Cover the specimen with a coverslip and place in a
hybridization chamber.
◦ Perform denaturation at 72°C for 2 minutes.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 14-16
hours.
C) Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Stringency Washes:
◦ Remove coverslips carefully and immerse slides in 2X SSC
solution at 72°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Follow with 0.1X SSC wash at 72°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Perform a final wash in a room-temperature 2X SSC/0.1%
Nonidet solution for 10 minutes.
D) Counterstaining:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to each slide.
2. Cover with a new coverslip and allow to sit in the dark for 10
minutes.
E) Microscopy Examination:
1. View under a fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter
sets for DAPI and fluorescent signals (FITC/TRITC).
2. Examine a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei for each probe
set.
3. Record the presence and percentage of abnormal signals.
F) Reflex Testing:
1. If the initial FISH results indicate abnormalities requiring further
clarification (e.g., ambiguous signals or additional suspected
abnormalities), apply reflex probes.
2. Repeat hybridization, wash, and microscopic examination steps
for reflex probes.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive Control: Test concurrently run positive control slides to
ensure the probe is functioning correctly.
2. Negative Control: Test concurrently run negative control slides
to avoid false positives.
3. Documentation: Record all control results in the Quality Control
Log. Ensure all steps are documented in the specimen's
processing sheet.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Prepare a detailed report including:
◦ Patient identifier
◦ Findings from the initial and, if applicable, reflex probes.
◦ Interpretation of results.
◦ Any recommendations for further testing or clinical
correlation.
2. Results are to be reviewed and verified by a qualified
supervisor before electronic entry into the LIS and release to
the ordering clinician.

10. RECORD RETENTION
All records related to specimen receipt, processing, quality control,
and results should be retained following institutional policies and
CLIA requirements.
11. REVISION HISTORY
Document and log any revisions made to this SOP along with
reasons for changes, ensuring all staff members are promptly
informed and trained in updated procedures.
Note: This protocol is based on standard practices and should be
adjusted according to new research findings, updated guidelines, or
institutional preferences.
