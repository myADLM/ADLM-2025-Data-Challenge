Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder, Pre-
Analysis Cell Sorting, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedure for sorting cells from
bone marrow specimens for analysis of plasma cell proliferative
disorders. This pre-analytical sorting of cells ensures precise
and accurate identification of plasma cells, which is critical for
the subsequent analysis stages.
2. SCOPE
The SOP is intended for trained laboratory personnel
responsible for sorting bone marrow cells prior to analysis. This
ensures uniformity and accuracy in identifying cells associated
with plasma cell proliferative disorders.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
All laboratory personnel performing the procedure must:
◦ Be appropriately trained in flow cytometry and cell sorting
techniques.
◦ Ensure the proper maintenance and calibration of all
equipment.
◦ Adhere to this SOP to ensure the integrity and accuracy of
the sorted cell populations.
4. DEFINITION
Plasma Cell Proliferative Disorder: A condition in which there is
an abnormal increase in plasma cells in the bone marrow,
potentially indicating disorders such as multiple myeloma.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
◦ Specimen type: Bone marrow aspirate.
◦ Volume: 5-10 mL of bone marrow aspirate in EDTA
anticoagulated tube.
◦ Storage: Specimens should be analyzed as soon as
possible after collection. If delayed, store at 2-8°C and
process within 24 hours.
◦ Prior to analysis: Ensure specimens are adequately mixed
and checked for clotting.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Flow Cytometer with Sorting Capability (e.g., BD FACSAria)
◦ Reagents: Fluorescently-labeled antibodies specific for
plasma cell markers (e.g., CD38, CD138)
◦ Sheath fluid
◦ Appropriate software for data acquisition and analysis
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ 15 mL polypropylene tubes
◦ Biohazard disposal containers
7. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation
◦ Label all tubes and prepare them for receiving sorted cells.
◦ Check and calibrate the flow cytometer, ensure it is
equipped with the appropriate lasers and filters for the
fluorescent antibodies used.
b) Staining of Cells
◦ Prepare a single-cell suspension of the bone marrow
aspirate.
◦ Aliquot an appropriate volume of the cell suspension
(approximately 5 x 10^6 cells) into a polypropylene tube.
◦ Add fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for
identifying plasma cells (e.g., CD38-FITC, CD138-PE) to the
cell suspension.
◦ Incubate the cells for 20 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
◦ Wash the cells by adding 2 mL of FACS buffer and
centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 minutes.
◦ Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in an
appropriate volume of FACS buffer.
c) Cell Sorting
◦ Load the prepared samples onto the flow cytometer.
◦ Perform a compensation setup to correct for any spectral
overlap between the fluorochromes.
◦ Create a scatter plot to gate the plasma cell population
based on forward and side scatter characteristics.
◦ Apply fluorescence gating to further identify plasma cells
(e.g., CD38 high, CD138 positive).
◦ Use the cell sorting function to collect the plasma cell
population into a labeled tube.
◦ Ensure sorted cell populations are kept at 4°C until further
analysis.
d) Post-Sorting Analysis
◦ Evaluate the purity of the sorted cell population by re-
analyzing a small aliquot of sorted cells on the flow
cytometer.
◦ Ensure the purity exceeds 90% for downstream analysis
purposes.
◦ Record all observations and any issues encountered during
the sorting process in the laboratory logbook.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Ensure all reagents, including antibodies, are within their
expiration dates and stored as recommended by the
manufacturer.
◦ Regularly clean and maintain the flow cytometer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Include appropriate biological controls (e.g., positive and
negative populations) to validate staining and sorting fidelity.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Document the sorted cell population's profile including the
percentage of total cells sorted.
◦ Include any relevant comments regarding sample condition,
anomalies detected during sorting, or deviations from the
SOP.
◦ Results are to be reviewed and validated by a senior
technologist before further analysis or reporting.
