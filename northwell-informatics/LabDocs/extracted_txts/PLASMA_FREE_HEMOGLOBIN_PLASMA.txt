Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Plasma Free Hemoglobin
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of free hemoglobin in plasma samples. This test is
essential in diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as hemolysis,
sickle cell anemia, and other diseases associated with red blood cell
destruction.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing the
plasma free hemoglobin test to adhere to this protocol to ensure
accurate and reliable test results.
3. DEFINITIONS
Plasma Free Hemoglobin (PFH): The concentration of hemoglobin
present in the plasma, not contained within red blood cells, indicating
hemolysis or red blood cell destruction.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma (heparinized)
Volume:
• At least 1 mL of plasma required.
Storage and Stability:
• Plasma samples must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store separated plasma at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed
immediately.
• Plasma samples can be frozen at -20°C for up to 7 days if longer
storage is needed.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Spectrophotometer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Micropipettes (with disposable tips)
• Labelled tubes for samples and controls
Reagents:
• Drabkin's reagent (Hemoglobin Reagent)
• Calibrators (Hemoglobin Standard)
• Quality Control materials (low, medium, and high levels)
Supplies:
• Gloves
• Lab coats
• Timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge whole blood at 2500-3000 RPM for 10 minutes at
4°C.
2. Carefully separate plasma without disturbing the buffy coat and
store in labelled tubes.
3. If immediate testing is not possible, store plasma at 2-8°C or
freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare Drabkin’s reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Prepare calibrator and control solutions as per manufacturer
instructions.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Turn on the spectrophotometer and set it to 540 nm.
2. Add 4.0 mL of Drabkin's reagent to each test tube (one tube for
each sample, calibrator and control).
3. Add 0.02 mL (20 µL) of plasma sample, calibrator, or control to
the respective tube and mix well.
4. Incubate the mixture at room temperature (18-25°C) for 5
minutes.
5. Blank the spectrophotometer with Drabkin's reagent alone.
6. Measure and record the absorbance of each tube at 540 nm.
D. Calculations:
1. Plot the calibration curve using the absorbance of the
calibrators.
2. Determine the concentration of plasma free hemoglobin in each
sample by comparing the absorbance to the calibration curve.
3. Report results in mg/dL.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Quality Control Material:
1. Use QC materials at low, medium, and high levels with each
batch of samples.
2. QC results must fall within the established range before patient
results can be reported.
3. Document and review QC results. Any out-of-range results
must be investigated and resolved before proceeding.
B. Troubleshooting:
1. Check reagent and sample preparation for any deviations.
2. Validate the performance of the spectrophotometer and
recalibrate if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Verification and Documentation:
1. Verify results based on QC acceptance criteria.
2. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
B. Reference Intervals:
• Normal Range: 0-5 mg/dL (reference range may vary, verify with
current literature).
C. Critical Values:
• Any PFH value greater than 50 mg/dL should be repeated and
reported immediately to the physician.
D. Documentation:
• Maintain all records including calibration, QC, and patient results
as per the laboratory’s standard documentation practices.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. High bilirubin (>20 mg/dL) and lipemia can interfere with the
measurement.
2. Ensure samples are not hemolyzed during collection and
processing.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves and lab coats.
2. Handle all samples as if they are potentially infectious.
3. Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling and disposal of
biohazardous materials.
