STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR-1, 4G/5G GENOTYPING
(PAI-1 POLYMORPHISM)
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the genotyping of Plasminogen
Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) polymorphism (4G/5G) to provide
accurate and timely genetic information for the necessary clinical
interventions and diagnoses.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the genotyping of PAI-1 (4G/5G)
polymorphism in DNA extracted from human biological samples in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory scientist/technologist will perform the procedure as
outlined and ensure quality control and documentation are
maintained throughout the process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• PAI-1: Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1, a protein that inhibits
fibrinolysis.
• 4G/5G Polymorphism: A genetic variation in the PAI-1 gene
promoter region (insertion/deletion polymorphism), which can
influence gene expression and, subsequently, PAI-1 levels in
plasma.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Pipettes and calibrated tips
• PCR tubes and tube racks
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV Transilluminator
• DNA Extraction Kit (validated for blood, buccal swabs, etc.)
• Reagents (Taq Polymerase, dNTPs, PCR buffer, Primers specific
for 4G/5G polymorphism, Agarose, Ethidium Bromide or GelRed)
• Water bath (optional for DNA extraction protocols)
• Documentation logs
6. REAGENTS AND PRIMERS
• Primers: Please ensure that specific primers for 4G/5G
polymorphism are synthesized and validated.
◦ Forward: 5'-ACGTTGGCTCCCTGCTCGTAA-3'
◦ Reverse: 5'-GTGGGATGTGGGTCAGAGGACTCT-3'
• Taq polymerase and commercial PCR mastermix
• Agarose, TAE/TBE buffer, and DNA ladder
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from the collected sample using a validated DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA concentration using a NanoDrop or a similar
spectrophotometer.
3. Document DNA concentration and quality metrics in the DNA
extraction log.
7.2 PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the following recipe
for each reaction (volume to be scaled up based on the number
of samples):
• 12.5 µL master mix
• 1 µL Forward primer (10 µM)
• 1 µL Reverse primer (10 µM)
• 1 µL DNA template (20-50 ng DNA)
• Adjust the final volume to 25 µL with nuclease-free water.
1. Mix by gently vortexing and briefly spin down in a
microcentrifuge.
7.3 PCR Amplification
1. Set the PCR thermal cycler according to the following
conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
• 35 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
• Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
1. Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and start the
program.
7.4 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with a suitable staining agent
(Ethidium Bromide or GelRed).
2. Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into each
well.
3. Include a DNA ladder for size comparison.
4. Run the gel at 100 volts for 30-45 minutes.
5. Visualize the gel under a UV transilluminator and document the
results.
8. ANALYSIS
1. The expected band sizes:
• 4G allele: 139 bp
• 5G allele: 133 bp
1. Determine the genotype of each sample based on band sizes:
• Homozygous 4G/4G: Single 139 bp band
• Homozygous 5G/5G: Single 133 bp band
• Heterozygous 4G/5G: Both 139 bp and 133 bp bands
9. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure reliability.
2. Repeat the analysis for any ambiguous results.
3. Document all control results and any troubleshooting measures
taken in the laboratory log.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Review by a qualified scientist/technologist.
3. Generate and sign the final report.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
N/A (Genotype will be reported as 4G/4G, 4G/5G, or 5G/5G).
12. REFERENCES
Refer to current literature and guidelines for PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism genotyping as well as manufacturer's instructions for
the DNA extraction and PCR kits used in this procedure.
13. APPENDICES
Provide a detailed flowchart and labeled images of expected gel
bands for easy reference.
14. REVISION HISTORY
Document any revisions made to this SOP with dates and
descriptions of changes.
