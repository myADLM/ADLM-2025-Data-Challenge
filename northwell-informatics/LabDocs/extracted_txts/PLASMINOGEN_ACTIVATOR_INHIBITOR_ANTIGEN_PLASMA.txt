Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps and conditions required for the
analytical phase of generating results for Plasminogen Activator
Inhibitor Antigen (PAI-1), Plasma.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps outlined in this procedure to ensure accurate
and reliable test results. All personnel must follow this SOP to
maintain consistency and reliability in test results.
1. DEFINITION
PAI-1 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1) is a protein that inhibits
fibrinolysis, and its measurement in plasma is used to assess
fibrinolytic activity in clinical samples.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma collected in a citrated tube (light blue top).
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Specimen should be centrifuged immediately after collection at
1500 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
• Freeze the separated plasma at -70°C if not analyzed
immediately. Samples are stable for 6 months when stored at
-70°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Plate Reader or ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory Freezer (-70°C)
• Plate Shaker
• PAI-1 ELISA Kit, including:
◦ PAI-1 Antibody Coated 96-well Microplate
◦ PAI-1 Standard
◦ Detection Antibody
◦ Substrate Solution
◦ Stop Solution
◦ Wash Buffer
◦ Sample Diluent
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature and mix thoroughly
by gentle inversion. Do not vortex.
2. Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions
provided with the PAI-1 ELISA Kit.
3. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before the
assay.
Analytical Phase:
1. Label the wells of the microplate according to the standards,
controls, and samples being used.
2. Add 100 µL of sample diluent to each of the desired wells.
3. Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and plasma sample to
the appropriate wells.
4. Cover the plate with plate sealer, and incubate for 2 hours at
room temperature on a plate shaker set at 300 rpm.
5. After incubation, remove the plate sealer and wash the plates 4
times with 300 µL Wash Buffer using the microplate washer.
After the last wash, invert the plate and tap it gently on
absorbent paper to remove any remaining wash buffer.
6. Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
7. Cover the plate with plate sealer, and incubate for 1 hour at
room temperature on a plate shaker set at 300 rpm.
8. Wash the plate as described in step 5.
9. Add 100 µL of Substrate Solution to each well. Incubate for
10-20 minutes at room temperature without shaking.
10. Add 100 µL of Stop Solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at 450 nm
within 30 minutes of adding the Stop Solution.
12. QUALITY CONTROL
13. Run Quality Control (QC) material with each assay to ensure
accuracy and reliability:
◦ Use both low and high control samples provided in the PAI-1
ELISA Kit.
14. Ensure all QC results fall within the established acceptable
ranges prior to reporting patient results.
15. Document all QC results in the QC log.
16. REPORTING RESULTS
17. Calculate the PAI-1 concentrations for patient samples using
the standard curve generated from the kit standards.
18. Report results in ng/mL.
19. Review results for any discrepancies or unusual patterns, and
verify calculations before validation.
20. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for final reporting.
21. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Establish reference intervals as per the laboratory's population
demographics and validation studies. Consult the ELISA kit’s insert or
literature for suggested reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for limitations related to the
ELISA kit. Possible limitations include sample handling, heterophile
antibodies, and cross-reactivity with other proteins.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the PAI-1 ELISA Kit package insert and any other relevant
literature or validation studies for detailed procedural information,
quality control, and method limitations.
This SOP is effective as of [Insert Date] and must be reviewed and
approved by the laboratory supervisor or designated authority before
