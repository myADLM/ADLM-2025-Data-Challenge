Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Plasminogen Activity,
Plasma Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
testing Plasminogen Activity in plasma to ensure accurate and
consistent measurement and reporting of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in
the processing and analysis of plasminogen activity tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and medical laboratory scientists are
responsible for performing plasminogen activity testing according to
this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with this procedure and addressing any discrepancies or
issues that may arise during testing.
4. ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS
• Plasminogen Activity (PGA): A measure of the functional activity
of plasminogen in plasma.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System
• QC: Quality Control
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Container: Sodium Citrate (light blue top) tube
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL plasma
• Transport Conditions: Plasma must be promptly separated from
cells and frozen at -70°C if not analyzed immediately. Avoid
thawing and refreezing.
6. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Plasma Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 4 hours
◦ 2-8°C: 24 hours
◦ -20°C: 1 month
◦ -70°C: 6 months
7. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Test Kit: Plasminogen Activity Assay Kit (e.g., Chromogenic
Assay Kit)
• Calibrators and Controls: Standard calibrator provided with the
assay kit, normal and abnormal QC controls
• Equipment:
◦ Plate reader or spectrophotometer capable of measuring
absorbance at the specified wavelength (e.g., 405 nm)
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge capable of achieving 1,500 x g
8. REAGENT PREPARATION AND STORAGE
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reconstituting and
storing reagents. Ensure all reagents are brought to room
temperature prior to use.
• Calibrators and controls should be prepared, aliquoted, and
stored according to the kit instructions.
9. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Warm all reagents to room temperature.
• Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly at 37°C. Mix well
immediately after thawing, then keep on ice.
• Prepare the microplate by labeling wells for standards, controls,
and patient samples.
• Set the plate reader to the specified wavelength (e.g., 405 nm).
B. Assay Procedure
1. Calibrator and Control Preparation: Prepare fresh calibrators
and quality controls according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 50 μL of calibrators, QC samples, and patient samples
to the appropriate wells of the microplate.
◦ Add 50 μL of chromogenic substrate to each well.
3. Incubation: Incubate the plate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
4. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 405 nm using the plate reader.
◦ Record the absorbance readings for all calibrators, controls,
and patient samples.
C. Calculation and Interpretation
1. Establish Calibration Curve: Plot the absorbance readings of
the calibrators against their known plasminogen activity values.
Generate a standard curve using appropriate software or
calculations.
2. Determine Sample Values: Use the calibration curve to
determine the plasminogen activity of QC samples and patient
specimens. Ensure sample values fall within the linear range of
the calibration curve.
D. Quality Control
1. Run Controls: Include normal and abnormal QC controls with
each assay run to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test.
2. Control Limits: Verify that QC results fall within the established
acceptable ranges. If controls are outside the acceptable limits,
troubleshoot the issue before reporting patient results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Documentation: Record all results, including QC data, and
reviewer’s initials in the laboratory log or electronic record.
• Verification: Cross-reference results with the LIS before
releasing.
• Critical Values: Immediately report any critical values or
significantly abnormal results to the ordering physician following
laboratory policy.
