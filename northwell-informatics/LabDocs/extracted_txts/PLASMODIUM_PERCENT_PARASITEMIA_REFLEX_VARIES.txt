Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing Plasmodium
Parasitemia (Percent Parasitemia Reflex, Various)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for determining Plasmodium parasitemia by
microscopic examination, ensuring accurate and reliable results for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment of malaria.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologists to
perform and document the analysis of Plasmodium parasitemia as
specified in this SOP. The laboratory supervisor must ensure that all
personnel are adequately trained and adhere to this procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Plasmodium Parasitemia: The percentage of red blood cells (RBCs)
infected with Plasmodium parasites in a given blood sample.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Thoroughly mix the whole blood sample by gently inverting the
tube several times.
2. Prepare two thin blood smears and one thick blood smear for
each sample: a. Thin smear: Place a small drop of well-mixed
blood at one end of a clean microscope slide. Using another
slide, spread the drop swiftly along the slide at an angle to
create a thin film. b. Thick smear: Place a larger drop of well-
mixed blood in the center of a clean slide and spread it in a
circular motion to create a thicker layer approximately the size
of a dime.
B. Fixation and Staining
1. Allow the smears to air dry on a flat surface.
2. Fix the thin smear in methanol for 1-2 minutes; do not fix the
thick smear.
3. Stain both the thin and thick smears with Giemsa stain: a.
Dilute Giemsa stain in pH 7.2 buffer (1:20 ratio). b. Immerse the
smears in the diluted stain for 30-45 minutes. c. Rinse the
smears with distilled water and allow to air dry.
C. Microscopic Examination
1. Using a CX31 or similar microscope, examine the stained
smears under oil immersion at 1000x magnification.
2. For the thin smear: a. Scan the smear systematically using the
100x objective lens. b. Count the number of infected RBCs
(with visible parasites) out of at least 1000 RBCs.
3. For the thick smear: a. Scan the smear systematically using the
100x objective lens. b. Count the number of asexual and sexual
Plasmodium parasites (trophozoites, schizonts, and
gametocytes) per 200 white blood cells (WBCs). c. Estimate the
total WBC count if not provided by the referring clinician
(average WBC count is 8000 cells/μL).
D. Calculation of Parasitemia
1. Using the thin smear: a. Calculate parasitemia (%) = (Number
of infected RBCs / Total number of RBCs examined) x 100.
2. Using the thick smear: a. Calculate the number of parasites per
microliter of blood = (Number of parasites counted / Number of
WBCs counted) x Total WBC count.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Use pre-stained slides with known parasitemia levels for
positive and negative controls.
5. Document control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges specified by the manufacturer.
6. Troubleshoot out-of-range controls by reviewing the staining
procedure, microscope calibration, and sample preparation
methods.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Record the parasitemia percentage and parasite density in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
9. Any peripheral observations (e.g., species differentiation,
abnormal RBC morphology) must be noted in the final report.
10. Review and verify results before releasing, ensuring correlation
with clinical suspicion and history.
Critical Results:
• Any presence of Plasmodium species in the peripheral blood
must be reported immediately to the attending clinician as it
necessitates urgent clinical management.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable; parasitemia should be detected and quantified when
present.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
This SOP is applicable to high-quality, well-prepared blood films and
assumes optimal hand-eye coordination and expertise in microscopy.
Sensitivity may vary with the technologist's proficiency in identifying
Plasmodium species and stages.
