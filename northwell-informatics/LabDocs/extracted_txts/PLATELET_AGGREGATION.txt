STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE PLATELET
AGGREGATION ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analytical phase of generating results for platelet aggregation assays.
These assays are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring platelet
function disorders and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
laboratory results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained medical laboratory
scientist to perform platelet aggregation assays as per this protocol.
The lab supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedure and for addressing any issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
1. DEFINITION
Platelet aggregation tests are used to evaluate the function of
platelets by measuring their ability to clump together (aggregate) in
response to various agonists such as ADP, collagen, thrombin,
epinephrine, and ristocetin.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1. Specimen Requirements
- Preferred Specimen: Freshly collected citrated whole blood (3.2% sodium citrate) using light blue top tubes. Ensure proper mixing to prevent clotting.
- Specimen Transport: Specimens must be transported at room temperature and analyzed within 2-4 hours of collection.
- Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens should be rejected.
3.2. Equipment and Reagents
- Platelet aggregometer
- Aggregation cuvettes and stir bars
- Pipettes and tips
- Platelet aggregation reagents (ADP, collagen, thrombin, epinephrine, ristocetin, etc.)
- Buffered saline solution
- Calibration and control materials
3.3. Pre-analytical Preparation
- Centrifuge the citrated whole blood at 200g for 10-15 minutes at room temperature to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP).
- Centrifuge another aliquot of citrated whole blood at 2500g for 20 minutes to prepare platelet-poor plasma (PPP) to be used as a blank or control.
- Pipette the PRP carefully to avoid disrupting the platelet layer.
3.4. Instrument Calibration
- Turn on the platelet aggregometer and allow it to warm up for at least 30 minutes.
- Perform instrument calibration following the manufacturer's instructions. Use appropriate calibration solutions to ensure accurate readings.
- Document the calibration, including date, time, and initials of the technologist.
3.5. Analytical Process
- Measure the baseline optical density (OD) of PRP at 37°C using PPP as a reference.
- Add stir bars to the aggregation cuvettes.
- Pipette an appropriate volume of PRP into the cuvettes (e.g., 250 µL).
- Add the selected agonist to the cuvette and initiate the aggregation. Common agonist concentrations:
- ADP: 5-10 μM
- Collagen: 2-5 μg/mL
- Epinephrine: 5-10 μM
- Ristocetin: 1.0-1.5 mg/mL
- Monitor and record the aggregation response over a defined period (e.g., up to 10 minutes) as optical density decreases due to platelet aggregation.
- Save the aggregation curves generated by the instrument.
3.6. Quality Control
- Run platelet aggregation controls (low, normal, and high) at the beginning of each shift or new reagent lot.
- Document control results. If any control is out of range, troubleshoot according to QC protocol before proceeding with patient samples.
3.7. Calculation and Interpretation
- Calculate the maximum aggregation (% decrease in OD) for each agonist.
- Compare results with standard reference ranges and interpret in the context of clinical findings.
- Notify the supervisor immediately if results are inconsistent or if there are technical issues.
3.8. Reporting Results
- Enter results into the laboratory information system, ensuring accuracy and proper documentation.
- Annotate any critical findings or deviations from expected results.
- Review and verify results before release.
