Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Platelet Antibody
Screen
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for screening for platelet antibodies
in patient samples to aid in the diagnosis of platelet disorders and
transfusion reactions.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the platelet antibody screen using the specified method
and to adhere to detailed procedural steps for accurate and
reproducible results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
competent in carrying out this procedure, and for overseeing the
adherence to quality control protocols.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) or serum (red
top) tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Store whole blood at 2-8°C if testing is not immediate, but do not
freeze.
• Serum or plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or
frozen at -20°C for longer storage periods.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing heparin.
• Specimens not labeled with patient identification.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Platelet antibody screening kit (commercially available, such as
PakPLUS® or similar)
◦ Reagents should be stored according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Positive and Negative controls.
• Microplate reader.
• Centrifuge.
• Immunoassay instrumentation (if automated).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Incubator (if required by the method).
• Plate washer (if automated method).
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use.
• Prepare workspace and arrange all necessary materials and
equipment.
Manual Method:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the whole blood specimen to separate plasma/
serum.
◦ Transfer serum/plasma to a clean, labeled test tube.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Add the required volume of serum/plasma to the wells in
accordance with the kit manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Add controls in designated wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at the temperature and duration specified
in the kit instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly using the plate washer or manual
wash method as specified.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the detection reagent and incubate for the prescribed
time.
◦ Wash the plate if necessary.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark, if required.
7. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
8. Reading Results:
◦ Determine the absorbance of each well using a microplate
reader at the appropriate wavelength.
◦ Compare the results to the cut-off value provided by the kit
instructions to determine positive or negative results.
Automated Method:
• Follow the instrument’s specific operational procedures for loading
samples, reagents, and performing the test.
• Ensure the instrument is calibrated and perform routine
maintenance as required.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Repeat the test if controls do not fall within the expected range.
• Document all QC activities, corrective actions taken, and
outcomes.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Negative: No antibodies detected; absorbance below cut-off
value.
• Positive: Presence of antibodies; absorbance above cut-off value.
• Equivocal: Indeterminate results; repeat test or perform additional
confirmatory tests as necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record both positive and negative findings in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Inform the ordering physician of positive results and any critical
findings immediately.
• Attach comments to results as required for clarification based on
interpretation criteria.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records of tests performed, including test dates,
reagent lot numbers, control results, patient results, and any
deviations.
• Ensure records are stored securely and are easily retrievable for
future reference and audits.
