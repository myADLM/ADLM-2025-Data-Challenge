STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
TITLE: Platelet Antibody Screen, Serum
SOP Number: LAB-PLT-001
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the screening of platelet antibodies in serum specimens to ensure
consistent, accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the following procedure as specified. All results will be reviewed by a
qualified technologist.
3. DEFINITION
The Platelet Antibody Screen, Serum is a laboratory test performed
to detect the presence of antibodies directed against platelets in a
patient's serum. This test is often utilized in cases of unexplained
thrombocytopenia.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Test tube racks
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450-650 nm
• Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Platelet Antibody Screening Kit (Store at 2-8°C)
• Control sera (positive and negative controls)
• Platelet antigen-coated microtiter strips
• Wash buffer
• Enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB - Tetramethylbenzidine)
• Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid or equivalent)
Supplies:
• Serum tubes (red or gold top)
• Disposable gloves
• Micropipette tips
• Laboratory coats
• Calibrated timers
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Serum: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube (gold
top) or plain red top tube. Allow the blood to clot at room
temperature for 30-60 minutes before centrifugation.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if testing is
performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze specimens
at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Label microtiter plate wells for individual patient samples, and
control sera.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette 100 μL of patient serum and control sera into
designated wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Aspirate and wash wells with wash buffer (5 cycles).
4. Add 100 μL of enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Aspirate and wash wells with wash buffer (5 cycles).
7. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 10-15 minutes,
shielded from light.
9. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
10. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set at 450 nm, with a reference filter at
620-650 nm.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative control sera in each batch of
tests.
2. Verify that the OD values of the controls are within the expected
range.
3. If control values are outside the expected range, the run is
invalid and should be repeated.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Calculate the mean OD for the negative control.
2. A sample is considered positive for platelet antibodies if the OD
of the sample is greater than the mean OD of the negative
control plus 0.100.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report results as either “Positive for platelet antibodies” or
“Negative for platelet antibodies” based on the interpretation
criteria.
2. Ensure results are entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS) and reviewed by a supervisor before final release.
