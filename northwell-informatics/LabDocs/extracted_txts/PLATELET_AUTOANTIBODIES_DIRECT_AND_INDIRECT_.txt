Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Platelet Autoantibodies Testing (Direct and Indirect)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of Platelet Autoantibodies (Direct and Indirect) testing,
ensuring the accuracy and reliability of results. These tests are used
to detect autoantibodies against patient platelets, aiding in the
diagnosis of conditions such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura
(ITP).
Responsibility:
This protocol is to be followed by all designated laboratory staff
trained in performing platelet autoantibodies testing. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all testing is
performed and documented in compliance with this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Platelet Autoantibodies Tests:
• Direct Platelet Autoantibody Test (DAT): Detects antibodies bound
to platelets in the patient's blood.
• Indirect Platelet Autoantibody Test (IAT): Detects antibodies
circulating in the patient's serum that can bind to platelets.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
1. Ensure the specimens (1-2 EDTA anticoagulated whole blood
for DAT; 1-2 serum samples for IAT) are received, accessioned,
and labeled appropriately.
2. Verify specimen integrity. Ensure specimens are maintained at
2-8°C and are processed within 24 hours of collection for
optimal results.
B. Reagents and Equipment:
1. Prepare all necessary reagents according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Ensure availability and calibration of instrumentation such as
flow cytometer or ELISA reader, centrifuge, and incubator if
required.
C. Direct Platelet Autoantibody Test (DAT):
1. Label a series of tubes for controls and patient's sample.
2. Add 100 µL of the patient’s EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood
to each appropriately labeled tube.
3. Wash the patient’s platelets three times with PBS or equivalent
washing buffer.
4. After the final wash, carefully aspirate the supernatant and
resuspend the washed platelets in a small volume of PBS.
5. Add anti-human IgG, IgM, or IgA (depending on the clinical
indication and test kit instructions) to the test tube.
6. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for the time specified by the
manufacturer (usually 30–60 minutes).
7. Wash the platelets again to remove unbound antibodies.
8. Analyze platelet-bound antibodies using flow cytometry or
microscopy techniques.
9. Document fluorescence intensity or absorbance readings as
per the test protocol.
D. Indirect Platelet Autoantibody Test (IAT):
1. Label a series of tubes for controls and patient's sample.
2. Prepare a 1:5 dilution of the patient’s serum with PBS.
3. Add 50 µL of the diluted patient serum to a tube containing
donor platelets (washed platelets from a normal volunteer or
commercially available platelets).
4. Incubate at room temperature or 37°C, as specified by the
manufacturer (usually 30-60 minutes).
5. Wash the platelets three times with PBS to remove unbound
antibodies.
6. Add anti-human immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, or IgA as
indicated) and incubate for an additional 30 minutes.
7. Perform a final wash and analyze using flow cytometry, ELISA
reader, or other suitable instrumentation.
8. Document results and interpret according to the provided
standardized criteria.
E. Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the patient’s platelet autoantibody levels with
reference controls.
2. A positive result indicates the presence of autoantibodies bound
to the platelets (DAT) or in the serum (IAT).
3. If a positive result is observed, document the intensity and any
observed patterns of binding.
4. Evaluate controls to ensure the accuracy and validity of the test
results.
F. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples
with each test batch.
2. Document and evaluate control results to ensure proper assay
performance.
3. If controls do not perform within acceptable ranges, investigate
and repeat the tests as necessary.
4. Perform regular calibration and maintenance of instruments as
per manufacturer’s guidelines.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS)
ensuring the patient's identification and results’ traceability.
2. Include test interpretation, any limitations, and remarks based
on control observations.
3. Ensure all results are reviewed and authorized by a supervising
technologist or laboratory supervisor before being reported to
the clinician.
