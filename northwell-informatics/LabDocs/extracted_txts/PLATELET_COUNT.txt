SOP: Platelet Count Analysis
1. Purpose To ensure accurate and consistent quantification of
platelet count in patient samples using an automated
hematology analyzer.
2. Scope and Responsibility This procedure applies to all CLIA-
certified laboratory personnel trained on the hematology
analyzer. It is the responsibility of the designated staff to follow
the procedure precisely and report any discrepancies to the
supervisor.
3. Definitions Platelet count: Measurement of the number of
platelets in a given volume of blood. Platelets are small,
colorless cell fragments in the blood whose primary function is
clot formation.
4. Specimen Requirements
◦ Preferred/acceptable specimens:
▪ Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top) vacutainer
tubes
◦ Unacceptable specimens:
▪ Hemolyzed samples
▪ Clotted samples
▪ Samples not properly mixed with anticoagulant
▪ Specimens over 24 hours old
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Automated hematology analyzer (e.g., Sysmex, Beckman
Coulter)
◦ EDTA (lavender-top) tubes
◦ Quality control materials (e.g., 3-level blood control)
◦ Optional: Manual counting chamber (hemocytometer) and
phase-contrast microscope (for confirmation/testing
analyzer issues)
6. Procedures
A. Preliminary Steps
1. Verify the analyzer's calibration and quality control status.
Ensure the instrument has passed QC for the current
shift.
2. Mix the whole blood sample by gentle inversion (8–10
times) immediately before analysis to ensure proper
suspension of platelets.
B. Automated Platelet Count Analysis
1. Enter patient/sample identification code into the analyzer.
2. Load the sample onto the sample rack of the analyzer.
3. Select 'Start' to initiate the analysis process.
4. The analyzer will aspirate the sample, and the results will
be displayed on the screen and automatically transferred
to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
C. Result Verification and Troubleshooting
1. If the platelet count is outside the reportable range or if a
flag/error code is displayed, take the following steps:
▪ Re-mix and re-run the sample on the analyzer.
▪ Perform a manual platelet count if flags persist (follow
the procedure detailed below).
2. For flagged samples or those with abnormal morphology,
review a blood smear under a microscope. Confirm
platelet count manually if there are discrepancies or signs
of platelet clumping.
3. For manual count:
▪ Prepare a blood smear and stained using appropriate
stains (e.g., Wright stain).
▪ Count platelets in 10 oil immersion fields.
▪ Calculate the average platelet count per field and
multiply by 15,000 to estimate the platelet count per
microliter of blood.
7. Quality Control
◦ Perform quality control (QC) checks with 3-level blood
control (low, normal, high) at the beginning of each shift.
◦ Record QC results and ensure they fall within the accepted
parameters set by the manufacturer.
◦ If QC is out of range, recalibrate the analyzer and re-run
QC. Notify supervisor and take corrective actions if
necessary.
8. Reporting Results
◦ Review and verify results within the LIS. Ensure that results
align with QC data and any manual counts performed.
◦ Ensure flagged results, critical values, and manual counts
are documented with proper comments.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results to
clinicians.
9. Reference Intervals Normal platelet count reference intervals
vary based on age and sex. Provide reference intervals as per
laboratory policy, typically:
◦ Adult/Children: 150,000 – 450,000 /µL
◦ Infants: May vary; refer to pediatric reference tables.
10. Critical Results and Action Points
◦ Critical low: <20,000 /µL
▪ Inform clinician immediately, repeat the test to confirm if
necessary.
◦ Critical high: >1,000,000 /µL
▪ Inform clinician immediately, repeat the test to confirm if
necessary.
11. Methods Limitations
◦ Aggregated/clumped platelets may impact results; ensure
proper mixing and microscopic intervention if needed.
◦ Automated analyzers may be affected by high white blood
cell counts or giant platelets. Confirm with manual counting
methods as required.
12. References
◦ Appropriate hematology analyzer user manual(s) (Sysmex,
Beckman Coulter, etc.)
◦ Laboratory’s internal QC policy and procedures.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
Ensure all laboratory staff are trained on this SOP and understand
the importance of accurate platelet counting in patient management.
Document all training sessions and update this SOP as needed to
reflect any changes in procedures or equipment.
