Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Platelet Disorders,
Comprehensive Gene Panel, Next-Generation Sequencing:
Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for
performing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for the detection of
variants in a comprehensive gene panel associated with platelet
disorders. This ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis phase of the NGS workflow for
platelet disorders, following the completion of specimen collection,
receipt, and accessioning. It is intended for all laboratory personnel
trained in NGS protocols and genomic data analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform NGS library preparation,
sequencing, and initial data analysis.
• Bioinformaticians: Conduct secondary and tertiary data analyses,
including variant calling and annotation.
• Laboratory Directors/Supervisors: Review and approve final
results, ensure compliance with quality control standards, and
oversee troubleshooting.
4. DEFINITIONS
• NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): A high-throughput method
used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA.
• Gene Panel: A test that examines multiple genes simultaneously
for mutations.
• PLATELET DISORDERS: A group of genetic conditions affecting
platelet function and production.
• QC (Quality Control): Procedures to ensure the accuracy and
precision of testing.
• Analytical Phase: The stage in laboratory testing where actual
analysis of specimen data is carried out.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Library Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract high-quality genomic DNA from blood samples using
a validated extraction kit.
◦ Quantify DNA using a Qubit fluorometer and assess purity
using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
2. DNA Fragmentation:
◦ Fragment DNA using enzymatic or mechanical shearing to
the target size.
◦ Check fragment size distribution using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer or similar instrument.
3. End-Repair, A-tailing, and Adapter Ligation:
◦ Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and ligation of sequencing
adapters according to the library preparation kit's
instructions.
◦ Purify adapter-ligated DNA using AMPure XP beads.
4. Library Amplification and Cleanup:
◦ Amplify the library using PCR and purify the amplified
product with AMPure XP beads.
◦ Assess library quality using an Agilent Bioanalyzer or
TapeStation.
5.2 Sequencing
1. Library Quantification:
◦ Quantify the library using a quantitative PCR (qPCR)
method.
◦ Normalize libraries to the required concentration for
sequencing.
2. Flow Cell Loading and Sequencing:
◦ Load the normalized library onto the sequencing flow cell
and run on the appropriate NGS platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion
Torrent).
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocols for sequencing.
3. Sequencing QC:
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for quality metrics such as
cluster density, Q30 scores, and overall yield.
◦ Perform troubleshooting if any metrics fall outside
acceptable ranges.
5.3 Data Analysis
1. Primary Data Analysis:
◦ Convert raw sequencing data (BCL files) to FASTQ files
using the sequencer's base-calling software.
◦ Perform initial quality control checks on FASTQ files using
tools such as FastQC.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align FASTQ reads to the human reference genome (hg19/
hg38) using an alignment tool such as BWA or Bowtie2.
◦ Sort, index, and remove duplicates from aligned reads using
SAMtools and Picard tools.
3. Variant Calling:
◦ Call variants using a variant caller such as GATK
HaplotypeCaller, FreeBayes, or VarScan.
◦ Annotate variants using a tool like ANNOVAR or SnpEff.
4. Variant Filtering and Interpretation:
◦ Filter variants based on allele frequency, read depth, and
quality scores.
◦ Classify variants using guidelines from sources like the
ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomics).
5.4 Quality Control
1. Internal QC:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of
sequencing to monitor for contamination and technical
variability.
◦ Reanalyze a subset of samples periodically to assess
reproducibility and accuracy.
2. Review and Validation:
◦ Have a secondary technologist or bioinformatician review
the data analysis and interpretation.
◦ Confirm significant or unexpected variants using an
orthogonal method such as Sanger sequencing.
5.5 Reporting Results
1. Report Generation:
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report including identified
variants, their clinical significance, and relevant
interpretative comments.
◦ Include information on the quality of the sequencing run and
any limitations of the test.
2. Result Verification:
◦ Have the laboratory director or a designated supervisor
review and approve the final report.
◦ Ensure that reports are communicated to the ordering
physician or directly input into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Record Keeping:
◦ Maintain thorough records of all steps in the analytical
phase, including raw data, intermediate files, and final
reports, for a specified retention period.
