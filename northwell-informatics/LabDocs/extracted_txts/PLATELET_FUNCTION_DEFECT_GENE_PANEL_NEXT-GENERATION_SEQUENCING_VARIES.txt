Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):
PLATELET FUNCTION DEFECT GENE PANEL, NEXT-
GENERATION SEQUENCING, VARIES
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to define the
standardized procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Platelet Function Defect Gene Panel using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS). This includes the steps for
sample preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and
interpretation. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the
analytical phase of the Platelet Function Defect Gene Panel
NGS tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for conducting this procedure as per the guidelines.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
process and addressing any issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING Specimens:
Peripheral blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes (Minimum
amount: 3 mL) Storage: Store blood samples at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately. DNA extracts can be stored at -20°C.
Acceptance Criteria: Properly labeled samples with requisition
forms. Samples must be fresh and not clotted. Rejection
Criteria: Unlabeled samples or samples from inappropriate
collection tubes, clotted samples, or samples with insufficient
quantity.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• Spectrophotometer/fluorometer for DNA quantification (e.g.,
NanoDrop)
• NGS library preparation kits specific for targeted gene panels
• Next-Generation Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or equivalent)
• Thermocycler for PCR amplification
• Reagents for library preparation, including adapters and primers
• PCR clean-up kits
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis (e.g., BWA, GATK, and
IGV)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction using a
suitable DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer/fluorometer.
3. DNA concentration should be a minimum of 10 ng/µL with A260/
A280 ratio between 1.8-2.0.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
6.2 Library Preparation
1. Perform NGS library preparation using a targeted gene panel
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure proper amplification and indexing of target regions.
3. Purify PCR products using appropriate clean-up kits.
4. Quantify the prepared library to ensure adequate concentration
for sequencing.
6.3 Sequencing
1. Load the prepared library on the NGS platform according to the
instrument’s guidelines.
2. Conduct sequencing using paired-end sequencing mode, if
applicable.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality parameters and potential
errors.
6.4 Data Analysis
1. FastQC: Perform initial quality control of the raw sequencing
data using FastQC software.
2. Alignment: Map the reads to the reference genome using BWA-
MEM or equivalent aligner.
3. Variant Calling: Perform variant calling using GATK or an
equivalent tool.
4. Annotation: Annotate identified variants using an appropriate
annotation tool (e.g., Annovar).
5. Filtering: Apply stringent filters to remove artifacts and low-
confidence variants.
6.5 Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the variant list for potential pathogenic mutations.
2. Compare results against known pathogenic variants in public
databases (e.g., ClinVar).
3. Interpret the clinical relevance of identified variants in relation to
platelet function defects.
4. Prepare a detailed report including the list of identified variants,
their clinical significance, and interpretations.
5. All reports should be verified by a qualified clinical geneticist or
molecular pathologist before release.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Include positive and negative controls in each sequencing run.
8. Validate the assay with known reference standards periodically.
9. Include inter- and intra-run reproducibility tests.
10. Document and investigate any discrepancies or anomalies in
sequencing data.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
12. Document all steps meticulously in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
13. Ensure proper documentation of sample receipt, DNA
extraction, library preparation, sequencing run details, and data
analysis.
14. Maintain records of digital and hard-copy reports including all
raw data and processed results.
15. Store all lab results and analyses according to regulatory
guidelines with appropriate security measures.

1. UPDATES AND REVISIONS This SOP will be reviewed
periodically to ensure it aligns with current best practices and
technological advancements. Any revisions will be documented,
and staff will be retrained accordingly.
