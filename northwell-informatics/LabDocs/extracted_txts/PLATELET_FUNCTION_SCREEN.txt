Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Platelet Function
Screen
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing a Platelet Function Screen to
evaluate platelet function disorders in patient samples accurately and
reliably.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
platelet function screen, interpret the results, and report findings in
compliance with this procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Sodium Citrate (3.2%) anticoagulated whole blood.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum Volume: 2.7 mL (one full Blue-top tube).
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Venipuncture technique must ensure minimal trauma to avoid
platelet activation.
• Tubes should be mixed gently by inverting 3-5 times immediately
after collection to avoid clotting.
• Specimens must be kept at room temperature and processed
within 4 hours of collection.
• Special note: Specimens must not be refrigerated or centrifuged
before testing.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Platelet Function Analyzer (e.g., PFA-100 or PFA-200)
• Timer
Supplies:
• CEPI (Collagen/Epinephrine) Cartridges
• CADP (Collagen/ADP) Cartridges
• Control materials (Normal and abnormal control)
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Power on the Platelet Function Analyzer and allow it to complete
its self-check and calibration process.
• Verify that CEPI and CADP cartridges have not expired and are
stored properly.
Quality Control:
• Before patient testing, run quality control samples (Normal and
abnormal control) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
Document the results on the Quality Control Log.
• If the quality control results are out of the acceptable range, do
not proceed with patient testing. Troubleshoot the issue,
recalibrate, or contact technical support if necessary.
Running the Test:
1. Mix the patient’s blood sample gently by inverting the tube.
2. Select the appropriate cartridge for the test. (CEPI or CADP).
3. Load the selected cartridge into the analyzer.
4. Using the blood sample tube, carefully draw up the required
volume into the sample holder.
5. Insert the sample pipette into the cartridge’s sample port,
ensuring a secure connection.
6. Press the “Start” button on the analyzer to begin the test.
Timing and Recording:
• The analyzer will measure and record the time in seconds until
the blood flow ceases (closure time).
• Document closure times for both CEPI and CADP cartridges in
the patient's test result log.
**If closure times are prolonged in both CEPI and CADP tests, it may
indicate a platelet function defect. If the abnormal result cannot be
interpreted based on the testing profile and clinical situation, repeat
testing should be considered and consult the laboratory supervisor.
Interpreting Results:
• Refer to the clinical reference range provided by the manufacturer
or established by the lab across different age groups or gender.
Typical closure times:
◦ CEPI: 85 – 165 seconds
◦ CADP: 65 – 130 seconds
• Prolonged closure time with CEPI and normal CADP suggests
aspirin or aspirin-like effects.
• Prolonged closure time for both CEPI and CADP suggests platelet
function disorder, anemia, or von Willebrand disease. Further
analysis such as full platelet aggregation studies may be
warranted.
Post-Analysis:
• Dispose of used cartridges and biological waste according to
biohazard protocols.
• Clean and maintain the analyzer as recommended by the
manufacturer.
• Ensure all test results are verified and reported in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). Any critical results requiring immediate
attention should be communicated to a healthcare provider
promptly.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the results and their accuracy through the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• All critical or abnormal results must be immediately reviewed and
communicated to the attending clinician or nurse.
• Reference ranges for platelets and a follow-up confirmation test
recommendation in case of abnormal closure time should be
noted in the report.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on the Platelet Function Analyzer as
per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document any troubleshooting, repairs, or preventive
maintenance efforts.
• Maintain a detailed record of all quality control results and actions
taken in response to out-of-range QC results.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Platelet Function Analyzer Manual.
• Laboratory protocols.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for platelet function testing.
8. MAINTENANCE LOG
• Record all equipment calibrations, cartridge lot numbers, control
runs, and any deviations encountered during operation in the
Maintenance Log.
By following this SOP rigorously, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate and reliable assessment of platelet function in patient
specimens, providing essential diagnostic information for the
management of hemostatic disorders.
