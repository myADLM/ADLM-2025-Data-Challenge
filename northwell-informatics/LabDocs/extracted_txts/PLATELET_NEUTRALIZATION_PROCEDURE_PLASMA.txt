Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Platelet
Neutralization Procedure (PNP) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for performing the
Platelet Neutralization Procedure (PNP) on plasma samples to
assess the presence of lupus anticoagulant.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all staff trained in the Platelet
Neutralization Procedure within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and ensuring the accuracy of the PNP.
• Supervisors must verify the competency of staff performing the
PNP and ensure adherence to the SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL plasma.
• Collection: Samples should be double-centrifuged to ensure
platelet-poor plasma. The first centrifugation should be done at
1500 x g for 15 minutes, and the second at 2500 x g for 15
minutes.
• Storage: Plasma should be tested within 4 hours of collection. If
the assay cannot be performed immediately, plasma should be
stored frozen at -70°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Platelet Lysate Reagent
• Lupus Anticoagulant Screening Reagent (e.g., dRVVT or APTT)
• Pipettes and Tips
• Test Tubes
• Timer
• Centrifuge
• Water Bath (37°C)
• Controls: Positive Control plasma known to contain lupus
anticoagulant, Negative Control plasma known to be free of lupus
anticoagulant.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Platelet Lysate
1. Obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from fresh whole blood by
centrifugation at 200 x g for 10 minutes.
2. Freeze-thaw the PRP several times until complete lysis is
achieved. This can be confirmed by the absence of intact
platelets via a microscope.
3. Aliquot the platelet lysate into sterile tubes and store at -70°C
until needed.
B. Platelet Neutralization Test
1. Thaw both the patient plasma and platelet lysate at 37°C prior
to testing.
2. Label a set of tubes: Test (T), Control (C), Positive Control (PC),
and Negative Control (NC).
3. Add 100 µL of patient plasma to both the test and control tubes.
4. Add 100 µL of Positive Control plasma to the Positive Control
tube, and 100 µL of Negative Control plasma to the Negative
Control tube.
5. To the Test tube, add 100 µL of thawed platelet lysate. To the
Control, Positive Control, and Negative Control tubes, add 100
µL of normal saline.
6. Incubate all tubes at 37°C for 10 minutes.
7. Following incubation, perform dRVVT or APTT on each sample
as per the standard procedure: a. Add the lupus anticoagulant
screening reagent to each tube. b. Add calcium chloride (if
necessary). c. Start the timer. d. Measure the clotting time.
C. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the clotting times of the Test and Control tubes for the
patient sample.
2. A significant reduction in clotting time in the presence of platelet
lysate (Test tube) compared to the Control tube indicates the
presence of lupus anticoagulant.
3. Validate the results by ensuring the Positive Control indicates
prolonged clotting time, and the Negative Control shows normal
clotting time.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure quality control is performed with each run by including
positive and negative controls.
• Control results must fall within established acceptable ranges.
• If controls are out of range, repeat the assay. If repeated failure
occurs, notify the supervisor and do not report patient results until
the issue is resolved.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter clotting times for the Test and Control tubes in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Interpret based on the SOP-specific criteria for lupus
anticoagulant presence.
• Notify the physician if a lupus anticoagulant is detected, following
laboratory critical value reporting policies.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Established based on laboratory validations and the specific
reagent package insert guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples, icteric samples, or samples with visible clots
must be rejected.
• High levels of anticoagulants other than lupus anticoagulant could
affect assay results.
• Platelet contamination in plasma could result in false-negative
findings.
