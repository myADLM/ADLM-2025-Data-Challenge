Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
PLATELET PLA1 ANTIGEN GENOTYPE, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Platelet PLA1 Antigen Genotype from
blood specimens. This includes steps for DNA extraction,
amplification of the PLA1 locus using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR), genotyping using specific assays, and result interpretation.
Responsibility:
All staff involved in molecular genetic testing are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable results. The
supervisor and laboratory manager must ensure the procedure is
performed and documented correctly and that corrective actions are
taken if necessary.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
• Blood tubes containing EDTA (specimens)
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents (e.g., Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific for
PLA1 locus)
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• Electrophoresis apparatus and reagents
• Genotyping assays (e.g., RFLP, TaqMan SNP Genotyping
Assays)
• Microcentrifuge tubes and pipettes
• Gel documentation system
• Laboratory notebook or electronic data management system
3. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Specimen Preparation
◦ Receive and verify blood samples and accession data.
◦ Store blood samples at 2-8°C if not immediately processed.
2. Extraction Process
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Elute DNA into a final volume of 50-100 µL of elution buffer.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Record-keeping
◦ Document DNA concentration and purity.
◦ Label and store extracted DNA at -20°C or lower until use.
B. PCR Amplification of PLA1 Locus
1. Reaction Preparation
◦ Prepare PCR master mix including Taq polymerase, dNTPs,
primers, buffer, and MgCl2 as per the optimization protocols.
◦ Add an appropriate amount of DNA template (e.g., 50-100
ng).
2. Thermal Cycling Conditions
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
3. Runtime and Documentation
◦ Run the PCR and document the reaction conditions.
◦ Store PCR products at 4°C or -20°C until further analysis.
C. Genotyping
1. Genotyping Assay (Example: RFLP or TaqMan Assay)
◦ Follow the instructions provided with the specific genotyping
assay.
◦ If using RFLP, digest PCR products with restriction enzyme,
followed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel.
◦ If using TaqMan assay, prepare the reaction mix and run on
a real-time PCR machine.
2. Result Analysis
◦ Analyze the gel or RT-PCR data according to the assay
instructions.
◦ Compare band patterns or fluorescence curves to control
and reference standards to determine genotype.
D. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Result Validation
◦ Validate the results by confirming with a second method or
replication if necessary.
◦ Input results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Result Documentation
◦ Compile results into patient reports including genotype
interpretation.
◦ Ensure all documentation is complete, including any
anomalies and corrective actions.
3. Storage and Record-keeping
◦ Store patient data and results securely, ensuring
confidentiality.
◦ Archive used reagents, PCR products, and other materials
in compliance with laboratory protocols.
E. Quality Control
1. Controls
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each PCR and
genotyping batch.
◦ Document control results and criteria for acceptance.
2. Quality Assurance
◦ Perform regular equipment calibration and maintenance.
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing for PLA1
genotyping.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
• PLA1/PLA1 homozygous: PLA1 positive
• PLA1/PLA2 heterozygous: PLA1 carrier
• PLA2/PLA2 homozygous: PLA1 negative
Refer to the latest guidelines from relevant professional organizations
for genotype-phenotype correlations.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential contamination can lead to false results. Strict aseptic
techniques must be followed.
• PCR inhibitors in the blood can affect the amplification. Ensure
proper DNA extraction and purification.
