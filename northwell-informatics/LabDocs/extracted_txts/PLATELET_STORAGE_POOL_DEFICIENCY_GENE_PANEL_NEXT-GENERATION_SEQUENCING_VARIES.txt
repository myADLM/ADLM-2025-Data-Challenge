Standard Operating Procedure
PLATELET STORAGE POOL DEFICIENCY GENE PANEL, NEXT-
GENERATION SEQUENCING
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of next-
generation sequencing (NGS) to identify variants in genes associated
with platelet storage pool deficiency (PSPD). This SOP ensures the
accurate and efficient generation of results that can be used for
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes.
Responsibility:
• Clinical Laboratory Scientists (CLS) performing the assay.
• Laboratory Technologists responsible for equipment maintenance
and quality control.
• Supervisors overseeing the testing process and result validation.
2. DEFINITION
This protocol outlines the steps to be followed in preparing DNA
libraries, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis for detecting
genetic variants associated with platelet storage pool deficiency
using NGS technology.
3. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction and Quantification:
Objective: To isolate high-quality DNA from the patient’s blood
sample.
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Use a blood sample already collected, received, and
accessioned.
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C until processing.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the instructions provided with the DNA extraction kit
(e.g., Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit).
◦ Ensure to include a negative extraction control to monitor for
contamination.
3. DNA Quantification and Quality Assessment:
◦ Quantify DNA using fluorometric methods (e.g., Qubit) and
assess purity using spectrophotometric methods (e.g.,
NanoDrop).
◦ Ensure the concentration is between 20-50 ng/µL and the
A260/A280 ratio is between 1.8-2.0.
B) Library Preparation:
Objective: To prepare sequencing-ready libraries from input DNA.
1. Target Enrichment:
◦ Use a PSPD gene panel target enrichment kit (e.g., Agilent
SureSelect).
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for hybridization and
capture.
2. Library Construction:
◦ Perform end-repair and adapter ligation as per the kit
instructions.
◦ Purify the libraries using magnetic beads (e.g., AMPure XP).
3. Library Quantification and Quality Control:
◦ Quantify libraries using qPCR, or a bioanalyzer to ensure
proper sizing and concentration.
◦ Ensure library concentration is within the required range for
sequencing.
C) Next-Generation Sequencing:
Objective: To sequence the prepared libraries using an NGS platform.
1. Sequencing Setup:
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencing instrument
(e.g., Illumina MiSeq, HiSeq).
◦ Configure the run parameters according to the
manufacturer's recommendations and desired coverage.
2. Run Monitoring and Quality Assurance:
◦ Monitor the sequencing run to ensure proper performance.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in the sequencing
run.
D) Data Analysis:
Objective: To analyze sequencing data and identify genetic variants.
1. Data Preprocessing:
◦ Demultiplex the sequencing reads and perform quality
filtering using appropriate software (e.g., FASTQ).
◦ Trim adapter sequences and low-quality bases using quality
control tools (e.g., Trimmomatic).
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align trimmed reads to the reference genome (e.g.,
GRCh38) using a reliable aligner (e.g., BWA).
◦ Perform variant calling using a validated pipeline (e.g.,
GATK).
3. Annotation and Interpretation:
◦ Annotate detected variants using an annotation tool (e.g.,
Annovar) to identify their impact and clinical relevance.
◦ Compare identified variants against known databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD).
E) Reporting Results:
Objective: To generate a comprehensive report of identified variants.
1. Variant Review:
◦ Perform a manual review of significant variants by a CLS
and a clinical geneticist.
◦ Verify the presence of variants using orthogonal methods if
necessary (e.g., Sanger sequencing).
2. Report Generation:
◦ Compile a detailed report including detected variants, their
clinical significance, and recommended follow-up actions.
◦ Ensure the report is reviewed and signed off by a qualified
clinical geneticist.
3. Result Communication:
◦ Deliver the final report to the ordering physician using
secure methods according to laboratory policy.
◦ Ensure proper documentation and archiving of the test
results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Maintain and calibrate equipment as per manufacturer guidelines
and laboratory policies.
• Include quality control samples in each run to monitor
performance.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions
taken.
5. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer manuals for DNA extraction kits, library preparation
kits, and NGS platforms.
• Clinical guidelines for NGS-based variant analysis and reporting
(e.g., ACMG standards).
6. DOCUMENTS AND FORMS
• DNA extraction log.
• Library preparation log.
• Sequencing run log.
• Variant review and interpretation form.
• Final test report template.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
incorporate new methodologies and technologies.
