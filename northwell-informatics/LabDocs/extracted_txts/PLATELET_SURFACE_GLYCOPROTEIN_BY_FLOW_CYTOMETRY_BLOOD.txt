PROTOCOL
PLATELET SURFACE GLYCOPROTEIN BY FLOW CYTOMETRY,
BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the steps involved in generating results for platelet surface
glycoprotein analysis by flow cytometry in a blood sample. This
includes specimen preparation, staining, acquisition, data analysis,
and reporting. This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and
reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for all steps outlined in this
procedure, including specimen preparation, staining, flow cytometry
acquisition, and data analysis. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the procedure and ensuring all steps are performed
correctly and any issues are addressed promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Platelet surface glycoproteins are critical markers used to evaluate
platelet function and are analyzed by flow cytometry to detect
abnormalities or to monitor conditions such as platelet function
disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Collection:
• Preferred sample: 3-5 mL of peripheral blood collected in an
EDTA or citrated tube.
• Specimen must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
• Keep and transport the specimen at room temperature, do not
refrigerate to avoid platelet activation.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted samples.
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples collected in heparin.
• Specimens older than 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Flow cytometer calibrated and validated for platelet analysis.
• Fluorescently labeled antibodies specific to platelet surface
glycoproteins (e.g., CD41, CD42b, CD61, etc.)
• Appropriate isotype controls.
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline).
• Red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer.
• Fixative solution (e.g., 1% formaldehyde in PBS).
• Tubes for flow cytometry (e.g., polypropylene or polystyrene
tubes).
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Initial Handling:
◦ Gently invert the blood collection tube to mix. Avoid vigorous
shaking to prevent platelet activation.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Aliquot 100 μL of well-mixed whole blood into each flow
cytometry tube.
B) Staining:
1. Antibody Binding:
◦ Add appropriate volume (as per manufacturer instructions)
of each fluorescently labeled antibody to the aliquoted
blood.
◦ Include isotype controls for each antibody used.
◦ Vortex gently to mix and incubate for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature in the dark.
2. RBC Lysis:
◦ Add 1-2 mL of RBC lysis buffer to each tube and incubate
for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
◦ Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes and aspirate
supernatant.
◦ Wash cells by adding 2 mL of PBS, centrifuge at 300 x g for
5 minutes, and aspirate supernatant.
◦ Repeat wash step twice.
3. Fixation (if necessary):
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in 200-500 μL of fixative solution.
◦ Store samples at 4°C in the dark until acquisition (within 24
hours).
C) Flow Cytometry Acquisition:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the flow cytometer and perform system checks
(e.g., calibration, compensation).
◦ Set up the flow cytometer for platelet analysis with the
appropriate voltage and gating strategy.
2. Sample Acquisition:
◦ Run each sample tube on the flow cytometer.
◦ Acquire a sufficient number of events for accurate analysis
(e.g., 10,000-20,000 platelets).
D) Data Analysis:
1. Initial Gating:
◦ Use forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) to gate on
the platelet population.
◦ Apply fluorescence gates based on the isotype controls to
determine positive staining.
2. Marker Expression:
◦ Analyze the data to determine the expression levels of the
platelet surface glycoproteins.
3. Data Interpretation:
◦ Evaluate the data and compare with reference ranges and
clinical histories to identify any abnormalities.
E) Reporting:
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Review and verify the results.
◦ Document findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Critical Values and Comments:
◦ If critical values are identified, immediately notify the treating
physician and document the communication.
◦ Include interpretative comments as necessary.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Controls:
◦ Utilize positive and negative controls for each antibody
used.
◦ Run and analyze controls concurrently with patient samples.
5. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Perform daily calibration checks and maintain
documentation.
◦ Validate flow cytometer settings regularly.
6. Reagent Verification:
◦ Check reagent expiration dates and store reagents as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Verify the performance of new reagent lots by running
parallel tests with established reagents.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of waste materials as per biohazard regulations.
8. PROCEDURE DEVIATIONS
• Any deviations from this SOP must be documented, and the
laboratory supervisor should be notified immediately.
