Protocol for Platelet Transmission Electron
Microscopic Study in Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the analytical
method for conducting a platelet transmission electron microscopic
(TEM) study using whole blood. The procedure ensures accurate and
reproducible results to aid in the diagnosis of platelet disorders and
structural abnormalities.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to perform and
document all steps of the TEM analysis. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that all staff are adequately trained and that
the equipment is properly maintained.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
• Ultracentrifuge
• Fixatives (e.g., glutaraldehyde, osmium tetroxide)
• Dehydration reagents (ethanol series, acetone)
• Embedding materials (e.g., epoxy resin)
• Microtome with diamond knife
• Copper grids
• Staining reagents (e.g., uranyl acetate, lead citrate)
• Fine forceps
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA
or citrate anticoagulant. The sample must be processed within 2
hours of collection to preserve platelet morphology.
• Volume: Minimum of 5 mL of whole blood.
• Storage and Transport: Maintain the specimen at room
temperature and avoid vigorous shaking to prevent platelet
activation.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Primary Fixation:
1. Gently mix the whole blood sample by inversion (5-10 times).
2. Aliquot approximately 1 mL of whole blood into a labeled
centrifuge tube.
3. Add an equal volume of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) to the blood. Mix gently by inversion.
4. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour to allow primary
fixation.
B) Post-Fixation:
1. Centrifuge the fixed blood at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully remove the supernatant and add 1% osmium
tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer to the pellet.
3. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.
C) Dehydration:
1. Sequentially dehydrate the sample in graded ethanol solutions
(30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%). Each step should take 10
minutes.
2. Perform two final rinses in 100% acetone for 10 minutes each.
D) Embedding:
1. Infiltrate the dehydrated specimen with epoxy resin and allow it
to penetrate for several hours or overnight.
2. Transfer the specimen into embedding molds filled with fresh
epoxy resin.
3. Polymerize the resin at 60°C for 24 hours.
E) Sectioning:
1. Trim the embedded block using a razor blade to expose the
area of interest.
2. Cut ultrathin sections (50-70 nm) using an ultramicrotome with
a diamond knife.
3. Collect the sections on copper grids.
F) Staining:
1. Stain the sections on the grids with uranyl acetate for 15
minutes.
2. Rinse with distilled water.
3. Stain with lead citrate for 5 minutes.
4. Rinse thoroughly with distilled water.
G) TEM Examination:
1. Load the stained grids into the TEM.
2. Adjust the microscope settings as required for optimal
visualization of platelets.
3. Capture images of representative fields, focusing on platelet
ultrastructure.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of the TEM as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Include control samples with known abnormalities to verify
staining and imaging quality.
• Document all observations and instrument settings used.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings including platelet count, morphology, any
observed defects or abnormalities in ultrastructure.
• Report images and findings using site-specific templates and
guidelines.
• Ensure all data is peer-reviewed by a senior technologist prior to
releasing the final report.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Artifacts caused by improper fixation, dehydration, embedding, or
sectioning can affect results.
• Results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical history and
other laboratory findings.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal platelet ultrastructure should include intact membrane
systems, normal alpha granules, and dense granules.
• Reference ranges may vary based on specific diagnostic criteria
and instrument calibration.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to the Transmission Electron Microscopy User Manual for
detailed operational guidelines.
• Consult relevant peer-reviewed literature for baseline platelet
ultrastructure descriptions and common abnormalities.
This protocol ensures thorough examination of platelet morphology
using TEM, aiding in the diagnosis of platelet dysfunction and related
hematological disorders.
