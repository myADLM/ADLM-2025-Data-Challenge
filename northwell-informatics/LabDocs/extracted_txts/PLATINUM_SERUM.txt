Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Protocol for
Measuring Platinum in Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for accurately measuring and generating results for platinum in
serum samples. This includes the operation of equipment, use
of reagents, and maintenance of quality control measures to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for adhering to this protocol. It is the responsibility of laboratory
supervisors to ensure that staff are appropriately trained and that all
steps are followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN 2.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 5 mL serum collected in a trace-element free, clot activator tube
(royal blue-top).
• Specimen should be centrifuged and the serum separated from
cells within 2 hours of collection.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in tubes containing additives that interfere with
metal analysis.
• Specimens not separated from cells within 2 hours.
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens arriving without proper labeling or with damaged
containers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES 3.1 Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
other metal-specific analytical instrument.
• Centrifuge.
• Trace-element free pipettes and tips.
• Refrigerated storage unit.
3.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• Calibration standards for platinum.
• Quality control materials with known concentrations of platinum.
• Nitric acid for sample digestion (high purity).
• Deionized water (ASTM Type I water).
1. PROCEDURE 4.1 Sample Preparation:
2. Allow serum samples to come to room temperature.
3. Using a trace-element free pipette, transfer 0.5 mL of serum
into a clean, trace-element free digestion vessel.
4. Add 2.0 mL of high-purity nitric acid to the serum to begin
digestion.
5. Cap the digestion vessel and place it in a digestion block at
90°C for 2 hours or until the sample is completely digested.
6. Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
7. Dilute the digested sample with deionized water to a final
volume of 10.0 mL.
4.2 Calibration and Instrument Setup:
1. Prepare calibration standards ranging from 0.1 ppb to 100 ppb
platinum using certified reference material.
2. Perform instrument tuning and calibration according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Validate calibration curves by analyzing known concentration
quality control samples.
4.3 Sample Analysis:
1. Load the diluted, digested serum samples into the ICP-MS
autosampler.
2. Begin the analysis sequence, ensuring that calibration
standards and quality controls are interspersed throughout the
sample run.
3. Use the instrument software to automatically calculate the
concentration of platinum in each serum sample based on the
calibration curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL 5.1 Internal Quality Controls:
• Run two levels of internal quality control samples (low and high
concentration) at the beginning and end of each analytical run.
• These results should fall within ±2 standard deviations of the
target values. Document any deviations and take corrective
actions as needed.
5.2 External Quality Controls:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for trace
elements.
• Review and document external quality control results and
implement corrective actions for any identified issues.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Report concentrations of platinum in serum in µg/L.
3. Review all QC data and ensure criteria are met before verifying
patient results.
4. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for reporting.
5. Any critical values should be promptly communicated to the
requesting physician as per the lab’s critical result notification
policy.

This SOP ensures that results for platinum in serum are accurate,
reliable, and in line with all regulatory requirements and best
laboratory practices.
