Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
PROTOCAL FOR ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR PLUM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standard procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for PLUM (Plumbum or
Lead), IgE (Immunoglobulin E), and serum tests to ensure accuracy,
precision, and consistency in results. This SOP ensures adherence to
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
steps outlined in this procedure.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing
compliance and addressing any issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
A. Specimen type:
• Blood samples collected in a designated serum separator tube
(SST) for serum analysis.
B. Specimen handling:
• Immediately after collection, allow the blood to clot by leaving it
undisturbed for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 2500-3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum to a labeled secondary specimen container
using a disposable pipette, avoiding any transfer of cellular
components.
• Store the serum specimen at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours; freeze at -20°C for long-term storage.
1. ANALYTICAL EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
A. Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes
• ELISA Reader for IgE
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer for PLUM
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer for Serum Analysis
B. Reagents:
• ELISA kits specific for IgE analysis
• Calibration standards and controls for PLUM analysis
• Appropriate chemistry reagents for serum analysis
1. PROCEDURE
A. PLUM Analysis (Lead):
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer as per
manufacturer’s instructions using lead standards.
◦ Run the calibration verification standards.
2. Analysis:
◦ Dilute the serum sample as required.
◦ Aspirate the sample into the Atomic Absorption
Spectrophotometer.
◦ Measure and record the absorbance.
◦ Use calibration curve to determine lead concentration in the
sample.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples (High, Medium, Low) along with patient
samples.
◦ Record and verify that QC results fall within the acceptable
range.
B. IgE Analysis:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards and control solutions
according to the ELISA kit instructions.
◦ Run initial calibration standards.
2. Analysis:
◦ Pipette the serum samples and controls into designated
wells in the ELISA plate.
◦ Follow the ELISA kit instructions for incubation, washing,
and reagent addition.
◦ Read the plate using an ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength.
3. Calculation:
◦ Generate the standard curve by plotting the average
absorbance for each standard on the y-axis against the
concentration on the x-axis.
◦ Determine the IgE concentration in the sample by
interpolating from the standard curve.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Include QC samples in each run to ensure result reliability.
◦ Document and review QC results before proceeding with
sample analysis.
C. Serum Analysis:
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the Automated Chemistry Analyzer with the
appropriate chemistry reagents.
◦ Perform initial calibration verification.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the serum samples into the designated sample cups or
racks.
◦ Select the appropriate serum tests (e.g., liver panel, renal
panel, electrolytes) on the analyzer.
◦ Run the analysis as per the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Use multi-level QC material to assess the performance of
the analyzer.
◦ Verify that QC results are within specified limits before
reporting patient results.
4. RESULT REPORTING
• Ensure all patient data are accurately and completely entered into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review all results for flags, errors, or critical values that require
immediate attention.
• Document corrective actions if quality control results indicate an
error.
• Report any critical values immediately to the attending physician
or relevant healthcare provider following departmental guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records of instrument calibration, maintenance, QC
runs, and patient results in compliance with CLIA standards.
• Record all corrective actions and deviations from the protocol in
the laboratory log.
