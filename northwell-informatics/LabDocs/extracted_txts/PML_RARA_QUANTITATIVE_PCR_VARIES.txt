Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PML::RARA
Quantitative PCR Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for the quantitative
detection of PML::RARA fusion gene by real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) in clinical specimens for the diagnosis and monitoring
of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
quantitative analysis of PML::RARA fusion gene using real-time PCR.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the quantitative PCR in accordance with this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor ensures that the procedure is followed
correctly and that necessary maintenance, calibration, and quality
control activities for the equipment are conducted as required.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Accepted Specimens: - Peripheral blood - Bone marrow aspirates
4.2 Specimen Collection and Handling: - Collect specimens in EDTA
anticoagulant tubes (lavender top). - Process specimens within 24
hours of collection. If delayed, store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. -
Label specimens clearly with patient’s identifiers and collection
details.
4.3 Specimen Transport: - Transport specimens at 2-8°C. Ensure
specimens are not frozen or exposed to extreme temperatures.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, LightCycler)
• PCR primers and probes specific for PML::RARA fusion gene
• PCR master mix (commercially available)
• Nucleic acid extraction kit
• Positive and negative control templates
• Pipettes and tips (sterile and filtered)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Thermocycler
• Nuclease-free water
• Optical 96-well reaction plates and adhesive seals
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Nucleic Acid Extraction: - Extract total RNA from peripheral blood
or bone marrow specimens using the appropriate extraction kit. -
Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Validate the quality and
quantity of extracted RNA using spectrophotometry or fluorometry.
6.2 cDNA Synthesis: - Synthesize cDNA using a reverse
transcriptase kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - Use
1000 ng of total RNA in a 20 µL reaction.
6.3 Real-Time PCR Setup: - Prepare the PCR reaction mix according
to the manufacturer's instructions. - Prepare the following reaction
mix for each sample: - 10 µL of 2X PCR master mix - Primers and
probe mix (final concentration as per manufacturer’s instruction) - 2
µL of cDNA - Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 20 µL
6.4 Plate Setup: - Aliquot the reaction mix into the wells of a 96-well
optical reaction plate. - Include negative and positive controls in each
run. - Seal the plate with an optical adhesive cover and centrifuge
briefly to ensure all contents are at the bottom of the wells.
6.5 PCR Cycling Conditions: - Load the plate into the real-time PCR
instrument. - Set up the PCR program as follows: - Initial
denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes - Amplification (40 cycles): -
Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds - Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1
minute
6.6 Data Acquisition and Analysis: - Select the appropriate
fluorescence detection channels (e.g., FAM for target detection). -
Analyze the PCR data using the instrument’s software. - Calculate
the PML::RARA fusion gene copy number based on the standard
curve generated from the positive controls.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Results should be expressed as the number of PML::RARA fusion
gene copies normalized to the input cDNA.
• Perform duplicate or triplicate runs to ensure reliability.
• Report as a quantitative value if the sample is positive.
• Include comments for inconclusive or negative results.
• Ensure that results are documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and reviewed by the laboratory supervisor before
releasing.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Include positive and negative control samples in each run.
• Regularly perform instrument calibration and maintenance as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs if available.
• Ensure compliance with laboratory accreditation standards (e.g.,
CLIA, CAP).
