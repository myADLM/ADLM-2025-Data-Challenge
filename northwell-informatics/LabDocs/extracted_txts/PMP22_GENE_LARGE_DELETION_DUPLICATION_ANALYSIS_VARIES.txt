Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for PMP22 Gene, Large Deletion/Duplication
Analysis, using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification
(MLPA) and/or other suitable methods.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel, including
Molecular Genetic Technologists and Laboratory Scientists, to
perform the analytic procedures in compliance with this SOP. Any
deviations or unexpected occurrences must be documented and
reported to the supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS

duplication analysis.
ii. MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification): A
method used for detecting large deletions and duplications in
genomic DNA.

6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Prepare blood samples for DNA extraction using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for the extraction process.
◦ Quantify the DNA using a suitable method (e.g., Nanodrop).
2. Quality Check:
◦ Verify the purity and concentration of the DNA. The purity
(A260/A280) should be between 1.8 and 2.0. Record the
concentration and purity.
B. MLPA Setup:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice and prepare the MLPA Master Mix
on a clean bench to avoid contamination.
2. Denaturation and Hybridization:
◦ Aliquot 5 µL of genomic DNA (50-100 ng) to each PCR tube.
◦ Add 4 µL of MLPA buffer and 1 µL of MLPA probe mix to
each tube containing the DNA.
◦ Heat the samples to 98°C for 5 minutes for denaturation.
◦ Incubate at 60°C for 16 hours for probe hybridization.
3. Ligation and Amplification:
◦ Add 32 µL of ligation mixture to each tube and incubate at
54°C for 15 minutes.
◦ Add 10 µL of ligase-65 and incubate at 54°C for 15 minutes
followed by 98°C for 5 minutes to inactivate the ligase.
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction by adding 10 µL of MLPA PCR
buffer mix to each tube.
◦ Perform PCR cycles as follows: 35 cycles of 95°C for 30
seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 60 seconds,
followed by a final extension at 72°C for 20 minutes.
4. Capillary Electrophoresis:
◦ Conduct capillary electrophoresis using an appropriate
system to separate and detect the amplified products.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Software Analysis:
◦ Transfer the electropherogram data to the software specified
for MLPA data analysis.
◦ Analyze the peak patterns corresponding to the probes in
the PMP22 gene. Ensure that the quality control metrics
pass their thresholds.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Compare the pattern from the test sample to the control to
identify duplications or deletions in the PMP22 gene.
◦ Record all findings including any observed duplications or
deletions.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Regularly run positive and negative controls with each batch
of samples to ensure assay performance.
◦ Document and address any deviations from the expected
control outcomes.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Result Verification:
◦ The laboratory technologist reviews the raw data and
software analysis for accuracy.
◦ Abnormal results should be confirmed by a second
technologist.
2. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Transcribe results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report including genetic
interpretation and clinical significance.
◦ Ensure that all results are reviewed and authorized by a
supervising clinical molecular geneticist.
3. Critical Results:
◦ Any findings indicative of significant genetic alterations (e.g.,
deletions/duplications related to PMP22) must be reported
immediately to the requesting physician and documented
accordingly.
7. LIMITATIONS
1. MLPA may not detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
or smaller indels.
2. Pseudogenes or other highly homologous regions may interfere
with analysis.
