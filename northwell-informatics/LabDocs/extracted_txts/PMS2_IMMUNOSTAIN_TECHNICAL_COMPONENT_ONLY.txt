Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) PMS2 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for performing the technical
component of PMS2 immunostaining on tissue samples to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the PMS2 immunostain procedure following this protocol.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any deviations.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections. Specimen Preparation: Section tissue at 4-5 microns and
mount on positively charged slides. Specimen Storage: Slides should
be stored at room temperature and processed within one week of
sectioning.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Primary Antibody: Anti-PMS2 antibody. Detection System:
Appropriate detection kit (e.g., polymer-based detection system).
Substrate-Chromogen: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) or equivalent.
Counterstain: Hematoxylin. Mounting Medium: Permanent mounting
medium. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Incubation chamber
• Heat source (oven or hot plate)
• Deparaffinization and rehydration reagents (xylene, ethanol,
distilled water)
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) solution (e.g., citrate buffer
pH 6.0)
• Humidity chamber
• Microscope
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Deparaffinization
1. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure tissue adherence.
2. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in three changes of xylene, 5
minutes each.
3. Rehydrate through a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%)
and finish with distilled water.
B) Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a preheated HIER solution (citrate buffer, pH
6.0).
2. Perform antigen retrieval using a pressure cooker or microwave
for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution to room
temperature.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS).
C) Immunostaining
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in TBS.
3. Apply the primary antibody (Anti-PMS2) and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature in a humidity chamber.
4. Rinse slides in TBS.
5. Apply the detection reagent (polymer-based) and incubate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Rinse slides in TBS.
7. Apply substrate-chromogen (DAB) and incubate until desired
color intensity develops (typically 5-10 minutes).
8. Rinse in distilled water.
D) Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse in running tap water.
3. Dehydrate through a graded ethanol series (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene.
4. Mount with permanent mounting medium and cover with a
coverslip.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include a positive control (known PMS2-positive tissue) and a
negative control (omission of the primary antibody) with each
batch of slides.
2. Examine QC slides to ensure expected staining patterns before
reporting results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are technical only and do not include interpretation.
2. Provide stained slides and corresponding QC slides to the
pathologist for evaluation.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for Anti-PMS2 antibody and detection
kit.
• Laboratory internal QC protocols for immunohistochemistry.
9. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain a log of all processed slides, including specimen IDs,
processing dates, and technologist initials.
