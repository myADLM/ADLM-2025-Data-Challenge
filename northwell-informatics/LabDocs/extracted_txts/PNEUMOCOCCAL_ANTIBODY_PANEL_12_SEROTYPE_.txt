Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PNEUMOCOCCAL
ANTIBODY PANEL (12 SEROTYPE)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for PNEUMOCOCCAL ANTIBODY PANEL (12
SEROTYPE) tests in the CLIA-certified laboratory. This SOP ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results in clinical diagnostics.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator
tube (SST) and allowed to clot at room temperature
(20-26°C) for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
◦ Centrifugation: Centrifuge the tube within 2 hours of
collection at 1,300 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
◦ Storage: Store serum at 2-8°C if testing is to be performed
within 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA reader capable of 450 nm and 620/630 nm readings
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Pipettes (single and multichannel)
◦ Tips (sterile, filter)
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pneumococcal Antibody Panel kit (approved for clinical use)
◦ Calibrated timer
◦ Absorbent paper
Kit Components:
• 12 serotype-specific antigen-coated microplates or strips
• Wash buffer concentrate
• Sample diluent
• Conjugate
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution
• Positive and negative controls
• Calibrator
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(20-26°C) before use.
2. Dilute the wash buffer concentrate with distilled water as
per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare the working solution of conjugate and substrate
according to the kit insert.
B. Sample and Control Preparation:
1. Dilute the serum samples, positive control, negative
control, and calibrator in the sample diluent (usually 1:100
or as specified by the manufacturer).
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Microplate Preparation:
▪ Allocate wells for controls, calibrators, and patient
samples as per the plate layout.
▪ In duplicate, add 100 μL of diluted calibrator, controls,
and patient samples to the appropriate wells.
2. Incubation:
▪ Cover the plate with adhesive seal.
▪ Incubate at 37°C for the time specified by the kit
instructions (usually 1 hour).
3. Washing:
▪ After incubation, remove the adhesive seal and
aspirate the contents of the wells.
▪ Wash the wells 3-5 times using the diluted wash
buffer. Ensure each well is filled and aspirated
completely.
4. Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add 100 μL of the prepared conjugate to each well.
▪ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for the specified
time (usually 30 minutes).
5. Washing:
▪ Repeat the washing step as described above.
6. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for
15-20 minutes or until the desired color intensity
develops.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
▪ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to terminate
the reaction. The stop solution typically changes the
color from blue to yellow.
8. Reading the Plate:
▪ Read the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference filter
at 620/630 nm within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
2. RESULT CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Plot the calibrator absorbance values against their
corresponding concentrations to construct a standard curve.
◦ Determine the concentration of pneumococcal antibodies in
the patient samples by comparing their absorbance to the
standard curve.
◦ Express results in μg/mL or other appropriate units
according to the kit insert.
Reference Ranges:
• Interpret positive, negative, or equivocal results in accordance
with the manufacturer’s guidelines and established clinical
thresholds.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
the assay’s validity.
◦ The assay run is valid if the controls are within the
acceptable ranges provided by the kit insert.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective actions if
controls are out of range.
2. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If the assay controls do not meet the acceptable criteria,
repeat the assay ensuring strict adherence to temperature,
timing, and procedure steps.
◦ Inspect pipettes and other equipment for accuracy and
proper functioning.
◦ Ensure proper washing to avoid cross-contamination or
carryover.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system.
◦ Review results for accuracy and validate by authorized
personnel before releasing.
◦ Critical results or significant findings should be
communicated to the requesting clinician immediately.
4. LIMITATIONS
◦ Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination
may affect results.
◦ Immunocompromised patients or those undergoing
immunosuppressive therapy may show altered antibody
levels.
