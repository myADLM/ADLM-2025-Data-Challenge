STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for Generating Results for Pneumocystis
(Direct Fluorescent Antibody, DFA)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the detection and quantification of Pneumocystis jirovecii using Direct
Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) staining in clinical specimens. These
procedures are designed to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel certified to perform DFA staining and analysis
are responsible for executing this protocol. It is the responsibility of all
staff to adhere to this SOP and report any deviations or issues that
may affect test results to the designated supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
• Induced sputum
• Tracheal aspirate
• Lung biopsy tissue
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated
• Specimens received outside the acceptable time frame for
collection and processing
• Specimens visibly contaminated or clotted
Specimen Storage:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 24
hours of collection.
Handling Precautions:
• Specimens should be handled with standard biosafety
precautions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
Reagents:
• DFA reagent specific for Pneumocystis jirovecii (commercially
available kit)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Cover slips
• Fine-tipped marker
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Turn on the fluorescence microscope and allow to warm up.
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature and check expiry
dates.
Staining Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 2000 RPM for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully decant the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1
mL PBS.
◦ Place a drop of resuspended pellet onto a labeled glass
slide.
◦ Spread the sample thinly using a sterile pipette tip and allow
it to air dry.
2. Staining:
◦ Apply DFA reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions directly onto the dried specimen on the slide.
◦ Incubate for the specified time (usually 30-60 minutes as per
product insert).
◦ Rinse the slide gently with PBS to remove excess staining
reagent.
◦ Apply mounting medium and cover slip.
Microscopy Examination:
• Observe the stained slide under the fluorescence microscope
using appropriate filter settings.
• Examine for the presence of characteristic bright apple-green
fluorescing cysts of Pneumocystis jirovecii.
• Count and document organisms per field (at least 10 fields should
be checked).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC Procedures:
• Include a known positive control sample and a negative control
with each batch of specimens stained.
• Document control results in the QC log.
• If controls fail, troubleshoot according to the QC failure protocol
and do not release patient results until QC issues are resolved.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Interpretation:
• Positive Result: Presence of characteristic apple-green
fluorescing cysts of Pneumocystis jirovecii.
• Negative Result: Absence of Pneumocystis jirovecii cysts.
Documentation:
• Record findings, including the number of organisms per field and
any other relevant observations.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by a senior technologist.
• Ensure critical results are communicated directly to the requesting
physician as per laboratory policy.
Reference Ranges:
• Pneumocystis Result: Positive or Negative for Pneumocystis
jirovecii.
Critical Values:
• Immediate notification to the physician if a positive result is
obtained, indicating a potential active infection requiring
intervention.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The sensitivity of the DFA method may vary based on specimen
quality and staining technique. Negative results do not rule out
infection.
• Ensure that all reagents and equipment are functioning optimally
to avoid false results.
