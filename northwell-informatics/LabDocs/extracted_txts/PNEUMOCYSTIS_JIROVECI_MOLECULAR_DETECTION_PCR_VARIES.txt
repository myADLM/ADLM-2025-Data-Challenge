Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Molecular Detection of
Pneumocystis jirovecii by PCR
1. PURPOSE This SOP provides detailed procedures for the
detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA in clinical specimens
using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology. This test
identifies the presence of Pneumocystis jirovecii, which can
cause pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to carry out this procedure correctly and to
maintain accurate documentation. All personnel performing this
procedure must be trained and demonstrate competency.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimens: Bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL), induced sputum, or other respiratory specimens.
Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL. Storage: Specimens
should be kept at 2-8 °C if testing will occur within 24 hours. For
longer storage, specimens should be kept at -20 °C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-sterile or leaking containers.
• Specimens not properly labeled with two patient identifiers.
• Specimens stored at improper temperatures or with prolonged
transport times resulting in specimen integrity compromise.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-Time PCR Instrument
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• PCR Master Mix (including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2)
• Pneumocystis jirovecii specific primers and probes
• Sterile, DNase/RNase-free tubes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control DNA for Pneumocystis jirovecii
• Negative control (no-template control)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing as required.
• Conduct routine maintenance and calibration of the PCR
instrumentation.
1. PROCEDURE 6.1. DNA Extraction: a. Thaw specimens at room
temperature. b. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to extract
DNA from the specimens. c. Elute the DNA in a final volume
consistent with the extraction kit instructions. d. Store DNA at
-20 °C until PCR analysis.
6.2. PCR Preparation: a. Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to
the reagent instructions, ensuring the inclusion of primers and probes
specific for Pneumocystis jirovecii. b. Aliquot the PCR Master Mix into
each well of a PCR plate, ensuring that all reactions are performed in
duplicate/triplicate. c. Add extracted DNA from each specimen to the
designated wells. d. Include both positive and negative controls in
separate wells.
6.3. PCR Program: Select the appropriate cycling conditions on the
Real-Time PCR instrument: a. Initial denaturation: 95 °C for 10 min
b. Denaturation: 95 °C for 15 sec
c. Annealing/extension: 60 °C for 1 min
d. Number of cycles: 45
6.4. Data Analysis: a. Upon completion, review the amplification plots
for each specimen and control. b. Determine the presence or
absence of Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA based on the threshold cycle
(Ct) value. c. A Ct value below the established limit of detection
threshold is considered positive. d. Validate the run if positive and
negative controls produce the expected results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Positive results should include a disclaimer indicating the clinical
significance of the PCR result given the patient’s clinical status.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the designated
technologist before releasing.
• Critical results should be communicated promptly to the
requesting physician as per laboratory guidelines.

• Manufacturer's manual for Real-Time PCR instrument.
• Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit product insert.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis
pneumonia.
1. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols when handling clinical
specimens and operating PCR instrumentation.
• Use appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection) when
processing specimens and setting up PCR reactions.
• Dispose of all waste according to biohazard regulations.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the negative control produces amplification, identify and
eliminate sources of contamination, clean all work areas, and
repeat the assay.
• If the positive control fails, review reagent preparation and storage
conditions, verify equipment performance, and repeat the assay
with new reagents if necessary.
• Document any instrument failures and corrective actions taken.
As a certified CLIA laboratory, ensure compliance with all relevant
regulations and guidelines pertinent to molecular diagnostic testing.
Regularly update SOPs in accordance with new methodologies and
technological advancements in molecular diagnostics.
