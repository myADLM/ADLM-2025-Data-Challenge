Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Pneumonia
PCR with Aerobic Culture and Gram Stain
1. Purpose
This procedure provides instructions for performing Pneumonia PCR
analysis, aerobic culture, and Gram stain on respiratory specimens to
identify pathogens causing pneumonia.
2. Responsibility
• Designated Laboratory Staff: Perform the testing, ensure the
quality and accuracy of the results, and document the analyses.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Validate and review results, ensure that
all protocols are followed, and take necessary corrective actions if
deviations occur.
3. Specimen Requirements
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Sputum
◦ Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
◦ Endotracheal aspirate
◦ Pleural fluid
◦ Nasopharyngeal swabs with viral transport media
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens which are visibly contaminated or improperly
labeled
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume
4. Equipment and Reagents
• PCR thermal cycler
• PCR reagents and primers for pneumonia pathogens
• Aerobic culture media (e.g., Blood Agar, MacConkey Agar)
• Gram stain reagents (Crystal Violet, Iodine, Decolorizer, Safranin)
• Incubator at 35-37°C
• Microcentrifuge
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Biological safety cabinet (BSC)
5. Safety Precautions
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Handle all specimens as if they are infectious.
• Dispose of waste in compliance with biohazard waste protocols.
6. Procedure
A. PCR Analysis
1. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
◦ Extract nucleic acids from the specimen using a
commercially available extraction kit as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Measure the concentration and purity of extracted nucleic
acids using a spectrophotometer.
2. PCR Setup:
◦ Thaw all PCR reagents on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix which includes template
DNA, primers, nucleotides, buffer, and Taq polymerase.
◦ Aliquot the PCR mix into PCR tubes or plates and add
extracted nucleic acid template to each reaction.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
3. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Perform PCR amplification using the thermal cycler under
the following cycling conditions:
| Step | Temperature | Time | Cycles |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------| | Initial Denaturation
| 95°C | 5 minutes | 1 | | Denaturation | 95°C | 30 seconds | | |
Annealing | 55-60°C | 30 seconds | 35 | | Extension | 72°C | 1
minute | | | Final Extension| 72°C | 10 minutes | 1 |
4. Detection and Analysis:
◦ Analyze the amplified products via gel electrophoresis or a
suitable detection system.
◦ Document and interpret the presence or absence of
bacterial DNA to identify potential pathogens.
B. Aerobic Culture
1. Specimen Processing:
◦ Using a sterile loop, streak the specimen on appropriate
aerobic culture media plates.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the cultures at 35-37°C in an aerobic incubator for
24-48 hours.
3. Colony Examination:
◦ After incubation, examine the plates for colony growth and
morphology.
◦ Perform further identification of bacterial colonies using
biochemical tests or automated identification systems if
necessary.
C. Gram Stain
1. Smear Preparation:
◦ Prepare a thin smear of the specimen or a well-isolated
colony on a microscope slide.
◦ Allow the smear to air dry completely and then heat-fix by
passing through a flame.
2. Staining Procedure:
◦ Apply Crystal Violet to the smear and let it stand for 1
minute.
◦ Rinse with tap water.
◦ Apply Gram's Iodine and let it stand for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse with tap water.
◦ Decolorize with alcohol or acetone for a few seconds (until
runoff is clear).
◦ Rinse immediately with tap water.
◦ Counterstain with Safranin and let it stand for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse with tap water and blot dry with bibulous paper.
3. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Examine the smear using a light microscope under oil
immersion (1000x magnification).
◦ Document the Gram reaction (positive or negative) and
morphology of the bacteria.
7. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Ensure culture plates are checked daily and appropriate
biochemical identification is performed.
• Periodically verify Gram stain reagents against known bacterial
strains.
• Document all findings and deviations, and report any
inconsistencies to the supervisor.
8. Reporting Results
• Interpret and log PCR results, aerobic culture findings, and Gram
stain observations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Communicate findings to the ordering physician in accordance
with laboratory protocols.
• Review and verify all results before releasing.
