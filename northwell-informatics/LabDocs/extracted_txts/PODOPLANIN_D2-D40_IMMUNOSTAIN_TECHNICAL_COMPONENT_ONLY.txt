Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PODOPLANIN (D2-D40)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing the Podoplanin
(D2-40) immunostain on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections for the purpose of detecting podoplanin expression. This
protocol outlines the steps required to ensure accurate and
reproducible staining results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for processing and
staining the tissue sections according to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure that all staff are
appropriately trained and that adherence to this SOP is maintained.

1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sectioning and Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4 µm thick serial sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 45-50°C and mount onto
positively charged slides.
3. Allow slides to dry overnight at room temperature or for 1 hour
in a 60°C oven.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 3 changes, 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series: 100% (2 changes, 5
minutes each), 95% (5 minutes), and 70% (5 minutes).
3. Rinse slides for 5 minutes in running distilled water.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval:
1. Prepare the antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat buffer to 95-99°C and immerse slides in the buffer for 20
minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
5.4 Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS buffer.
3. Block non-specific binding using serum blocking buffer for 30
minutes.
4. Incubate slides with primary anti-podoplanin (D2-40) antibody,
diluted as per manufacturer’s instructions, at room temperature
for 1 hour.
5. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
6. Incubate slides with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody,
diluted as per manufacturer’s instructions, at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
7. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
8. Develop slides using DAB substrate solution until appropriate
staining intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.5 Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water until excess stain is removed.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series: 70%, 95%,
100% (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
4. Clear slides in xylene for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
5. Mount slides with a permanent mounting medium and cover
slips.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run
to validate the procedure.
6.2 Document all antibody lot numbers, reagent lot numbers, staining
times, and any deviations from the protocol.
6.3 Evaluate stained slides using a light microscope to confirm
appropriate staining patterns and intensity.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Only the technical component (staining procedures) is reported.
7.2 Results should be documented and electronically reported to LIS,
reviewed, and verified by a trained technologist.

procedures.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
9.1 Suboptimal staining: Ensure reagent and antibody integrity, verify
antigen retrieval conditions, or recalibrate equipment. 9.2 Non-
specific staining: Optimize antibody dilution and blocking conditions.
9.3 No staining: Check primary antibody activity and confirm antigen
preservation.
This SOP is effective as of [Date] and will be reviewed annually for
adherence and updates as needed.
