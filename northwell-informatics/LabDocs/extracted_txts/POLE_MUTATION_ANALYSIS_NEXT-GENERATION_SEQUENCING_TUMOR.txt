Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for POLE Mutation Analysis,
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), Tumor
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analysis of
POLE gene mutations in tumor samples using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technology. This includes various steps from
specimen preparation to data analysis and reporting, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the results.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff will perform the NGS analysis and ensure the
procedure is followed accurately.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any anomalies or
issues during the procedure that may affect the test results and
notify the supervisor immediately.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are properly
trained and adhere to SOPs.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the laboratory personnel performing the NGS
analysis for POLE mutations in tumor samples. It covers specimen
preparation, library preparation, sequencing, bioinformatics analysis,
quality control, and result reporting.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements
• Tumor tissue samples (preferably formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded [FFPE]) or fresh frozen tissue.
• Minimum of 10 unstained sections (5-10 μm thick) or an
equivalent volume of macro-dissected tissue.
• A matched normal sample (e.g., blood or buccal swab) may also
be requested for paired analysis.
B) DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA from tumor samples using a validated extraction kit
(e.g., QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit).
• Measure DNA quantity and quality using a spectrophotometer
(e.g., NanoDrop) and a fluorometer (e.g., Qubit).
C) Library Preparation
• Use a validated library preparation kit (e.g., Illumina DNA Prep) to
prepare DNA libraries.
• Fragment DNA to the desired size (e.g., 150-200 bp) using a
sonicator or a fragmentation enzyme.
• Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation according to the
library preparation kit protocol.
• Amplify the library using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
purify using magnetic beads.
• Quantify the library using a fluorometer and assess the size
distribution using a bioanalyzer (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer).
D) Target Enrichment
• Use a validated POLE gene target enrichment kit or custom
probes to selectively capture POLE gene regions.
• Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for hybridization, washing, and
post-capture amplification steps.
E) Sequencing
• Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS instrument (e.g.,
Illumina MiSeq or NovaSeq).
• Run the sequencing according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
ensuring appropriate sequencing depth (e.g., minimum coverage
of 500x for target regions).
F) Bioinformatics Analysis
• Use a validated bioinformatics pipeline for NGS data analysis.
• Perform quality control checks on raw sequencing data (e.g.,
FastQC).
• Align reads to the reference genome (e.g., human reference
genome GRCh38) using a suitable aligner (e.g., BWA).
• Identify variants using a variant caller (e.g., GATK) and annotate
variants using a mutation annotation tool (e.g., ANNOVAR).
• Filter and prioritize variants based on their significance and
relevance to POLE gene mutations.
G) Quality Control
• Confirm that quality control metrics meet the required standards
(e.g., read quality, alignment rates, coverage depth).
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay performance.
• Repeat the analysis for any samples that do not meet quality
control criteria.
H) Result Interpretation and Reporting
• Review and interpret the identified POLE gene mutations in the
context of clinical significance.
• Generate the final report including detailed information on
identified mutations, their potential impact, and clinical relevance.
• Ensure that reports are reviewed and verified by a qualified
clinical molecular geneticist or pathologist.
• Report results to the referring physician or oncologist.
I) References
• Ensure all steps follow the manufacturer's protocols and
laboratory accreditation guidelines.
• Consult the latest research literature and clinical databases (e.g.,
COSMIC, ClinVar) for mutation interpretation.
