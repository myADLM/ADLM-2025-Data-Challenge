Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Poliovirus (Types 1, 3) Antibodies,
Neutralization
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis and generation of
results for Poliovirus (Types 1, 3) Antibodies, Neutralization within the
laboratory to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable test outputs.
Responsibility:
Designated staff must perform the analysis and generate the results
as defined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
the procedure is followed correctly and addressing any deviations or
issues that may arise during the process.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
A. Equipment
• Vortex Mixer
• Microtiter Plate Reader (capable of reading at 492 nm)
• Automated or manual sample handler
B. Reagents
• Specific Poliovirus Types 1 and 3 antigens
• Poliovirus antibody standards
• Cell culture media (appropriate for cell lines used)
• Neutral Red Stain
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
C. Supplies
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Sterile pipette tips
• Serological pipettes
• Calibration controls for plate reader
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum or plasma samples collected using standard venipuncture
techniques.
B. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with improper labeling
• Samples collected in anticoagulant other than what is specified
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Thaw serum or plasma samples at room temperature.
• Standards and controls should be prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Titration of Antibodies
1. Dilute patient samples and controls according to the specified
dilution series (e.g., serial dilutions in 96-well plates).
2. Add equal volumes of Poliovirus Types 1 and 3 antigens to the
respective wells.
C. Incubation
1. Incubate the microtiter plate at 37°C for 1 hour in a CO2
incubator.
2. Following incubation, add cell culture media containing indicator
cells to each well.
3. Incubate the plates further at 37°C for an additional time period
specified for optimal virus-cell interaction.
D. Staining and Reading
1. Post-incubation, stain cells with Neutral Red Stain.
2. Incubate stain for approximately 30 minutes.
3. Wash plates with PBS to remove excess stain.
4. Measure the absorbance using the microtiter plate reader set at
492 nm.
E. Interpretation of Results
1. Use the absorbance readings to assess the presence and
quantification of neutralizing antibodies.
2. Calculate the Neutralization Titer for each sample.
3. Compare the individuals' results with the established standard
curves to determine antibody levels.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Controls
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure the
validity of test results.
• Ensure that the calibration of the plate reader is up to date.
B. Reagent Integrity
• Use reagents before their expiration date and follow storage
conditions recommended by the manufacturer.
• Document any observed issues with reagents that could impact
test results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be carefully reviewed and validated by the
technologist before being entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Ensure that each result is documented with respect to the
standard reference values and reported as per the guidelines.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Any significantly high-level results indicating potential infection or
an immune response must be reported immediately to a
designated supervisor and documented appropriately.

This SOP ensures consistent use of the methods and accurate
results in the analysis process for Poliovirus (Types 1, 3) Antibodies,
Neutralization. All staff must adhere strictly to these guidelines to
maintain high standards of laboratory practice.
