Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for POLLOCK WHITE (POLLACHIUS
VIRENS) IgE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the accurate measurement of
Pollock White (Pollachius virens) IgE levels in patient specimens
using a validated assay method. The goal is to ensure precise and
reliable results, facilitating appropriate clinical diagnosis and
subsequent patient management.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the IgE
assay, documenting the results, and implementing corrective actions
when necessary. All staff must be aware of potential deficiencies in
the assay process that could affect the accuracy of test results and
report any issues to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred specimen: Serum, collected in a red-top tube.
• Acceptable specimen: Plasma (EDTA anticoagulant), collected in
a lavender-top tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum or plasma samples are stable for up to 24 hours at room
temperature (20-25°C). If longer storage is required, samples can
be refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 7 days, or frozen at -20°C for up
to 1 month.
• Avoid repeated freezing and thawing of specimens.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate, fluoride/oxalate, or
heparin-coated tubes.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure specimens are free from contamination and properly
labeled with patient ID, collection date, and time.
• Prior to analysis, bring refrigerated or frozen specimens to room
temperature.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated IgE assay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250 or equivalent)
• Pollock White (Pollachius virens) IgE assay kit
• Calibrators and control materials (low, medium, and high
concentration)
• Disposable pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes
• Timer or stopwatch
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure the analyzer and associated equipment are calibrated and
functioning correctly.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for initial setup and calibration
of the IgE assay kit.
Control and Calibrator Verification:
• Run all control materials and calibrators according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Validate performance against established acceptable ranges
before testing patient samples.
Patient Sample Testing:
• Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature.
• Mix specimens gently but thoroughly prior to analysis to ensure
homogeneity.
• Load patient specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer according to manufacturer’s specifications.
• Follow the program for Pollock White IgE testing on the
automated analyzer.
Result Generation:
• The analyzer will automatically process and generate IgE results.
• Review results for any flags or error messages. Troubleshoot as
necessary following machine-specific guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality controls daily and document results in the QC
log.
• Perform proficiency testing as per regulatory guidelines.
• Initial results outside acceptable control limits should prompt re-
analysis and supervisor notification.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results are accurately recorded in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines and reference
intervals.
Reference Intervals:
• Pollock White IgE: < 0.35 kU/L (normal range for undetectable to
low IgE)
Critical Results:
• Concentrations ≥ 0.35 kU/L should be considered for potential
clinical significance and reported promptly as per the laboratory’s
critical result notification policy.
1. PROCEDURE LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit manufacturer's documentation for specific
limitations related to reagent pad interference, cross-reactivity, or
other procedure-specific limitations.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
If a specimen fails the initial analysis or produces an invalid result:
• Repeat the assay on a fresh aliquot.
• Notify the supervisor if repeated issues occur.
• Document all corrective actions taken in a designated log.
