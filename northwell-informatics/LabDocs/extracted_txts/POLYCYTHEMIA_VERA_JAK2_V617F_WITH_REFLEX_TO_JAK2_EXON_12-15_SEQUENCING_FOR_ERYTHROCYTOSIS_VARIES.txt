Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
POLYCYTHEMIA VERA, JAK2 V617F WITH
REFLEX TO JAK2 EXON 12-15
SEQUENCING FOR ERYTHROCYTOSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for generating results for
POLYCYTHEMIA VERA JAK2 V617F with reflex to JAK2 Exon 12-15
sequencing for erythrocytosis. This SOP ensures the consistent,
accurate, and valid analysis of the specified genetic markers.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed correctly and that any issues are addressed promptly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Peripheral blood, ideally collected in EDTA
tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 3 mL.
• Stability: Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of
collection.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment
• Sequencing apparatus (e.g., Sanger Sequencer or Next
Generation Sequencing platform)
• QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit or equivalent (for DNA extraction)
• JAK2 V617F assay kit
• JAK2 Exon 12-15 sequencing primers
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Prepare workspace: Ensure all surfaces are clean and
decontaminated.
2. Sample preparation: Label all tubes clearly with patient
information.
3. DNA Isolation:
◦ Use QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for processing 3 mL
of whole blood.
◦ Elute DNA in 100 µL of elution buffer.
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer
(e.g., NanoDrop).
B. JAK2 V617F Analysis
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Add template DNA (100 ng) to the PCR mix.
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls.
2. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
3. Detection:
◦ Analyze PCR products using gel electrophoresis.
◦ Confirm the presence or absence of the JAK2 V617F
mutation.
C. Reflex to JAK2 Exon 12-15 Sequencing
1. Sequencing Preparation:
◦ Prepare the sequencing PCR using JAK2 Exon 12-15
primers.
◦ Follow similar PCR conditions as the JAK2 V617F protocol
but adjust annealing temperatures based on primer
specifications.
2. Purification:
◦ Purify PCR products using a suitable purification kit (e.g.,
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit).
3. Sequencing Reaction:
◦ Set up the sequencing reaction using the purified PCR
products.
◦ Follow the standard protocol for your sequencing
equipment.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze sequencing data using dedicated software.
◦ Compare sequences to reference JAK2 gene sequences to
identify mutations.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive controls: Samples known to contain the JAK2 V617F
mutation and JAK2 exon 12-15 mutations.
• Negative controls: DNA samples known to be free of the JAK2
mutations.
• Run controls: Include controls in each batch of tests to ensure
accuracy.
• Data verification: Confirm results through repeat testing if
necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all results clearly in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• If JAK2 V617F is detected, report as positive and proceed to
JAK2 Exon 12-15 sequencing if indicated.
• If no mutation is detected in JAK2 V617F, report as negative.
• Review all sequencing data thoroughly before finalizing the report.
• Include interpretive comments based on genetic findings.
8. REFERENCES
• Refer to relevant manufacturer guidelines and product inserts for
detailed procedures and limitations.
• Consult latest clinical guidelines for the interpretation of JAK2
mutation analysis in erythrocytosis and Polycythemia Vera.
9. REVISION HISTORY
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or when significant changes
are made to the procedure or equipment.
