Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for POLYOLS,
QUANTITATIVE, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the quantitative analysis of polyols in urine
specimens, ensuring standardized procedures are adhered to for
reliable and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel perform and analyze the
quantitative analysis of polyols in urine samples, ensuring quality
control and result verification. Supervising personnel oversee
adherence to protocols and troubleshooting any procedural
discrepancies.
1. DEFINITIONS
Polyols: Polyols are sugar alcohols, important for various
biochemical and metabolic functions. The quantitative analysis of
polyols in urine helps in diagnosing metabolic disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen:
▪ Preferred/acceptable:
▪ 20 mL of freshly voided urine.
▪ Unacceptable:
▪ Specimens contaminated, with no collection date/
time, or more than 24 hours old without proper
storage.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
system or equivalent.
▪ Centrifuge.
▪ Refrigerators for sample storage.
▪ Analytical balance.
◦ Reagents:
▪ HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water).
▪ Calibration standards for polyols (e.g., sorbitol, xylitol,
etc.).
▪ Internal standards and quality control materials.
◦ Supplies:
▪ Urine collection containers.
▪ HPLC columns.
▪ Centrifuge tubes.
▪ Sample vials.
▪ Pipettes and pipette tips.
3. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Sample Receipt:
◦ Verify sample integrity and labeling upon receipt.
◦ Log sample details in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Storage:
◦ Store samples at 4°C if not processed immediately.
◦ If delayed, freeze specimens at -20°C for long-term storage.
Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples and bring refrigerated samples to
room temperature.
◦ Mix the sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial.
3. Sample Processing:
◦ Pipette an aliquot (typically 1 mL) of the processed sample
into a new vial.
◦ Add internal standard and mix well.
4. Injection into HPLC:
◦ Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Inject the prepared sample into the HPLC column.
◦ Run the sample alongside calibration standards for accurate
quantification.
Quality Control:
- Include quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each batch.
- Ensure the calibration curve is established and verified before analyzing patient samples.
Post-analytical Phase:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Process chromatograms to identify and quantify polyols.
◦ Ensure baseline separation and peak integration accuracy.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare the results against reference intervals.
◦ Flag and recheck any results outside the expected range.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Transmit results from the analytical instrument to the LIS.
◦ Verify results by comparing quality control data.
◦ Report finalized results in accordance with site-specific
guidelines.

5. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the HPLC system manual for troubleshooting common
issues such as baseline drifts, irregular peak shapes, or unexpected
retention times. For unresolved issues, contact the technical support
service.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Adhere to laboratory safety protocols, including the proper disposal of
biological specimens, and chemical reagents, and using personal
protective equipment (PPE).
1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENT CONTROL
This SOP shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary. The
current document version shall be accessible to all laboratory
personnel.
This concludes the standard operating procedure for the
quantitative analysis of polyols in urine.
