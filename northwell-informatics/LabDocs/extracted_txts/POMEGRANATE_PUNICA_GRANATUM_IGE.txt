Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for POMEGRANATE (PUNICA GRANATUM) IgE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for POMEGRANATE (PUNICA GRANATUM)
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of test results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps of this procedure. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any deviations or issues.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum or plasma sample (EDTA, heparin or citrate
anticoagulants) collected and stored according to standard blood
collection practices.
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL of specimen required.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted samples.
• Samples with less than the required minimum volume.
• Specimens not labeled appropriately or without collection date/
time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• POMEGRANATE (PUNICA GRANATUM) IgE specific assay kit
(e.g., ImmunoCAP by Thermo Fisher Scientific or equivalent).
• Calibrators and controls as provided within the assay kit or as
specified by the manufacturer.
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer compatible with the testing kit.
• Routine laboratory consumables (pipettes, tips, gloves, etc.).
• Specimen storage solutions and decontaminant agents as
required.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Verify that all equipment and reagents are within their expiry dates
and stored under appropriate conditions.
• Allow reagents, controls, and specimens to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
B. Calibration
• Perform calibration of the assay according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided within the kit.
• Document calibration curve and ensure all control results fall
within the acceptable range indicated by the manufacturer.
C. Quality Control
• Run internal quality control (QC) samples at suggested levels
(low, medium, high) before patient specimens.
• Ensure QC results fall within the predetermined acceptable
ranges. If QC fails, do not proceed with patient testing;
troubleshoot and rerun until QC is acceptable.
• Document all QC results and any corrective action taken.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Label all tubes or appropriate vessels using specimen
identification numbers.
2. Add an appropriate amount of calibrator, controls, and
specimens to designated wells/tubes as per the assay kit’s
instructions.
3. Follow detailed steps within the assay kit's insert for the
incubation and washing procedures.
◦ Typically involves incubation with IgE binding reagents,
washing, addition of enzyme conjugate, and development
substrates.
4. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using the automated
analyzer at the specified wavelength.
5. Calculate IgE levels based on the calibration curve generated
by the assay system.
E. Results Interpretation
• Review generated results for each specimen against the
calibration curve.
• Ensure all quality controls are within acceptable ranges before
accepting patient results.
• Document findings and manually verify results if necessary.
1. Report Generation
• All results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• The technologist must review and verify results prior to releasing
them.
• Clearly mark any results requiring repeat testing or manual
verification for follow-up.
• Flag critical values for immediate communication to the
appropriate healthcare provider, and document this
communication.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If discrepancies or issues arise during the analytical phase, perform
the following steps:
1. Review all procedural steps to ensure compliance.
2. Re-run controls to identify potential assay or equipment
malfunctions.
3. Check for possible contamination or degradation of reagents.
4. Notify the laboratory supervisor and quarantine affected
specimens and runs.
5. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Regular reviews and audits of the POMEGRANATE (PUNICA
GRANATUM) IgE test results and associated quality control data
should be conducted to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability.
Document any identified trends and address potential areas of
improvement.
1. REFERENCES AND DOCUMENTS
• Reference the manufacturer’s assay kit instructions and inserts.
• Internal laboratory guidelines and standard procedural
documentation.
• CLIA regulations and any pertinent accreditation requirements.
By adhering to this SOP, we ensure the generation of reliable and
accurate POMEGRANATE (PUNICA GRANATUM) IgE results,
fostering proper patient diagnosis and treatment.
