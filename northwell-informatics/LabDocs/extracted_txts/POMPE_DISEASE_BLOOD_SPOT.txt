Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase for Pompe
Disease Testing Using Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE:
This procedure describes the steps involved in the analytical phase
of testing for Pompe Disease from dried blood spot (DBS)
specimens. The objective is to ensure that testing is performed
consistently and accurately to provide reliable results for clinical
decision-making.
Responsibility:
• Designated lab personnel are responsible for performing the
assays according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and addressing any issues that arise during testing.
1. DEFINITIONS:
Pompe Disease: Pompe disease is a rare, inherited metabolic
disorder caused by mutations in the GAA gene, leading to a
deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. This enzyme
deficiency results in the accumulation of glycogen in the body's cells,
affecting various tissues and organs, particularly the heart and
skeletal muscles.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• Specimen Type: Dried Blood Spots (DBS) on filter paper.
• Collection: Follow standard guidelines for DBS collection. Ensure
adequate drying before storage and transportation.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, insufficient quantity, or
improperly stored DBS.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT:
• Reagents:
◦ Assay-specific reagents and buffers for Pompe disease
enzyme activity assay.
◦ Calibrator and control materials.
• Supplies:
◦ DBS filter paper cards.
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Disposable gloves and lab coat.
• Equipment:
◦ Incubator set to assay-specific temperature.
◦ Microplate reader for fluorescence or absorbance
measurement.
◦ Centrifuge.
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Punch out a 3.2mm (⅛-inch) disk from each dried blood spot on
the filter paper.
2. Place the punched disks into individual microcentrifuge tubes.
B. Enzyme Extraction:
1. Add the assay buffer to each tube according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Incubate the tubes at an assay-specific temperature for a set
period to allow enzyme extraction from the blood spots.
C. Enzyme Activity Assay:
1. Transfer the extracted enzyme sample to the assay plate
following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Add the substrate specific for acid alpha-glucosidase to each
well containing the enzyme extract.
3. Incubate the assay plate at the specified temperature for the
recommended time.
4. Measure the fluorescence or absorbance using a microplate
reader as specified in the assay protocol.
5. Run appropriate calibrators and controls along with patient
samples.
D. Quality Control:
1. Include negative, low, and high controls in each assay run.
2. Ensure that controls fall within specified ranges. If controls are
out of range, investigate and resolve before reporting patient
results.
3. Record results from controls, calibrators, and patient samples in
the designated log.
4. RESULTS INTERPRETATION:
• Calculate enzyme activity for each sample based on the standard
curve generated from calibrators.
• Compare the calculated enzyme activity to established reference
ranges.
• Report results as:
◦ Normal: Enzyme activity within the reference range.
◦ Carrier: Reduced enzyme activity, suggestive of carrier status.
◦ Affected: Significantly reduced enzyme activity, indicative of
Pompe disease.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results according to lab policy, ensuring any critical or
abnormal results are flagged for further review.
• Ensure the report contains necessary interpretations and
recommendations based on enzyme activity levels.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal range: Specific to the assay and population; refer to the
manufacturer’s insert or validated in-house ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed or insufficient blood spots may lead to inaccurate
results.
• Misinterpretation of carrier and affected status may arise without
proper controls.
• Refer to the assay insert for specific limitations related to
interferences and assay sensitivity.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If enzyme activity in controls consistently falls outside acceptable
ranges, review assay conditions and reagents for potential issues.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained regularly.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert.
• Validated laboratory procedures and documentation available on
internal systems.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent
and accurate testing for Pompe disease using dried blood spot
specimens.
