1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Pompe Disease, Full Gene Analysis in
a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP and ensure accurate and reliable results for Pompe Disease,
Full Gene Analysis. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance and addressing any deficiencies in the procedure.
2. DEFINITION
Pompe Disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the
GAA gene, which encodes the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Full
Gene Analysis involves sequencing the entire GAA gene to identify
mutations associated with the disease.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase
• Verify that specimen collection, receipt, and accessioning
procedures have been completed.
• Ensure specimens are labeled correctly and meet acceptance
criteria.
B. Analytical Phase
1. Preparation of DNA Samples
• Extract DNA from the patient's blood sample using an automated
or manual DNA extraction kit.
• Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or Qubit
fluorometer.
• Store the DNA at -20°C until ready for use.
2. PCR Amplification
• Set up PCR reactions to amplify the entire GAA gene using
specific primers.
• Use thermal cyclers for PCR amplification following optimized
conditions.
• Verify the amplification by running agarose gel electrophoresis.
3. Library Preparation for NGS
• Purify PCR products using magnetic beads or gel extraction.
• Normalize DNA concentration of purified PCR products.
• Prepare libraries using an NGS library preparation kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Verify library quality and quantity using a BioAnalyzer or
TapeStation.
4. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
• Load libraries onto the NGS platform, ensuring proper calibration
and controls.
• Monitor sequencing runs and ensure data quality.
• Use standard protocols for data acquisition, ensuring reliable and
complete sequencing.
5. Bioinformatics Analysis
• Process raw NGS data using appropriate bioinformatics pipelines.
• Align sequencing data to the reference human genome.
• Call variants and annotate sequence data using bioinformatics
software tools.
6. Interpretation and Reporting
• Review variant annotations and classify identified mutations
according to ACMG guidelines.
• Compile results including variant classification, zygosity, and
clinical relevance.
• Verify results by additional methods if required (e.g., Sanger
sequencing).
• Review interpretation with clinical geneticists and finalize the
report.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure complete documentation.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in PCR and sequencing
runs.
• Analyze control samples concurrently with patient samples.
• Review QC data to ensure accuracy and repeatability of the
assay.
B. External Quality Control
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for Pompe
Disease gene analysis.
• Regularly review calibration certificates of equipment used in the
procedure.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by qualified molecular
geneticists.
• Report critical findings promptly and follow site-specific reporting
guidelines.
• Ensure clear documentation and communication of results to
healthcare providers.
6. REFERENCES
• ACMG Guidelines for Variant Classification.
• Manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction and NGS library
preparation kits.
• Bioinformatics pipeline documentation for GAA gene analysis.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain accurate records of PCR, sequencing, and
bioinformatics analysis.
• Store QC, calibration, and proficiency testing results in secure
systems.
