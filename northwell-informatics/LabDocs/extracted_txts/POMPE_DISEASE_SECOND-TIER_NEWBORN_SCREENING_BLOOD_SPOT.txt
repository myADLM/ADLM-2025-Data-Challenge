Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP): Pompe Disease Second-
Tier Newborn Screening, Blood
Spot
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the second-tier screening of Pompe disease using dried blood spot
(DBS) specimens in the laboratory. This ensures accurate and
reliable detection of Pompe disease in newborns who have tested
positive in the initial screening.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of Pompe disease second-tier newborn screening
using DBS specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis,
validating the results, and documenting all activities. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing results, ensuring the accuracy of the testing
process, and implementing corrective actions when needed.
3. DEFINITION
Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II, is a
genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-
glucosidase (GAA). The second-tier newborn screening is performed
to confirm the initial positive screening results.
4. SPECIMEN
Acceptable:
• Dried blood spots collected on standardized filter paper cards
(e.g., Whatman 903).
Unacceptable:
• DBS cards with insufficient blood quantity.
• Specimens not dried completely before shipping.
• Contaminated or damaged DBS cards.
• DBS cards without proper labeling (e.g., missing patient
identification).
• Specimens received after the stability period (i.e., greater than 14
days since collection).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) or equivalent.
• Microtiter plate shaker.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Internal standards for enzyme activity.
• Analytical-grade solvents and reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, water).
• Calibration standards and quality control materials.
• Extraction reagents and buffers (specific to GAA enzyme activity
assay).
Supplies:
• DBS punching equipment.
• Microtiter plates (96-well).
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Eppendorf tubes.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of DBS Extracts:
1. Punching DBS: Using a DBS puncher, punch out appropriate-
sized discs (e.g., 3.2 mm) from each DBS card into a well of a
96-well microtiter plate.
2. Extraction: Add the specified volume of extraction buffer to
each well. Vortex thoroughly to ensure proper mixing.
3. Internal Standard Addition: Add the internal standard solution
of known concentration to each well.
4. Incubation: Incubate the plate at the specified temperature
(e.g., 37°C) for a defined time period (e.g., 1-2 hours) with
shaking.
B) Enzyme Activity Assay:
1. Reaction Setup: Add the substrate solution to each well
containing the DBS extract.
2. Incubation: Incubate the plate at the specified temperature
(e.g., 37°C) for a defined time period (e.g., 18-24 hours) with
shaking.
3. Termination: Terminate the reaction by adding a stopping
solution as specified in the assay protocol.
4. Transfer and Filtration: Transfer a portion of the supernatant
to a clean microtiter plate and filter if necessary.
C) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Instrument Preparation: Calibrate and prepare the LC-MS/MS
instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Loading: Load samples, calibration standards, and
quality controls onto the auto-sampler.
3. Chromatography and Detection: Perform chromatographic
separation and detection of the analytes using the LC-MS/MS.
4. Data Acquisition: Acquire and analyze data using the
dedicated software.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Include appropriate quality control materials (e.g., low, medium,
high controls) in each assay run.
• Accept or reject the run based on established criteria for quality
control materials.
Calibration and Validation:
• Perform instrument calibration daily using calibration standards.
• Validate new lots of reagents and supplies as per laboratory
guidelines.
Documentation:
• Document all steps, including specimen ID, extraction, enzyme
assay details, and instrument settings.
• Record calibration and quality control results.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND
REPORTING
Interpretation:
• Compare enzyme activity levels in the patient samples against
established reference ranges.
• Flag samples with enzyme activities below the clinical cut-off for
Pompe disease.
Reporting:
• Review and validate results by a designated technologist.
• Upload validated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and report findings to the newborn screening program.
Critical Results:
• Immediately communicate critical values suggestive of Pompe
disease to the responsible healthcare provider following
laboratory critical result reporting guidelines.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This method is highly specific for detecting GAA enzyme activity;
however, interferents in the blood spot can affect the accuracy of
the results.
• Genotyping or additional biochemical testing may be required for
a definitive diagnosis of Pompe disease.
