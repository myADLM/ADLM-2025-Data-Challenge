Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Poplar White (Populus
Alba) IgE Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
Poplar White (Populus Alba) IgE testing, ensuring reliable, accurate,
and timely generation of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to follow this procedure for
processing and analyzing Poplar White (Populus Alba) IgE samples
and ensuring the correct documentation and reporting of results.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP)
• Calibrators and Controls specific to Poplar White (Populus Alba)
IgE testing
• Reagents specific to the ImmunoCAP platform
• Sample tubes containing patient serum or plasma
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Timer
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Check Sample Integrity:
◦ Ensure that the serum or plasma samples are properly
labeled.
◦ Verify that samples have not been hemolyzed, lipemic, or
icteric.
2. Preparation of Samples:
◦ Centrifuge samples if necessary to obtain clear serum/
plasma.
◦ Aliquot the required volume of serum/plasma into a suitable
secondary container if necessary.
4.2 EQUIPMENT PREPARATION
1. Immunoassay Analyzer Setup:
◦ Turn on the Immunoassay Analyzer and allow it to warm up.
◦ Ensure that all reagents, calibrators, and controls specific to
Poplar White (Populus Alba) IgE testing are loaded into the
analyzer.
◦ Perform daily maintenance checks and calibration as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibration curve using Poplar White (Populus Alba) IgE
calibrators.
◦ Run high, medium, and low controls specific to Poplar White
(Populus Alba) IgE to verify the accuracy and precision of
the analyzer.
◦ Document all calibration and quality control results.
4.3 TESTING PROCEDURE
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load the prepared patient samples onto the Immunoassay
Analyzer following the instrument’s specific loading
instructions.
◦ Ensure correct positioning and labeling to prevent sample
mismatch.
2. Initiate Test:
◦ Select the Poplar White (Populus Alba) IgE test protocol on
the analyzer.
◦ Start the assay run and monitor the instrument for any
errors or alerts during processing.
3. Result Generation:
◦ Upon completion, review analyzer-generated results for
each sample.
◦ Ensure that the results fall within the expected range of
values for calibrated analyzers.
◦ Document any error messages and repeat analyses if
necessary.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Verify that control results are within acceptable limits before
accepting patient results.
◦ Re-run controls if any result falls outside the acceptable
range.
2. External Quality Assessment:
◦ Participate in external quality assessment schemes as
provided by recognized bodies.
◦ Compare and document results to ensure alignment with
global standards.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Verification:
◦ Review results for analytical accuracy and report any critical
or unexpected findings within designated timeframes.
◦ Calculate final Poplar White (Populus Alba) IgE
concentration if necessary and document all results
thoroughly.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and update patient records accordingly.
◦ Ensure all results are confirmed by a senior laboratory
technologist or supervisor before final reporting.
3. Communication of Critical Results:
◦ Immediately notify the requesting clinician of any critical
results following laboratory protocol.
◦ Document all communication related to result notification.
