Protocol for Analytical Phase: Poppy Seed IgE, Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the measurement of Poppy
Seed specific IgE in serum specimens to assist in the diagnosis of
food-related allergic reactions.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the test following the
defined procedure, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test
results, and documenting any errors or anomalies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum-separator tube (SST).
• The serum must be separated and stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately analyzed.
Unacceptable:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
heparin, EDTA).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Laboratory centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• ELISA reader or another relevant immunoassay analyzer
• Specific IgE assay kit for Poppy Seed (manufacturer-specific)
• Incubator (if required for the specific assay)
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective
equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-Analytical Phase: a. Check the sample for proper labeling
and specimen integrity. b. If using SST, allow the blood to clot
and centrifuge to separate serum. c. Transfer serum to labeled
secondary tubes if needed.
3. Analytical Phase: a. Follow the kit-specific instructions for
preparing reagents. b. Add the appropriate amount of serum (as
indicated by the assay kit) to the test wells. c. Add the enzyme-
linked antibodies specific for Poppy Seed IgE according to the
assay kit instructions. d. Incubate for the specified time at the
temperature indicated in the kit instructions (usually room
temperature or specific incubation conditions). e. Wash the
wells to remove unbound components. f. Add substrate solution
and incubate for the required time. g. Measure the optical
density at the specified wavelength using an ELISA reader or
another relevant immunoassay analyzer. h. Record the results.
4. Post-Analytical Phase: a. Evaluate the results against the
standard curve provided by the assay kit. b. Document the
findings on the laboratory information system (LIS). c. Verify
results and, if necessary, repeat the test to confirm validity. d.
Report critical or unusual findings to the referring physician
following laboratory guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Perform quality control with each assay run: a. Use standard
positive and negative controls provided in the kit. b. Ensure
controls are within the acceptable range before releasing
patient results.
7. Document any deviations from expected control values and the
corrective actions taken.
8. Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment according to
manufacturer instructions.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Enter results into the LIS for review and verification.
11. Ensure results are consistent with control levels before
validation.
12. Use standard reporting guidelines for releasing results to the
physician.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Poppy Seed IgE: Reference ranges will be provided by the
manufacturer and should be included in result interpretation.
