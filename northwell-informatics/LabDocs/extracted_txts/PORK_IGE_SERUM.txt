Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase: PORK,
IGE, SERUM Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required to
accurately analyze serum specimens for Pork-specific IgE (PORK
IgE) concentrations. This protocol ensures consistent, precise, and
accurate results while adhering to regulatory requirements.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel trained and authorized to
perform PORK IgE testing in the designated laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
assays, recording data, and ensuring the quality control (QC)
processes are followed.
• Supervisor: Ensures that all personnel are trained and up-to-date
with the current protocol. Reviews and validates results and
assists with troubleshooting if required.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum.
• Collection: Blood collected in an SST (Serum Separator Tube) or
a red-top tube.
• Storage: Serum samples should be separated from cells within 1
hour of collection. Samples should be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C
if analyzed within 72 hours. For longer storage, samples should
be frozen at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Transportation: Ensure samples are transported to the
laboratory on ice and processed promptly.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PORK IgE testing kit (as per the manufacturer’s specifications)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at the specified wavelength
• Multichannel pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubators set at required temperatures
• Calibration and QC materials as provided or recommended by the
IgE testing kit manufacturer
• Laboratory records and logbooks
6. QUALITY CONTROL (QC)
• Implement QC measures by running controls provided with the
test kit:
◦ Positive Control: To validate expected positive responses.
◦ Negative Control: To verify non-reactive samples.
◦ Controls should be run with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all QC results. Investigate and resolve any QC failures
before proceeding with patient samples.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Test Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents are brought to room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Label all required tubes and microplate wells clearly.
3. Pre-set the microplate reader to the correct wavelength as
specified by the test kit insert.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Vortex and briefly centrifuge serum samples if necessary.
◦ Aliquot a sufficient volume of serum for the test, typically
according to the volume specified by the manufacturer.
2. Assay Execution:
◦ Add the required volume of standards, controls, and patient
samples to the designated wells following the kit's
instructions.
◦ Perform any washing steps using the prescribed wash buffer
and technique.
◦ Incubate as directed at the correct temperature and for the
exact time specified.
◦ Add the appropriate detection reagents following the kit
insert.
3. Detection and Measurement:
◦ After the final incubation and wash steps, add the substrate
solution to develop the color.
◦ Stop the reaction using the stop solution once the incubation
period ends.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) using the microplate
reader set to the recommended wavelength.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of PORK IgE in patient samples
by comparing the OD readings against the standard curve
generated with the known standards run in the same assay.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record raw data and calculated results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure all QC results are within acceptable limits before
releasing patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify that all results meet internal QC requirements. Any
deviations or discrepancies should be resolved before result
release.
2. Results are automatically or manually entered into the LIS and
reviewed by a certified technologist.
3. Notify the clinician immediately of any critical values as per
laboratory policy and document all notifications as per protocol.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific limitations of the
IgE test kit being used, including cross-reactivity, potential
interference, and sensitivity limitations.
