Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for PORK IGG (Porcine Immunoglobulin G)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for PORK IGG, including the preparation, analysis,
and reporting of results, to ensure accuracy and consistency in the
diagnostic testing of animal specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP for the analysis of PORK IGG. Supervisors must ensure that
staff are trained and adhere to these procedures.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader
• ELISA plates (96-well)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory incubator
• Plate washer (optional, manual washing also acceptable)
• PORK IGG ELISA kit
• Deionized/distilled water
• Plate sealers
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Acceptable specimens: Serum or plasma collected from porcine
animals.
• Specimens should be centrifuged and separated immediately
after collection to avoid hemolysis.
• Store specimens at 2-8 °C if analysis is to be conducted within a
few days. For long-term storage, specimens should be stored at
-20 °C or below.
• Thaw frozen specimens completely and mix well before testing.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Reagent Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Prepare the wash buffer by diluting the provided concentrate as
indicated in the kit insert.
3. Prepare the working standards and controls as per the kit
instructions.
B. Plate Preparation:
1. Label a 96-well ELISA plate appropriately for standards,
controls, and samples.
2. Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples into
corresponding wells, following the plate layout.
3. Cover the plate with a sealer and incubate at the temperature
specified in the kit instructions (typically at 37 °C for 1 hour).
C. Washing:
1. After incubation, gently aspirate the contents of the wells.
2. Wash the plate three times with the prepared wash buffer using
an automated plate washer or manually by filling the wells with
wash buffer and aspirating.
D. Detection Antibody:
1. Add 100 µL of the detection antibody solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate as specified in the kit instructions (typically at
room temperature for 30 minutes).
E. Substrate Addition:
1. Wash the plate as described above.
2. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
3. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for the time specified
in the kit instructions (typically 10-15 minutes).
F. Stopping Reaction:
1. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. This will change the
color from blue to yellow.
2. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
G. Reading the Results:
1. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
2. Record the optical density (OD) values.
6. CALCULATION OF PORK IGG CONCENTRATION
• Plot the standard curve using the OD values of the standards
against their respective concentrations.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of PORK
IGG in the samples by interpolation based on their OD values.
• Ensure results fall within the linear range of the standard curve.
Repeat specimens with values above or below the detection
range after appropriate dilution or concentration.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for acceptable ranges for
control values.
• Document and review control results before reporting patient
results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compare sample results to established reference ranges.
• Report concentrations of PORK IGG in micrograms per milliliter
(µg/mL), following the site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Review and verify results through the laboratory information
system (LIS).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that all steps are carried out accurately to avoid false
results.
• Be aware of potential cross-reactivity and non-specific binding,
which may interfere with assay results.
• Refer to the kit insert for specific reagent limitations and
troubleshooting tips.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert from the PORK IGG ELISA kit.
• Laboratory quality control protocols.
• Current literature on immunoassay techniques for PORK IGG
determination.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete the assay worksheet with raw data and calculated
results.
• Ensure all logs for equipment usage, temperature monitoring,
reagent preparation, and quality control are up to date and
reviewed regularly.
This SOP ensures the standardized and accurate generation of
results for PORK IGG testing, maintaining compliance with laboratory
standards and regulatory requirements.
