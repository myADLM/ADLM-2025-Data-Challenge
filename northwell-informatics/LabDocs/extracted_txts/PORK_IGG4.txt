Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PORK IGG4
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for PORK IGG4 in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This SOP ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures as defined in this SOP,
documenting results, and bringing any issues to the attention of a
supervisor. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
the SOP and addressing any procedural issues or deficiencies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimens for PORK IGG4
testing must be collected, received, and accessioned prior to
initiating the analytical phase.
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma collected in an SST or heparinized vacutainer
tube.
• Samples should be stored and transported at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens received in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or
EDTA tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PORK IGG4 assay kit (specify manufacturer)
• Calibrators and controls for PORK IGG4 assay
• Micropipettes and tips
• Test tubes and racks
• Timer
• Analytical balance
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-analytical Phase: a. Verify and document specimen receipt
and accession number. b. Inspect specimen for integrity
(absence of hemolysis, lipemia, icterus). c. Centrifuge the
sample at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate serum/
plasma. d. Aliquot serum or plasma into appropriately labeled
test tubes.
3. Analytical Phase: a. Prepare assay reagents as per
manufacturer’s guidelines. b. Calibrate micropipettes to ensure
accurate sample and reagent volumes. c. Add required volume
of serum/plasma (as specified in the assay kit) to the reaction
mixture. d. Incubate the reaction mixture at the specified
temperature and duration per manufacturer's instructions. e.
Measure the absorbance or signal as directed by the assay kit.
f. Enter raw data into LIS and calculate PORK IGG4
concentration using the provided standard curve.
4. Quality Control: a. Run assay controls (negative and positive)
alongside patient samples. b. Ensure control results fall within
specified ranges before accepting patient results. c. Document
control results and any corrective actions taken.
5. Reporting Results: a. Review generated data for accuracy and
completeness. b. Verify and validate results in the LIS. c. Enter
notes for results outside expected ranges and notify the
requesting physician as necessary. d. Report final results
following site-specific guidelines, including a note if results
cannot be provided due to interference.
6. REFERENCES List of manufacturer’s insert and assay
guidelines for PORK IGG4 kit.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to assay kit for limitations in
detecting PORK IGG4 due to interfering substances, insufficient
sample volume, or improper storage conditions.
8. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Any deviations from this protocol must be documented and
reviewed by a supervisor.
• Review new guidelines and updates from the manufacturer
periodically to ensure adherence to current best practices.
This SOP is effective from October 1, 2023, and must be reviewed
annually or when significant changes are implemented.
