Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Porphobilinogen (PBG) and
Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA), Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidelines for
the proper analytical procedure to measure Porphobilinogen
(PBG) and Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) in plasma samples using
HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) or an
appropriate alternative method as per laboratory standards.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the steps outlined in this procedure. It is
essential to ensure that all quality control and validation steps are
followed to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
1. SPECIMEN:
◦ Preferred/acceptable: Plasma samples collected in EDTA or
lithium heparin tubes.
◦ Unacceptable: Specimens collected in other anticoagulant
tubes (e.g., citrate, oxalate), hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric
samples.
Important: Samples should be transported on ice and promptly
centrifuged at 4°C to separate plasma from cells within 30 minutes of
collection. If delayed analysis is anticipated, the plasma should be
frozen immediately at -70°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
◦ HPLC system or LC-MS/MS with appropriate columns and
detectors
◦ Analytical-grade reagents and solvents (e.g., acetonitrile,
methanol, water)
◦ Derivatization reagents if required by the method
◦ Standard solutions of PBG and ALA
◦ Sample vials and caps
◦ Inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) for drying samples
◦ Micro-centrifuge and freezer (-70°C)
4. PROCEDURE:
Column and Instrument Setup:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Condition the column by running mobile phases through it until
stable baseline and pressure are achieved.
3. Calibrate the HPLC system with a series of PBG and ALA
standard solutions.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge at 4°C for 10 minutes at high speed to remove
particulate matter.
3. Transfer the required volume of plasma into a new
microcentrifuge tube.
Extraction and Derivatization: 4. Add an appropriate amount of
derivatization reagent (if applicable) and mix thoroughly. 5. Incubate
the sample according to the kit's or method's specifications. 6. If the
method requires extraction, add the extraction solvent, vortex, and
centrifuge at 4°C. Collect the supernatant for analysis.
HPLC Injection and Analysis: 7. Filter the supernatant through a
0.22 µm filter before vialing. 8. Load the filtered extract into the HPLC
autosampler vials, capping securely. 9. Inject a defined volume of the
prepared sample into the HPLC system. 10. Run the HPLC method
with appropriate settings (e.g., flow rate, gradient, temperature) as
validated for PBG and ALA analysis.
Data Acquisition and Interpretation: 11. Acquire the
chromatograms and detect the peaks corresponding to PBG and ALA
based on their retention times. 12. Integrate the peak areas and
compare with the calibration curves to determine the concentrations
of PBG and ALA in the plasma samples.
5. QUALITY CONTROL: 13. Include quality control samples with low,
medium, and high concentrations of PBG and ALA in each analytical
run to validate the assay performance. 14. Verify that QC results are
within the acceptable range before reporting patient results.
Investigate out-of-range QC results, re-run the samples or
troubleshoot the instrument as necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS: 15. Results are automatically recorded
and subjected to a verification process. 16. Transmit the results to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review. 17. The laboratory
technologist will review the results for accuracy and completeness,
checking for any discrepancies or abnormal values. 18. Report
results according to facility policy and include comments for any
abnormalities or issues encountered during analysis.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Consult clinical guidance or literature
for reference intervals applicable to the population served.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to specific method or instrument
manuals for limitations regarding sample interferences, linearity
ranges, and stability conditions.

10. AMENDMENTS/REVISIONS: Any changes to this SOP must be
documented and justified with appropriate validations and approvals.
