Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measuring
Porphobilinogen Deaminase Activity in Washed Erythrocytes
1. Purpose: This procedure aims to measure the activity of
porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) in washed erythrocytes,
critical for diagnosing disorders such as acute intermittent
porphyria.
2. Scope: This protocol applies to the clinical laboratory
performing biochemical and enzymatic assays in erythrocyte
preparations.
3. Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained medical
laboratory scientist or technologist to perform the assay, ensure
accuracy, and maintain quality control throughout the testing
process.
4. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred Specimen: Fresh whole blood collected in EDTA
anticoagulant.
◦ Volume Required: A minimum of 2 mL of whole blood.
◦ Stability: Keep the whole blood sample refrigerated at
2-8°C until processed, but do not freeze. Perform assays
within 24 hours of collection.
5. Materials and Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Reagent-grade water
◦ Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)
◦ Lysis buffer (as per manufacturer's specifications)
◦ Enzyme assay reagents (specific for PBGD activity)
◦ UV-Vis spectrophotometer
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Ice
6. Reagents Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents according to manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Lysis buffer: prepare fresh or according to stability
guidelines provided.
7. Procedure:
**A) Erythrocyte Washing: 1. Mix the whole blood sample
gently and transfer 2 mL to a centrifuge tube. 2. Centrifuge at
1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. 3. Carefully remove the plasma
and buffy coat without disturbing the erythrocytes. 4. Add 5 mL
of isotonic saline to the erythrocyte pellet. Mix gently. 5.
Centrifuge again at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. 6. Repeat
the wash step two more times for a total of three washes. 7.
After the final wash, remove the supernatant and resuspend the
erythrocyte pellet in isotonic saline to a final concentration of
approximately 50%.
B) Lysate Preparation: 1. Transfer 200 µL of the washed
erythrocyte suspension to a new microcentrifuge tube. 2. Add
800 µL of lysis buffer. Mix well. 3. Incubate on ice for 30
minutes. 4. Centrifuge at 3000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
pellet cellular debris. 5. Transfer the supernatant (erythrocyte
lysate) to a new tube.
C) Enzyme Assay: 1. Prepare the assay mixture with enzyme
assay reagents as specified by the kit or protocol. Include
appropriate standards and controls. 2. Pipette a specified
volume of erythrocyte lysate into the assay mixture. 3. Incubate
the mixture at 37°C for a specific time as detailed in the assay
protocol. 4. Stop the reaction as specified and prepare for
measurement. 5. Measure absorbance using a UV-Vis
spectrophotometer at a specified wavelength (usually ~555-565
nm).
8. Calculation of Results:
◦ Calculate the enzyme activity based on the absorbance
readings, incorporating standards and control values.
◦ Express results in units of enzyme activity per gram of
hemoglobin (U/g Hb) or other appropriate units as defined
by the laboratory's methodology.
9. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (positive and negative controls)
with each batch of assays.
◦ Maintain internal control logs.
◦ If controls are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
before reporting any patient results.
10. Reporting Results:
◦ Verify all results before reporting.
◦ Use the laboratory information system (LIS) to record and
transmit results.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
assay and the corrective actions taken.
11. Reference Range:
◦ The reference range for PBGD activity in washed
erythrocytes will be provided by the assay kit manufacturer
or as established by the laboratory’s validation studies.
12. Method Limitations:
◦ Hemolysis, sample age, and improper handling can affect
the results. Ensure all samples are processed according to
the guidelines.
◦ Refer to the assay kit insert for specific reagent and
procedural limitations.
13. Safety and Waste Handling:
◦ Follow the laboratory’s standard safety protocols for
handling biological samples and reagents.
◦ Dispose of waste according to biohazard regulations.
14. References and Documentation:
◦ Manufacturer’s insert for enzyme assay reagents.
◦ Standard Laboratory Quality Assurance and Quality Control
guidelines.
Revision History: - Document and register any changes to the
protocol in the laboratory’s document control system.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff should be able to reliably
measure porphobilinogen deaminase activity in washed erythrocytes,
ensuring accurate and reproducible results for clinical decision-
making.
