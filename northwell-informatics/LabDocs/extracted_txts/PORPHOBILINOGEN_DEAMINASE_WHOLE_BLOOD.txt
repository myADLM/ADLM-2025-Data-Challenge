PORPHOBILINOGEN DEAMINASE, WHOLE BLOOD - Standard
Operating Procedure
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this protocol is to provide clear instructions for the
analytical phase of testing Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBG-D)
activity in whole blood in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure
ensures the generation of accurate and reliable results.
1. Scope:
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel who
are trained to perform and interpret Porphobilinogen Deaminase
assays.
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Specimen Type:
▪ Whole blood, collected in an EDTA tube (lavender top).
◦ Specimen Volume:
▪ A minimum of 5 mL of whole blood.
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Whole blood should be kept refrigerated (4-8°C) if not
processed immediately and should be analyzed within
24 hours of collection.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens will
not be processed.
2. Equipment and Supplies:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Ice or refrigerated storage (4-8°C)
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Test tubes
◦ Porphobilinogen Deaminase Assay Kit
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Water bath or heating block set at 37°C
◦ Spectrophotometer (with appropriate settings for the assay)
3. Reagents:
◦ All reagents as provided by the Porphobilinogen Deaminase
Assay Kit
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
4. Quality Control:
◦ Include normal and abnormal control samples with each run.
◦ Verify that control values fall within the established range
before accepting patient results.
◦ Document all quality control activities as per laboratory
policy.
5. Procedure:
Sample Preparation:
a. Accept the whole blood sample and ensure it is correctly
labeled.
b. Mix the sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
c. Aliquot 1 mL of whole blood into appropriately labeled test
tubes.
Assay Setup:
a. Prepare all reagents and solutions as per the manufacturer's
instructions provided in the assay kit.
b. Bring all reagents, calibrators, and control samples to room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
Assay Procedure:
a. Lysis of Blood Cells: - Add 1 mL of PBS to each aliquot of
whole blood and mix well. - Incubate on ice for 10 minutes, then
centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. - Carefully
remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of
cold PBS. - Repeat the wash step.
b. Enzyme Reaction: - Prepare the reaction mix as instructed
in the assay kit. - Add the lysed and washed blood cell
suspension to the reaction mix. - Incubate in a water bath or
heating block at 37°C for the specified reaction time (typically
30 minutes).
c. Measurement: - Transfer the reaction mixture to a cuvette. -
Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
spectrophotometer. - Record the absorbance readings for each
sample, control, and calibrator.
6. Calculation of Results:
◦ Calculate the enzyme activity based on the change in
absorbance, using the formula provided by the assay kit.
◦ Compare the patient sample results with the normal
reference range provided in the kit or established by the
laboratory.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Verify and enter results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Include reference intervals on the report.
◦ All critical values must be promptly communicated to the
requesting physician and documented as per lab protocol.
8. References:
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the Porphobilinogen
Deaminase Assay Kit.
◦ CLSI Guidelines for the proper handling and processing of
whole blood specimens.
9. Document Control:
◦ This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as
needed by the laboratory Quality Assurance Committee.
Note: Any deviations from this procedure must be approved by a
laboratory supervisor and properly documented. This ensures
adherence to quality standards and the accuracy of test results.
