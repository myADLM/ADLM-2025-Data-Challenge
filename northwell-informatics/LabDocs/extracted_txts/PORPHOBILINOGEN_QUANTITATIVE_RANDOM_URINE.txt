Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Porphobilinogen,
Quantitative, Random, Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the analytical phase for
the quantitative analysis of porphobilinogen (PBG) in random urine
specimens. This analysis is typically performed to aid in the diagnosis
of acute intermittent porphyria and other disorders of porphyrin
metabolism.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
documenting, and verifying all steps outlined in this procedure. Staff
members are to ensure quality control measures are met and to
notify the supervisor of any discrepancies or issues during the
analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 10 mL random urine sample collected without preservatives.
• Store the specimen refrigerated (2-8ºC) if not processed
immediately.
• Specimen must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection to
ensure integrity.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected with preservatives.
• Specimens stored for more than 24 hours or not refrigerated.
• Specimens contaminated, severely hemolyzed, or with insufficient
volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Urine Analyzer or Specific PBG Analyzer
• Dilution reagents and calibrators
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high)
• Pipettes and tips
• Appropriate documentation logs
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Collect and handle urine specimens according to the 'Specimen
Requirements and Stability' section.
2. Ensure reagents, calibrators, and controls are at room
temperature before analysis.
B) Calibration
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Use calibration standards to ensure accuracy for PBG
measurement.
C) Analysis
1. Aliquot 10 mL of well-mixed random urine into a labeled sample
cup.
2. Load the urine sample onto the automated analyzer or
manually pipette into the specific PBG assay system.
3. Initiate the analysis process as outlined in the analyzer's
protocol.
D) Quality Control
1. Run quality control materials thrice daily at beginning, mid, and
end of batch analysis.
2. Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
3. Troubleshoot any QC failures as per manufacturer guidelines
and inform supervisor if unresolved.
E) Result Verification and Reporting
1. Review all analytical results for proper calibration, control
compliance, and data integrity.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure they are verified by the designated technologist.
3. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for porphobilinogen in random urine are
determined by the laboratory based on the population it serves and/
or provided in the manufacturer's instructions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the analyzer’s manual or reagent package insert for specific
limitations and interferences applicable to PBG quantitation. Note
that hemolyzed specimens, delayed processing, or contaminated
samples can affect assay accuracy.
1. REFERENCES
Utilize the analyzer’s operational manual and manufacturer’s product
inserts for detailed procedural instructions and troubleshooting
guides.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure detailed records are maintained for all calibration, quality
control, maintenance, and patient result logs according to standard
laboratory practices and regulatory compliance requirements.
This concludes the Standard Operating Procedure for the quantitative
analysis of porphobilinogen in random urine. Ensure all steps are
followed rigorously to maintain data integrity and diagnostic accuracy.
Any deviations or issues should be immediately reported and
documented for further evaluation.
