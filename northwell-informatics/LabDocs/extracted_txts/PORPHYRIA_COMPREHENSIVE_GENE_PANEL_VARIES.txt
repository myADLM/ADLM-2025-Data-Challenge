Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Porphyria Comprehensive Gene Panel,
Varies
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase
of generating results for the Porphyria Comprehensive Gene Panel,
Varies. This includes the procedures for preparation, quality control,
sequencing, data analysis, and result validation, ensuring accurate
and reliable diagnostic data for patients.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the steps outlined in this procedure. It is
the responsibility of all staff to adhere to the protocol and report any
deviations to a supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS Porphyria Comprehensive Gene Panel: A diagnostic
test designed to detect mutations in genes associated with various
types of porphyria.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Nucleic acid extraction kit
• Quantitative PCR (qPCR) machine
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion
Torrent)
• Porphyria gene panel kit (specific to the sequencing platform)
• Bioinformatics analysis software
• Analytical instruments and computers with necessary software
• Quality control materials
5. SAMPLE PREPARATION
A. DNA Extraction
1. Use the nucleic acid extraction kit to extract DNA from the
clinical specimen.
2. Measure DNA concentration using Qubit or Nanodrop.
3. Ensure the DNA purity (A260/A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0).
B. Library Preparation
1. Follow the protocol specific to the Porphyria gene panel kit.
2. Fragment the DNA into appropriate sizes if necessary.
3. Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation.
4. Amplify the library using PCR (conditions will vary based on the
kit used).
C. Quality Control of Libraries
1. Measure the library concentration using qPCR or Bioanalyzer.
2. Verify the size distribution using Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
6. SEQUENCING
A. Load Libraries onto Sequencing Platform
1. Dilute the libraries to the required concentration specified by the
sequencing platform.
2. Load the libraries into the sequencer following the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Run Sequencing
1. Set up the sequencing run parameters based on the
recommendations for the Porphyria gene panel.
2. Monitor the run to ensure proper performance.
7. DATA ANALYSIS
A. Primary Data Analysis
1. Upload sequencing data to the analysis software.
2. Perform base calling and generate FASTQ files.
3. Assess the quality of reads (e.g., Q30 score, read length).
B. Secondary Data Analysis
1. Align reads to the human reference genome.
2. Identify variants (SNPs, indels) using variant calling software.
3. Annotate variants with relevant databases (e.g., dbSNP,
ClinVar).
C. Tertiary Data Analysis
1. Interpret variant pathogenicity using ACMG guidelines.
2. Use bioinformatics tools to predict the impact of detected
variants on protein function.
3. Cross-reference variants with known porphyria mutations.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Monitor sequence quality indicators (e.g. coverage, depth, base
quality scores).
3. If controls fail, troubleshoot and rerun the affected samples.
B. Proficiency Testing
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs if available.
2. Compare laboratory performance against external benchmarks.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify the analytical validity of the results.
2. Double-check all data analysis steps and results interpretation.
3. Generate a comprehensive report including:
◦ Detected variants and their clinical significance.
◦ Methodological notes.
◦ Limitations of the test.
4. Review the report with a qualified supervisor or laboratory
director.
5. Provide reports to the attending clinician or referring entity.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. This test detects only the mutations in genes included in the
panel.
2. The sensitivity and specificity of variant detection are influenced
by the sequencing depth and quality.
3. Certain types of genetic mutations (e.g., large deletions,
duplications) may not be detected by this method.

12. DOCUMENTATION AND VERIFICATION
1. Maintain all records of sample processing, sequencing runs,
data analysis, and result interpretation.
2. Document all deviations, corrective actions, and preventive
measures.
3. Verify that all SOPS, logs, and manual entries are signed by the
performing technician and approved by a supervisor.
