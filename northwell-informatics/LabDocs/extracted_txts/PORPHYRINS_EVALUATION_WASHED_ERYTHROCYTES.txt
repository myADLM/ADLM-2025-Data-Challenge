STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) PORPHYRINS
EVALUATION, WASHED ERYTHROCYTES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
generating results for porphyrins evaluation in washed erythrocytes.
This evaluation is critical for diagnosing and monitoring patients with
disorders related to heme metabolism.
2. DEFINITION
Porphyrins are a group of organic compounds, many of which are
precursors to heme, an essential component of hemoglobin.
Evaluation of porphyrins in washed erythrocytes involves qualitative
and quantitative analysis of these compounds to detect
abnormalities.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately to ensure reliable and reproducible results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for verifying that the
personnel are properly trained and that quality control measures are
adhered to.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top tube).
Volume Required:
• Minimum of 5 mL of whole blood.
Handling and Storage:
• The specimen should be stored and transported at 4°C.
• The erythrocytes must be washed and the specimen processed
within 24 hours of collection to ensure stability.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Hemolyzing solution (0.9% saline solution)
• pH meter or pH indicator strips
• Spectrophotometer or HPLC system
• Standard porphyrin solutions for calibration
• Clean glass or plastic containers
• Protective laboratory gear (gloves, goggles, lab coat)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Sample Washing:
◦ Centrifuge the collected whole blood at 1500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C.
◦ Carefully aspirate and discard the plasma and buffy coat.
◦ Add an equal volume of cold 0.9% saline solution to the
erythrocytes.
◦ Mix gently and centrifuge again at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Repeat the washing step three times to ensure the removal
of plasma and any residual leukocytes and platelets.
2. Hemolysis:
◦ After the final wash, resuspend the erythrocytes in a minimal
volume of saline.
◦ Hemolyze the erythrocytes by freezing and thawing or by
adding equal volume of a hemolyzing solution (always follow
the lab's specific protocol).
B. Porphyrins Extraction and Measurement
1. Extraction:
◦ Acidify the hemolyzed erythrocyte suspension to a pH of 2-3
using an appropriate acid (e.g., 10% trichloroacetic acid or
3N hydrochloric acid).
◦ Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Centrifuge the acidified mixture at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove precipitated proteins and cellular debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube for analysis.
2. Measurement:
◦ Calibrate the spectrophotometer or HPLC system with
standard porphyrin solutions according to manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Measure the absorbance of the extracted porphyrins at the
appropriate wavelengths (typically 400-480 nm for
porphyrins).
◦ If using HPLC, follow the specific protocol for elution and
detection of the various porphyrin species.
C. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run controls alongside patient samples. Controls should
include normal, low, and high porphyrin concentrations.
◦ Document all control results to ensure the assay is
performing within the established parameters.
2. Corrective Actions:
◦ If control results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
the process starting with reagent integrity, calibration of
equipment, and technique accuracy.
◦ Repeat the wash and extraction process if needed for
control recovery.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Interpret the results according to the standard reference
ranges provided by the clinical guidelines.
◦ Include a detailed report noting any deviations in values,
potential interferences, and final interpretation based on the
clinical context.
2. Documentation:
◦ All results should be documented and verified by a
laboratory technologist.
◦ Input the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and final verification by the pathologist.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS
• Ensure specimens are processed within the stability period to
prevent degradation of porphyrins.
• Handle all samples with care using appropriate protective gear, as
blood samples are biohazardous.
• Cross-contamination must be avoided to ensure accurate results.

porphyrins analysis.

procedure.
