Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Porphyrins Evaluation
in Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures
for the evaluation of porphyrins in whole blood samples. This
procedure ensures the accurate and reliable measurement of
porphyrin levels, which is essential for diagnosing and
monitoring conditions like porphyrias.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
◦ Whole Blood
Collection Tubes:
◦ EDTA (lavender top) tube
Volume:
◦ Minimum 4 mL of whole blood
Handling:
◦ Blood samples should be protected from light to prevent
degradation of porphyrins. Wrap the tubes in aluminum foil
or use light-protective containers immediately after
collection.
◦ After collection, keep the samples at 2-8°C and avoid
freezing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Laboratory technologists trained in porphyrin analysis are
responsible for performing the analysis.
◦ The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that
the equipment is calibrated, reagents are prepared correctly,
and the technologists adhere to standard laboratory
practices.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
◦ Spectrofluorometer or HPLC with fluorescence detector
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and tips
Reagents:
◦ Extraction solvent (e.g., methanol)
◦ Standards for quantification of porphyrins
◦ Quality control materials
Supplies:
◦ Light-protective tubes or wraps
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Sample vials for HPLC
◦ Data recording logbook
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure specimens are shielded from light from the moment
of collection until analysis.
◦ Mix the whole blood sample thoroughly before aliquoting to
maintain homogeneity.
B) Extraction of Porphyrins:
◦ Aliquot 1 mL of whole blood into a light-protected tube.
◦ Add 4 mL of extraction solvent to the sample.
◦ Vortex the sample for 1-2 minutes to ensure complete
mixing.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a new light-protected centrifuge
tube while avoiding the pellet.
C) Analysis by Spectrofluorometer or HPLC:
◦ Calibrate the instrument daily using porphyrin standards.
◦ Inject the extracted sample into the HPLC or prepare for
spectrofluorometer analysis.
◦ For HPLC, follow the specific gradient and settings as per
manufacturer instructions.
◦ For spectrofluorometer, measure the fluorescence intensity
at the following excitation/emission wavelengths (e.g.,
400/620 nm for total porphyrins).
D) Data Analysis and Interpretation:
◦ Compare the sample fluorescence or chromatogram peaks
with standards to quantify porphyrin levels.
◦ Record all readings in the data recording logbook, ensuring
traceability.
◦ Validate with quality control samples to ensure the accuracy
of the results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include at least one internal quality control sample with each
batch of patient samples analyzed.
◦ Perform inter-laboratory comparisons bi-annually to ensure
consistency and accuracy.
◦ Check linearity, precision, and accuracy of the instrument
with appropriate controls.
7. RESULTS REPORTING
◦ Validate and transmit results to the laboratory information
system (LIS) after confirming QC acceptance.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the responsible
technologist.
◦ Notify physicians or requesting departments of critical
results immediately.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals should be determined based on the
specific population and methods used. Refer to the latest
published guidelines and validate ranges in-house.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Results may be influenced by factors such as interfering
substances in the specimen (e.g., hemolysis).
◦ Exposure of the sample to light can degrade porphyrins,
leading to inaccurate results.
