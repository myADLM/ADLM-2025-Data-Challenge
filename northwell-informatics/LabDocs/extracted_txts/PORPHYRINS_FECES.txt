Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Determining Fecal
Porphyrins
1. PURPOSE
To accurately determine the presence and concentration of
porphyrins in feces samples by utilizing an appropriate analytical
method.
Responsibility:
Laboratory staff are responsible for following this procedure, ensuring
sample integrity, and accurately documenting results. The supervisor
must verify protocols, results, and manage any discrepancies that
might occur.
2. PRINCIPLE
Porphyrins are a group of organic compounds, many of which are
precursors to heme and can be indicative of various disorders.
Determination of fecal porphyrins can provide valuable diagnostic
information.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Fecal samples
• Container: Clean, dry, leak-proof container
• Volume: Preferably 5-10 grams of stool
• Storage: Refrigerate samples at 2-8°C if analysis is not
immediately performed, stable for 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens contaminated with urine or water.
• Samples with insufficient volume (less than 1 gram).
• Samples not stored under correct conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
with fluorescence detector
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ pH meter
• Reagents:
◦ Acetonitrile
◦ Methanol
◦ Water (HPLC grade)
◦ Ethyl acetate
◦ Sodium acetate
◦ Glacial acetic acid
◦ Internal standard solution
◦ Calibration standards for porphyrins (uroporphyrin,
coproporphyrin, protoporphyrin)
• Supplies:
◦ Glass or plastic tubes
◦ Syringes and filters
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenization:
◦ Homogenize 5-10 grams of feces in a clean container.
2. Extraction:
◦ Weigh approximately 1 gram of homogenized feces into a
centrifuge tube.
◦ Add 10 mL of ethyl acetate/acetic acid mixture (1:5, v/v).
◦ Vortex for 3-5 minutes to ensure thorough mixing.
3. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean glass tube.
4. Evaporation:
◦ Evaporate the supernatant to dryness under nitrogen at
40°C.
5. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the dried residue in 1 mL of the mobile phase
(acetonitrile/water, 50:50 v/v).
5.2 HPLC Analysis:
1. Setting up HPLC:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC system using porphyrin calibration
standards.
◦ Ensure column temperature is set at 30°C.
◦ Use mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water (50:50
v/v).
◦ Set the flow rate to 1.0 mL/min.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject 20 µL of the sample extract into the HPLC system.
3. Detection:
◦ Utilize a fluorescence detector for porphyrin detection, with
excitation at 405 nm and emission at 620 nm.
4. Run Time:
◦ The total run time should be 30 minutes per sample.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control samples (positive and negative
controls) with each batch of patient samples.
• The QC samples should demonstrate expected porphyrin
concentrations correlating with control standards.
• If QC samples fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot the
assay and repeat sampling as necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Quantification:
◦ Perform quantification using the HPLC software based on the
calibration curve generated with standard porphyrin solutions.
• Documentation:
◦ Record results, including sample ID, porphyrin concentrations
in µg/g (micrograms per gram) of feces, and any anomalies.
• Interpretation:
◦ Compare results against reference ranges provided in medical
literature or institutional guidelines.
Reference Ranges:
• Uroporphyrin: <10 µg/g feces
• Coproporphyrin: <50 µg/g feces
• Protoporphyrin: <20 µg/g feces
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results can be compromised by improper sample collection and
storage.
• High fat content in feces can interfere with extraction efficiency.
• Ensure samples are free from contamination which can potentially
alter the porphyrin profile.

• Current literature on the determination of porphyrins in human
samples.

This protocol ensures accurate, reproducible, and reliable results for
fecal porphyrins, enabling appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic
decisions by clinical staff.
