STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) PORPHYRINS,
QUANTITATIVE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized instructions for the
quantitative analysis of porphyrins in a 24-hour urine specimen
to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure exactly as outlined. All
personnel must be trained and deemed competent before
performing the assay.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Collection:
◦ A 24-hour urine collection must be completed.
◦ The patient must be instructed to avoid red meat, fish, and
specific medications (e.g. barbiturates, sulfonamides) 72 hours
before and during the collection period to prevent interference.
◦ The collection container should contain 5 grams of sodium
carbonate (Na2CO3) as a preservative.
◦ Proper instructions must be given to the patient for complete
urine collection for 24 hours including start and end time
documentation.
• Specimen volume:
◦ A minimum of 100 mL of well-mixed 24-hour urine is required
for analysis, but the total volume should be noted and
recorded.
• Transportation & Storage:
◦ Once collection is complete, the sample must be stored at
4-8°C until delivered to the laboratory.
◦ The specimen should arrive in the laboratory within 48 hours
of completing the collection to avoid degradation of porphyrins.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• pH test strips
• Light-protected tubes
• Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and Hydrochloric acid (HCl) for pH
adjustment
• Porphyrin assay kit (manufacturer-specific instructions to be
followed; e.g., Fluorescence detection kit)
• Fluorometer or Spectrophotometer
• Pipettes and Tips (variable volumes)
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibration:
◦ Ensure the fluorometer/spectrophotometer is calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions before starting the
assay.
• Quality Control:
◦ Use commercial porphyrin control material at two
concentration levels (normal and elevated) with each assay
run.
◦ Run blanks and standards in parallel to samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, mix the 24-hour urine collection well to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Measure and record the total urine volume.
3. Aliquot a suitable volume (~5-10 mL) of the well-mixed urine
sample into a light-protected tube.
4. Check the pH of the sample; it should be neutral (pH 7.0).
Adjust the pH if necessary using 1 N NaOH or 1 N HCl.
5. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates. Transfer the supernatant to a new light-
protected tube.
B) Analytical Procedure:
1. Follow specific instructions provided with the porphyrin assay
kit to prepare reagents and samples.
2. Add appropriate volumes of urine, controls, and standards to
their respective wells/tubes as per the instructions.
3. Incubate the samples for the specified time and temperature as
instructed in the assay kit.
4. Measure the fluorescence of each sample, control, and
standard using the fluorometer, set to the specified excitation
and emission wavelengths detailed in the assay kit.
C) Calculation of Porphyrin Concentrations:
1. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the fluorescence
intensities of the standards against their concentrations.
2. Calculate the concentration of unknown samples by
interpolating from the calibration curve.
3. Express the results as µg/24 hours of total porphyrin:
Concentration in µg/mL x Total Volume in mL = µg/24 hours.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in µg per 24 hours based on the total urinary
output.
• Interpretation:
◦ Normal Range: <50 µg/24 hours (values may vary slightly by
laboratory; refer to reference intervals established by internal
validation).
• Include comments on sample integrity if any anomalies were
noted during analysis.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS AND FOLLOW-UP
• Review and verify all values before reporting.
• If results are significantly elevated, suggest repeat testing and/or
further clinical evaluation as porphyrinurias may indicate various
disorders, including hepatic and erythropoietic porphyrias.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• The frequency of quality control (QC) fails and corrective actions
should be logged.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, reanalyze QC
materials and take corrective actions, including recalibration of
devices if necessary.
• Document all troubleshooting processes.
