Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PORPHYRINS, QUANTITATIVE, RANDOM
URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the quantitative analysis of
porphyrins in random urine specimens. It ensures uniformity and
consistency of results, while maintaining quality and reliability in the
detection and measurement of porphyrins.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Freshly voided random urine collected in a clean, dry
container.
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL.
Stability:
• The specimen must be protected from light and ideally stored in a
light-resistant container.
• Avoid prolonged exposure to ambient light.
• Store at 4-8°C if analysis is not performed immediately.
• If frozen, store at -20°C, and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens showing signs of contamination.
• Specimens with visible particulate matter, or hemolyzed
specimens.
• Specimens received without proper labeling indicating the
collection date and time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Spectrophotometer or HPLC system.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Light-resistant containers.
Reagents:
• Acetate buffer solution.
• Sodium acetate.
• Glacial acetic acid.
• Saponin.
• Standard porphyrin solutions (uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and
other relevant standards).
Supplies:
• Clean urine collection containers.
• Light-sensitive labels.
• Laboratory glassware (flasks, beakers).
• pH meter.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Urine Specimen:
1. Allow the urine specimen to equilibrate to room temperature
away from direct light.
2. Mix the specimen well before aliquoting.
3. Transfer a suitable volume (e.g., 5 mL) of urine into a light-
resistant container.
Extraction and Quantification:
1. Centrifuge the urine specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean, light-resistant container.
3. Prepare the extraction buffer by mixing acetate buffer solution
with glacial acetic acid and saponin.
4. Add the extraction buffer to the urine specimen in a 1:1 ratio.
5. Vortex the mixture thoroughly for 30 seconds.
6. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes to ensure proper
extraction.
7. Measure the pH and adjust to pH 4-5 using glacial acetic acid.
8. Quantify porphyrins using either spectrophotometry or HPLC
system in accordance with the instrument’s operational
procedures.
◦ Spectrophotometry:
▪ Set the spectrophotometer to the appropriate
wavelength.
▪ Measure absorbance at the specific wavelengths for
uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and other relevant
porphyrins.
◦ HPLC:
▪ Use pre-set HPLC conditions (column type, mobile
phase, flow rate).
▪ Run the prepared sample through the HPLC column.
▪ Detect peaks corresponding to distinct porphyrins and
quantify based on standard curves.
Data Analysis and Calculation:
1. Compare the absorbance values or HPLC peak areas against
standard curves to quantify porphyrin levels in the sample.
2. Record concentrations in µmol/L.
Quality Control:
1. Use control urine specimens containing known concentrations
of porphyrins with each batch of tests.
2. Run internal quality controls (IQC) and external quality controls
(EQC) as per the laboratory guidelines.
3. Verify that all control results fall within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results. Document any discrepancies and
corrective actions.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Always refer to site-specific reference intervals for each porphyrin
being evaluated.
Reporting:
1. Enter the quantified results for each porphyrin in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify results according to established protocols.
3. Add any comments related to sample integrity or method
limitations.
Critical Results:
• Critical values for porphyrins should be flagged in the LIS and
reported to the appropriate healthcare provider immediately.
