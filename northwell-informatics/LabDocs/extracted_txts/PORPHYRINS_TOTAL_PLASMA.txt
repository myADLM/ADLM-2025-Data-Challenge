Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Total
Plasma Porphyrins
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed and standardized procedure
for the analysis of total porphyrins in plasma samples. Proper
implementation of this SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible test results.
2. SCOPE This SOP covers all steps from the receipt of the
sample in the laboratory to the reporting of results. It is intended
for use by trained and certified laboratory personnel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to follow the procedures as outlined to ensure the
integrity and accuracy of test results. The supervising
technologist is responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol and for addressing any deviations or issues that may
arise during the testing process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Type of Specimen: Plasma
◦ Collection Tube: Use an EDTA tube (purple top).
◦ Volume: A minimum of 2 mL plasma is required.
◦ Handling: Plasma must be separated from cells within 2
hours of collection. Store plasma samples refrigerated at
2-8°C if the analysis is to be performed within 24 hours,
otherwise, samples must be frozen at -20°C or lower.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic
specimens are not acceptable. Samples received in the
laboratory more than 24 hours after collection without being
frozen are also unacceptable.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Fluorometer or Spectrofluorometer
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ 0.9% saline solution
◦ Extraction solvents (acetonitrile, methanol)
◦ Standard porphyrin solutions
◦ Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation 1. Thaw frozen
specimens at room temperature if applicable. 2. Centrifuge
plasma samples at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
remaining particulates. 3. Aliquot 1 mL of the clear supernatant
to a new labeled tube.
B. Porphyrin Extraction 1. Add 2 volumes of acetonitrile to the
plasma aliquot to precipitate proteins. 2. Vortex mix for 1
minute. 3. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 x g for 10 minutes. 4.
Transfer the supernatant to a new labeled tube. 5. Evaporate
the solvent under nitrogen gas or in a centrifugal evaporator. 6.
Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of methanol.
C. Analysis 1. Calibrate the Fluorometer or Spectrofluorometer
according to manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Prepare standard
porphyrin solutions in methanol for a calibration curve. 3.
Pipette 100 µL of plasma extract or standard solution into a
cuvette. 4. Run the analysis using the appropriate settings for
porphyrin detection. - Excitation wavelength: ~405 nm -
Emission wavelength: ~620 nm
D. Calculation 1. Create a standard curve using the readings
from the calibration standards. 2. Calculate the concentration of
total porphyrins in the plasma samples by comparing their
fluorescence intensities to the standard curve. 3. Ensure
calculations account for any dilution or concentration steps
performed during sample preparation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL A. Run quality control samples (both
positive and negative controls) at the beginning of each batch.
B. Results for QC samples must be within the established
acceptable range. C. If QC results are out of the acceptable
range, troubleshoot the issue, recalibrate the equipment if
necessary, and rerun the controls. D. Document all QC results
and any corrective actions taken in the QC log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS A. Review the calculated results for
consistency and accuracy. B. Report total plasma porphyrin
concentrations in micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL). C. Validate
and verify each result in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) before reporting. D. Abnormal or critical results must be
communicated to the requesting physician as per laboratory
policy, and documented accordingly.
9. REFERENCE VALUES
◦ Normal Range: 0-1.0 µg/dL (Note: Reference ranges may
vary; cross-reference with laboratory guidelines)
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis can interfere with results. Ensure samples are
handled correctly to avoid hemolysis.
◦ Extreme icterus may interfere with fluorescence readings.

analysis.
