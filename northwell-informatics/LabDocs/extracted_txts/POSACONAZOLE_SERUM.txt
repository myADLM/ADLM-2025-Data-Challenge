Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Posaconazole,
Serum
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantification of
posaconazole in serum samples using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. This SOP ensures accuracy,
reproducibility, and compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
All qualified laboratory personnel responsible for the analysis of
posaconazole in serum samples are to follow the procedures outlined
in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring procedures are
adhered to and quality control measures are followed.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin)
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours at room temperature
(15-25°C).
• For long-term storage, serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days or at -20°C for up to 3 months.
1. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies
• HPLC or LC-MS/MS system equipped with appropriate detectors
(UV photodiode array or mass spectrometer)
• Posaconazole reference standard
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol, water, buffer
solutions)
• Sample preparation reagents (e.g., protein precipitation agents,
extraction solvents)
• Calibrators and quality control material
• Serum separator tubes or red-top tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
1. Quality Control
• Perform quality control with each analytical batch using at least
two levels of control materials.
• Calibrators should cover the anticipated range of posaconazole
concentrations in patient samples.
• Results should be charted and monitored for trends using control
charts.
1. Analytical Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes
at 4°C to separate the serum from the clot. Transfer the clear
supernatant to a clean tube.
2. Prepare the serum sample for analysis according to the chosen
technique (HPLC or LC-MS/MS). This typically involves:
i) Adding an internal standard to the serum sample. ii) Protein
precipitation: Add protein precipitation agent (e.g., acetonitrile)
to the serum sample, vortex the mixture, and centrifuge to
separate precipitated proteins. Transfer the supernatant to a
clean tube. iii) Solid-phase extraction (SPE) if required: Load
the serum onto SPE cartridge, wash, and elute the
posaconazole into a clean tube. iv) Dilution: Dilute the final
extract if necessary, based on the expected concentration
range.
B. Instrument Calibration
1. Prepare calibration standards at appropriate concentrations
using the posaconazole reference standard.
2. Perform instrument calibration by running the calibration
standards through the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
3. Ensure that calibration curves meet acceptance criteria with
correlation coefficients (r) of at least 0.995.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Inject prepared serum samples into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
system following the established method.
2. Acquire and process data using instrument software.
3. Ensure peaks corresponding to posaconazole and the internal
standard are correctly identified and integrated.
4. Quantify posaconazole concentrations in serum samples using
the calibration curve.
D. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify all results in the laboratory information
system (LIS) before reporting.
2. Results above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) should
be diluted appropriately and reanalyzed.
3. Report posaconazole concentrations in serum in mcg/mL.
