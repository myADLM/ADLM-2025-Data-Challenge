Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
POSACONAZOLE SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide clear guidelines for the
procedures for conducting Posaconazole susceptibility testing of
pathogenic fungal isolates in the laboratory. Accurate and
reproducible susceptibility testing is crucial for guiding effective
treatment decisions in clinical practice.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated lab personnel to perform
Posaconazole susceptibility testing according to this SOP and to
ensure that all results are accurately interpreted, documented, and
reported. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing the final results
and addressing any discrepancies or issues encountered during
testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Clinical fungal isolates
Specimen Collection and Storage:
• Isolates should be collected and subcultured onto appropriate
fungal media (e.g., Sabouraud dextrose agar) for purity.
• Once isolated colonies are obtained, they should be used for
susceptibility testing within 7 days.
• If delays are anticipated, the isolates should be stored at 2-8°C or
in appropriate cryopreservation solutions at -70°C.
1. MATERIALS, REAGENTS, AND EQUIPMENT
Materials:
• Sterile inoculation loops or needles
• Microdilution trays or E-test strips specific for Posaconazole
• Sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl)
• RPMI 1640 medium with MOPS buffer
Reagents:
• Posaconazole powder (reference standard) or commercially
prepared Posaconazole susceptibility testing kits
Equipment:
• Biological safety cabinet
• Spectrophotometer or nephelometer
• Incubator maintained at 35±2°C
• Micropipettors and sterile tips
• Laboratory timer
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Inoculum: A. Remove a loopful of the pure fungal
colony grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar. B. Suspend the colony in
sterile saline to achieve a turbidity equivalent to a No. 0.5 McFarland
standard (approximately 1-5 x 10^6 CFU/mL).
Microdilution Method: A. Prepare the RPMI 1640 medium with MOPS
buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. B. Dispense the
prepared inoculum into the microdilution trays or appropriate wells. C.
Add Posaconazole to the wells in a dilution series to obtain final
concentrations ranging from 0.016 to 16 µg/mL. D. Mix the trays
gently and cover with a sterile lid or adhesive seal. E. Incubate the
trays at 35±2°C for 48-72 hours. F. After incubation, examine the
trays for fungal growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
is the lowest concentration of Posaconazole that completely inhibits
visible fungal growth.
E-test Method: A. Apply the E-test strip onto the surface of an RPMI
agar plate that has been inoculated with the prepared fungal
suspension. B. Incubate the plates at 35±2°C for 48-72 hours. C.
Read the MIC at the point where the elliptical zone of inhibition
intersects the scale on the E-test strip.
Quality Control: A. Include quality control (QC) strains, such as
Candida albicans ATCC 90028, with known susceptibility profiles in
each test run. B. Ensure that the QC results fall within the established
reference ranges for each included strain.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Document the MIC values and interpret the susceptibility results
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) or
European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
(EUCAST) breakpoints. B. Report the results as either susceptible,
intermediate, or resistant.
Sample Report:
• Fungal isolate: Candida glabrata
• Posaconazole MIC: 0.25 µg/mL
• Interpretation: Susceptible
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to current CLSI or EUCAST guidelines for breakpoint
definitions and interpretation criteria.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure correct inoculum density; discrepancies in the inoculum
concentration can affect the accuracy of the MIC.
• Prolonged incubation times or deviations in temperature may alter
the results.
• Not all fungal species have defined breakpoints for Posaconazole
susceptibility.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all biosafety and hazard precautions when handling clinical
fungal isolates.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste material in accordance with
institutional guidelines.
