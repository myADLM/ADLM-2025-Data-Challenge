POSTMORTEM AORTOPATHY GENE PANEL, TISSUE SOP
1. PURPOSE
To accurately analyze and generate results for the postmortem
aortopathy gene panel from tissue specimens, ensuring high-quality
and reliable data for genetic analysis.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP. All staff must ensure
proper handling and documentation of specimens and results, and
notify supervisors of any discrepancies or issues.

◦ Tissue preserved in formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Degraded or improperly preserved tissue.
◦ Specimens that are not accompanied by proper
documentation or do not meet collection date/time
requirements.

1. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Preparation and DNA/RNA Extraction:
• Fresh/Frozen Tissue:
1. Thaw frozen tissue if applicable.
2. Using a sterile microtome, cut thin sections for extraction.
3. Place tissue sections in a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
4. Extract DNA or RNA using the appropriate extraction kit
following the manufacturer's instructions. Store extracted
DNA/RNA at -20°C until use.
• Formalin-fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Tissue:
1. Trim excess paraffin from the tissue block.
2. Cut thin sections using a sterile microtome.
3. Deparaffinize tissue sections with xylene.
4. Proceed with DNA/RNA extraction using the appropriate kit
and store extracted DNA/RNA at -20°C.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix including primers specific to the
aortopathy gene panel.
2. Add extracted DNA/RNA to the PCR mix.
3. Perform amplification using a PCR thermocycler under
optimized conditions for the gene panel.
4. Verify PCR product integrity via gel electrophoresis.
C) Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a purification kit.
2. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer.
3. Perform library preparation as per the sequencing platform's
protocol.
4. Load prepared library onto the sequencing platform and run the
sequencing.
D) Data Analysis and Result Generation:
1. Analyze sequencing output using bioinformatics tools specific to
the gene panel.
2. Collate and interpret genetic variants in the context of
aortopathy.
3. Generate a report detailing the genetic findings.
E) Quality Control and Validation:
• Internal QC:
◦ Perform bi-weekly runs with known standards for validation.
◦ Implement a monthly cross-comparison with other instruments
as detailed in the SOP.
• Solution Pack and Sensor Cassette Validation:
◦ Follow outlined steps for correlation checks upon changes in
reagents or instrumentation, as applicable.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to LIS and reviewed by
the technologist.
2. Verify results for accuracy and integrity, referencing critical
values and quality control data where applicable.
3. Include specific comments on sample integrity or issues
encountered during analysis.
4. REFERENCES
Refer to relevant product inserts, kit manuals, and sequencing
platform documentation for detailed procedural guidelines and
limitations.
All staff must adhere to these procedures to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of postmortem aortopathy gene panel results.
