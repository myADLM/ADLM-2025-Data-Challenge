Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for POSTMORTEM ARRHYTHMIA GENE
PANEL, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed guidelines on the
analytical phase of generating results for the Postmortem Arrhythmia
Gene Panel using tissue samples. These guidelines include protocols
for DNA extraction, preparation, amplification, sequencing, and
results interpretation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
postmortem genetic analysis.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
all analytical procedures and document results according to this SOP.
They must ensure that all steps are conducted accurately to maintain
the integrity of the results. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing
and verifying all documented results and taking corrective measures
when necessary.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Fresh or frozen tissue samples obtained postmortem stored at
-80°C.
Unacceptable:
• Tissue samples stored at ambient temperature for prolonged
periods.
• Samples without proper labeling of collection date/time and
identification.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Tissue homogenizer
• Centrifuge
• DNA extraction kit (commercially available)
• PCR thermocycler
• Sequencing instruments (e.g., Next-Generation Sequencing
platforms)
• Pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR reagents and master mix
• Primers specific to the arrhythmia gene panel
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Homogenize tissue sample using a tissue homogenizer.
2. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol for the isolation of
genomic DNA from the homogenized tissue.
3. Quantify and assess purity of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until use.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to manufacturer's
instructions and include tissue-specific primers.
2. Aliquot the PCR master mix into PCR tubes and add extracted
DNA.
3. Perform PCR amplification using thermocycler, following
specific thermal cycling conditions for the arrhythmia gene
panel.
4. Verify PCR product by gel electrophoresis.
C. Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a purification kit.
2. Prepare sequencing library according to sequencing platform
instructions (e.g., Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep protocol).
3. Quantify and assess library quality using a bioanalyzer.
4. Load library onto the sequencing instrument and initiate
sequencing run.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Process raw sequencing data using bioinformatics pipelines for
alignment to a reference genome.
2. Analyze the data for variants in arrhythmia-associated genes
using appropriate software tools.
3. Annotate identified variants using available databases and
literature.
E. Results Interpretation:
1. Compile analysis results into a comprehensive report.
2. Interpret variant significance based on phenotype, available
family history, and existing clinical data.
3. Review the report for accuracy and completeness.
4. Document and verify results appropriately.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Implement quality control measures at each step to ensure integrity
and reliability of results:
• Validate DNA extraction efficiency
• Run positive and negative controls during PCR and sequencing
• Perform repeat runs or alternate methods if initial results are
inconsistent
• Assess accuracy of variant annotation through comparison with
known standards
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be thoroughly reviewed and documented. Include
interpretations relevant to the clinical context. Sign off by responsible
laboratory personnel and ensure data are securely stored in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Recognize potential limitations such as the quality of postmortem
tissue, sequencing errors, or extraction efficiency. Document any
anomalies observed during the analytical procedures.
