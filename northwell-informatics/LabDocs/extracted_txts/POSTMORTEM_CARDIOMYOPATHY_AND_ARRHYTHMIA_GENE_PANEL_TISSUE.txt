Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Postmortem Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmia Gene Panel, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
genetic results for the Postmortem Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmia
Gene Panel from tissue samples to ensure accurate, reliable, and
timely results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow
the outlined procedures accurately.
• All staff must ensure the integrity of the sample and report any
potential issues to a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Postmortem Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmia Gene Panel refers to a
comprehensive genetic analysis focused on identifying genetic
mutations associated with cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia in tissue
samples taken postmortem.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue Types: Heart, liver, or other relevant tissues.
• Tissue Preservation: Fresh-frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue is
preferred.
• Quantity: At least a 250 mg tissue sample is necessary for
accurate analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-throughput sequencer (e.g., Illumina or Ion Torrent)
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen)
• PCR reagents and consumables
• Various library preparation kits specific to panel requirements
• Quantification tools (e.g., Qubit fluorometer, Bioanalyzer)
• Thermal cycler
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Ice and ice buckets
• Computer and bioinformatics software for data analysis
1. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Processing and DNA Extraction
1. Fresh-frozen Tissue: a. Retrieve the tissue sample from storage
and keep on ice. b. Cut approximately 250 mg of tissue using
sterile instruments. c. Homogenize the tissue using a bead mill
or mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen. d. Extract genomic
DNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a
commercial DNA extraction kit.
2. Paraffin-embedded Tissue: a. Obtain a tissue section (5-10 µm
thick) in a microtome. b. Deparaffinize tissue sections using
xylene and rehydrate through a graded ethanol series. c.
Extract genomic DNA using a commercial DNA extraction kit
suitable for FFPE samples according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
B) DNA Quantification and Quality Assessment
1. Quantify the extracted DNA using a Qubit fluorometer. Follow
the manufacturer's instructions for the DNA quantitation kit.
2. Assess the quality of DNA using a Bioanalyzer or similar
instrument to ensure high molecular weight and integrity of
DNA.
C) Library Preparation
1. Prepare DNA libraries using a library preparation kit appropriate
for the Postmortem Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmia Gene
Panel.
2. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for preparing the libraries,
including fragmentation, end repair, adapter ligation, and
amplification.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of prepared libraries using the
Qubit fluorometer and Bioanalyzer, respectively.
D) Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the high-throughput sequencer
following the instrument’s protocol.
2. Set up the sequencing run parameters according to the needs
of the gene panel (e.g., read length, coverage).
E) Data Analysis
1. After sequencing, transfer the raw data files to the
bioinformatics workstation.
2. Use bioinformatics software to perform the alignment of
sequencing reads to the human reference genome.
3. Detect variants and annotate them using appropriate variant
calling pipelines.
4. Filter the variants based on quality and relevance to
cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes.
F) Results Interpretation and Reporting
1. Correlate identified variants with known pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, benign, or uncertain significance categories.
2. Generate a detailed report summarizing the genetic findings,
their potential clinical significance, and recommendations for
further investigation.
3. Review the report for accuracy and completeness before final
verification by a qualified laboratory director or geneticist.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Conduct regular calibration and maintenance of equipment as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure the reliability of the procedure.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing to ensure the laboratory's
technical performance and accuracy.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all sample information, reagent lot numbers, and
equipment identifiers in the laboratory information management
system (LIMS).
• Document all steps and observations throughout the procedure in
laboratory notebooks or electronic records.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all chemicals, biological samples, and hazardous reagents
according to safety data sheets (SDS) and laboratory protocols.
