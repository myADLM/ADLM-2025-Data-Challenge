POSTMORTEM CARDIOMYOPATHY GENE PANEL, TISSUE:
Analytical Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the generation and
verification of results for the Postmortem Cardiomyopathy Gene
Panel using tissue specimens. This protocol ensures accurate
identification of cardiomyopathy-related genetic mutations to
provide valuable information for postmortem analysis and
potential genetic counseling for surviving family members.
RESPONSIBILITY: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing genetic analysis and ensuring the integrity and
accuracy of the results. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to
oversee the process and ensure compliance with the protocol.

1. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Preparation
1. Record the tissue details (type, quantity, collection date, storage
condition).
2. Homogenize the tissue sample using the tissue homogenizer
according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
3. Transfer homogenized tissue to a microcentrifuge tube.
B. DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA using the designated DNA extraction kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Assess the quality and quantity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
3. Store DNA samples at -20°C until further use.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR reactions using specific primers for target
cardiomyopathy genes.
2. Perform PCR using the thermal cycler with the following
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-65°C for 30 seconds (depending on primer
Tm)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Number of cycles: 30-35
3. Verify PCR products via agarose gel electrophoresis.
D. Library Preparation for NGS
1. Quantify and pool PCR products for library preparation.
2. Perform library preparation using the NGS library preparation
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Quantify and assess library quality using a bioanalyzer or
similar system.
E. Next-Generation Sequencing
1. Load prepared libraries into the NGS system.
2. Run the sequencer following the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Ensure appropriate run-specific settings are selected for
optimal data output.
F. Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Process raw sequencing data using bioinformatics software to
identify variants.
2. Cross-reference identified variants with known cardiomyopathy-
associated mutation databases.
3. Filter variants for pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS (variants
of uncertain significance), likely benign, and benign
classifications.
4. Generate a mutation report summarizing the findings.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Review genetic variant data for accuracy and clinical relevance.
7. Prepare a report including:
◦ Patient and specimen details
◦ List of detected mutations with clinical relevance and
classifications
◦ Methodology summary
◦ Interpretation and recommendations
8. Verify the report with a supervisory analyst.
9. Submit the final report to the requesting physician or authorized
entity.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
11. Include positive and negative controls during DNA extraction
and PCR steps.
12. Perform intra-lab comparison tests for consistency of results.
13. Conduct routine maintenance and calibration of equipment as
documented in specific equipment SOPs.
14. Document all procedural actions performed on log sheets.
15. Address and document any procedural deviations, equipment
malfunctions, or unusual findings with appropriate corrective
actions.
16. REFERENCES List any references, such as manuals for DNA
extraction kits, PCR protocols, NGS library preparation
instructions, and bioinformatics software guides.
This SOP ensures the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the
analytical process for the Postmortem Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel
in tissue specimens, contributing to precise postmortem diagnosis
and genetic counseling.
