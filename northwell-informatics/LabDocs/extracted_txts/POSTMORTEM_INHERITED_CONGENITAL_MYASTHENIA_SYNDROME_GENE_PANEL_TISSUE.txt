Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Postmortem Inherited Congenital Myasthenia
Syndrome (CMS) Gene Panel, Tissue
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis and interpretation of postmortem tissue samples for
the Inherited Congenital Myasthenia Syndrome (CMS) gene
panel.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable
results. Any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis should be immediately reported to the supervisor.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Thermocycler
• NGS Library Preparation Kit
• NGS Sequencing System
• Reagents for PCR and library preparation
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micro tubes
• Ethanol (70%)
• Ultra-pure water
1. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
• Specimen: Postmortem tissue.
• All tissue samples should be handled using sterile techniques to
avoid contamination.
• Store tissue samples at -80°C until processing.
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA EXTRACTION
1. Transfer approximately 25 mg of the tissue into a micro tube.
2. Add appropriate lysis buffer and incubate as per DNA extraction
kit instructions.
3. Vortex and centrifuge samples to ensure proper lysis.
4. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA isolation, including
any purification and washing steps.
5. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or Qubit fluorometer.
B) PCR AMPLIFICATION
1. Design primers specific to the CMS gene panel.
2. Prepare the PCR reaction mix, including DNA polymerase,
primers, dNTPs, buffer, and extracted DNA.
3. Program the PCR thermocycler with the appropriate cycles and
temperatures for the CMS gene panel.
4. Load the PCR tubes into the thermocycler and start the
reaction.
5. Verify the amplification by running an aliquot of the PCR
product on an agarose gel.
C) NGS LIBRARY PREPARATION
1. Purify the PCR products using an appropriate purification
method (e.g., magnetic beads).
2. Quantify the purified PCR products.
3. Prepare the NGS library using a library preparation kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Index the samples as required by the sequencing protocol.
5. Quantify and assess the quality of the NGS library.
D) SEQUENCING
1. Load the prepared NGS libraries into the sequencing system.
2. Run the sequencing protocol optimized for the CMS gene
panel.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality and completion.
E) DATA ANALYSIS
1. Transfer the raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics analysis
pipeline.
2. Perform quality control on the raw data, including trimming of
low-quality bases and removal of adapter sequences.
3. Align the cleaned reads to the reference genome.
4. Perform variant calling to identify mutations relevant to CMS.
5. Filter and annotate the variants using variant databases and
prediction tools.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Review and interpret the identified variants in the context of
CMS.
8. Compile the findings in a report.
9. Include relevant clinical interpretations and recommendations
based on the detected variants.
10. Ensure the final report is reviewed and signed off by a qualified
specialist before release.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
12. Run positive and negative controls throughout the DNA
extraction, PCR, and sequencing processes to ensure accuracy
and reliability.
13. Adhere to calibration and maintenance schedules for all
equipment used.
14. Participate in external quality assurance programs relevant to
genetic testing.
15. DOCUMENTATION
16. Maintain detailed records of all procedures performed, including
sample tracking, reagent lot numbers, and deviations from the
protocol.
17. Store raw data and generated reports securely according to
laboratory policy and relevant regulations.
