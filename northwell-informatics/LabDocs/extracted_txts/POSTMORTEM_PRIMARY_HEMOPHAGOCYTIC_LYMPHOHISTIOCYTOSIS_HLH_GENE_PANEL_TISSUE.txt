Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Postmortem Primary
Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Gene Panel, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for generating results for the Postmortem
Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Gene Panel
from tissue samples, including steps for tissue preparation, DNA
extraction, gene panel sequencing, and data analysis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This SOP must be followed by qualified laboratory personnel trained
in molecular genetic techniques. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory staff to ensure accurate and timely processing and
documentation of the analytical results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Accepted Specimens: Fresh tissue, formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue.
◦ Handling: Store fresh tissue at -80°C until processing.
FFPE blocks can be stored at room temperature.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Tissue samples with significant
degradation or contamination.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment: Microtome, Tissue Homogenizer, Centrifuge,
PCR Thermocycler, Sequencing Platform.
◦ Reagents: DNA Extraction Kit, Library Preparation Kit, Gene
Panel Sequencing Kit.
◦ Supplies: Microcentrifuge Tubes, Pipettes, Tips, Gloves.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Preparation
1. Fresh Tissue Handling
◦ Thaw tissue samples at room temperature.
◦ Homogenize tissue using an appropriate tissue
homogenizer.
2. FFPE Tissue Handling
◦ Cut 5-10 µm sections using a microtome.
◦ Deparaffinize and rehydrate tissue sections according to the
deparaffinization protocol.
B. DNA Extraction
1. Fresh Tissue
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions of the DNA extraction
kit.
◦ Quantify and assess the integrity of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis.
2. FFPE Tissue
◦ Follow extraction protocol optimized for FFPE tissue
provided by the extraction kit manufacturer.
◦ Quantify DNA quality and integrity using appropriate assays.
C. Library Preparation and Sequencing
1. Library Preparation
◦ Prepare the DNA library using the library preparation kit
following manufacturer instructions.
◦ Perform quality control steps including quantification and
size assessment of library fragments.
2. Gene Panel Sequencing
◦ Utilize the HLH gene panel sequencing kit tailored for this
test.
◦ Load the sequencing platform with the prepared library and
initiate the sequencing run.
D. Data Analysis
1. Initial Data Processing
◦ Import raw sequencing data into bioinformatics software.
◦ Perform quality control checks to ensure sequencing
accuracy.
2. Variant Calling
◦ Use bioinformatic pipelines to identify variants within the
HLH gene panel.
◦ Filter and prioritize variants based on quality metrics and
known pathogenicity.
3. Result Interpretation
◦ Interpret the clinical relevance of identified variants.
◦ Compile a detailed report including detected variants, their
significance, and any recommendations.
E. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control
◦ Include positive and negative control samples in each run.
◦ Verify control results to ensure assay performance.
2. External Quality Control
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing and validation
programs.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Verified results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure the laboratory report includes all crucial details such
as identified variants and interpretation notes.
◦ Review and validate the final report before release.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference intervals are gene-specific and should be based on
established databases.
• Limitations include potential issues with sequencing depth, quality
of FFPE-derived DNA, and interpretation of variants with unknown
significance.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocols for DNA extraction and sequencing kits.
• Relevant HLH gene panel databases and guidelines.
Compliance: Ensure adherence to regulatory standards and
institutional policies related to genetic testing and reporting.
Laboratory personnel must follow this SOP meticulously to ensure
the validity and reliability of test results. Any deviations or issues
encountered should be promptly reported to the supervisor.
