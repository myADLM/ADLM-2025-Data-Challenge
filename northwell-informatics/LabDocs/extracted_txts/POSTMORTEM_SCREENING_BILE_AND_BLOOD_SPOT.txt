Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Postmortem
Screening: Bile and Blood Spot Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This protocol aims to describe the method for analytical procedures
conducted on bile and blood spot samples collected during
postmortem examinations. This includes handling, processing, and
analyzing these samples to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory Personnel: Responsible for following the outlined
procedures, performing quality control, and ensuring
accuracy and precision in test results.
◦ Supervisors: Responsible for training and oversight to
ensure adherence to protocols and addressing any issues
that arise during the testing process.
2. DEFINITIONS
◦ Postmortem Bile Sample: Bile obtained from the
gallbladder or bile ducts during an autopsy.
◦ Postmortem Blood Spot: Blood collected on specialized
filter paper and dried, commonly from cardiorespiratory
blood sources.
3. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Bile:
▪ Collect bile in sterile containers.
▪ Store at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 24
hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C or below.
◦ Blood Spot:
▪ Collect on specialized filter paper (e.g., Guthrie cards).
▪ Ensure thorough drying before storage.
▪ Store dried spots at room temperature in a dry, dark
place. Long-term storage should be at 2-8°C in low
humidity.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Bile Analysis
▪ Chemical reagents for bile component analysis (e.g.,
bilirubin, bile acids).
▪ Spectrophotometer or HPLC equipment.
◦ Blood Spot Analysis
▪ Reagents for extraction of analytes from blood spots.
▪ LC-MS/MS or equivalent equipment for detailed analysis.
5. PROCEDURES
A. Bile Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
▪ Thaw frozen bile samples gradually to room
temperature if stored frozen.
▪ Mix the bile sample thoroughly before taking an aliquot
for analysis.
2. Quantitative Analysis:
▪ Refer to specific reagent and test kit instructions for
the quantitative analysis of bile components.
▪ Load samples into the spectrophotometer or HPLC
system.
▪ Conduct analysis according to the validated method,
ensuring calibration with standards and controls.
3. Troubleshooting:
▪ If bile analysis fails calibration or shows inappropriate
results, repeat the test with fresh aliquots.
▪ Document and report any persistent issues to the
supervisor.
B. Blood Spot Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
▪ Punch out designated areas of the blood spot filter
paper (usually 3 mm – 6 mm diameter punches).
▪ Extract analytes using appropriate solvent and method
(typically methanol extraction).
▪ Ensure complete extraction by agitation and
appropriate duration.
2. Quantitative Analysis:
▪ Configure and calibrate the LC-MS/MS or appropriate
analysis system.
▪ Load extracted samples into the system.
▪ Conduct the analysis adhering to method-specific
instructions and validation.
3. Troubleshooting:
▪ Address any issues related to extraction efficiency,
instrumental errors, or results outlier by repeating the
extraction and analysis steps.
▪ Consult the supervisor for persistent problems and
document all troubleshooting actions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Ensure the quality control materials are analyzed alongside
patient samples to validate method performance.
◦ Follow internal quality control procedures including regular
instrument calibration and control checks.
◦ Maintain a log of all quality control activities and any
corrective measures taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
after reviewing and validating data.
◦ Notify the appropriate personnel of critical or unusual
findings.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Postmortem reference intervals may vary based on the
analyte and population. Refer to current literature and
internal data for guidance.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Sample quality can affect results significantly. Degradation or
contamination must be avoided.
• Interference from other substances in bile or blood can lead to
inaccurate results. Interpret results with caution if any interfering
substances are suspected.
