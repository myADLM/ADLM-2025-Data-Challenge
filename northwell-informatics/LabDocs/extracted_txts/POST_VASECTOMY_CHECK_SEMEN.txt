Post Vasectomy Check, Semen Analysis SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for post-vasectomy semen
analysis to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the semen
analysis according to this protocol. Supervisors ensure that the
procedures are followed and documented properly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Freshly collected semen sample in a clean, sterile container.
• Specimen should be collected by masturbation directly into the
provided container.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected via condoms or lubricants (contamination
risk).
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient name, date, and time
of collection.
• Specimens received more than 1 hour after collection without
prior approval.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope
• Hemocytometer or Makler Chamber
• Sterile containers
• Centrifuge (if necessary)
• Staining solutions (e.g., Eosin-Nigrosin)
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Standard operating procedure documentation
5. PROCEDURE
Note: Perform all analysis within 1 hour of specimen collection for
reliability.
A. Initial Verification:
1. Verify patient information on the specimen container matches
the requisition form.
2. Document the time of specimen receipt and condition (e.g.,
volume, viscosity).
B. Macroscopic Examination: 3. Assess and record volume, color,
and consistency of the sample. 4. Note any abnormalities (e.g.,
presence of blood).
C. Microscopic Examination: 5. Mix the sample well to ensure
homogeneity. 6. Load a small aliquot of the semen sample into the
counting chamber (hemocytometer or Makler Chamber).
Determining Sperm Concentration: 7. Count the sperm in the
designated grid areas under the microscope. 8. Calculate the
concentration of sperm per milliliter: - Sperm concentration (millions/
mL) = (number of sperm counted) x (dilution factor) / (volume of
counting chamber).
Motility Assessment: 9. Assess the motility of sperm: - Record the
percentages of motile, non-motile, and progressively motile
spermatozoa.
Stain and Morphology Examination: 10. Prepare a stained smear to
evaluate sperm morphology using Eosin-Nigrosin stain: - Place a
small drop of semen on a glass slide, mix equal parts of the stain,
and spread the mixture. - Allow to air dry and then observe under the
microscope for morphological assessment. - Classify and count
normal and abnormal spermatozoa.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
Criteria:
• No sperm detected (azoospermia): Semen analysis repeated at
least once after a waiting period (e.g., 1 week) to confirm.
• Presence of sperm: Evaluate concentration and motility, consult
with physician for next steps.
Report Results:
1. Document all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results according to laboratory standards.
3. Report findings to the referring physician with an interpretation
explaining the levels of sperm detected and their motility.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure quality control protocols are followed for equipment and
reagents.
• Perform control checks with known standards regularly.
• Document all quality control measures and maintain records as
per laboratory policies.
