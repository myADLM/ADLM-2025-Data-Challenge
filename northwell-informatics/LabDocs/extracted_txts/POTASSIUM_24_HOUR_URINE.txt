Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for POTASSIUM, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analysis of 24-hour urine
samples for the determination of potassium concentration. Ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis and reporting of potassium levels in 24-hour urine
specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting and
documenting the analysis following this procedure. Supervisors must
ensure the adherence to this protocol and address any procedural
issues that may arise.
4. DEFINITIONS
• 24-Hour Urine Collection: The process of collecting all urine
produced by an individual over a 24-hour period.
• Potassium (K): An essential electrolyte in the body, measured in
millimoles per liter (mmol/L) in urine.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection:
• Specimen: 24-hour urine collection in a clean, chemically
resistant, and appropriately labeled container.
• Preservatives: Required if specified by the manufacturer's
instructions or referring physician. Follow specific collection and
preservation instructions if necessary.
• Storage: Refrigerate collected urine during and after the collection
period. Transport under refrigeration to maintain specimen
integrity.
Specimen Acceptance Criteria:
• Collected urine must represent the complete 24-hour period.
• Adequate labeling with patient information, date, and time of
collection.
• No gross contamination or significant delay in transport.
Specimens should be received within 24 hours of collection
completion.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Incomplete collection (less than 24 hours).
• Specimens with evident contamination.
• Mislabeling or lack of labeling.
• Significant deviations in transport timing that may affect stability.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Automated urine analyzer (if available) or appropriate manual
measuring tools
Reagents:
• NIST-traceable potassium standard solutions
• Quality control materials (high and low potassium concentrations)
Supplies:
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Gloves and personal protective equipment
• Urine collection containers
• Calibration and control logs
7. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Perform calibration using NIST-traceable potassium standards
according to the manufacturer's instructions for the analyzer.
• Verify calibration by running quality control samples prior to
sample analysis.
Quality Control:
• Run high and low potassium QC samples within the laboratory's
acceptable range before testing patient samples.
• Document the QC results. Any result falling outside the
acceptable range must be addressed following the
troubleshooting steps outlined in the laboratory's QC protocol.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Preparation:
1. Verify the completeness and proper storage of the 24-hour
urine sample.
2. Record the total volume of urine collected over the 24-hour
period.
3. Thoroughly mix the specimen to ensure uniformity before
aliquoting.
B. Analytical Process:
1. Aliquot an appropriate volume of urine into a properly labeled
sample cup.
2. If utilizing an automated analyzer:
◦ Load the aliquot into the analyzer following the instrument's
specific loading guidelines.
◦ Initiate the analysis as per the manufacturer's instructions.
If performing manual analysis:
◦ Utilize the protocol outlined for manual potassium
measurement (e.g., flame photometry or ion-selective
electrode).
◦ Follow all steps as per the manual analysis method being
employed.
3. Document the analyzer or method used for calibration before
sample analysis.
4. Record the test results directly. Verify that results fall within
expected quality control limits.
9. RESULT REPORTING
A. Calculations (if applicable):
• Calculate potassium concentration: Ensure results are reported
per liter of urine.
• If necessary, correct results for urine volume to express
potassium excretion per 24 hours.
B. Documentation:
• Verify and sign off on results prior to releasing.
• Document any issues, discrepancies, and corrective actions taken
during the analysis process.
C. Review:
• Ensure a peer review for accuracy before final reporting.
• Confirm that all results are transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) correctly.
