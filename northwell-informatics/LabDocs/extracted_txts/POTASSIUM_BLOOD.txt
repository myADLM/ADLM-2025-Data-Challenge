Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Blood
Potassium
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the determination of
potassium levels in blood specimens using the ABL90 analyzer,
ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all authorized personnel performing potassium
analysis in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP. Supervisors must ensure compliance and provide training to
staff as necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
4.1 Specimen Types
• Preferred: Heparinized whole blood (arterial, venous, or capillary
samples).
• Acceptable: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or PST (Plasma
Separator Tube) with heparin, ensuring tubes are completely
filled.
4.2 Specimen Collection
• Blood gas syringe containing low concentration or balanced
lithium heparin.
• Immediately after collection, expel any air in contact with the
blood specimen, mix adequately, and remove the needle before
capping the syringe.
4.3 Transport and Storage
• Transport specimens to the laboratory immediately by pneumatic
tube system or by hand in a plastic bag.
• Analyze blood-gas specimens promptly to avoid pre-analytical
errors.
4.4 Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10% of volume).
• Specimens with needle attached.
• Clotted specimens.
• Blood collected in Microtainer tubes for ionized calcium and blood
gas components.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment
• ABL90 Flex Analyzer or equivalent.
• Centrifuge (for handling and verifying sample integrity).
5.2 Reagents
• Electrolyte balanced or low concentration heparin for blood gas
syringes and collection tubes.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Ensure the ABL90 analyzer is calibrated and internal QC has
passed.
2. Check that the required reagents and supplies are available
and within their expiration dates.
6.2 Sample Analysis
1. Mix the blood sample thoroughly by gently inverting the syringe
or tube.
2. Cap the blood gas syringe or tube and ensure no air bubbles
are present.
3. Load the sample into the ABL90 analyzer as per manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Wait for the analyzer to complete the measurement.
6.3 Result Verification
1. Review the results displayed by the ABL90 analyzer.
2. If the potassium level is critically low (< 3.0 mmol/L) or high (>
6.0 mmol/L):
◦ For critically low potassium levels, result and proceed
according to critical value policy.
◦ For high potassium levels, centrifuge a small aliquot to
check for hemolysis: a. If the sample is not hemolyzed,
accept and report the results. b. If the sample is hemolyzed,
do not report the potassium level. Add a comment indicating
the specimen condition.
3. In cases of high WBC count or if results are questionable,
contact the on-call supervisor for further instructions.
6.4 Reporting Results
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
2. Verify all results, ensuring appropriate comments are included if
necessary.
3. If "?" mark or error codes are displayed, review and
troubleshoot following the ABL90 user manual.
4. For pO2 values below the reportable range (<10 mmHg),
manually enter "<10" in the LIS.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Internal Quality Control
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly intralab blood gas syringe
comparisons as outlined in the Quality Control section.
• Quality control materials at three levels are automatically run
according to the preset schedule on the ABL90.
• Investigate any QC failures immediately and follow corrective
action procedures.
7.2 Solution Pack and Sensor Cassette Validation
• Follow protocol for new lot numbers and same lot number
comparisons ensuring correlation and validation as described in
solution pack validation steps.
8. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Conduct regular maintenance, calibration, and validation of the
ABL90 analyzer as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Document all maintenance, calibration, and QC activities in the
appropriate logbooks.
9. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow standard biosafety and waste disposal protocols.
• Dispose of all biological waste, including used syringes and
sample tubes, in designated biohazard containers.
