Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Potassium in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and efficient testing of
plasma potassium levels in the laboratory, ensuring quality results
that meet clinical requirements.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing plasma
potassium analysis following this SOP. They must ensure adherence
to the protocol, check for potential issues, document findings, and
take corrective actions if required.
3. DEFINITION
Potassium: An essential electrolyte influential in cellular function,
nerve conduction, and muscle contraction.
4. PRE-ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred specimen: Plasma collected in a heparinized tube
(dark green or PST).
◦ Unacceptable specimens: Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/
oxalate, EDTA specimens, clotted specimens.
2. Storage and Stability:
◦ Plasma specimens should be tested promptly after
collection. If testing is delayed, specimens must be kept at 2
– 8°C and analyzed within 24 hours.
3. Sample Integrity:
◦ Inspect samples for signs of hemolysis or clots. Hemolyzed
specimens can lead to false increases in potassium levels.
5. PROCEDURE
1. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Electrolyte analyzer as specified by the laboratory (e.g., ISE
methods on automated chemistry analyzers).
◦ Quality control materials for calibration and validation (e.g.,
low, medium, and high control levels).
2. Preparation:
◦ Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and quality control
checks are within acceptable ranges before analyzing
patient samples.
3. Analysis:
◦ Prepare plasma specimens by centrifuging whole blood at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes. If using PST tubes, ensure
they are completely filled to maintain anaerobic conditions.
Measurement Using Electrolyte Analyzer:
◦ Load the specimen onto the electrolyte analyzer.
◦ Follow specific equipment instructions for operation.
◦ Record the potassium concentration displayed by the
analyzer.
4. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify and review results in the LIS before finalizing the
reports.
◦ Report potassium levels in mmol/L.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control tests at the beginning and end of
each shift and with each batch of tests.
◦ Document and review the quality control results.
◦ Any deviations from acceptable ranges should prompt re-
calibration or instrument troubleshooting, as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can artificially elevate potassium levels. Visual check
and centrifugation analysis must be performed to ensure
specimen integrity.
• Analyzer-specific issues should be documented and dealt with
according to laboratory policies.
7. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Critical low potassium values (< 3.0 mmol/L) and high values (>
6.0 mmol/L) must be verified and rechecked. Follow laboratory
policy for handling critical results.
• Hemolyzed specimens should be noted, and if critical low/high
results are suspected due to sample integrity, report with "No
Value" and comment accordingly.

• Manufacturer's manual for the electrolyte analyzer.
• Clinical guidelines for handling and processing plasma
specimens.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure accurate and complete documentation of all test results,
quality control measures, and any corrective actions taken.
Maintain records according to laboratory protocols and regulatory
requirements.
NOTE: Always follow detailed instructions provided in specific
reagent kits and equipment manuals. Consult the laboratory
supervisor for any unexpected issues or deviations.
