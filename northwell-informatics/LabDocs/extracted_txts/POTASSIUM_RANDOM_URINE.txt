Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Potassium,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of potassium in random
urine specimens using the appropriate analytical instruments and
methods. This ensures accurate and reliable results to support
clinical diagnosis and treatment.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing urine
potassium analysis using the specified equipment and methods. They
are also responsible for documenting all the steps and ensuring
quality control measures are followed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• Random urine specimen collected in a clean, leak-proof container.
• Specimen should be free from preservatives or contaminants.
Unacceptable:
• Specimen with visible contamination or sediment.
• Specimen collected in containers with preservatives.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 24 hours after
collection if not refrigerated.
Storage:
• Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be
performed immediately. Specimens should be analyzed within 24
hours of collection if refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-
OES) or Flame Photometry for potassium measurement.
• Sterile, clean, leak-proof urine containers.
• Calibrators and controls specific for urine potassium analysis.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety glasses.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the urine specimen well by gentle inversion.
2. Transfer an aliquot of the mixed specimen to an appropriate
analysis container or tube.
Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration standards according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Perform instrument calibration using these standards, ensuring
that the calibration curve covers the expected range of
potassium concentrations in urine.
Quality Control:
1. Run low, medium, and high concentration quality control
samples with each batch of patient specimens.
2. Verify that all QC results fall within the acceptable range. Do not
proceed with patient samples if QC results are out of range.
Troubleshoot and recalibrate, if necessary.
Analysis:
1. Follow the specific operating procedure for the ICP-OES or
Flame Photometry instrument being used.
2. Load the patient specimens and quality control samples into the
instrument.
3. Ensure all samples and controls are properly identified and
placed in the correct positions.
4. Start the analysis run as per the instrument’s operational guide.
Result Validation:
1. Review the analysis results from the instrument.
2. Validate that all patient and QC results meet the laboratory's
acceptance criteria.
3. Re-run any samples with unusual or unexpected results.
4. Document any discrepancies and actions taken.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Technologist reviews and verifies all results before reporting.
• Critical results are flagged in the LIS and must be communicated
to the relevant healthcare provider promptly following the
laboratory’s critical result policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The following reference interval should be used unless otherwise
specified by the clinical setting:
• Potassium (Random Urine): 25 – 125 mmol/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Contaminants such as preservatives or detergents in the urine
collection container can interfere with the measurement.
• Highly concentrated or diluted urine samples can impact the
accuracy of the results.
• Ensure specimen handling and storage are appropriate to avoid
degradation or contamination.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use traceable standards and controls as per guidelines.
• Document all QC checks and maintain records for calibration,
control results, and instrument maintenance.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for urine
potassium analysis when available.

• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the ICP-OES or Flame Photometry
instrument used.
