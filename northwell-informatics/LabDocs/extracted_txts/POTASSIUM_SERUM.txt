Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Potassium, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a
standardized procedure for the analysis of Serum Potassium in
the clinical laboratory, ensuring accurate and reliable results are
reported in a timely manner.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis and reporting of serum potassium
levels using the designated clinical analyzers.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP and documenting the results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP,
providing training, and addressing any issues or discrepancies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Serum Separator Tube (SST, gold-top) or
plain red-top tube.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): 6 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples due to cell lysis which can falsely elevate
potassium levels.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Potassium Assay Reagents: Specific to the analyzer in use (e.g.,
ion-selective electrode (ISE) reagents).
• Calibrators and Quality Control (QC) Materials: As per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Analyzers: Designated clinical chemistry analyzers with ISE
technology for potassium measurement.
• Pipettes and tips: For sample handling.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Gloves, Lab coat, Safety
glasses.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge collected blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate serum.
◦ Ensure serum is free of fibrin, red blood cells (RBCs), and
other particulates.
3. Instrument Setup and Calibration:
◦ Power on the analyzer and allow it to initialize.
◦ Load the appropriate potassium assay reagents and ensure
they are within their expiration date.
◦ Run daily calibration checks using the provided calibrators
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of quality control (QC) materials (low and
high) at the beginning of each shift and following any
maintenance or reagent replacement.
◦ Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis. Document QC
results.
5. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared serum samples into the analyzer’s
sample carousel or designated sample ports.
◦ Enter or scan patient identification and sample information
into the analyzer.
◦ Initiate analysis by following the manufacturer’s instructions
for operation.
6. Result Validation:
◦ Review the analyzer’s output for each sample.
◦ Check for flags or error codes that may indicate issues (e.g.,
insufficient sample volume, instrument malfunction).
◦ For results flagged with possible interferences (e.g.,
hemolysis), verify by visual inspection or re-run the sample.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Technologists must review and verify all results before reporting
them.
• Critical values (K < 3.0 mmol/L or ≥ 6.0 mmol/L) must be flagged,
and the appropriate healthcare provider must be notified
immediately following established critical value reporting
protocols.
• Document any critical value notifications, including the date, time,
and person notified.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, perform
troubleshooting steps such as recalibration, reagent checks, or
maintenance as per the analyzer's user manual.
• Re-run QC samples after troubleshooting and ensure they are
within acceptable limits before analyzing patient samples.
• Document all troubleshooting steps taken and notify the
supervisor of any unresolved issues.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Always wear appropriate PPE when handling biological samples
and reagents.
• Follow biosafety guidelines to avoid exposure and contamination.
• Dispose of all waste materials, including used reagents and
samples, according to institutional biohazard waste disposal
protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis: Hemolyzed samples may yield falsely elevated
potassium results. Inspect samples visually for hemolysis before
analysis.
• Lipemia and Icterus: These conditions may also interfere with
accurate potassium measurement. If suspected, treat or handle
samples accordingly.

testing.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document the creation and revision dates.
• Track changes and updates made to this SOP.
