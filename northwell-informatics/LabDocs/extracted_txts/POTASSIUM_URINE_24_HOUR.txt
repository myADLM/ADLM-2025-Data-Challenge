Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for POTASSIUM,
URINE, 24 HOUR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
potassium levels in 24-hour urine specimens. This ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results that can be used for
clinical diagnosis and patient management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis and documentation as per this SOP. The responsibility of
initiating corrective actions in case of deviations from expected
results lies with the staff and supervisors.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 24-hour urine specimen collected in a chemically clean container.
Specimen Stability:
• Collected sample should be kept refrigerated during the collection
period and transported to the laboratory within 24 hours of
completing the collection.
• If necessary, potassium levels in the urine sample are stable for
up to 7 days when stored at 4-8°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Ion-selective electrode (ISE) analyzer or flame photometer for
potassium measurement
• Potassium standards and calibration solutions
• Deionized water
• Reagent blank and quality control solutions
• Disposable pipettes
• Specimen containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. CALIBRATION
• Calibrate the ion-selective electrode (ISE) analyzer or flame
photometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions before
testing.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Handling:
1. Upon receipt, record and accession the 24-hour urine specimen
into the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Verify that the urine collection has been carried out properly
and ensure there are no signs of contamination or improper
storage conditions.
3. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen well to ensure homogeneity.
B. Analysis:
1. Set up and prepare the ISE analyzer or flame photometer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Pipette an appropriate volume of the mixed urine specimen into
a disposable container for analysis.
3. Run a reagent blank and quality control samples to validate the
analytical setup.
4. Analyze the urine specimen for potassium levels as per the
analyzer’s protocol.
5. Record the potassium concentration output from the analyzer in
mmol/L.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality controls at the beginning of each batch and/or shift
to ensure accuracy.
2. Include at least one low, one medium, and one high
concentration control material in each run.
3. Review the quality control data to ensure it falls within the
prescribed limits before accepting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review each result for potential errors or anomalies before
entering it into the LIS.
2. Apply necessary calculations to convert the potassium
concentration from mmol/L to the total amount in the 24-hour
collection (mmol/24 hours), based on the total volume of urine
collected.
Formula: [ \text{Total Potassium} (\text{mmol/24 hour}) =
\text{Potassium concentration (mmol/L)} \times \text{Total
Volume (L)} ]
3. Report the final result in the LIS according to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
4. Include reference intervals and any comments as necessary in
the final report.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Provide reference intervals for potassium in urine according to
age, sex, and clinical guidelines.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that urine samples are free of any contamination that may
affect the potassium readings.
• Utilize only properly calibrated equipment to ensure accuracy.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manual for ISE analyzer / flame photometer.
• Clinical guidelines and reference materials for potassium in urine
testing.
11. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs of calibration, quality control results, and patient test
results as per laboratory policies.
• Document any troubleshooting or corrective actions taken during
the analytical phase.
