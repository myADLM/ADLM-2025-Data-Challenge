STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR POTASSIUM, URINE,
RANDOM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed
procedures for the analytical phase of measuring and reporting
potassium levels in random urine specimens. This ensures
consistent, accurate, and precise results are generated for
patient diagnosis and treatment.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel performing the test
must adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the lab
supervisor to ensure all staff members are trained and follow
this protocol accurately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable:
• 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean, sterile container.
• Specimen should be transported to the laboratory at room
temperature within 2 hours of collection if unrefrigerated, or within
24 hours if refrigerated at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in leaking, non-sterile containers.
• Specimens with visible contamination or particulate matter.
• Urine samples preserved with additives other than those specified
by the laboratory.
1. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
• Ion-selective electrode (ISE) analyzer or equivalent.
• Calibrated potassium reference solutions.
• Quality control material (2 levels: normal and pathological).
• Sterile specimen cups.
1. PROCEDURE: A) PRE-ANALYTICAL PREPARATION i)
Confirm the specimen identity matches the laboratory
requisition form. ii) Inspect the specimen for volume, container
integrity, and signs of contamination. iii) Record details of the
specimen condition on the Specimen Receiving Log.
B) SAMPLE PREPARATION i) Mix the urine specimen by gently
inverting the container several times. ii) Pour the urine into a labeled
aliquot container if necessary.
C) ANALYSIS i) Power on the ISE analyzer and allow it to warm up
for at least 30 minutes. ii) Perform daily maintenance and calibration
as per the ISE analyzer manufacturer’s instructions. iii) Verify
calibration using the potassium reference solutions before processing
patient samples. iv) Run quality control material at the beginning of
each batch of specimens, and after every 20 patient samples, to
ensure the analyzer is functioning within acceptable limits. v) Load
the urine specimen onto the analyzer and initiate the run according to
the manufacturer's instructions. vi) Document the sample identity,
date, and time of analysis in the Potassium Testing Log.
D) TROUBLESHOOTING i) If quality control results fall outside
acceptable limits, do not proceed with patient samples. Recalibrate
the instrument and repeat quality control checks. ii) If the analyzer
exhibits error messages or inconsistent results, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the manufacturer’s manual and take
corrective actions. Document these actions in the Instrument
Maintenance Log.
1. POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES A) REVIEW AND
VALIDATE RESULTS i) Review the results generated by the
analyzer for any flags or errors. ii) Validate results by comparing
them to the quality control range. iii) Flag and re-test any results
that fall outside the expected range or show significant
deviation from previous results, if applicable.
B) RECORD AND REPORT RESULTS i) Manually record validated
results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS). ii) All critical or
significantly abnormal results must be confirmed by repeat testing
and reviewed by a supervisor before releasing the results. iii) Results
should be reported with reference intervals: - Potassium (urine,
random): 25-125 mmol/L iv) Document the report submission in the
Urine Potassium Report Log.
1. QUALITY CONTROL Routine quality control procedures must
be adhered to as described earlier. Review control logs weekly
to identify trends or recurring issues.

1. DOCUMENTATION All documents and logs mentioned herein
must be maintained both electronically and in hardcopy as
applicable. Retain records according to laboratory policy and
ensure they are readily available for auditing and quality
assurance purposes.
