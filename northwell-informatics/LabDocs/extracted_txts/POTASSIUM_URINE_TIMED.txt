Standard Operating Protocol for Analytical Phase: Potassium,
Urine, Timed Collection
1. Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps to be
followed in the analytical phase of generating results for Potassium,
Urine, Timed samples. It ensures the accuracy and consistency of
results, maintaining compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory scientists to follow
this SOP accurately.
• The supervisor is responsible for reviewing the results and
overseeing the entire process to ensure all steps are followed.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Timed urine collection (commonly 24-hour urine)
• Specimen Volume:
◦ Collect the total volume of urine produced over the specific
time period and measure the volume.
• Handling:
◦ Store the specimen at 2-8°C during and after the collection
period.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimen collected outside the specified time period
◦ Specimen with contamination
1. Reagents, Equipment and Supplies
• Reagents:
◦ Potassium reagents and calibrators for the analyzer in use
(e.g., Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) Maintenance Solution).
◦ Quality control materials.
• Equipment:
◦ Calibrated volumetric containers for urine collection.
◦ Urine analyzer (preferably one with Ion Selective Electrode
(ISE) capabilities).
◦ Traceable thermometer for checking the calibration of
equipment.
• Supplies:
◦ Urine collection containers.
◦ Labels and specimen logbook.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. Procedure
• Calibration:
◦ The analyzer should be calibrated at the beginning of each
shift and verified with quality control materials.
• Analyzing Urine Sample:
1. Ensure that the urine sample is well-mixed before aliquoting.
2. Measure and record the total volume of urine collected over
the specified time period.
3. Aliquot a sufficient volume of the mixed urine sample for
analysis in an appropriate sample container.
4. Label the aliquot with patient identification, collection date
and time, and total urine volume.
5. Place the labeled aliquot on the analyzer.
6. Follow the analyzer's specific instructions for sample loading
and analysis.
• Quality Control:
◦ Run the quality control (QC) materials at the start of each run
of patient samples.
◦ Record QC results and verify that they fall within the
acceptable range.
◦ If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer’s instructions or SOP.
1. Reporting Results:
• Calculating Potassium Concentration:
◦ Obtain the potassium concentration (mmol/L) from the
analyzer readout.
◦ Calculate the total excretion of potassium over the timed
collection period (usually 24 hours) using the formula: [
\text{Potassium Excretion (mmol/24 hours)} = \text{Potassium
Concentration (mmol/L)} \times \text{Total Urine Volume (L)} ]
• Documentation:
◦ Enter the calculated potassium excretion value into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results for accuracy.
◦ Ensure the final report includes the potassium concentration,
total urine volume, and the calculated excretion value.
1. Reference Intervals:
• Normal Reference Range:
◦ Verified and indicated by the laboratory based on historical
data or standard references for timed urine collections.
1. Quality Assurance:
• Ensure all equipment is maintained and calibrated as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Retain records of all calibration, maintenance, and QC
procedures.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure the
accuracy of test results.
1. Handling Unexpected Results:
• If the results are outside the expected reference range, check for
potential pre-analytical or analytical errors.
• Repeat the analysis if necessary.
• If issues persist, consult with a supervisor for further investigation.
1. Safety and Compliance:
• Wear appropriate PPE during all laboratory procedures.
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols and CLIA regulations.
• Dispose of all biological waste according to biohazard guidelines.
