Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for POTATO WHITE IGG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for POTATO WHITE IGG
(Immunoglobulin G) in the laboratory. This includes preparation,
analysis, quality control, and reporting, ensuring that results are
accurate, reliable, and produced in a timely manner.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel who are
responsible for performing POTATO WHITE IGG tests. It is relevant
for the analysis conducted using the specified immunoassay
technique.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the analyses as described in this SOP and ensure compliance with all
quality control measures. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
reviewing and validating the procedure and results.
4. SPECIMEN CONSIDERATIONS
4.1 Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum-separating tube
(SST)
• Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For long-term storage, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens, samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparinized vacutainers), specimens with inadequate volume, or
specimens that have been stored incorrectly or for prolonged
periods without freezing.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
5.1 Reagents & Supplies:
• POTATO WHITE IGG Reagent Kit
• Calibrators and Controls (Low, Medium, and High)
• Microplate reader or other specified immunoassay device
• Microcentrifuge tubes or appropriate storage vials
5.2 Equipment:
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate washer
• Incubators
• Laboratory timer
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
• Ensure that all reagents and samples reach room temperature
before analysis.
• Gently mix all reagents before use and avoid bubbles.
• Label microplate wells or tubes properly for identifiable tracking.
6.2 Analysis:
1. Microplate Setup:
◦ Dispense 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into designated microplate wells.
◦ Add appropriate amount of detection antibody to each well,
as specified in the manufacturer's insert.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate for the specified time at the recommended
temperature (usually 37°C) according to kit manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash wells using a microplate washer or manual washing
procedure with appropriate buffer, following the
recommended cycles in the original kit insert.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the enzyme substrate solution to each well, incubate for
the recommended duration for color development.
5. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
6. Measurement:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
using a microplate reader.
6.3 Data Analysis and Reporting:
• Compare the sample OD readings against the calibration curve
established with known standards.
• Calculate the concentration of POTATO WHITE IGG in patient
samples using the calibration curve.
• Record and verify results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Internal Controls:
• Run internal positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
• QC results must fall within the specified range as defined by the
manufacturer. If results fall outside the acceptable range, the run
must be invalidated and troubleshooting steps followed before re-
analysis.
7.2 Troubleshooting:
• Check the entire assay procedure to identify potential errors
(improper washing, reagent expiry, etc.).
• Re-calibrate the instrument as needed.
• Consult the supervisor if issues persist.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and review results before entry into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Report any critical or unexpected values according to the
laboratory's reporting protocol.
• Include appropriate comments for any deviation from the
expected assay procedure.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens and reagents in accordance with standard
laboratory safety practices.
• Properly dispose of all biohazardous waste, using appropriate
containers.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coats, and safety glasses.
