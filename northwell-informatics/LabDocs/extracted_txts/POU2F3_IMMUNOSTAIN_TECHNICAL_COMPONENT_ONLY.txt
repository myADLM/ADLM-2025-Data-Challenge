Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for POU2F3 Immunostain
(Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing the POU2F3
immunostain on histological samples to ensure accurate,
reproducible, and quality results.
Responsibility:
This procedure is to be performed by trained laboratory personnel in
the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) section. It is the responsibility of all
laboratory staff to adhere to this procedure and to document all
actions and observations accurately.
1. DEFINITION
POU2F3 is a transcription factor and its immunostaining is used to
identify the expression in specific cell and tissue types for diagnostic
and research purposes.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• POU2F3 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (species-specific, conjugated with HRP or
alkaline phosphatase)
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) or another suitable chromogen
• Hematoxylin (for counterstaining)
• Xylene (for dewaxing slides)
• Ethanol (for rehydrating slides)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer or EDTA, pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution (normal serum or BSA)
• Mounting medium
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath (set at 60°C)
• Slide rack
• Hot plate
• Humidified chamber
• Microscope
• Coverslips
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Sections cut at 4-5 micrometers thickness
• Mounted on positively charged glass slides
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Cut FFPE tissue sections at 4-5 micrometers.
2. Place sections on positively charged slides.
3. Dry slides on a hot plate at 60°C for 1 hour.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Dewax slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanols (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%,
50%, distilled water, 2 minutes each).
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer or
EDTA, pH 6.0).
2. Heat in a water bath or microwave for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
D) Blocking:
1. Incubate sections with blocking solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature in a humidified chamber.
2. Drain excess blocking solution without washing.
E) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply POU2F3 primary antibody to each section.
2. Incubate overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.
F) Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Rinse sections in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Apply secondary antibody to each section.
3. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in a humidified
chamber.
G) Chromogen Development:
1. Rinse sections in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Apply DAB or other suitable chromogen to each section.
3. Incubate until the desired staining intensity develops (typically
5-10 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
H) Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dip slides in blueing solution (optional).
4. Rinse in distilled water.
I) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanols (70%, 80%, 95%,
100%, 2 minutes each).
2. Clear sections in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Apply coverslip using mounting medium.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide with each run to verify the staining
protocol.
• Include a negative control slide (omitting primary antibody) to
check for non-specific staining.
• Document all reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The immunostaining results will be reviewed and documented by
a pathologist.
• Only the technical component of the procedure is covered in this
SOP. Interpretation and reporting of results are the responsibility
of the pathologist.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inadequate staining: Check antigen retrieval steps, primary
antibody concentration, and incubation times.
• High background staining: Check blocking steps and antibody
dilutions.
• No staining: Ensure antibody specificity and tissue antigen
preservation.
