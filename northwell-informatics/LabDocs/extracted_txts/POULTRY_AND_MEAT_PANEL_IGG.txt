POULTRY AND MEAT PANEL IGG TESTING PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for testing and reporting results
for the Poultry and Meat Panel IgG using the Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. This ensures consistency
and accuracy in detecting IgG antibodies specific to antigens found in
poultry and meat.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the performance of
the test, including the pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical
steps. All laboratory personnel must ensure the accuracy and validity
of the results according to the following procedures.
2. DEFINITION
ELISA is an immunoassay technique used for quantifying specific
antibodies by having them bind to antigens that are immobilized on a
solid surface and then detecting such binding using enzyme-
mediated color change.
3. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
• ELISA Kit for Poultry and Meat Panel IgG (includes all necessary
reagents and controls)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Micropipettes (10-1000 µL)
• Wash buffer
• Distilled water
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Laboratory Timer
• Software for data analysis
A) Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before starting
the assay.
2. Prepare wash buffer according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Label each microplate well with appropriate sample or control
identification.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Collect patient serum samples previously accessioned.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3000g for 10 minutes to remove any
cellular debris.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant to clean tubes without
disturbing the pellet.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Add 100 µL of each diluted sample, control, and calibrator to
the pre-designated wells.
◦ Include Blank, Negative, and Positive Controls for every run.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Washing:
◦ Perform washing steps as per the ELISA kit instructions,
generally 3 to 5 washes.
4. Antibody Binding:
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugated antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate again at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Final Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes or
until the color develops.
7. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of the stop solution to each well.
D) Reading Results:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using the
microplate reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
2. Record the data.
E) Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Utilize the calibration curve to determine the IgG antibody
concentration in patient samples.
2. Compare sample OD readings to the Positive and Negative
Controls to establish validity.
3. Concentrations above the predetermined cut-off indicate a
positive result for IgG antibodies against the antigens of
interest.
F) Quality Control:
1. Perform regular calibration of the microplate reader.
2. Use quality control material provided with the ELISA kit for each
run.
3. Ensure consistency in pipetting and incubation times to
maintain assay accuracy.
4. Document the results and any deviations or corrective actions
in a dedicated logbook.
Reporting Results:
Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by a qualified technologist. Notify the appropriate parties of any
critical findings.
