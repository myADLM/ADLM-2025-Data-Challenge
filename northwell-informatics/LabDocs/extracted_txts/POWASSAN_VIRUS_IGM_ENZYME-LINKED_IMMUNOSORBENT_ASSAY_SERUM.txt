Standard Operating Procedure for POWASSAN VIRUS, IgM,
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of Powassan Virus (POWV)
IgM antibodies in human serum using the Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique. This test is essential for
diagnosing Powassan virus infection, especially in cases of
suspected viral encephalitis or meningitis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel trained in ELISA
techniques are responsible for performing the assay, ensuring quality
control, and documenting results. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing assay performance, confirming adherence to protocols,
and addressing any procedural deviations.
1. DEFINITION
POWV IgM ELISA is an immunological assay designed to detect
specific IgM antibodies against Powassan Virus in human serum
samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL serum required. Preferably collected
in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if tested within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA Reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Microplate Washer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Powassan Virus IgM ELISA Kit (containing microtiter plates,
conjugates, substrate solution, stop solution, positive and
negative controls, and sample diluent)
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Multichannel pipette
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Distilled or deionized water
C. Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, serum samples, and controls to room
temperature (18-25°C) before use.
• Mix all control and sample tubes gently by inversion before adding
to the plate.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Preparation
◦ Prepare the microtiter plate wells according to the number of
samples and controls to be tested.
◦ Duplicate wells for positive control, negative control, and
samples are recommended to ensure accuracy.
2. Sample and Control Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted positive and negative control into the
appropriate wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of each diluted patient serum sample into the
assigned wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of sample diluent into blank wells.
3. Incubation
◦ Cover the microtiter plate with a plate sealer and incubate at
37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing
◦ Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the wells 4
times with 1X wash buffer, ensuring each wash step remains
for at least 30 seconds.
5. Conjugate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated anti-human IgM to each
well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
6. Washing
◦ Wash the wells an additional 4 times with 1X wash buffer.
7. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 20
minutes.
8. Stopping the Reaction
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well, changing the color
from blue to yellow.
9. Reading the Plate
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA plate
reader within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
E. Quality Control:
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
the integrity of the assay.
• Run internal controls (High, Medium, and Low) for assay
validation.
• All controls must fall within predetermined ranges for results to be
accepted.
• If controls do not meet acceptance criteria: i) Review procedure
execution to identify potential errors. ii) Verify reagent integrity
and operating conditions. iii) If necessary, repeat the entire run.
F. Interpretation of Results:
• Calculate the average absorbance for each control and sample.
• The presence of POWV IgM is determined by comparing sample
absorbance values to the cut-off value defined by the assay kit
instructions.
G. Reporting Results:
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review by a qualified laboratory technologist.
• Positive results should be reported as “Positive for POWV IgM
antibodies” along with numerical values.
• Negative results should be reported as “Negative for POWV IgM
antibodies.”
1. Method Limitations:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with
test results.
◦ False positives or negatives can occur. Clinical correlation
and additional testing may be required for confirmation.
2. References: Refer to the Powassan Virus IgM ELISA kit insert
for detailed information on reagent preparation, testing
procedure, validation, and interpretation of results.
3. Record Keeping:
◦ Maintain detailed records of test performance, including
sample ID, results, and QC records.
◦ Documentation should comply with laboratory quality
management system standards and regulatory
requirements.
