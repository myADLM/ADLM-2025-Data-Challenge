Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
POWASSAN VIRUS, RNA, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR,
BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of Powassan
virus RNA in blood specimens using molecular detection by PCR.
Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test results for clinical
diagnosis and patient management.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform the procedure as outlined, ensure proper
execution, and ensure quality control measures are adhered to.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen:
▪ Blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tube.
▪ Minimum volume: 2 mL whole blood.
◦ Storage and Stability:
▪ Store specimens at 2-8°C if they will be tested within 48
hours.
▪ If delayed beyond 48 hours, store at -70°C or below until
testing.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ PCR Thermocycler
▪ Microcentrifuge
▪ Vortex mixer
▪ Pipettes and sterile tips
▪ Biosafety cabinet
◦ Reagents:
▪ Extraction kits specific for RNA from blood
▪ Reverse transcription reagents
▪ Master mix for PCR
▪ Primers and probes specific to Powassan virus RNA
▪ Nuclease-free water
▪ PCR grade ethanol
◦ Supplies:
▪ Microcentrifuge tubes
▪ PCR tubes or plates
▪ Gloves and lab coats
3. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction:
◦ Step 1: Thaw samples if frozen. Keep on ice.
◦ Step 2: Use a commercially validated RNA extraction kit.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Step 3: Elute RNA in 50 µl of elution buffer or RNase-free
water.
◦ Step 4: Measure RNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer. Ensure A260/280 ratio is between 1.8
and 2.0.
B. Reverse Transcription:
◦ Step 1: Set up reverse transcription reaction using extracted
RNA. Prepare the following mixture on ice:
▪ RNA sample: 5 µl
▪ Reverse transcription master mix: 15 µl (according to the
manufacturer's protocol)
◦ Step 2: Perform reverse transcription in a thermocycler
using the recommended cycling conditions by the reagent
manufacturer (usually 42°C for 50 minutes followed by 70°C
for 15 minutes).
C. PCR Amplification:
◦ Step 1: Prepare the PCR master mix on ice:
▪ Nuclease-free water: variable
▪ PCR buffer: as per the manufacturer's instructions
▪ MgCl2: as per the manufacturer's instructions
▪ dNTPs: as per the manufacturer's instructions
▪ Specific primers and probes for Powassan virus: as per
the manufacturer's instructions
▪ DNA polymerase: as per the manufacturer's instructions
▪ cDNA (reverse transcribed from RNA): 5 µl per reaction
◦ Step 2: Mix the components thoroughly and dispense 20 µl
of the reaction mix into PCR tubes or plates.
◦ Step 3: Add 5 µl of cDNA from each sample to the
respective tubes, including positive and negative controls.
◦ Step 4: Seal the PCR tubes or plate and load them into the
thermocycler.
◦ Step 5: Program the thermocycler with the following
conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
▪ Number of cycles: 40
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests.
◦ Verify that the positive control gives a positive result and the
negative control gives a negative result before assessing
patient samples.
◦ Record all quality control results and take corrective actions
if controls do not perform as expected.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Analyze the PCR amplification data to determine the
presence of Powassan virus RNA.
◦ Presence of a specific amplification curve in the patient
sample that matches the positive control indicates a positive
result.
◦ Absence of specific amplification curve or only the presence
of negative control amplification indicates a negative result.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Results must be reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist.
◦ Report positive results immediately to the requesting
physician and follow critical value reporting protocol.
◦ Ensure all results are documented and stored according to
laboratory protocols.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Positive: Presence of Powassan virus RNA.
◦ Negative: Absence of Powassan virus RNA.
8. REFERENCE MATERIALS
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for PCR reagents and RNA
extraction kits.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for molecular diagnostic methods.
NOTE: Ensure all procedures are performed in compliance with
laboratory safety and quality management protocols, and all biosafety
measures are strictly followed to prevent contamination.
