SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Powassan Virus, RNA, Molecular Detection, PCR, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedural steps and
guidelines for the molecular detection of Powassan Virus RNA using
PCR in random urine specimens. This standard operating procedure
ensures accurate and reliable test results while maintaining
laboratory safety and quality control.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and analysts are responsible for performing
specified procedures to detect Powassan Virus RNA in urine
specimens. It is the responsibility of the supervisory personnel to
ensure that laboratory staff follow this SOP accurately and to verify
the integrity of the results generated.
1. DEFINITIONS
Powassan Virus: A tick-borne flavivirus that can cause encephalitis
and other neurological complications. RNA: Ribonucleic acid, a
nucleic acid present in viruses that carries genetic information. PCR:
Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify specific
RNA sequences.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL of freshly voided urine specimen collected in a sterile
container.
• The specimen should be processed within 4 hours of collection. If
delay is expected, refrigerate (2-8°C) up to 24 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Urine specimens collected more than 24 hours prior without
refrigeration.
• Specimens in improper containers (e.g., non-sterile or
contaminated).
• Specimens with apparent contamination or visible particulates.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR thermocycler
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Biosafety cabinet
Reagents:
• RNA extraction kit
• Reverse transcription reagents
• PCR amplification mix
• Primers and probes specific for Powassan Virus RNA
• Molecular grade water
Supplies:
• Sterile collection containers
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat and appropriate PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
1. Upon receiving the urine specimen, log the details into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Inspect the specimen for volume and signs of contamination.
Reject if criteria do not meet specifications in section 4.
3. Aliquot 5 mL of urine into a sterile microcentrifuge tube for
processing.
B. RNA Extraction:
1. Perform RNA extraction using the designated extraction kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Verify RNA yield and purity using a spectrophotometer if
required.
C. Reverse Transcription:
1. Prepare the reverse transcription reaction mix with the required
reagents and RNA template.
2. Run the reverse transcription reaction according to the
specified cycle conditions in the thermocycler.
D. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix:
◦ Template cDNA (from reverse transcription)
◦ PCR buffer
◦ Primers/probes specifically designed for Powassan Virus
RNA
◦ Nucleotide mix
◦ DNA polymerase
2. Dispense the reaction mix into the PCR tubes or plate wells.
3. Load the PCR tubes/plate into the PCR thermocycler and
initiate the specified PCR program.
4. Ensure the thermal cycling conditions as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds
5. Monitor the amplification process and record data at the end of
the run.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Evaluate the amplification curves for fluorescence threshold
value (Ct value) determination.
2. Compare the specimen Ct values against positive and negative
controls.
3. A Ct value within the specified range indicates the presence of
Powassan Virus RNA while a non-detect result indicates
absence.
4. Document the results and review for accuracy.
5. Enter the results into the LIS and release to the ordering
clinician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform validation of reagents and equipment per the laboratory’s
QA/QC guidelines. Each run must include:
• Positive controls (known RNA template)
• Negative controls (nuclease-free water)
• Internal controls to monitor for inhibition
QC failures or outliers must be addressed promptly, and the entire
run may need to be repeated if necessary.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Common Issues:
• No amplification/detection: Check PCR reagents, confirm RNA
integrity, verify thermocycler performance, and eliminate
contamination sources.
• False positives: Ensure proper handling and use of PPE to
minimize contamination.
• Inconsistent results: Perform equipment calibration and reagent
validation checks.

1. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain records of all specimen handling, RNA extraction, PCR
setup, and result reporting for review and traceability. Documentation
should include date, technician initials, QC results, and any
deviations observed.
Ensuring adherence to this SOP will facilitate standardized, reliable,
and accurate detection of Powassan Virus RNA in urine specimens
through molecular PCR techniques.
