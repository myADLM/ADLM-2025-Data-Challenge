Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Powassan Virus, RNA, Molecular
Detection by PCR, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
molecular detection of Powassan virus RNA in serum
specimens utilizing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
technology.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to adhere to this SOP, ensure the integrity of the specimen,
and appropriately document the analysis and results. Quality control,
calibration, and maintenance of PCR equipment must be performed
as specified to ensure the accuracy of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a sterile, appropriately labeled serum
separator tube (SST).
• Specimen must be properly labeled with patient identifiers and
collection date and time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly contaminated.
• Specimens with no proper identification or that are outside the
acceptable time frame for testing.
• Specimens not stored or transported under appropriate conditions
(e.g., specimens that have not been refrigerated or arrived more
than 72 hours post-collection without prior freezing).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR thermocycler
• RNA extraction kit compatible with serum samples
• PCR master mix reagents (enzymes, buffers, dNTPs, primers,
probes specific for Powassan virus RNA)
• Nuclease-free water
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
• Microcentrifuge and PCR tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes with sterilized aerosol-resistant tips
• RNAse-free work area and consumables
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing and RNA Extraction
1. Upon arrival, verify specimen identity and information with the
accompanying requisition form.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube at 1300-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum from the clot.
3. Using a sterile pipette, transfer the serum to a labeled
nuclease-free tube for RNA extraction.
4. Follow the specific RNA extraction kit protocol to extract viral
RNA from the serum.
5. Ensure all RNA extraction steps are conducted in an RNAse-
free environment to prevent contamination.
B. PCR Preparation
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The master mix should include:
◦ Enzyme mix
◦ Reverse transcriptase (if using one-step RT-PCR)
◦ Forward and reverse primers specific to Powassan virus
RNA
◦ Probes labeled with appropriate fluorophores
◦ Nuclease-free water
2. Aliquot the master mix into individual PCR reaction tubes.
3. Add the extracted RNA samples into the PCR reaction tubes,
ensuring all samples are processed in duplicate or triplicate to
ensure result reliability.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Program the real-time PCR thermocycler as follows (example
cycling parameters):
◦ Reverse transcription (if needed): 50°C for 15 minutes
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute, 40 cycles
2. Place the PCR tubes into the PCR thermocycler and start the
run.
3. Evaluate the amplification plot and Ct values after the run for
each sample.
D. Result Interpretation
1. A positive result is indicated by Ct values less than 40 cycles in
both/all replicate wells.
2. A negative result is indicated by no detectable Ct value or a Ct
value considered beyond the cut-off (e.g., ≥40 cycles) in both/all
replicate wells.
3. Include appropriate controls in each run:
◦ Positive control: Known Powassan virus RNA to validate
correct assay performance.
◦ Negative control: Nuclease-free water to verify absence of
contamination.
E. Quality Control
1. Ensure that a positive control exhibits amplification within the
specified range for positive Ct values.
2. Ensure the negative control exhibits no amplification
(undetermined Ct value).
3. Follow internal quality control rules to assess quality control
materials and run-to-run consistency.
4. Document and investigate any deviations or anomalies in the
amplification plots or controls.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Review and Verification
• Technologist to review the Ct values and amplification curves.
• Document and verify results according to laboratory standards
and guidelines.
B. Reporting
• Report results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System)
ensuring results are clear and include interpretative statements
(Positive, Negative, or Inconclusive).
• Include reports of critical results and unusual findings as per
laboratory policy.
• Ensure timely communication of results to the requesting
physician.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including PPE and
biosafety level 2 practices.
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials following institutional and
regulatory guidelines.
