Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for POWASSAN VIRUS
RNA MOLECULAR DETECTION VIA PCR IN SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide instructions for the detection of Powassan virus RNA in
spinal fluid samples using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
technique to ensure accurate and reliable identification of the virus.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to strictly adhere to
the procedures established in this document. Supervisors must
ensure compliance and address any deviations or issues that may
arise.
2. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen type: Spinal Fluid (CSF)
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL
• Storage: Refrigerate at 2-8°C if not processed immediately. For
long-term storage, freeze at ≤ -20°C.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filter tips
• RNA extraction kits (validated for viral RNA extraction from CSF)
• PCR machine (validated for clinical diagnostic testing)
• Powassan virus-specific primers and probes
• PCR Master Mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control (known Powassan virus RNA)
• Negative control (nuclease-free water)
• Analytical balance
Preparation:
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Clean and disinfect the work area before and after processing
specimens.
• Prepare all reagents and equipment according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
RNA Extraction:
1. Label microcentrifuge tubes with sample identifiers.
2. Aliquot 200 µL of CSF into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
3. Follow the RNA extraction kit protocol to isolate RNA from the
CSF samples.
4. Verify the quality and quantity of extracted RNA using a
spectrophotometer or equivalent instrument.
PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the kit’s instructions,
which typically includes:
◦ 10 µL of PCR Master Mix
◦ 1 µL of forward primer
◦ 1 µL of reverse primer
◦ 1 µL of probe
◦ 5 µL of nuclease-free water
2. Add 2 µL of extracted RNA to the PCR Master Mix, bringing the
total reaction volume to 20 µL.
3. Prepare positive and negative controls:
◦ Positive control: Add 2 µL of known Powassan virus RNA.
◦ Negative control: Add 2 µL of nuclease-free water.
Thermal Cycling Conditions:
1. Set up the PCR machine with the following cycling parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Amplification (45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds
Result Analysis:
1. After the PCR run, analyze the amplification plots.
2. Compare the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the samples to the
controls.
◦ A positive result is indicated by a Ct value within 10 cycles
of the positive control.
◦ A negative result is indicated by the absence of an
amplification curve or a Ct value significantly higher than the
positive control.
Quality Control:
• Ensure that all positive and negative controls meet acceptance
criteria.
• Repeat the assay if controls do not behave as expected.
• Document all results, including any troubleshooting steps.
Reporting Results:
• Record the final results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Positive results: Indicate detection of Powassan virus RNA.
• Negative results: Indicate no detection of Powassan virus RNA.
Method Limitations:
• Ensure the specimen is properly collected, stored, and
transported to avoid degradation of viral RNA.
• Cross-contamination between samples can lead to false-positive
results.
• Inhibitors present in clinical specimens can lead to false-negative
results.

reagents.

clinical diagnostics.
• Laboratory quality management system (QMS) guidelines and
protocols.
