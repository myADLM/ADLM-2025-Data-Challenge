Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Prader-Willi/Angelman
Syndrome, Molecular Analysis – Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the molecular analysis of
Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and Angelman Syndrome (AS) through
methylation-specific PCR and/or other relevant techniques. This SOP
ensures that procedures are conducted consistently and accurately
to yield reliable results that inform patient diagnosis and
management.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to
follow this SOP accurately. A designated supervisor is responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any deviations or issues.
1. PROCEDURE
2.1 Equipment and Reagents
2.1.1 Equipment:
• Thermal Cycler
• PCR workstation
• Electrophoresis apparatus
• Gel Documentation System
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex Mixer
2.1.2 Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) reagents
• Bisulfite modification reagents
• DNA ladder
• Primers for PWS/AS regions
• Positive/Negative Control DNA
• Agarose gel and electrophoresis buffers
• Ethidium Bromide or GelRed™ for staining
2.2 Specimen:
• Preferred specimen: Peripheral blood (EDTA tube), buccal swab,
or other tissue samples as required.
• Ensure that the specimen matches documentation and has been
annotated and stored correctly upon receipt in the laboratory.
2.3 Protocol Overview:
• DNA extraction
• Bisulfite treatment of DNA
• Methylation-Specific PCR (MS-PCR)
• Gel electrophoresis
• Result interpretation and documentation
2.4 DNA Extraction:
• Using the designated DNA extraction kit, follow the
manufacturer’s protocol to isolate genomic DNA from the
specimen.
• Quantify the DNA and record the concentration. Ensure DNA is of
appropriate quality for bisulfite modification.
• Store the DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
2.5 Bisulfite Modification:
2.5.1 Treatment:
• Using bisulfite modification reagents, treat the DNA according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. This step converts unmethylated
cytosines into uracils, while methylated cytosines remain
unchanged.
2.5.2 Clean-up:
• Purify the bisulfite-treated DNA using a manufacturer-
recommended clean-up procedure to ensure removal of excess
reagents and salts.
• Quantify the DNA, if possible, and ensure it is ready for
subsequent amplification.
2.6 Methylation-Specific PCR:
2.6.1 PCR Setup:
• Prepare the PCR master mix with appropriate reagents, including
primers specific for PWS/AS methylation-sensitive regions.
• Include positive control (methylated DNA), negative control
(unmethylated DNA), and no-template control (NTC) in every
batch.
• Distribute the master mix to PCR tubes or plates, and add the
bisulfite-treated DNA, ensuring careful and accurate pipetting
techniques.
2.6.2 PCR Cycling Conditions:
• Perform PCR cycling as per the specific condition required by the
methylation-specific assay. Typical conditions are:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C (primer-specific) for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Repeat for 35-40 cycles
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
2.7 Gel Electrophoresis and Visualization:
2.7.1 Preparation:
• Prepare a 2% agarose gel containing appropriate DNA stain (e.g.,
Ethidium Bromide or GelRed™).
2.7.2 Loading and Running:
• Load PCR products alongside a DNA ladder into the gel wells.
• Run the gel electrophoresis at appropriate voltage (100-120V)
until the bands are well-separated.
• Visualize the gel under UV light using a Gel Documentation
System and capture the image for analysis.
2.8 Result Interpretation:
2.8.1 Analyze the gel image:
• Compare the band pattern from the sample to the positive and
negative controls.
• In PWS, the absence of the paternal methylation pattern and
presence of the maternal methylation pattern indicates the
syndrome.
• In AS, the absence of the maternal methylation pattern and
presence of the paternal methylation pattern signals the
syndrome.
• Record the presence or absence of specific bands, indicating
methylation status.
2.8.2 Reporting:
• Document all findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure to note down any anomalies, deviations, or issues
encountered during the process.
2.9 Quality Control:
• Validate the PCR results with internal and external controls for
every batch.
• Analyze the QC material results to confirm assay performance
and troubleshoot any issues accordingly.
2.10 Troubleshooting:
• Poor amplification or lack of specific bands: Verify DNA quality
and concentration, reassess PCR conditions, ensure reagents are
within expiry and that PCR setup is free from contamination
(check NTC).
• Non-specific bands: Optimize annealing temperatures and
reassess primer design.
• Consult the manufacturer’s manual as needed for additional
troubleshooting guidance.
1. REFERENCE
• Manufacturer’s kit inserts and preparation manuals.
• Relevant published literature and guidelines on molecular
analysis for PWS and AS.

Note: These procedures must be adapted if specific equipment and
reagent kits have particular requirements that deviate from this
general protocol. Ensure that technologists are trained in these
specific protocols and have access to appropriate supportive
resources and troubleshooting guidelines.
