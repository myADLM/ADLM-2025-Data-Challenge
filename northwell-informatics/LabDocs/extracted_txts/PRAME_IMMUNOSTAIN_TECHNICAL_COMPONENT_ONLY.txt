Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for PRAME Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE To ensure the accurate and standardized
processing of PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in
Melanoma) immunostain samples. This procedure outlines the
steps for the technical component of generating PRAME
immunostain results, ensuring that the specimen is properly
processed, stained, and analyzed.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory staff trained in
immunohistochemistry to follow this procedure and maintain proper
documentation of all steps involved.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS a. Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Tissue sections should be 3-4 microns thick.
b. Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimens that are not properly fixed. -
Specimens damaged or showing signs of degradation.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS a. Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Slide dryer
◦ Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
◦ Light microscope
b. Reagents: - PRAME primary antibody - Detection kit (e.g., HRP-
polymer) - DAB (3,3’-diaminobenzidine) chromogen - Hematoxylin
counterstain - Xylene and ethanol for deparaffinization and
rehydration - Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Sectioning: 1. Cut tissue sections at 3-4 microns thick using
a microtome. 2. Float sections on a water bath at approximately
40°C. 3. Pick up sections on positively charged glass slides. 4. Allow
slides to air dry overnight or dry in a slide dryer at 60°C for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 1. Deparaffinize slides by
immersing in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes each. 2.
Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol: a. 100% ethanol, two
changes for 5 minutes each. b. 95% ethanol for 2 minutes. c. 70%
ethanol for 2 minutes. 3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval: 1. Place slides in a microwave-safe container
filled with appropriate antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH
6.0). 2. Heat slides in a microwave or pressurized heating device
according to manufacturer's instructions. 3. Allow slides to cool for 20
minutes. 4. Rinse slides in PBS.
D. Immunostaining: Note: Perform manual staining or use an
automated immunostainer as specified by the laboratory's SOP. 1.
Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. 2. Rinse slides in PBS. 3. Apply
blocking solution to cover the tissue sections and incubate for 10
minutes. 4. Apply primary PRAME antibody and incubate according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations (typically 30-60 minutes at
room temperature). 5. Rinse slides in PBS. 6. Apply secondary
antibody (HRP-polymer) and incubate as recommended by the
detection kit manufacturer (typically 30 minutes). 7. Rinse slides in
PBS. 8. Apply DAB chromogen, monitoring the color development
(typically 2-10 minutes). 9. Rinse slides in distilled water. 10.
Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 11. Rinse slides in
distilled water.
E. Dehydration and Mounting: 1. Dehydrate slides through a graded
series of ethanol: a. 70% ethanol for 2 minutes. b. 95% ethanol for 2
minutes. c. 100% ethanol, two changes for 2 minutes each. 2. Clear
slides in three changes of xylene for 2 minutes each. 3. Mount
coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
F. Microscopic Examination and Documentation: 1. Examine slides
under a light microscope. 2. Ensure controls (both positive and
negative) show expected staining patterns. 3. Document findings and
record any deviations or issues encountered during the process.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of slides
to ensure reagent and staining quality.
◦ Document control results and any corrective actions taken if
controls fail.
2. HANDLING AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
◦ Handle all chemicals and biological specimens following
established safety guidelines.
◦ Dispose of waste materials in accordance with laboratory
safety protocols and regulations.
