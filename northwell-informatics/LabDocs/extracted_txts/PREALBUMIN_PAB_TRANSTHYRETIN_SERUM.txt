Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytic Phase of Generating Results for Prealbumin (PAB) /
Transthyretin, Serum
1. PURPOSE: To ensure accurate and reliable results for
Prealbumin (PAB) / Transthyretin, Serum using the designated
analytical method. This SOP provides detailed procedures for
the preparation, calibration, quality control, and analysis of
serum samples for PAB determination.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: The procedure shall be performed by
qualified laboratory personnel trained in serum protein analysis.
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to ensure all steps
in the process are executed as per this protocol and to address
and document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
3. DEFINITIONS: Prealbumin (PAB) or Transthyretin: A serum
protein used as a marker for nutritional status and hepatic
function.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum required.
• Handling: Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for at least
30 minutes, then centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum from cells.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days refrigerated
at 2-8°C or for up to 1 month when frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Specimens that were not properly refrigerated or frozen post-
collection.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Prealbumin Reagent Kit: including calibrators and quality control
materials.
• Automated Biochemistry Analyzer as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
• Micropipettors and appropriate tips.
• Quality Control materials
• Deionized Water
Storage and Handling:
• Store reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Do not use reagents past their expiration date.
• Ensure reagents are equilibrated to room temperature before use.
1. CALIBRATION:
• Calibration of the instrument should be performed as per
manufacturer’s instructions using the provided calibrators.
• Calibrate the instrument every 24 hours during periods of
continuous use or after any significant maintenance.
• Document all calibration activities including date, time, and initials
of the personnel performing the calibration.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run appropriate quality control (QC) samples at the start of each
batch, after calibration, and after every 20 samples.
• Use QC materials at two different concentration levels to ensure
accuracy across the measurement range.
• Review QC results to ensure they are within the specified control
limits. If QC results are out of range, re-calibrate the instrument
and re-run the QC samples before proceeding with patient
samples.
• Document all QC results including date, time, and initials of the
personnel performing the QC analysis.
1. PROCEDURE: A. Sample Preparation and Handling: a. Thaw
frozen samples at room temperature ensuring even thawing. b.
Mix samples thoroughly by gentle inversion. c. Follow the
biochemistry analyzer’s instructions for sample loading.
B. Analytical Measurement: a. Load patient and control samples
onto the biochemistry analyzer as per manufacturer
instructions. b. Perform the analysis by initiating the appropriate
assay protocol for Prealbumin (PAB) on the analyzer. c. Ensure
the analyzer completes the run and prints or electronically
records the results.
2. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review analyzer print-outs or electronic results.
• Compare the results to the reference interval:
◦ Reference Interval: 0.15–0.35 g/L (can vary slightly based on
the method used)
• Critical values: If Prealbumin levels are critically low <0.10 g/L,
promptly alert the ordering physician as per laboratory critical
value policy.
• Record all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify them for accuracy.
• Unusual results or results outside linearity should be investigated
and the sample re-tested if necessary.
1. SAMPLE STORAGE AND DISPOSAL:
• Post-analysis, retain serum samples at 2–8°C for 7 days or freeze
at -20°C if long-term storage is required.
• Dispose of all biological materials as biohazardous waste,
following standard laboratory waste disposal protocols.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icteric samples can interfere with the
assay.
• Refer to the reagent manufacturer's package insert for specific
interferences and limitations.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain records of each step in the process including calibration,
QC, patient results, and any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure appropriate logs are completed and maintained as per
laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Biochemistry Analyzer.
• Prealbumin Reagent Kit insert.
• CLSI guidelines for serum protein analysis.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or when new methods and
instruments are adopted by the laboratory.
