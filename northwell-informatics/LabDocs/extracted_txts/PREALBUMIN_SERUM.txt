Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Prealbumin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for the
analysis of serum prealbumin using the specified instrument and
reagents. This ensures accurate and reliable results for patient
diagnosis and management.
Responsibility:
Laboratory scientists are responsible for performing the analysis and
ensuring that prealbumin results are obtained accurately and
reported timely. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process and providing support in case of troubleshooting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Instructions:
• Collect blood in a plain or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge for separation of serum within 2 hours of collection.
Specimen Stability:
• After separation, serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if
not immediately analyzed.
• If analysis cannot be performed within 72 hours, store serum at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: [Specify Analyzer Model]
• Reagent Kits: [Specify Manufacturer and Kit Name]
• Calibrators: Provided with the reagent kit or as specified by the
manufacturer.
• Controls: Two levels of quality control material (low, high).
• Other Supplies:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
i) Calibrator and Quality Control Preparation:
• Prepare calibrators and controls according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Allow calibrators and controls to come to room temperature
before use.
ii) Instrument Setup and Calibration:
• Turn on the analyzer and ensure it is functioning correctly.
• Perform a daily calibration using the provided calibrators.
• Verify calibration by running quality control samples at both levels
(low, high).
iii) Sample Preparation:
• Ensure serum samples are free from hemolysis or lipemia.
• If serum has been frozen, thaw it at room temperature and mix
gently before analysis.
• Aliquot required volume of serum for analysis.
iv) Sample Analysis:
• Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Input necessary patient and sample information into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Select the appropriate prealbumin analysis protocol on the
analyzer.
• Start the analysis and monitor the instrument for any error
messages.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND VERIFICATION:
i) Review of Results:
• Review analyzer outputs for each sample.
• Ensure quality control results fall within acceptable ranges before
verifying patient results.
ii) Result Handling:
• If a sample result exceeds the linearity range, perform necessary
dilution as per the manufacturer’s instructions and re-run the
sample.
• If quality control results are out of range, investigate possible
causes (e.g., reagent issues, instrument malfunction, sample
quality) and take corrective action.
iii) Reporting Results:
• Verify acceptable results within the LIS.
• Ensure critical results are verified and communicated to relevant
personnel timely, following laboratory protocols.
Reference Interval:
• Refer to the specific reference interval provided by the reagent
manufacturer or pre-established laboratory ranges (typically 20-40
mg/dL for adults).
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
i) Quality Control:
• Quality control samples must be run at the beginning of each shift
and whenever a new reagent kit is opened.
• Document all quality control results, and investigate any control
values falling outside the acceptable limits.
ii) Troubleshooting:
• If the analyzer encounters errors, refer to the operator's manual
for troubleshooting steps.
• If errors persist, notify the supervisor or contact the
manufacturer's technical support.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
Ensure to document all steps, including sample accessioning, QC
results, instrument maintenance, any troubleshooting, and final result
reporting in accordance with laboratory standard operating
procedures.
