Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PRECIVITYAD2, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for generating accurate and reliable results
for the PRECIVITYAD2 test on plasma specimens. The procedure
ensures consistency in testing, fulfillment of regulatory requirements,
and provision of high-quality results for clinical decision-making.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory technologists trained in the PRECIVITYAD2 assay are
responsible for performing the test in compliance with this SOP. The
Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for ensuring staff competency,
maintaining reagents and equipment, and overseeing compliance
with this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen stability: Store at 2-8°C if analyzed within 72 hours;
otherwise, freeze at -20°C for longer storage. Avoid multiple
freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
• Specimens that have not been stored under proper conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PRECIVITYAD2 assay kit (store and handle as per
manufacturer’s instructions).
• Precision pipettes and tips.
• Calibrated centrifuge.
• EDTA plasma tubes.
• Laboratory-grade freezers and refrigerators for specimen storage.
• Temperature-monitored incubator.
• Quality control materials provided in the PRECIVITYAD2 kit.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-analytic phase:
• Verify specimen integrity per acceptance criteria.
• Record specimen details in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Centrifuge EDTA tubes at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to separate
plasma. Carefully aliquot plasma to avoid disturbances to the
cellular layer.
B) Analytical phase:
i) Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen plasma specimens at room temperature and mix
properly by gentle inversion.
• Equilibrate all samples, standards, and controls to room
temperature.
ii) Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare reagents, calibrators, and quality controls according to
the manufacturer's guidelines.
iii) Assay Procedure:
• Add an appropriate volume of plasma sample, quality control, or
calibrator to designated wells in the microtiter plate.
• Add assay buffer as instructed by the kit protocol.
• Incubate the microtiter plate in an incubator at 37°C for the
specific duration, ensuring even temperature distribution.
• Wash the wells thoroughly after incubation if required by the
specific assay protocol.
• Add appropriate detection reagent and incubate as required.
• Measure optical density using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength provided in the manufacturer's instructions.
iv) Calibration and Quality Control:
• Run calibrators and quality controls in parallel with patient
samples.
• Perform assay calibration using the standards provided in the kit.
• Ensure that quality control results fall within the acceptable range
as defined by the kit insert. Quality controls should be recorded in
the QC log.
C) Post-analytical phase:
• Transfer generated results to the LIS for review.
• Verify that all controls are within the defined range before
releasing patient results.
• Re-run assays where controls out of range indicate possible
assay issues.
• Document any deviations in the run and corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results within the LIS before they are sent to the clinical
team.
• Critical results must be communicated directly to the requesting
physician or clinical team, following the established laboratory
protocol for critical values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC for each new lot of assay kits and document
adherence according to laboratory guidelines.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs as required.
• Document any incidences of assay non-conformance and
corrective actions taken.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Schedule and record regular maintenance of equipment (pipettes,
centrifuges, microplate readers) as per manufacturer's
instructions.
• Calibrate instruments regularly.
• Ensure that all equipment and reagents are within their expiration
date.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow biosafety guidelines for handling human plasma
specimens.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste in compliance with regulatory
standards and use designated biohazard waste containers.
