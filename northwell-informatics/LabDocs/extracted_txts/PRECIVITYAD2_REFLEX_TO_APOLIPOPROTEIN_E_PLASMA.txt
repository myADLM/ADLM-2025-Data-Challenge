Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Results for PRECIVITYAD2, REFLEX TO
APOLIPOPROTEIN E, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to define the process
and procedures followed in the analytical phase of generating
results for the PRECIVITYAD2, Reflex to Apolipoprotein E test,
using plasma specimens. This protocol ensures the accuracy,
reliability, and timeliness of test results for clinical decision-
making.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
conducting the analysis of plasma specimens to determine
PRECIVITYAD2, with a reflex to Apolipoprotein E testing as
needed, ensuring adherence to CLIA regulations.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory staff are responsible for performing the test
procedures accurately.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process,
troubleshooting as needed, and ensuring completion within the
designated timeframe.
• All personnel must ensure compliance with this SOP and
documentation of all procedural steps and corrective actions.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection: Blood is drawn into an anticoagulant tube (EDTA tube
preferred) and centrifuged to separate plasma.
• Storage: Plasma should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is
performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, the plasma should
be aliquoted and stored at -20°C or colder.
4.2 REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• PRECIVITYAD2 assay reagents and control materials
• Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) test reagents
• Calibrators for the assays as indicated by the manufacturer
• Pipettes and appropriate tips
• Centrifuge
• Applicable assay analyzer or equipment as per manufacturer's
specifications
• Refrigerator and freezer (for specimen and reagent storage)
• Temperature monitoring devices
4.3 QUALITY CONTROL
• Include controls at high, low, and mid-range levels to verify assay
performance.
• Run controls in duplicate at the beginning of each day and after
every 20 samples.
• Document all QC results in the QC log. A designated QC officer
must review and sign off on the log monthly.
• If QC results are outside of acceptable limits, do not proceed with
patient sample analysis until the issue is resolved and
documented.
4.4 ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
• Thaw plasma samples to room temperature, ensuring no
evidence of hemolysis or clots.
• Vortex each sample gently before pipetting.
• Prepare reagents and calibrators as instructed in the
PRECIVITYAD2 and ApoE assay kit inserts.
• Program the analyzer according to the PRECIVITYAD2 assay
protocol.
• Load samples, calibrators, and controls in the designated
positions within the analyzer.
• Begin the assay run, following all prompts and commands of the
analyzer.
• Assay results: Verify the run's completion. Review the data for
each sample, ensuring that internal controls are within acceptable
limits.
4.5 REFLEX TESTING FOR APOE
• If the PRECIVITYAD2 results require reflex testing for ApoE:
1. Prepare additional plasma aliquots.
2. Program the necessary ApoE assay protocol in the analyzer.
3. Run the ApoE assay on the designated analyzer.
4. Ensure that quality control procedures for ApoE are adhered
to as described above.
5. Review all results and validate the run before reporting.
4.6 DATA INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Review the test data for completion and accuracy.
• Interpret the results referring to provided assay interpretation
guidelines.
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Double-check entries for correctness.
• Sign off on validated results and submit them for clinical use.
4.7 DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs for sample processing, QC results, equipment
calibration, and maintenance.
• Archive assay data, QC logs, and maintenance records according
to laboratory archival procedures (minimum retention period of 2
years).
4.8 TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If instrument or reagent failures occur, document the issue and
resolution in the troubleshooting log.
• Re-run QC samples post-repair to ensure accuracy before
proceeding with patient specimens.
• All corrective actions and additional steps taken must be logged
and reported to the supervisor.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
• The reference intervals for PRECIVITYAD2 and ApoE assays are
determined based on assay-specific package inserts.
• Critical values warranting immediate clinical intervention should
be communicated directly to the requesting physician,
documented, and noted in the patient report.
1. REFERENCES
• PRECIVITYAD2 Assay Kit Insert and User Guide.
• Apolipoprotein E Assay Kit Insert.
• CLIA Guidelines for Laboratory Testing.
• Laboratory’s internal Validation and Quality Control Procedures
documentation.
1. NOTES AND ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
• Ensure all laboratory staff are trained in this specific protocol and
have verified competency before performing the assay.
• The procedure is subject to periodic review and updates to align
with current regulatory standards and advancements in
technology.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate
and timely results for the PRECIVITYAD2, reflex to Apolipoprotein E
test, supporting effective patient care.
