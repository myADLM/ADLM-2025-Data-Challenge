Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
PRECIVITYAD, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the precise and accurate generation of
results for the PRECIVITYAD, PLASMA test. This assay is used to
support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease by assessing plasma
biomarkers.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in generating
results for the PRECIVITYAD, PLASMA test, including the initial
setup, running, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated personnel are responsible for performing the assay
and generating accurate results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
that quality control measures are enforced.
• All laboratory staff must report any deviations, errors, or unusual
occurrences immediately to their supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
PRECIVITYAD: A plasma-based test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's
Disease.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• PRECIVITYAD, PLASMA assay kit
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Plasma aliquot tubes
• Reagents and controls as specified by the kit
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
required wavelengths
• Laboratory timer
• Cooling racks
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable samples: Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of plasma required.
• Stability: Plasma samples should be processed and stored at
-80°C and are stable for up to 6 months.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• QC materials: Use provided controls in PRECIVITYAD assay kit.
• Perform QC checks with every batch of samples processed.
• Ensure the instrument is calibrated and maintained according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the centrifuge, pipettes, and microplate reader.
3. Verify identification numbers on each sample and control.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Pre-treatment
◦ Centrifuge plasma samples at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
◦ Aliquot 0.5 mL of cleared plasma into new labeled tubes.
2. Reagent Preparation
◦ Prepare all reagents, standards, and controls according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Assay Setup
◦ Pipette the required volumes of standards, controls, and
plasma samples into the designated wells of the assay
plate.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol to add the appropriate
reagents to each well.
4. Incubation and Detection
◦ Incubate the plate for the prescribed time periods, ensuring
conditions specified by the protocol are met.
◦ Measure the absorbance at the required wavelength using
the microplate reader.
5. Data Analysis
◦ Export data from the microplate reader to the appropriate
software.
◦ Analyze the data, ensuring that control and standard values
meet prescribed acceptance criteria.
◦ If any QC results are out of range, investigate and resolve
before proceeding with patient sample results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Generate a report using the software linked to the microplate
reader.
• Verify the results by reviewing the QC data and ensuring all
criteria are met.
• Document and report the final results following established
laboratory procedures.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there are issues with control results, ensure all reagents were
prepared correctly.
• Verify that the microplate reader is functioning correctly and
recalibrate if necessary.
• Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for additional
support.
