Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Preeclampsia sFlt-1/PlGF (Soluble fms-like Tyrosine Kinase 1/
Placental Growth Factor) Ratio, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for the determination of
the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in serum samples for the diagnosis and
management of preeclampsia.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
and documenting the results.
• Supervisory staff will ensure the quality control of the process and
validation of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum acceptable volume is 1 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (such as EDTA,
heparin).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours of
collection. For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: Roche Elecsys, Thermo Fisher B·R·A·H·M·S, or
equivalent immunoassay analyzer.
• sFlt-1 and PlGF assay kits as per the specifications of the
selected analyzer.
• Calibrators, controls, and quality control materials specific to the
assay kits.
• Micropipettes and tips, vortex mixer, centrifuge, sample cups or
tubes.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and controls to room temperature before use.
2. Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring correct calibration and quality control are
in place.
4.2 Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 1000-1500 x g for 10 minutes to
ensure clarity.
2. Aliquot the required volume of serum into the sample cups or
tubes suitable for the analyzer.
4.3 Analytical Procedure:
1. sFlt-1 Measurement:
◦ Load the calibrators, controls, and patient samples onto the
analyzer.
◦ Follow the specific instructions for the sFlt-1 assay kit used
in the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the assay run and allow completion. Document
results as per protocol.
2. PlGF Measurement:
◦ Ensure a separate run for the PlGF assay if not combined in
a single assay.
◦ Load the calibrators, controls, and patient samples similarly.
◦ Follow the specified instructions for the PlGF assay kit used
in the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the assay run and document results similarly.
4.4 Quality Control:
• Run high, medium, and low controls at the beginning, middle, and
end of each batch.
• The results are valid only if the controls fall within the specified
range.
• Recalibrate the analyzer if controls are out of range, and re-run
samples if necessary.
5. CALCULATIONS AND REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio using the formula: [ \text{sFlt-1/
PlGF Ratio} = \frac{\text{sFlt-1 (pg/mL)}}{\text{PlGF (pg/mL)}} ]
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist or supervisor before final reporting.
3. Report any critical values or notable findings immediately to the
requesting clinician.
4. Document sFlt-1 and PlGF values as well as the calculated
ratio in the patient's record.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATIVE CRITERIA
• Normal pregnancy: sFlt-1/PlGF ratio typically below 38-85.
• Suspected preeclampsia: sFlt-1/PlGF ratio exceeding 85 may
indicate abnormal angiogenesis and potential preeclampsia.
• Refer to the specific kit insert or published guidelines for detailed
interpretative criteria.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences may arise from heterophilic antibodies or other
cross-reactants.
• Proper sample handling and prompt analysis are essential to
minimize pre-analytical and analytical variability.
