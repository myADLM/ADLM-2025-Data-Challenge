Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Pregabalin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This standard operating procedure (SOP) is designed to outline the
steps involved in the analytical phase of generating results for
pregabalin concentration in serum samples. The goal is to ensure
accurate, reliable, and timely results for clinical purposes and patient
care.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of serum samples for
pregabalin levels using a validated analytical method in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Staff: Responsible for performing the analysis,
ensuring the equipment and reagents are in working order, and
documenting all steps and observations.
• Supervisors: Responsible for oversight, troubleshooting,
validation, and ensuring compliance with the procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Pregabalin: An anticonvulsant drug used to treat neuropathic
pain and fibromyalgia.
• Serum: The liquid portion of blood obtained after removing the
clotting factors.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Pregabalin reference standard
• Internal standard (if necessary)
• Mobile phase reagents
• Serum calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples
• Sample vials and caps
• Centrifuge
• Water bath or incubator
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation of Reagents and Materials
1. Mobile Phase: Prepare the mobile phase according to the
validated method specifics (e.g., composition, pH, buffer
concentration).
2. Standards and QC Samples: Prepare calibration standards
and quality control (QC) samples at specified concentrations
using pregabalin reference standard. Ensure they are stored at
the correct temperature and documented.
6.2. Sample Preparation
1. Serum Sample Collection: Ensure that serum samples are
collected, labeled, and stored properly. Samples should be free
from hemolysis and preferably stored at -20°C until analysis.
2. Sample Thawing: Thaw the serum samples at room
temperature, then mix thoroughly.
3. Serum Preparation: Add an accurate volume of internal
standard solution to each sample (if required). Vortex to mix.
4. Protein Precipitation (if needed): Add an appropriate volume
of precipitating agent to the serum, vortex, and centrifuge at
10,000 x g for 10 minutes.
5. Supernatant Collection: Transfer the clear supernatant to a
new vial for injection into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
6.3. Preparation and Validation of Analytical Equipment
1. System Calibration: Turn on the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system
and allow it to equilibrate. Ensure the system calibration is
performed according to the instrument's operational manual.
2. Column Preparation: Install and condition the analytical
column according to the column manufacturer's instructions.
3. Internal Quality Control: Run initial QC samples to ensure the
system is functioning properly before analyzing patient
samples. Check for accuracy and precision.
6.4. Analytical Method
1. Injection Sequence: Create an injection sequence in the
method’s software that includes blanks, calibration standards,
QC samples, and patient serum samples.
2. Sample Injection: Inject an appropriate volume of processed
serum sample onto the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
3. Run Method: Initiate the analytical run, ensuring that the
instrument parameters conform to the validated method (e.g.,
flow rate, column temperature, detection wavelength).
6.5. Data Analysis and Review
1. Peak Identification: Identify the peak corresponding to
pregabalin in the chromatogram. Compare the retention time or
mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) with that of standard.
2. Quantification: Calculate the concentration of pregabalin in the
serum samples based on the calibration curve constructed from
known standards.
3. Quality Control Check: Confirm that QC samples are within
acceptable ranges. If QC samples fail, troubleshoot and rerun
as necessary.
6.6. Documentation and Reporting
1. Result Entry: Enter the pregabalin concentrations into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Review and Verification: A second technologist or supervisor
will review the results for accuracy and completeness.
3. Reporting: Results will be verified and reported to the
physician or clinical staff according to laboratory reporting
guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Frequency: QC samples must be included in every analytical
run.
2. Acceptance Criteria: QC results must fall within specified
control limits. If results are outside these limits, investigative
actions must be documented, and results must be reanalyzed.
