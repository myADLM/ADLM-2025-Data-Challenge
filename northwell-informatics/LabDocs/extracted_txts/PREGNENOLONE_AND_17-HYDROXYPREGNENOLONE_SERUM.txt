Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Pregnenolone and 17-Hydroxypregnenolone, Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Pregnenolone and 17-
Hydroxypregnenolone in serum. It ensures accurate and
reliable measurement of these hormones, necessary for clinical
diagnosis and treatment.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedures as outlined, ensuring adherence to the
protocol, proper documentation, and excellent quality control.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum
Collection Instructions: - Preferred specimen is serum collected in
a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST). - Allow serum to clot
for at least 30 minutes before centrifugation. - Centrifuge at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum from cells. - Transfer
the clear serum into a properly labelled aliquot tube. - Avoid
hemolysis and lipemia as it may interfere with the assay.
Specimen Stability: - Room Temperature (15-25°C): Up to 8 hours -
Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 48 hours - Frozen (-20°C or lower): Up to
3 months. Thaw samples completely and thoroughly mix before
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
- Specimens not properly labeled or missing essential patient
information.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ LC-MS/MS system (or Immulite 2000 analyzer)
◦ Calibration standards for Pregnenolone and 17-
Hydroxypregnenolone
▪ Quality control materials (low, medium, and high levels)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vials and caps for serum aliquots
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Data Management System (LIS)
2. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Quality Control: - Calibrate the instrument daily
with at least five standards covering the assay's dynamic range. -
Run quality controls (low, medium, and high) at the beginning of each
batch, after every 20 samples, and at the end of each batch. - Ensure
quality control results are within acceptable limits before proceeding
with the patient samples.
Sample Preparation: - Thaw frozen samples completely and mix
thoroughly. - Aliquot 500 µL of serum into each sample tube. - Include
blank, calibrators, and quality controls in the batch.
Extraction: - Add extraction reagent as per manufacturer's
instructions. - Vortex samples to ensure proper mixing. - Centrifuge at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes. - Carefully transfer the supernatant to
a new vial without disturbing the pellet.
Analytical Measurement: - Program the LC-MS/MS or Immulite
2000 analyzer according to the manufacturer’s operating manual. -
Ensure proper settings for Pregnenolone and 17-
Hydroxypregnenolone analysis. - Run blank, standards, and quality
controls first. - Proceed with patient samples after the quality control
results are verified.
Data Analysis: - Ensure the instrument’s software properly
integrates each analyte peak. - Review calibration curves and quality
control results. - Identify and quantify Pregnenolone and 17-
Hydroxypregnenolone concentrations in serum samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals: - Pregnenolone: Refer to the laboratory’s
established reference range. - 17-Hydroxypregnenolone: Refer to the
laboratory’s established reference range.
Documentation: - Document all results in the laboratory information
system (LIS). - Ensure the data reviewed do not contain anomalies. -
Flag any results outside the specified reference intervals for further
clinical evaluation.
Critical Values: - None specified; follow laboratory protocol if critical
values are determined for these analytes.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Internal Quality Control: - Verify integrity and accuracy of controls
before accepting any patient results. - Follow corrective actions for
any quality control failures as per laboratory protocol.
Method Limitations: - Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for
method limitations.
REFERENCES: - Manufacturer’s instructions for the LC-MS/MS or
Immulite 2000 analyzer. - Laboratory’s internal reference intervals
and validation records.
