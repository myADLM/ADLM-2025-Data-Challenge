Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Pregnenolone, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the steps required for the analytical phase
of generating results for Pregnenolone, serum in a clinical
laboratory setting. This procedure ensures accurate and timely
analysis and reporting of pregnenolone levels in patient serum
specimens.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained
in handling and analyzing serum specimens for pregnenolone
using the designated analytical instruments and methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
clinical laboratory technologists to perform the analysis of
pregnenolone in serum according to this SOP. Supervisors and
laboratory managers are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimens:
• Serum: Collect blood in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST). Allow blood to clot for at least 30 minutes at room
temperature, then centrifuge for 10 minutes at a speed of 1500 x
g.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
heparin).
• Specimens not properly labeled or received outside the
acceptable time frame must not be used.
Storage and Transport:
• After centrifugation, transfer the serum to a clean, labeled
polypropylene tube if not using SSTs.
• Store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or freeze at -20°C for longer
storage. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass
spectrometry (MS) system
• Calibration and quality control materials specific for pregnenolone
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes
• Polypropylene transfer tubes
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A) Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at the correct
temperature and properly mixed.
• Prepare the analyzer for operation by reviewing and confirming
that all maintenance and calibration procedures have been
performed.
B) Specimen Analysis:
1. Centrifuge the patient serum specimen if not already done.
2. Transfer 500 µL of the serum sample to a labeled tube for
analysis.
3. Load the serum samples, calibration standards, and quality
control samples into the HPLC or MS system.
4. Initiate the analytical run according to the manufacturer's
instructions and predefined method.
C) Instrumentation and Run:
• Follow the instrument-specific method for pregnenolone analysis.
Ensure that all calibrators and controls meet the established
criteria before running patient samples.
• Monitor the run to ensure proper system function and record any
deviations or errors.
D) Data Analysis:
• Upon completion of the run, use the software to generate the
concentration of pregnenolone in each patient sample.
• Review the calibration curve and QC results to ensure they fall
within acceptable ranges.
• Identify and address any result outliers according to laboratory
guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify patient results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Enter results manually if necessary and ensure all units and
reference intervals are accurate.
• Report any critical results immediately to the requesting physician
or healthcare provider following established critical value
communication protocols.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) at the beginning,
middle, and end of each analytical run.
• Acceptable ranges for QC samples must be established and
documented. Results outside these ranges require investigation
and possible recalibration or reanalysis of patient samples.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
analysis. Such specimens should be noted and appropriate
actions taken.
• Ensure all reagents and consumables are within their expiration
dates to guarantee accurate results.
1. REFERENCES
• Instrument and reagent package inserts and manufacturer
guidelines for pregnenolone analysis.
• Laboratory quality assurance and safety manuals.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of specimen receipt, analysis, QC results, and
patient results.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and communication
of critical results in the LIS and laboratory logs.
By following these guidelines, laboratory personnel can ensure
accurate and reliable generation of results for pregnenolone, serum
analyses, thereby supporting effective patient care and clinical
decision-making.
