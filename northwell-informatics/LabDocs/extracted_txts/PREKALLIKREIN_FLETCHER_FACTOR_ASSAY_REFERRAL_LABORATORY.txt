PREKALLIKREIN (FLETCHER FACTOR)
ASSAY REFERRAL LABORATORY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for processing, analyzing, and generating
results for Prekallikrein (Fletcher Factor) Assay in the referral
laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of
Prekallikrein (Fletcher Factor) Assay testing within the referral
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay as
per the outlined procedure and ensuring quality control standards are
maintained. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process
and addressing any identified deficiencies.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Citrate plasma (3.2% sodium citrate)
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL plasma
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 4 hours at room
temperature and 24 hours if refrigerated at 2-8°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Prekallikrein assay kit from a validated manufacturer
• Automated coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP 700)
• Citrate plasma
• Calibration materials
• Control plasma: normal and deficient controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Test tubes
• Refrigerator/freezer (as required by sample storage protocol)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration
1. Calibrate the coagulation analyzer using the manufacturer’s
instructions with the appropriate calibration materials.
2. Verify calibration by running control plasma.
B. Specimen Handling
1. Upon receiving the specimen, centrifuge plasma at 1500-2000
g for 10 minutes to ensure platelet-free plasma.
2. Aliquot the plasma into labeled test tubes and store
appropriately if not processing immediately.
C. Assay Preparation
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Allow reagents to equilibrate to room temperature for at least 30
minutes before use.
D. Running the Assay
1. Load specimens and controls into the automated coagulation
analyzer.
2. Enter the assay parameters into the analyzer software as per
manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Perform the assay and monitor the analyzer for any errors or
alerts.
E. Result Generation
1. Review the analyzer-generated results for each specimen.
2. Validate results by ensuring control results fall within acceptable
limits.
3. If control results are out of range, troubleshoot potential issues
and repeat the assay if necessary before reporting patient
results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run at least two levels of control plasma (normal and deficient)
daily.
2. Document control results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges.
3. If control results are outside acceptable limits, perform
troubleshooting steps and repeat the assay before reporting
patient results.
4. Perform regular maintenance on the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure
quality and accuracy.
3. Flag any critical values and notify the referring physician or
healthcare provider as per the laboratory’s critical result
notification policy.

implications.
10. DOCUMENTATION
1. Maintain records of calibration, control runs, and assay results.
2. Document any deviations from the procedure and corrective
actions taken.
3. Keep a log of equipment maintenance and service activities.
This protocol ensures the reliability and accuracy of Prekallikrein
(Fletcher Factor) Assay results, meeting the standards required for
the analytical phase in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
