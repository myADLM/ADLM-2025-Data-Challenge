Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Prenatal Aneuploidy
Detection via Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of common
prenatal aneuploidies using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) method on interphase nuclei derived from amniotic fluid,
chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or fetal blood.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
FISH analysis and accurately interpret the results. Supervisors must
ensure adherence to this SOP to maintain the quality and reliability of
the test results.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Aneuploidy: An abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell.
• FISH: A molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent
probes to bind to specific chromosome regions.
• Prenatal Specimen: Samples obtained from amniotic fluid, CVS,
or fetal blood.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Amniotic Fluid: 15-20 mL collected in a sterile container.
• Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS): 10-25 mg of collected tissue.
• Fetal Blood: 1-2 mL collected in a heparinized syringe.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled.
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported.
• Specimens with visible contamination or degradation.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets.
• Probe sets specific for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y.
• Fixation solutions: methanol, acetic acid.
• Hybridization buffer.
• Detergent washes, ethanol series for dehydration.
• Mounting medium with antifade and DAPI counterstain.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Amniotic Fluid:
◦ Centrifuge fluid at 400 g for 10 minutes.
◦ Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in a small volume
of fixative (solution of methanol:acetic acid, 3:1).
◦ Drop cells onto clean microscopic slides and air-dry.
2. Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS):
◦ Rinse tissue in sterile saline.
◦ Mince tissue into small fragments and dissociate cells.
◦ Centrifuge cell suspension and resuspend in fixative.
◦ Drop cell suspension onto slides and air-dry.
3. Fetal Blood:
◦ Mix blood sample with fixative.
◦ Drop fixed cells onto slides and air-dry.
B. Probe Hybridization:
1. Pre-treat slides with pepsin and then dehydrate through ethanol
series (70%, 85%, 100%) and air dry.
2. Apply probe mixture to the targeted area on the slide.
3. Denature both probe and target DNA by heating the slide on a
hot plate at 75°C for 5 minutes.
4. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber overnight at 37°C.
C. Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Immerse slides in 2X SSC (saline-sodium citrate) buffer at 72°C
for 2 minutes.
2. Rinse in 0.1X SSC at room temperature.
3. Dehydrate through ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) and air
dry.
D. Visualization:
1. Apply mounting medium with DAPI counterstain to the
hybridized area on the slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and seal edges with nail polish or
adhesive.
E. Microscopy and Analysis:
1. Using a fluorescence microscope, examine at least 100
interphase nuclei to detect FISH signals corresponding to
chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y.
2. Count and record the number of fluorescent signals for each
targeted chromosome and interpret the results based on the
number of signals.
◦ Normal disomy: 2 signals/nucleus for autosomes and 2
signals for sex chromosomes (XX or XY).
◦ Abnormal findings (trisomy or monosomy): 3 signals for
trisomy or 1 signal for monosomy.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use both positive and negative controls to validate the
hybridization process.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing to ensure consistent
performance.
• Validate new lot numbers of probes and reagents with known
normal and abnormal controls.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the number and type of aneuploid cells detected.
2. Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
3. For critical results, contact the referring physician immediately.
4. Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for appropriate
documentation and communication of results.
