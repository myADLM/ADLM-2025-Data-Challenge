Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): PRENATAL HEPATITIS
EVALUATION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for analyzing serum samples for
Prenatal Hepatitis Evaluation, ensuring accurate and timely results to
support prenatal care and management.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring adherence to this SOP, reporting results, and
documenting any corrective actions taken. The laboratory supervisor
is responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring compliance.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection:
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a red top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Ensure the tube is properly labelled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate).
• Specimens with missing or incorrect collection date/time.
• Specimens exhibiting signs of contamination, hemolysis, or
clotting.
Specimen Stability:
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA or chemiluminescent immunoassay kit for Hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs),
Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and Hepatitis C antibody
(anti-HCV).
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Calibrated incubator
• Wash buffer and rinse solutions
• Plate reader or analyzer compatible with the assay kit
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge SST tubes at 1500–2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum from clot.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the
assay reagents (e.g., diluents, wash buffers, substrate
solutions).
Assay Procedure:
1. Initial Setup:
◦ Ensure the ELISA plate or analyzer is clean and calibrated.
◦ Set up the assay according to the kit instructions. Ensure all
controls and standards are included.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add appropriate volumes of standards, control, and patient
serum samples to the wells.
◦ Follow the kit instructions for incubation times and
temperatures.
3. Washing and Signal Detection:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly as per the kit instructions to
remove unbound materials.
◦ Add the detection reagent (enzyme conjugate) and incubate
as specified.
◦ Add the substrate solution, incubate, and read the results at
the appropriate wavelength/time per kit instructions.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure assay validity.
• Document any deviations from the expected control values,
troubleshoot, and repeat the assay as necessary.
• Record reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the assay results to confirm control values are within
acceptable ranges.
• Report patient results according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
ensure they are verified by a technologist before releasing to the
ordering clinician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Negative
• Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs): Positive indicates
immunity
• Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc): Negative
• Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV): Negative
8. LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations.
• Potential cross-reactivity should be considered when interpreting
results.
• Ensure sample integrity is verified before testing.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow universal precautions when handling specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves and lab coats.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to institutional
protocols.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If assay controls do not perform as expected, review each step of
the procedure for errors.
• Check reagent preparation, incubation times, and instrument
calibration.
• Repeat the assay using fresh reagents if necessary.

Documentation of Changes:
• Any amendments to this SOP must be documented and approved
by the Laboratory Supervisor.
