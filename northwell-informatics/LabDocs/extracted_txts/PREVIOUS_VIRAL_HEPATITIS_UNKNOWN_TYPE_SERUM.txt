Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for Previous Viral Hepatitis (Unknown Type), Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for generating laboratory results for previous
viral hepatitis (unknown type) using serum specimens. The aim is to
ensure accurate and consistent results, facilitating proper patient
diagnosis and care.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all qualified personnel responsible for
processing and analyzing serum specimens for previous viral
hepatitis (unknown type) in the laboratory.
3. Responsibility
Laboratory personnel, including Laboratory Technologists and
Supervisors, are responsible for adhering to this protocol. All results
must be reviewed and verified by qualified personnel prior to
reporting.
4. Definitions
• Serum: The clear liquid part of the blood that remains after blood
cells and clotting proteins have been removed.
• Hepatitis Markers: Laboratory tests used to identify and
differentiate the types of viral hepatitis infection including Hepatitis
A, B, C, D, and E.
5. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Amount Required: Minimum 3 mL of serum.
• Collection Container: Use serum separator tubes (SST).
• Stability: Specimens should be processed and tested within 48
hours of collection. If testing is delayed, specimens should be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For long-term storage,
specimens may be frozen at -20°C or colder.
6. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Analyzer: Appropriate immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott
Architect, Roche Cobas).
• Reagents: Hepatitis marker test kits validated for previous
infection detection including but not limited to:
◦ Hepatitis A Total Antibodies
◦ Hepatitis B Core Antibodies (Anti-HBc)
◦ Hepatitis B Surface Antibodies (Anti-HBs)
◦ Hepatitis C Antibodies (Anti-HCV)
• Quality Control Material: Manufacturer-supplied positive and
negative controls.
• Other Supplies: Centrifuge, pipettes, timer, personal protective
equipment.
7. Procedure
A. Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Reception and Accessioning:
◦ Verify the correct identification of the patient and proper
labeling of the sample.
◦ Ensure the specimen meets the acceptance criteria with no
signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
2. Specimen Processing:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 3500 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled secondary
containers if necessary.
B. Analytical Phase
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform daily calibration and instrument maintenance
procedures as per the equipment manual.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Load serum samples, controls, and reagents onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Enter the required test panels for previous viral hepatitis
detection.
◦ Start the analysis following the specific instructions for the
analyzer and test kits used.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with every batch of
samples.
◦ Validate the quality control results before any patient results
are released.
◦ Document all quality control data in the appropriate logs.
C. Post-Analytical Phase
1. Verification of Results:
◦ Review and interpret the assay results based on predefined
criteria.
◦ Confirm repeatability and accuracy by comparing with
historical results if available.
2. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Validate results and ensure proper documentation of any
interventions or discrepancies.
◦ Communicate critical and abnormal results to the
appropriate clinical personnel following established
protocols.
3. Storage and Retention of Samples:
◦ Store remaining serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 7 days
post-analysis.
◦ Store long-term retention samples at -20°C for potential
retesting or verification purposes following the laboratory’s
retention policy.
4. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
◦ Repeat the assay if quality control results do not fall within
acceptable ranges.
◦ Investigate and document any deviations from standard
operating procedures.
◦ Report and resolve instrument or reagent issues with the
supervisor’s assistance.
8. Results Interpretation and Reporting
• Negative Results: No previous infection markers detected.
Report as “No evidence of past viral hepatitis infection.”
• Positive Results: Presence of hepatitis markers specific to one
or more types of viral hepatitis. Report with detailed findings
indicating the type and titers of antibodies detected.
9. Safety and Compliance
• Follow all biosafety protocols and standard precautions while
handling human specimens.
• Ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory guidelines,
including CLIA, CAP, and local regulations.
10. References
• Manufacturer's instructions and user manuals for immunoassay
analyzers and test kits.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory procedures.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards for viral hepatitis
testing.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
reliable and accurate generation of results for previous viral hepatitis
(unknown type) in serum specimens, thereby supporting appropriate
clinical decision-making.
