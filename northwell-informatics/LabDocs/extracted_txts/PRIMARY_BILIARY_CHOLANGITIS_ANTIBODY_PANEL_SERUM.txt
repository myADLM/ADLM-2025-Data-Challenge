STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Primary Biliary Cholangitis Antibody
Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE To ensure standardized and accurate testing for the
detection of antibodies associated with Primary Biliary
Cholangitis (PBC) in serum samples, including
antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), anti-gp210, and anti-sp100.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis of the PBC antibody panel
according to this procedure.
2. DEFINITION The Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) antibody panel
includes the following tests:
• Antimitochondrial Antibodies (AMA)
• Anti-GP210 antibodies
• Anti-SP100 antibodies
3. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents, calibrators, controls, and samples are
at room temperature prior to testing.
2. Verify that the testing area is clean and that all necessary
equipment is functioning properly.
3. Check the expiration dates and integrity of all reagents,
controls, and calibrators to be used.
Sample Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Sample Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL
• Storage and Stability: Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours. If testing is delayed beyond 48 hours, samples
should be stored at -20°C or lower.
Equipment and Supplies:
• ELISA reader with wavelength settings appropriate for the
substrate chromogen
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microtiter plates specific for the PBC antibody panel
• Calibrators, controls, and reagent kits for AMA, anti-GP210, and
anti-SP100
• Plate washer (automatic or manual)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Timer
Testing Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation: Follow manufacturer instructions for
reconstitution of reagents, if required.
2. Controls and Calibrators Preparation:
◦ Prepare controls and calibrators as specified in the reagent
kit insert.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge serum samples if they contain particulates,
ensuring that the supernatant is clear.
4. Plate Preparation:
◦ Label the microtiter plate with patient IDs, controls, and
calibrators.
5. Addition of Samples and Controls:
◦ Add 100 µL of each sample, control, and calibrator to the
designated wells on the microtiter plate.
6. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time indicated in
the kit insert (e.g., 30 minutes).
7. Washing:
◦ Wash each well with the washing buffer according to the
manufacturer instructions (e.g., 3-5 cycles).
8. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the conjugate solution to each well.
9. Second Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (e.g., 30
minutes).
10. Wash Steps:
◦ Wash each well thoroughly as described previously.
11. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
12. Final Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for the
specified time (e.g., 15 minutes).
13. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
14. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength using the ELISA reader (e.g., 450 nm).
Quality Control:
• Ensure that all control values fall within established ranges. If any
control value is out of range, do not report patient results and
troubleshoot the assay.
• Run controls with each batch of patient samples to monitor assay
performance.
Reporting Results:
1. Analyze the results using the ELISA reader software.
2. Compare the absorbance values of samples to those of the
controls and calibrators.
3. Generate a standard curve and determine the sample
concentrations based on the curve.
4. Interpret the results as per the cut-offs provided in the reagent
kit insert (e.g., positive, negative, or indeterminate).
5. Verify and document the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
