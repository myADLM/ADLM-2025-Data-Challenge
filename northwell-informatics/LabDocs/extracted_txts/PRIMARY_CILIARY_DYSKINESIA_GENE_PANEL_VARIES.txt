Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for PRIMARY
CILIARY DYSKINESIA GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical process and
ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results for the PRIMARY
CILIARY DYSKINESIA GENE PANEL, VARIES. This procedure
includes guidelines for DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing, data analysis, and result interpretation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologists and
geneticists to perform the DNA extraction, library preparation, next-
generation sequencing (NGS), data analysis, and reporting of results
in accordance with this SOP.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD): A genetic disorder
characterized by defects in the action of cilia, leading to
respiratory and reproductive system issues.
• NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): A high-throughput method
used to sequence DNA and RNA for comprehensive genetic
analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kits
• Library preparation kits
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher)
• PCR thermal cycler
• Quantification and quality control devices (e.g., Qubit,
Bioanalyzer)
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis
• Reference databases for genetic variation (e.g., ClinVar, gnomAD)
5. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/Acceptable: Whole blood (EDTA), saliva, or buccal
swabs.
• Unacceptable: Specimens stored at non-optimal conditions, or
those with insufficient DNA quantity/quality.
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from the specimen using a suitable DNA
extraction kit.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a Qubit or similar fluorometric
device.
3. Check the quality and integrity of the DNA using gel
electrophoresis or a Bioanalyzer.
4. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C or lower until ready for library
preparation.
B) Library Preparation
1. Prepare the DNA library using a library preparation kit specific
for NGS.
2. Quantify and quality control the prepared library using the Qubit
and Bioanalyzer.
3. Normalize the library concentration according to the sequencing
platform requirements.
C) Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run the sequencing protocol and monitor the run progress,
ensuring that quality metrics are met.
D) Data Analysis
1. Use bioinformatics software to analyze the raw sequencing
data.
2. Perform alignment to the human reference genome (hg19 or
hg38).
3. Call variants using established pipelines and quality filters.
4. Annotate the variants using reference databases for clinical
relevance.
E) Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the annotated variants and interpret the significance in
the context of PCD.
2. Corroborate findings with clinical data where available.
3. Generate a comprehensive report with details on the detected
variants, their clinical relevance, and any recommendations for
further action.
4. Validate the results by a second qualified scientist if any novel
or rare variants are identified.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use internal and external quality controls at each step of the
process.
• Perform periodic calibration and maintenance of equipment.
• Monitor pass/fail criteria for quality metrics during sequencing.
• Participate in external proficiency testing to ensure compliance
with CLIA and other regulatory standards.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist and a
geneticist before releasing. The report should include patient-
identifiable information, details of the methodology, detected variants
and their significance, and any recommendations for follow-up
actions.
