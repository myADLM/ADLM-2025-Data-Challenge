Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Gene Panel,
Various
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedure for generating results
for the Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Gene
Panel. The aim is to identify potential genetic mutations associated
with primary HLH to aid in the diagnosis and treatment planning for
patients.
Responsibility:
This procedure is to be performed by qualified laboratory technicians/
molecular genetic technologists certified in molecular diagnostics. It
is the responsibility of the laboratory director or designated
supervisor to ensure all steps are followed as outlined to maintain the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE AND APPLICATION
This SOP applies to all molecular diagnostic testing facilities involved
in HLH genetic testing. This includes any laboratory certified under
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).
3. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Gene-specific and reference primers
• PCR Master Mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Thermal Cycler
• Agarose Gel Electrophoresis System
• Gel Imaging System
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) machine or Sanger
Sequencer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Bioinformatics Software for Sequence Analysis
4. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
• DNA extracted from peripheral blood or bone marrow samples.
• Minimum DNA concentration requirement: 20 ng/uL.
• DNA purity: A260/A280 ratio between 1.8-2.0.
5. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from the provided patient samples using a
validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer. Record the concentration and purity.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR reaction mixtures according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Include both gene-specific primers and reference
control primers.
2. Amplify the selected gene segments associated with HLH (e.g.,
PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, STXBP2).
3. Set up the PCR reactions on a thermal cycler adhering to the
specified cycling conditions for the primers used.
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Load the PCR amplification products on an agarose gel (1-2%)
containing a suitable DNA stain.
2. Perform electrophoresis at an appropriate voltage to resolve the
DNA fragments.
3. Visualize the gel under a UV transilluminator and document the
results.
D) Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) or Sanger Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. For NGS:
◦ Prepare the library as per the NGS platform's library
preparation protocol.
◦ Quantify and normalize libraries.
◦ Load libraries onto the NGS machine and initiate
sequencing run.
3. For Sanger Sequencing:
◦ Mix purified PCR products with sequencing primers and
sequencing reagents.
◦ Load onto the Sanger Sequencer and perform sequencing.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Use bioinformatics software to analyze sequencing data.
2. Align the sequence reads to the reference genome.
3. Identify and annotate variants using validated variant caller
software.
4. Interpret results in the context of known pathogenic mutations,
variants of uncertain significance, and benign polymorphisms
based on current literature and databases.
F) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples throughout the PCR and sequencing processes to
validate the run.
2. Check internal quality metrics provided by sequencing
platforms (e.g., read depth, quality scores).
3. Conduct regular proficiency testing and comparisons with
quality control specimens to ensure continued accuracy of
methods.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Verify that all controls behaved as expected.
2. Verify and interpret the sequencing data for the patient.
3. Report all findings to the attending physician or requesting
clinician with detailed interpretation. Include specifications of
detected mutations, any known clinical significance, or
recommendations for further diagnostics if needed.
4. If no mutations are found, report that no actionable mutations
were detected.
7. REFERENCES
1. Current literature on genetic mutations associated with primary
HLH.
2. Manufacturer instructions for all reagents, kits, and machines
used.
3. Database resources for sequence alignment and mutation
interpretation (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. PCR Failure: Validate primer sequences, check template
quality, optimize PCR conditions.
2. Sequencing Errors: Ensure library quality, validate sample prep,
ensure proper calibration of sequencing machine.
9. END OF PROCEDURE
Ensure all data is stored securely in accordance with HIPAA and
other relevant privacy laws. Document all procedural steps and any
deviations encountered during the testing process.
10. DOCUMENT CONTROL
This SOP is subject to revision and must be reviewed annually or
when new guidelines and technologies are introduced. Keep a
historical log of revisions for reference.
By following these outlined steps, laboratory personnel can ensure
consistent and reliable generation of results for the Primary
Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Gene Panel, aiding in the
accurate diagnosis and management of affected patients.
