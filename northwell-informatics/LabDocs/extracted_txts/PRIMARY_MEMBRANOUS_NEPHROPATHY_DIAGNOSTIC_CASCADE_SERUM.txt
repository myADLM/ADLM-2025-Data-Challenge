Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Primary
Membranous Nephropathy Diagnostic Cascade, Serum
1. Purpose
To establish a standardized procedure for processing,
analyzing, and reporting serum samples for the detection of
primary membranous nephropathy (PMN).
2. Specimen Requirements
Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 4 mL serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Acceptable tension to receive the sample within 24 hours of
collection if stored at 2-8°C or within 7 days if stored frozen
at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours
after collection if not refrigerated.
◦ Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 7 days after
collection if frozen.
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens without proper labeling, including date and time
of collection.
3. Materials, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ ELISA kit for anti-PLA2R (phospholipase A2 receptor)
antibodies.
◦ ELISA kit for anti-THSD7A (thrombospondin type-1 domain-
containing 7A) antibodies.
◦ Calibrators, controls, and samples.
◦ Micropipettes and pipette tips.
◦ Wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution.
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450
nm with a correction at 620-650 nm.
4. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the blood specimen at 1,500xg for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
2. Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled tubes for
storage or immediate analysis.
3. If not analyzed immediately, store the aliquots at 2-8°C
(for up to 24 hours) or at -20°C (for up to 7 days).
Testing Procedure:
Anti-PLA2R Antibody Detection:
1. Remove ELISA plate from packaging and let it reach room
temperature (~20-25°C).
2. Add 100 µL of calibrator, controls, and patient serum
sample into the designated wells in duplicate.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plate using automated or manual means with
the provided wash buffer (typically 4-5 washes).
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme-linked secondary antibody into
each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate again as per step 4.
8. Add 100 µL of provided substrate solution into each well,
avoid exposure to light.
9. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes until the color change is noticeable.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. Gently tap the
plate to ensure a uniform distribution.
11. Read the plate at 450 nm with reference wavelength set
between 620-650 nm using a microplate reader.
Anti-THSD7A Antibody Detection:
Follow identical steps (1-11) as outlined for Anti-PLA2R
Antibody Detection for the detection of anti-THSD7A.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality controls with each run comprising negative
controls, low positive controls, and high positive controls.
◦ Document all quality control results. Acceptable ranges for
controls must be defined and referenced with
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ If controls are out of the specified range, do not report
patient results until the issue has been resolved. Repeat the
assay or take corrective measures as necessary.
6. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
calibrator, control, and sample.
◦ Utilize a standard curve generated from the calibrators to
determine the concentration of antibodies in patient
samples.
◦ Reference values:
▪ Anti-PLA2R: <20 RU/mL (negative), ≥ 20 RU/mL
(positive).
▪ Anti-THSD7A: <20 RU/mL (negative), ≥ 20 RU/mL
(positive).
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Analyze data and interpret results per the established
reference ranges.
◦ Report results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Flag and review any critical values following laboratory
protocol for critical results.
8. Additional Notes:
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Periodically review and validate assays to ensure accuracy
and precision.
◦ Perform internal and external proficiency testing as
recommended.
9. Method Limitations:
◦ Samples with biotin above 10 ng/mL may interfere or cause
false results.
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus need investigation as they
may affect results.
10. References:
◦ Manufacturer's kit insert and instructional manual.
◦ Internal laboratory SOPs for ELISA assays.
◦ Current clinical guidelines on the interpretation of anti-
PLA2R and anti-THSD7A antibody results.
