Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Primidone and Phenobarbital, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide consistent and accurate
methodologies for the analysis and reporting of Primidone and
Phenobarbital levels in serum according to the best practice
guidelines and CLIA standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of Primidone and Phenobarbital serum levels.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis to ensure they follow the procedures outlined and ensure
quality and accuracy of testing and reporting. Laboratory supervisors
are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP and any
corrective actions as necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Container: Red top tube without gel separator or serum
separator tube (SST)
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C after collection and can be frozen at
-20°C for longer storage. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing EDTA, sodium citrate, or
heparin
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient information and
collection date/time
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass
spectrometry (MS) analyzer
• Appropriate analytical columns specified for Primidone and
Phenobarbital
• Primidone and Phenobarbital standards and controls
• Mobile phase reagents (solvent A, solvent B)
• Calibration set - to include both Primidone and Phenobarbital
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibrate the instrument daily using certified calibration standards
prior to sample analysis.
• Run a minimum of two levels of quality control samples (one in
therapeutic range, one out of range) at the beginning, middle, and
end of each analytical run.
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to come to room temperature.
2. Vortex each sample to mix thoroughly.
3. Centrifuge serum samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
4. Pipette a specified aliquot (e.g., 200 µL) of the serum sample
into a clean tube for analysis.
HPLC/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or MS as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load calibration standards, quality controls, and serum samples
onto the analytical tray.
3. Initiate the run sequence on the instrument software.
4. Ensure that each run includes blanks, calibration standards,
and quality controls at prescribed intervals.
5. Monitor the instrument for any error messages or abnormalities
during the run.
Data Analysis:
1. Review chromatograms and/or mass spectral data generated
by the instrument.
2. Identify peaks corresponding to Primidone and Phenobarbital
and integrate their areas.
3. Compare sample peak areas to the calibration curve to quantify
Primidone and Phenobarbital concentrations in serum.
4. Ensure that all quality control samples are within acceptable
limits before proceeding with patient sample reporting.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
2. Report Primidone and Phenobarbital serum levels with
appropriate units (e.g., µg/mL).
3. Any results outside the therapeutic range should be flagged
and reviewed.
4. Ensure critical values are reported immediately to the
requesting physician.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with assay accuracy.
• Cross-reactivity with other compounds may result in inaccurate
results.
• Dilution or concentration of the sample due to improper collection
or handling can affect the integrity of the results.
