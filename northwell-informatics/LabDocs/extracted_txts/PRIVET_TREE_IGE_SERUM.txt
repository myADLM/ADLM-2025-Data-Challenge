SOP: Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Privet Tree, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of Privet
Tree, IgE levels in serum samples, ensuring accurate,
reproducible, and reliable results for clinical assessments.
2. Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen:
◦ 5 mL of serum obtained from a properly clotted blood
sample, collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain
red-top tube.
Acceptable Specimen:
◦ 5 mL of plasma collected in an EDTA tube, provided it is
noted on the requisition.
3. Unacceptable Specimen Criteria
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes such as heparin
or citrate tubes.
◦ Clotted or particulate matter presence in plasma specimens.
◦ Specimens that have been stored beyond stability limits:
▪ Serum/plasma stored at 2-8°C should be analyzed within
7 days.
▪ Serum/plasma stored frozen at -20°C or lower can be
stable for up to 30 days.
4. Reagents and Supplies
◦ Calibrators: Specific IgE calibrator, traceable to international
standards.
◦ Controls: Two levels of quality control material, including one
negative and one positive control.
◦ Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) kits specific for Privet Tree, IgE
measurement.
◦ Micropipettes and tips, calibrated and dedicated to IgE
assays.
◦ ELISA reader with appropriate filters for detecting IgE-
specific absorbance.
5. Procedure
5.1 Pre-Assay Setup:
◦ Inspect specimens and ensure they meet the acceptable
criteria.
◦ Thaw frozen serum/plasma specimens at room temperature
and mix well before analysis.
◦ Bring all reagents, controls, and calibrators to room
temperature before starting the assay.
5.2 Assay Procedure:
◦ Prepare the EIA plate or strips specific for Privet Tree, IgE
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Add calibrator, controls, and patient samples to the
respective wells.
◦ Follow EIA kit instructions, which generally involve: • Adding
specific reagents for incubation phases. • Washing steps
between reagent additions to remove unbound proteins. •
Adding enzyme conjugates, substrate solution, and stopping
solution.
◦ Incubate at specified times and temperatures as outlined in
the kit insert at each step.
5.3 ELISA Reading and Analysis:
◦ Read the EIA plate at the specific wavelength mentioned in
the kit insert using the ELISA reader.
◦ Compare the optical densities (OD) of samples to the
calibrator curve to determine IgE concentrations in serum
samples.
5.4 Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
specimens.
◦ Acceptable limits for controls must be met before reporting
patient results.
◦ If control values are outside the predefined acceptable
range, do not report patient results until the issue is
resolved.
6. Calculation and Result Interpretation
Calculate the concentration of Privet Tree, IgE in serum by
plotting the OD values against the calibrator curve using the
analytical software or manually.
◦ Valid reportable range for IgE should be adhered to as
specified in the EIA kit insert.
◦ Reference intervals:
▪ Normal: < 0.35 kU/L
▪ Elevated: ≥ 0.35 kU/L (clinical significance to be
determined based on patient history and clinical
correlation)
7. Reporting Results
After verifying QC results are within the acceptable range, enter
patient results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and final approval by the technologist.
8. Quality Assurance
◦ Routinely participate in external proficiency testing programs
for IgE assays.
◦ Regularly maintain and calibrate pipettes and equipment
used in the analysis.
◦ Document all maintenance, calibrations, and repairs.

maintenance protocols.
The protocol above is created keeping in consideration essential
aspects of laboratory analysis for serum IgE levels for Privet Tree
allergen. Further details or site-specific customizations can be
incorporated as required by the specific laboratory settings.
