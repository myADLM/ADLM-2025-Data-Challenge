PRKAR1A FULL GENE SEQUENCING WITH DELETION/
DUPLICATION
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the protocol for conducting PRKAR1A full gene
sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis. This procedure
ensures that accurate and reproducible results are obtained for
diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All designated laboratory personnel who have
been trained on this procedure are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that the staff strictly adheres to this SOP and
that any deviations or issues are promptly addressed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen type: EDTA whole blood or extracted DNA
• Minimum volume: 3-5 mL of whole blood (for DNA extraction) or
minimum 20 µL of extracted DNA (concentration ≥ 50 ng/µL)
• Storage conditions: Whole blood should be stored at 2-8°C and
processed within 3 days of collection. Extracted DNA should be
stored at -20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit (Supplier: [Name])
• Gene sequencing kit (Supplier: [Name])
• Deletion/duplication analysis kit (Supplier: [Name])
• Microcentrifuge tubes (0.2 mL and 1.5 mL)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Sequencing software (e.g., BCL Convert, MiSeq Reporter)
• Reference DNA sample for QC

5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Receive and verify specimen integrity.
2. Extract DNA using the designated DNA extraction kit following
the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometric analysis (e.g., NanoDrop) and agarose gel
electrophoresis.
4. Store DNA at -20°C until ready for sequencing.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Design primers covering the entire PRKAR1A gene, including
all exons and intron-exon boundaries.
2. Prepare PCR reaction mix according to the conditions specified
in the gene sequencing kit.
3. Amplify target regions using the PCR Thermocycler under the
conditions optimized for PRKAR1A.
4. Assess PCR product quality and quantity using agarose gel
electrophoresis.
C. Sequencing
1. Purify PCR products using a purification kit to remove primers
and nucleotides.
2. Prepare sequencing reactions according to the specifications in
the sequencing kit.
3. Load purified PCR products into a sequencer (e.g., MiSeq or
Illumina platform) and initiate sequencing.
4. Monitor sequencing run and QC metrics periodically to ensure
run success.
D. Analysis of Sequencing Data
1. Use the designated sequencing software to analyze raw
sequencing data.
2. Align the sequence reads to the reference PRKAR1A gene and
identify variants.
3. Perform deletion/duplication analysis using software designed
for CNV analysis.
4. Validate identified variants using secondary analysis tools if
required.
5. Classify the variants according to ACMG guidelines.
E. Quality Control
1. Include a reference DNA sample in each sequencing run for
internal QC.
2. Perform bi-weekly inter-laboratory comparisons to ensure
consistent and accurate results.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken in the
laboratory log.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Interpret the analyzed data by correlating identified mutations
with clinical significance.
2. Generate a detailed report including mutation nomenclature,
zygosity, and predicted impact.
3. Review results with a qualified geneticist before final release.
4. Transmit final verified results to the LIS (Laboratory Information
System) and ensure proper documentation.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Possibility of missing deep intronic mutations that may affect gene
function.
• PCR and sequencing artifacts may occasionally result in false
positives.
• Variants in homonucleotide regions may pose challenges for
accurate calling.

9. DOCUMENTATION Complete recording of all steps including
specimen receipt, DNA extraction, PCR setup, sequencing, data
analysis, and QC results in the tracking log. Ensure traceability and
compliance with regulatory standards.
By adhering strictly to this SOP, we aim to generate reliable and
