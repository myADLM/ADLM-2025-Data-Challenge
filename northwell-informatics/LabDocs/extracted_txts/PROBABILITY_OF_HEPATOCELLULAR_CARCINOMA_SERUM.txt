STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
TITLE: Analysis of Probability of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),
Serum
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed, standardized
procedure for the analytical phase of determining the probability of
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) utilizing serum samples. This
protocol ensures accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all serum samples received in the
laboratory for the analysis of the probability of HCC using appropriate
laboratory methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the authorized personnel in the laboratory to
perform this analysis as described in this SOP. Staff must ensure that
all equipment and reagents used are within their expiration dates and
correctly calibrated.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Calibration Materials
• Control Materials
• Hepatocellular Carcinoma Probability Assay Kits (e.g., AFP-L3,
DCP, etc.)
• Serum Sample Tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Appropriate consumables (pipettes, tips, gloves)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) access for result reporting
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the assay kits
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL
• Specimen Collection and Handling:
◦ Blood should be collected by venipuncture in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the sample to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge to
separate the serum.
◦ The serum should be transferred to a clean, labelled container
if not using an SST.
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 72
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Receive Sample:
◦ Verify the sample and its accompanying documentation.
◦ Check for appropriate sample volume and integrity (e.g.,
free from hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia).
◦ Accession the sample into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Retrieve the assay kit and bring all reagents and materials
to room temperature.
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and controls as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Calibrate the instrument using the calibration standards
provided.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples before commencing patient
sample analysis to ensure the assay is performing within the
acceptable range.
◦ Document all QC results. Do not proceed if QC does not
meet criteria.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared serum samples into the automated
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure proper labeling and tracking of samples.
◦ Select the appropriate assay protocol for HCC probability
determination.
◦ Start the analysis, and the instrument will run the assay,
measure the relevant biomarkers, and calculate the
probability.
4. Monitoring:
◦ Monitor the assay progress and analyzer for any errors or
alarms.
◦ Ensure that all steps are performed as per the
manufacturer’s protocol to avoid any potential errors.
C. Post-analytical Phase:
1. Review Results:
◦ Once the assay is complete, review the results from the
analyzer.
◦ Validate the results by comparing the output with control and
calibration standards.
2. Data Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the probability scores as per the clinical guidelines
provided by the assay manufacturer.
◦ Ensure that the results fall within the expected reference
range.
3. Reporting:
◦ Enter the validated results into the LIS.
◦ Ensure results are reported promptly and findings
communicated to the requesting clinician if critical values
are observed.
◦ Maintain confidentiality and adhere to patient data protection
policies.
4. Documentation:
◦ Record all assay conditions, standard curves, control
results, and any observed deviations in the laboratory log.
◦ Retain these records according to laboratory policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Internal quality control samples must be run with every assay
batch.
• External proficiency testing should be performed as per regulatory
requirements.
• Routine maintenance and calibration of equipment should be
performed as per manufacturer’s instructions and recorded
accordingly.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Quality Control Failure:
◦ Recalibrate the analyzer and prepare fresh control samples.
◦ Review all steps to ensure proper procedure compliance.
◦ Contact technical support if issues persist.
• Instrument Errors:
◦ Refer to the instrument manual for troubleshooting
instructions.
◦ Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
