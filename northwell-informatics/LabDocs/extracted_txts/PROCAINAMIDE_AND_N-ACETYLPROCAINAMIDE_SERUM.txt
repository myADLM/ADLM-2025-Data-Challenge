Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis and
Reporting of Procainamide and N-Acetylprocainamide (NAPA) in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis and reporting of
Procainamide and its metabolite N-Acetylprocainamide (NAPA) levels
in serum samples to ensure accurate and reliable results. This SOP
covers the preparation, analysis, and reporting of serum samples
using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the
implementation of this procedure, including sample preparation,
analysis, quality control, and reporting. It is the responsibility of all
staff to adhere to this SOP to ensure the accuracy and integrity of
results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all serum samples received for the analysis of
Procainamide and NAPA levels in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
• Procainamide: An antiarrhythmic medication used to treat certain
types of tachycardia.
• NAPA: N-Acetylprocainamide, the active metabolite of
Procainamide.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
4.1. Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
4.2. Collection:
• Collect the blood specimen using standardized phlebotomy
techniques.
4.3. Handling:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature and centrifuge within
1 hour of collection.
• Separate the serum from the cells and transfer to a labeled
polypropylene tube for analysis.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be done within 48 hours, or
freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
4.4. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC system equipped with a UV detector
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage
• Procainamide and NAPA reference standards
• HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol)
• Mobile phase components (e.g., phosphate buffer)
• 10 µL Hamilton syringes
• Auto-sampler vials with caps
• Water bath
• HPLC column (suitable for Procainamide and NAPA separation)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen samples completely at room temperature.
• Mix samples gently by inversion.
• Pipette 500 µL of serum into a clean auto-sampler vial.
• Add 500 µL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
• Vortex the vial for 1 minute.
• Centrifuge the vial at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Transfer the supernatant to a new auto-sampler vial for HPLC
analysis.
6.2. Instrument Setup:
• Prepare the mobile phase according to the defined method.
• Prime the HPLC system with the mobile phase.
• Prepare the HPLC column according to manufacturer instructions.
• Set the detection wavelength for UV detection based on the
optimal absorbance for Procainamide and NAPA.
6.3. Calibration Standards:
• Prepare calibration standards of Procainamide and NAPA in
human serum at concentrations ranging from the lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) to the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ).
• Run calibration standards before analyzing patient samples and
plot calibration curves.
6.4. Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of quality control (QC) samples (low
and high) in each run.
• Run blanks between samples to check for carryover.
6.5. Sample Analysis:
• Inject an aliquot of the prepared sample (usually 10 µL) into the
HPLC system.
• Record the chromatograms and measure the peak areas for
Procainamide and NAPA.
• Ensure that the retention times and peak shapes are consistent
with those of the calibration standards.
6.6. Data Analysis:
• Calculate the concentrations of Procainamide and NAPA in the
serum samples using the calibration curves.
• Review the results to ensure they fall within the expected range
and meet acceptable QC criteria.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by the laboratory
technologist.
• Critical and out-of-range results must be flagged and reviewed.
• Report Procainamide and NAPA levels in µg/mL (micrograms per
milliliter).
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform daily QC checks using high and low QC serum samples.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions for any out-
of-range values.
• Participate in external proficiency testing as required.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to established clinical guidelines or your laboratory-specific
reference intervals for interpreting Procainamide and NAPA levels.
1. KEY POINTS
Ensure all equipment is calibrated and properly maintained. Follow
safety guidelines and use appropriate personal protective equipment.
Document all steps taken and maintain records for traceability.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to HPLC instrument manuals, reagent data sheets, and
relevant clinical laboratory guidelines.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate
and reliable determination of Procainamide and NAPA levels in serum
samples, maintaining high standards of laboratory practice.
