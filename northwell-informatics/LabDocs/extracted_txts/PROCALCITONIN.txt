Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Procalcitonin
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized instructions
for the analytical phase of generating results for Procalcitonin (PCT)
testing to ensure accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
Procalcitonin testing according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to promptly identify any issues
affecting test results and bring them to the attention of a
supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that testing is performed
and documented according to this SOP, and that appropriate
corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
blood to clot at room temperature. Centrifuge within 2 hours of
collection.
• Plasma: Collect blood in a lithium or sodium heparin tube.
Centrifuge within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in EDTA or citrate tubes
• Specimens that have not been properly centrifuged or have been
stored beyond stability limits
Stability:
• Serum and plasma are stable for up to 48 hours when refrigerated
at 2-8°C. For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C
or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Procalcitonin assay analyzer (e.g., Roche cobas e411, bioMérieux
VIDAS)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and disposable pipette tips
• Vortex mixer (if required by the analyzer protocol)
Reagents:
• Procalcitonin assay reagents specific to the analyzer being used
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high levels)
• Calibrators specific to the Procalcitonin assay
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or lithium/sodium heparin tubes
• Sample cups or tubes compatible with the analyzer
• Labeling materials
• Disposable gloves
1. TEST PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment and reagents are prepared and calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Mix samples thoroughly by gentle inversion or using a vortex
mixer if required.
3. Label all samples, controls, and calibrators appropriately.
Assay Steps:
1. Load the calibrators, quality control materials, and patient
samples into the sample racks or cups:
◦ Adhere to the sample layout required by the specific
Procalcitonin analyzer.
◦ Ensure careful and aliquoting of the samples to avoid
contamination.
2. Input patient and sample information into the analyzer’s LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
3. Start the analysis run according to the manufacturer's operating
procedures.
4. Monitor the assay progression and check for any error
messages or flags.
5. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
Post-Analysis:
1. Review the assay output.
◦ Verify that all internal quality checks (e.g., calibrator and
control values) fall within acceptable ranges.
◦ Investigate and take appropriate corrective actions if any
quality control values are out of range.
2. Transfer data to the LIS for result verification and reporting.
3. Document and review any flagged or critical results according
to established reporting policies.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Run the following Quality Control measures:
1. Calibrations:
◦ Perform calibration as per the manufacturer's specified
frequency or after reagent lot changes.
◦ Document and review calibration results to ensure
compliance with acceptable performance criteria.
2. Quality Control Tests:
◦ Run quality controls at the beginning of each testing shift
and after calibration.
◦ Use at least two levels of controls (low, medium, high) to
ensure assay performance across the measuring range.
◦ Record and review QC results to detect any trends or
deviations from acceptable ranges.
◦ Take appropriate actions to address any QC failures before
releasing patient results.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
reporting.
• Investigate and document any discrepancies in results.
• Critical results must be promptly communicated to the requesting
healthcare provider and documented following established
protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific Procalcitonin assay manufacturer’s insert for
limitations associated with the assay.
• Interpretation of results should be made within the clinical context,
considering other diagnostic factors and patient history.

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is effective as of [Date]
and will be reviewed annually or as needed following pertinent
updates or changes to protocols, reagents, or instrumentation.
