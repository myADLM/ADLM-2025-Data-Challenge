PROTOCOL: PROCALCITONIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for Procalcitonin (PCT)
from serum specimens. Procalcitonin testing is used as a
marker for bacterial infection and sepsis diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all clinical laboratory personnel in the
analytically focused department, performing Procalcitonin
testing on serum using the designated automated
immunoassay analyzer.
3. DEFINITION
Procalcitonin (PCT) is a protein biomarker that can be
measured in the serum to detect bacterial infections, with
elevated levels suggesting a higher probability of sepsis or
systemic bacterial infection.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technicians or technologists are responsible for
performing the Procalcitonin assay, ensuring quality control
measures are conducted, and validating the results before
reporting. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring
compliance and addressing any discrepancies or failures in the
testing process.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Specimen Collection: Blood should be collected using
standard venipuncture technique into a serum separation
tube (SST).
◦ Specimen Stability: Separated serum can be stored at
2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For long-term storage, specimens
should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
◦ Unacceptable Samples: Samples with significant
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus which could interfere with the
PCT measurement.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche COBAS
e411, Siemens ADVIA Centaur)
◦ Procalcitonin reagent kit (specific to the analyzer)
◦ Calibrators and control materials specific for PCT assay
◦ Pipettes and Tips
◦ Serum tubes (SST)
◦ Centrifuge
7. REAGENTS
◦ Procalcitonin reagent kit
◦ Procalcitonin calibrator
◦ Quality control materials (High, medium, low control)
8. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
◦ Ensure that the analyzer is properly set up and calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents and controls to come to room temperature
before use.
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as per kit instructions.
B. Sample Preparation
◦ Centrifuge the Serum Separation Tube (SST) to separate
serum from the blood clot.
◦ Aliquot serum into appropriate sample cups if necessary.
C. Assay Procedure
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient specimens
onto the analyzer.
◦ Select the PCT assay protocol according to the analyzer’s
user manual.
◦ Start the assay run.
D. Quality Control
◦ Run quality control materials at levels specified by the
manufacturer before patient samples.
◦ Ensure the results of the controls are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
◦ Document any deviations and take corrective actions as
needed.
E. Result Interpretation
◦ Review and analyze the data generated by the analyzer.
◦ Validate the results by comparing them against control data
and reference ranges.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and verify them according to the quality assurance
protocol.
◦ Report results to the requesting healthcare provider,
indicating critical values that require immediate clinical
attention.
10. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal Range: <0.05 ng/mL
• Intermediate Risk of Sepsis: 0.05-2 ng/mL (Clinical correlation
recommended)
• High Risk of Sepsis: >2 ng/mL
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results may be affected by severe hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Some rare conditions may cause elevated PCT levels in the
absence of bacterial infection.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks as outlined in the procedure and document
results in the QC log.
• Implement corrective actions if QC results fall outside acceptable
ranges.
• Regularly participate in external proficiency testing programs.

1. APPROVAL AND REVIEW
• This SOP shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
upon advancements in technology, changes in guidelines or
procedures, or identifiable areas of improvement.
