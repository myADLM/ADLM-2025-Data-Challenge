Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Procollagen I Intact N-Terminal (PINP), Serum Analysis
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedures for the accurate and timely
analysis of Procollagen I Intact N-Terminal (PINP) in serum using a
designated immunoassay technique in the laboratory. Proper
handling, measurement, and documentation procedures are vital to
ensuring quality, reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the analysis and
documentation of PINP, ensuring all procedures are followed
according to this SOP. Staff and supervisors must identify and
troubleshoot any issues that may affect the quality of test results and
implement corrective actions as necessary.
1. Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a red-top or gold-top (SST) tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C and are
stable for up to 48 hours. If storage exceeds 48 hours, specimens
must be frozen at -20°C and are stable for up to three months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA,
citrate, or heparin.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens with no collection date or time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Immunoassay analyzer (ELISA, chemiluminescent immunoassay,
or equivalent)
• Procollagen I Intact N-Terminal assay kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to PINP
• Pipettes, centrifuge, and sample tubes
• Refrigerated storage units (-20°C for long-term sample storage)
• Timer and sample racks
1. Procedure
Preparation:
• Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature prior to use as per the assay kit instructions.
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and validated
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Sample Handling and Preparation:
• Centrifuge the blood-clot sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
• Transfer the serum into a properly labeled sample tube.
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare the assay reagents and set up the immunoassay
analyzer according to the assay kit's protocol.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum sample, calibrators, and
quality controls into designated wells or tubes.
3. Follow the assay kit instructions for incubation, washing, and
signal detection.
4. Allow the system to process the samples, ensuring proper
timing for each step (e.g., incubation, wash cycles, signal
development).
Data Analysis:
1. Upon assay completion, retrieve test results from the analyzer.
2. Review the results, ensuring all quality control measures are
within acceptable ranges.
3. Validate the results by comparing against established reference
intervals and calibrator values.
4. Quality Control
• Utilize internal QC materials for each run (negative and positive
controls) according to kit instructions.
• Document all QC results and any troubleshooting actions taken.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, re-analyze affected
batches and notify the supervisor immediately.
1. Reporting Results
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals for PINP should be obtained from assay kit
inserts or peer-reviewed literature and documented for regular
use.
Documentation:
• Record results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System)
ensuring proper entry of patient demographics and sample
identifiers.
• Verify results before release, with critical values flagged for
immediate communication to clinicians as per laboratory policy.
Interference and Limitations:
• Note any potential assay interferences (e.g., rheumatoid factor,
heterophile antibodies).
• Refer to assay kit insert for specific limitations and
troubleshooting procedures.
1. Maintenance
• Perform routine maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer per
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document all maintenance and calibration activities in the
instrument logbook.
1. References
• Manufacturer's assay kit insert for Procollagen I Intact N-Terminal.
• Peer-reviewed references relevant to PINP assay technique and
clinical application.
This protocol is intended to standardize procedures for the analysis
of PINP, ensuring high-quality and accurate results are generated
consistently within the laboratory. By adhering to these guidelines,
laboratory staff can maintain compliance with CLIA standards and
meet clinical needs effectively.
