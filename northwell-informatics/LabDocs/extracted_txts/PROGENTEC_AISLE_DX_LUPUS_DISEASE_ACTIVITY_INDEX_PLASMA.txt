Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Progentec Aisle Dx
Lupus Disease Activity Index, Plasma
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Progentec Aisle Dx Lupus
Disease Activity Index test using plasma specimens. This ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for the assessment of
lupus disease activity.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the testing personnel
to follow the procedures as outlined in this document. The designated
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel
are adequately trained and that the procedures are updated as
necessary.
3. DEFINITION The Progentec Aisle Dx Lupus Disease Activity Index
is a laboratory test used to assess the disease activity in patients with
lupus. It involves the quantitative measurement of specific
biomarkers in plasma.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Progentec Aisle Dx Lupus Disease Activity Index Kit
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Plasma collection tubes (e.g., EDTA, Citrate)
• Vortex mixer
• Plate reader (compatible with kit specifications)
• Timer
• Laboratory gloves, lab coat, and protective eyewear
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Quality control materials
• Specimen log sheet
• Laboratory information system (LIS) access
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen type: Plasma
• Collection: Blood is collected in EDTA or Citrate tubes and
immediately inverted gently 8-10 times to ensure proper mixing
with anticoagulant.
• Transport and Storage: Plasma specimens should be separated
from cells within 2 hours of collection by centrifugation at 1500 x g
for 10 minutes at 4°C. Plasma aliquots should be stored at -80°C
if not analyzed immediately.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with hemolysis,
excessive lipemia, or improper labeling will not be accepted.
6. PROCEDURE A) Preparation
• Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and ready for use.
• Thaw plasma specimens on ice or at 4°C if frozen.
• Prepare quality control materials as specified in the kit insert.
• Bring all kit reagents, control materials, and specimens to room
temperature (18-25°C) before starting the assay.
B) Sample Preparation
• Vortex thawed plasma specimens to ensure homogeneity.
• Aliquot the required plasma volume into labeled microcentrifuge
tubes, if necessary.
C) Running the Assay
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the Progentec
Aisle Dx Lupus Disease Activity Index Kit insert.
• Add the appropriate volume of sample, control, and standards to
the designated wells of the assay plate.
• Follow the specified incubation times, wash steps, and reagent
addition instructions precisely.
• Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and for the
specified duration as prescribed in the kit.
D) Reading Results
• After completing the assay, read the results using a plate reader
set to the appropriate wavelength as specified in the kit insert.
• Export and save the plate reader data securely.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each assay to
ensure assay integrity.
• Acceptable ranges for control results must be established in
accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document and review control results. If control results fall outside
acceptable ranges, do not report patient results and initiate
troubleshooting procedures.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze and interpret the assay data using the specified software
or calculation methods indicated in the kit insert.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a certified
technologist before releasing the report.
9. PROCEDURAL NOTES
• Use gloves and follow biohazard safety guidelines while handling
specimens.
• Ensure all assays are conducted in a clean, contamination-free
environment.
• Follow waste disposal regulations for biohazardous materials.
