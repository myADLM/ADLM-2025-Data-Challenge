Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for PROGENTEC AISLE DX LUPUS FLARE
RISK INDEX, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps for the analytical phase in generating results for
the PROGENTEC AISLE DX Lupus Flare Risk Index using plasma
specimens to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Lupus Flare Risk Index: The predictive index used to assess the
likelihood of a lupus flare in patients using plasma biomarkers.
Plasma Specimen: The clear, liquid portion of blood that is
separated and used for testing after the blood cells are removed by
centrifugation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying out
the analysis as per this protocol. The lab supervisors are responsible
for ensuring adherence to the SOP and addressing any issues that
arise during the analytical process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Plasma samples collected using sodium or lithium heparin.
• Samples must be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection and
stored at -70°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Plasma collected in other anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA).
• Samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens that have not been properly stored or labeled.
5. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• PROGENTEC AISLE DX testing kit
• Calibration standards and controls
• Analytical instruments (e.g., multiplex immunoassay reader or
ELISA reader)
• Labware (e.g., pipettes, centrifuge, test tubes)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Procedure Steps:
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Ensure plasma specimens are received and stored at -70°C.
2. Check specimen integrity and verification against patient
information.
3. Thaw specimens at room temperature prior to analysis.
Analytical Phase:
1. Prepare reagents and calibrators according to manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Calibrate the analyzers using the provided standards.
3. Load specimens onto the analytical instruments following the kit
instructions.
◦ Ensure samples are properly mixed before loading into the
device.
4. Run quality controls alongside patient samples to validate the
assay performance.
5. Initiate the assay run following the established protocol outlined
in the assay package insert.
Quality Control:
1. Analyze QC materials alongside each assay run. Document the
results in the quality control log.
2. Verify that QC results fall within the established acceptable
limits. If QC results fail, troubleshoot and repeat the analysis as
necessary.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Review generated data for anomalies and assess the quality of
the results.
2. Validate the results against control measures.
3. Report any critical values according to lab protocols.
4. Transfer valid results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for final review and reporting.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Interpretation of Results:
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for the Lupus Flare Risk
Index.
• Apply any result comments as needed based on assay limitations.
Critical Result Handling:
• Notify the healthcare provider immediately if results indicate high
risk for lupus flare.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Continuously monitor and document QC measures.
• Address and resolve any discrepancies or deviations from
acceptable QC limits.
