Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Progesterone Levels
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the quantitative
determination of progesterone levels in human serum or plasma
samples using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA).
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the analysis of progesterone levels in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analysis according to this SOP,
ensuring accurate results, and maintaining proper documentation. It
is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to ensure the
adherence to this protocol and to address any compliance issues
promptly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma (EDTA or heparin)
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL of serum or plasma
b. Acceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in serum separator tubes (SST), EDTA, or
heparinized vacutainers.
c. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Lipemic samples
• Icteric samples
• Tubes containing anticoagulants other than EDTA or heparin.
d. Specimen Stability:
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines provided in the assay kit
insert.
• Store serum or plasma samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid
multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment:
• Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens Atellica
IM, Roche Elecsys, etc.)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
b. Reagents:
• Progesterone assay kit (specific to the analyzer used)
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials at different levels (low, medium, high)
c. Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Sample tubes
• Timer
• Precision pipettes and tips
6. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at room
temperature before use.
b. Instrument Preparation:
1. Power on the Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Perform instrument maintenance, if due, following the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify and log the temperature settings of the incubation
chamber (temperature should be 37°C).
c. Calibration:
1. Calibrate the instrument using the provided calibration
standards following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Accept the calibration curve if it meets the criteria specified in
the assay kit insert. If not, troubleshoot and recalibrate.
d. Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control materials at low, medium, and high
levels.
2. Confirm that QC results fall within the acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient specimens.
3. Document QC results appropriately.
e. Sample Analysis:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood samples at 1000-2000g for 10
minutes to separate serum/plasma.
2. Carefully aliquot the serum/plasma into appropriately labeled
sample tubes.
3. Load the samples, controls, and reagents onto the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
4. Start the analysis following the protocol outlined by the
instrument's user manual.
5. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
f. Interpretation and Reporting of Results:
1. Verify the auto-generated assay results for each sample.
2. Input data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) as
required.
3. Review any flagged results or instrument messages and
address them accordingly.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Adult female:
◦ Follicular phase: 0.2 – 1.5 ng/mL
◦ Luteal phase: 1.7 – 27.0 ng/mL
◦ Postmenopausal: < 0.2 ng/mL
• Adult male: < 0.2 - 1.4 ng/mL
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Follow the assay kit insert for detailed limitations regarding
potential interferences, cross-reactivity, and analytical sensitivity.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's Assay Kit Insert
• CLIA Guidelines and Regulations
• Laboratory Quality Management Manual
10. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain records of all calibrations, quality control results, patient
sample results, maintenance logs, and corrective actions taken.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Refer to the analyzer's user manual and assay kit insert for
troubleshooting steps.
12. REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
• This SOP must be reviewed and approved annually by the
laboratory manager and medical director.
