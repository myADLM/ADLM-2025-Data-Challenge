Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generated Results of
Progesterone Receptor (PR) Immunostain - Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures to be followed for the technical
performance of Progesterone Receptor (PR) immunohistochemical
staining in histopathology laboratory to ensure consistent,
reproducible, and high-quality results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing PR
immunostaining within the histopathology department. It does not
cover the interpretation or clinical reporting of results.
3. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Staining racks
• Immunostainer (automated or manual staining instruments)
Materials:
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• PR primary antibody
• Secondary antibody
• Detection system (DAB or other chromogen kits)
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Mounting medium
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (various concentrations)
• Distilled water
• Wash buffer (e.g., TBS or PBS)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer or EDTA)
• Hydration and dehydration solutions
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
• Unstained tissue sections (4-5 micrometers thick) mounted on
positively charged microscope slides
5. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Sectioning:
1. Sectioning:
• Cut 4-5 µm thick tissue sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded blocks using a microtome.
• Float sections on a water bath at approximately 45°C and transfer
to positively charged slides.
• Allow slides to dry at room temperature overnight or dry in an
oven at 60°C for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinization:
• Place slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
1. Rehydration:
• Transfer slides through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2
minutes each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
• Place slides in a pre-heated antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate
buffer, pH 6.0) and microwave, pressure cook, or use a water bath
as per recommended protocol, generally 20-30 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool in the buffer for at least 20 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water followed by wash buffer.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
• Incubate slides with a blocking solution to minimize non-specific
staining (e.g., serum or commercial blocking agent) for 10
minutes.
1. Primary Antibody:
• Incubate slides with primary PR antibody at the specified dilution
and temperature for 30-60 minutes.
• Wash slides in wash buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
1. Secondary Antibody:
• Incubate slides with a biotinylated secondary antibody or HRP-
polymer conjugate as appropriate for 30 minutes.
• Wash slides in wash buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
1. Detection:
• Incubate slides with DAB or appropriate chromogen until desired
staining intensity is achieved (generally 5-10 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain:
• Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in tap water.
• Differentiate in 0.1% acid alcohol if necessary, and rinse again in
tap water.
• Blueing in alkaline solution (e.g., ammonia water) for 1 minute,
then rinse in tap water.
F. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydration:
• Dehydrate slides through an ascending series of ethanol
concentrations (70%, 95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each.
• Clear slides in 3 changes of xylene for 2 minutes each.
1. Mounting:
• Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Always include a positive control (tissue known to express PR)
and a negative control (omit primary antibody).
• Document all staining runs in the logbook.
• Validate new antibody lots and staining reagents before regular
use.
• Ensure external and internal QC measures are regularly
performed and documented.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Non-specific staining: Review antibody dilution, incubation time,
and blocking procedures.
• Weak staining: Verify antibody activity, antigen retrieval
conditions, and incubation times.
• Background staining: Ensure proper washing, blocking, and check
for reagent contamination.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Technical reports include completion of staining procedures with
any deviations documented.
• The slides are handed over to the pathologist for interpretation
and clinical reporting.
9. REFERENCES:
• Instruction manuals and datasheets of the PR primary antibody,
secondary antibody, and detection system.
• CLSI guidelines for immunohistochemistry.
10. APPENDIX:
• List of commonly observed artifacts and how to address them
(optional).
