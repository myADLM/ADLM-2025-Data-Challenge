Protocol for Analytical Phase of Progesterone, Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
serum progesterone levels to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all personnel performing serum
progesterone testing in the biochemistry laboratory. The procedure
covers the entire analytical phase from the preparation of samples/
reagents to the reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to:
• Perform the serum progesterone testing according to this
protocol.
• Adhere to quality control measures and troubleshooting
guidelines.
• Report any issues to the laboratory supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Progesterone assay kit(s) (approved and validated for use)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator (if required for the assay)
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory glassware/PCR tubes (where necessary)
• Rack for sample organization
• Serum controls (high, medium, low)
• Quality control reagents
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Calibrated digital/ELISA reader or appropriate instrument for
result reading
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• 5 mL of serum is required for the analysis.
• Acceptable containers: Red-top tubes (without gel separator) or
SST tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed specimens, Lipemic specimens for
certain kits or instruments if not validated, and specimens
collected in non-serum collection tubes.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation for Analysis
◦ Ensure that all reagents are at optimal storage conditions
before starting.
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
◦ Calibrate the instrument as specified by manufacturer
guidelines.
2. Sample Processing
◦ Centrifuge the blood collection tubes at 1000-1500 x g for
10-15 minutes to separate serum, ensuring that serum is
free from any cell debris.
◦ Aliquot the serum into clean labeled microtubes, avoiding
transfer of any cells from the clot.
◦ Store the separated serum at 2-8°C until analysis, or freeze
at -20°C or lower if analysis will be delayed beyond 48
hours.
3. Assay Procedure (Sample and Standard Preparation)
◦ Prepare the reagents and standards as per the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Set up the standards in duplicates and samples in sequence
on the assay plate.
◦ Pipette specified volumes of sample, standards, and
controls into their respective wells.
4. Incubation and Washing Steps
◦ Follow the specific assay incubation times and temperatures
detailed in the kit's instruction manual.
◦ Adhere to the washing steps to avoid cross-contamination
and ensure consistency and reproducibility.
5. Detection and Measurement
◦ Follow the specific protocol for colorimetric or
chemiluminescent detection.
◦ Measure the absorbance or other specified detection
metrics using a calibrated reader.
◦ Record data as per laboratory data management
procedures.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Run serum controls (high, medium, low) with each batch of
samples to ensure that the results of the tests fall within the
established acceptable range.
• If quality control results are outside acceptable limits, no samples
should be reported until the issue is resolved.
• Calibration should be performed as indicated by the reagent kit or
device manual.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results occur, verify the reagent integrity, incubation
times, pipetting accuracy, and instrument calibration.
• Re-analyze samples after ensuring all procedural steps were
appropriately followed.
• Notify the supervisor for further evaluation if issues persist.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure all results meet quality control standards.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification and report generation.
• Critical values should be immediately escalated as per laboratory
SOP.
10. RESULT INTERPRETATION
Reference Intervals (may vary slightly based on guidelines and
patient demographics):
• Follicular phase: <1 ng/mL
• Luteal phase: 2-25 ng/mL
• Pregnancy: Varies by trimester

• Maintain detailed log entries of each assay run, including date
and time, operator initials, control results, and comments on any
deviances or issues.
