Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
PROGRAMMED DEATH-LIGAND 1 (PD-L1) (22C3), SEMI-
QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, MANUAL
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for manual semi-quantitative
immunohistochemical staining and evaluation of PD-L1 (22C3) in
tissue specimens. Accurate and reliable evaluation of PD-L1
expression is critical for guiding therapy in oncology patients.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists and
pathologists to carry out this procedure following all guidelines
detailed within this SOP. The quality and accuracy of the test
results are a shared responsibility among those performing and
interpreting the tests.
1. PRINCIPLE
PD-L1 (22C3) immunohistochemistry is used to detect PD-L1 protein
expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
samples. The staining intensity and membrane staining percentage
are semi-quantitatively evaluated to guide therapeutic decision
making.
1. SPECIMEN
• Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue section
• Section thickness: 4-5 microns
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with inadequate fixation.
◦ Specimens improperly processed.
◦ Specimens with excessive tissue folding.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Positive control slides
• Negative control slides
• Primary antibody: PD-L1 (22C3)
• Detection system: Compatible peroxidase detection system
• Chromogen: Diaminobenzidine (DAB)
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Microscope
Supplies:
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Water bath
• Humidity chamber
• Immunostaining reagents (buffers, antigen retrieval solutions, etc.)
• Washing solutions (PBS or TBS)
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Xylene: Two changes for 10 minutes each.
2. 100% Ethanol: Two changes for 5 minutes each.
3. 95% Ethanol: One change for 5 minutes.
4. 70% Ethanol: One change for 5 minutes.
5. Distilled water: Rinse to remove ethanol.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a pressure cooker or microwave-safe container
with antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat the slides in the pressure cooker or microwave as
specified by the retrieval protocol.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
C. Blocking Endogenous Enzyme Activity:
1. Incubate slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate tissue sections with PD-L1 (22C3) primary antibody
for 30 minutes at room temperature or as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
E. Detection System:
1. Incubate slides with an appropriate secondary antibody
conjugated with peroxidase for 30 minutes.
2. Rinse in PBS or TBS.
3. Apply DAB chromogen solution for 5-10 minutes or until desired
intensity is achieved.
4. Rinse in distilled water.
F. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in water.
3. Bluing in ammonia water or Scott’s tap water for 1-2 minutes.
4. Rinse in distilled water.
G. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. 70% Ethanol: One change for 5 minutes.
2. 95% Ethanol: One change for 5 minutes.
3. 100% Ethanol: Two changes for 5 minutes each.
4. Xylene: Two changes for 10 minutes each.
5. Mount with a permanent mounting medium and coverslip.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Examine control slides to ensure proper staining protocol was
followed before analyzing patient specimens.
• Any discrepancies in staining should be addressed by
troubleshooting and documented.
1. INTERPRETATION:
• A pathologist will evaluate PD-L1 expression by assessing the
percentage of tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane
staining.
• Semi-quantitative scoring criteria will be used, such as Tumor
Proportion Score (TPS).
◦ TPS < 1%: Negative
◦ TPS ≥ 1% but < 50%: Low expression
◦ TPS ≥ 50%: High expression
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are documented in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Pathologist reviews and finalizes results including TPS and any
relevant comments.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Tissue preservation, antigen retrieval quality, and antibody
specificity play critical roles in staining quality.
• False positives/negatives may result from technical errors or
artifacts; these must be minimized by following validated
protocols.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for PD-L1 (22C3) antibody and
detection system.
• National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for
PD-L1 testing.
• Published protocols and peer-reviewed articles specifying best
practices for PD-L1 IHC staining.
