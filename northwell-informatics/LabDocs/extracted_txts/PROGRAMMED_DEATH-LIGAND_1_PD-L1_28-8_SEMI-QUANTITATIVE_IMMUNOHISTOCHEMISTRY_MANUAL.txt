Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Programmed Death-
Ligand 1 (PD-L1) (28-8), Semi-Quantitative
Immunohistochemistry, Manual
1. PURPOSE
To outline the semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry procedure for
the detection of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) (28-8)
expression in tissue specimens. This assay is used in the context of
oncology for the assessment of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and
immune cells to guide therapeutic decisions.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing PD-L1
immunohistochemistry staining, documenting procedures, and
ensuring the accuracy and quality of test results. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing and validating test results.
1. DEFINITION
Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a protein that plays a critical
role in suppressing the immune system and is involved in the
immune escape of tumor cells.

1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Tissue Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks
• Section Thickness: 4-5 µm
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning and Slide Preparation
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 µm thickness using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 45-50°C.
3. Pick up sections onto adhesive microscope slides and allow to
dry at room temperature.
4. Incubate slides in a drying oven at 60°C for 30 minutes to 1
hour (or overnight at 37°C).
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded alcohols:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 x 2 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
3. Rinse in distilled water for 2 x 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Prepare antigen retrieval solution (e.g., Citrate Buffer pH 6.0).
2. Heat the antigen retrieval solution in a microwave or water bath
until it reaches near boiling (approximately 95-100°C).
3. Place slides in a retrieval container and immerse them in the
hot solution.
4. Maintain the slides in the solution for 20-30 minutes.
5. Let the slides cool for an additional 20 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 x 2 minutes, then in wash
buffer (PBS or TBS).
D. Blocking and Antibody Staining
1. Encircle the tissue section with a hydrophobic barrier pen to
contain reagents.
2. Apply peroxidase blocking solution to slides and incubate for
5-10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
3. Wash slides in wash buffer for 2 x 2 minutes.
4. Apply primary PD-L1 (28-8) antibody to slides and incubate for
60 minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash slides in wash buffer for 2 x 2 minutes.
6. Apply Envision+ System-HRP Labelled Polymer Anti-Rabbit to
slides and incubate for 30 minutes.
7. Wash slides in wash buffer for 2 x 2 minutes.
8. Add DAB substrate to slides and incubate for 5-10 minutes or
until adequate color develops.
9. Wash slides in distilled water for 2 x 2 minutes.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2-5 minutes.
2. Wash slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and 100%
ethanol) and clear in xylene.
4. Apply coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
5. RESULT INTERPRETATION
Semi-quantitative evaluation of PD-L1 expression should be
performed by a pathologist using a light microscope. The staining
patterns observed in both tumor cells and immune cells are scored
based on intensity and percentage of cell positivity within the
specimen.
Positive Control: Must show appropriate membrane staining in known
positive tissue areas. Negative Control: Must show no staining or
minimal nonspecific staining in areas expected to be negative.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Include known PD-L1 positive and negative control slides with each
staining run to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
immunohistochemistry procedure. Document control results in
relevant logs.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be documented, and the staining patterns should be
reported accurately in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Pathologists to interpret and sign off on the final report according to
clinical reporting guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
Manufacturer's instructions for the PD-L1 (28-8) antibody and other
reagents used in the procedure should be reviewed and followed.
This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor and laboratory director. Regular review and updates
should be conducted to ensure compliance with the latest standards
and protocols.
