PROTOCOL FOR ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR PROGRAMMED DEATH-LIGAND 1 (PD-L1)
(SP142), SEMI-QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,
MANUAL
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for evaluating PD-L1 expression in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using the SP142
antibody and semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC).
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to ensure the
correct preparation, staining, and interpretation of PD-L1 (SP142)
IHC slides. Supervisory staff are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this protocol and rectifying any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable samples:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• 4-5 micrometer sections mounted on positively charged glass
slides.
Unacceptable samples:
• Inadequately fixed or poorly preserved tissue.
• Specimens without proper labeling.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• PD-L1 (SP142) antibody (commercially available)
• Detection kit (e.g., Ventana OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit)
• Positive control tissue (known PD-L1 positive tissue)
• Negative control tissue (known PD-L1 negative tissue)
• Mounting media and coverslips
• Xylene, ethanol, and distilled water
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Automated or manual staining apparatus
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sectioning and Deparaffinization
1. Cut 4-5μm tissue sections and mount on positively charged
slides.
2. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adhesion.
3. Deparaffinize sections in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
4. Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol
solutions to distilled water (100%, 95%, 80%, 70% ethanol, 2
minutes each).
B) Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using a proprietary
solution or citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker or water
bath at 95-100°C for 20-30 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Blocking and Antibody Incubation
1. Apply blocking agent (e.g., protein block serum-free) to each
section and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
2. Apply primary antibody (PD-L1 SP142) at the manufacturer’s
recommended dilution and incubate for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
3. Rinse slides with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-
buffered saline (TBS).
D) Detection and Visualization
1. Apply secondary antibody from the detection kit and incubate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (typically 30
minutes).
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
3. Apply DAB substrate-chromogen solution and incubate for the
time specified by the manufacturer (typically 5-10 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E) Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water, followed by distilled water.
3. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol to xylene.
4. Mount coverslips with permanent mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known PD-L1 positive and negative controls for each
staining run.
• Review control slides to ensure appropriate staining and absence
of background staining.
• Any inconsistencies must be addressed and documented before
proceeding with case specimens.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Analyze stained slides under a microscope at appropriate
magnification.
• Score PD-L1 expression semi-quantitatively based on the
manufacturer's guidelines and clinical reference materials.
Common scoring criteria may include percentage of PD-L1
positive tumor cells and immune cells, and staining intensity.
1. RECORDING AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Document staining and control results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Report results under established guidelines, including PD-L1
positivity percentage and intensity where relevant.
• Communicate findings to the requesting pathologist or clinician.
1. LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure tissue quality and fixation are adequate, as improper
handling can result in poor staining.
• Be vigilant for non-specific staining and implement necessary
corrective measures.
• Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for any additional
limitations or troubleshooting tips.

• Relevant literature on PD-L1 semi-quantitative IHC scoring and
interpretation.
1. REVIEW AND REVISIONS
• This protocol shall be reviewed annually or as needed to
incorporate new guidelines, technologies, or findings.
By adhering to this standardized protocol, the laboratory ensures
accurate and consistent results in the evaluation of PD-L1
expression, contributing to appropriate clinical decision-making.
