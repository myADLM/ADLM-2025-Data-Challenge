Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) PROGRAMMED DEATH-
LIGAND 1 (PD-L1) (SP263), SEMI-QUANTITATIVE
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, MANUAL
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the
procedures for the semi-quantitative immunohistochemical
detection and evaluation of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-
L1) expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue specimens using the PD-L1 (SP263) antibody. This test
aids in the assessment of PD-L1 as a biomarker for
immunotherapeutic interventions in oncology.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel performing the test to adhere to this protocol and
ensure all reagents, equipment, and specimens are handled
and processed correctly. Supervisors must ensure staff
competency and compliance with this protocol.
3. SPECIMENS 3.1. Accepted Specimens:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks 3.2.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Fresh, non-fixed tissue
◦ Inadequately fixed or processed tissue
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT 4.1. Reagents:
◦ Primary Antibody: PD-L1 (SP263) antibody
◦ Detection System: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
◦ DAB Chromogen Solution
◦ Hematoxylin counterstain 4.2. Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Automated slide stainer (if available)
◦ Incubator
◦ Water bath
◦ Microscope
◦ pH 6.0 citrate buffer
◦ Xylene and graded alcohols
5. PROCEDURES 5.1. Preparing Tissue Sections:
◦ Cut 4-micron thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
◦ Mount sections on positively charged slides and dry
overnight at 37°C.
5.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: - Deparaffinize tissue
sections by incubating in xylene for 2 cycles of 5 minutes each. -
Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) for 3
minutes each, then rinse in distilled water.
5.3. Antigen Retrieval: - Perform heat-mediated antigen retrieval
using pH 6.0 citrate buffer in a water bath at 95-99°C for 20 minutes.
- Cool sections for 20 minutes at room temperature and rinse with
distilled water.
5.4. Blocking: - Apply blocking solution to sections to reduce non-
specific staining. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
5.5. Primary Antibody Incubation: - Incubate sections with PD-L1
(SP263) primary antibody at a pre-determined dilution. - Incubate for
60 minutes at room temperature.
5.6. Secondary Antibody and Detection: - Rinse sections with wash
buffer. - Incubate with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as per
manufacturer’s instructions. - Visualize using DAB chromogen
solution. Incubate until desired staining intensity is achieved
(approximately 5-10 minutes).
5.7. Counterstaining: - Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes. - Rinse in distilled water and blue in running tap water.
5.8. Dehydration and Mounting: - Dehydrate through graded alcohols
and clear in xylene. - Mount sections using a permanent mounting
medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL 6.1. Include appropriate positive and
negative control slides in each run. 6.2. Review all slides to
ensure adequate staining quality and specificity. 6.3. Record
any issues and take corrective actions as necessary.
2. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 7.1. Evaluate PD-L1
expression semi-quantitatively using a light microscope. 7.2.
Assess membranous staining in tumor cells and immune cells.
7.3. Score staining intensity from 0 (no staining) to 3+ (strong
staining).
3. REPORTING RESULTS 8.1. Document and review the
interpretation alongside the pathologist. 8.2. Report PD-L1
status: Positive or Negative with percentage of positive tumor
cells and intensity scores.

1. REVISIONS AND APPROVAL This SOP will be reviewed
annually and updated as needed. All revisions must be
approved by the laboratory supervisor and documented.
