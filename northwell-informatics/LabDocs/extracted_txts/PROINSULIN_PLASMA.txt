Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Proinsulin, Plasma
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis
and reporting of proinsulin levels in plasma specimens, ensuring
accuracy, precision, and compliance with regulatory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel performing Proinsulin,
Plasma testing must adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory manager or designated supervisor to oversee compliance,
troubleshoot, and provide necessary training.
3. SCOPE This procedure applies to all plasma samples received for
proinsulin testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Plasma: Collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL.
• Specimens must be separated and frozen within 45 minutes of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Icteric or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient identification,
collection date/time).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Refrigerated Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Proinsulin ELISA Kit or equivalent immunoassay system
• Microtiter plates and plate reader
• Calibrators and controls specific to the Proinsulin assay
• Deionized or distilled water
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Review and accession the specimen according to laboratory
protocols.
2. Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
3. Label aliquots clearly with patient information and store plasma
at −20°C or lower until analysis.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation: a. Ensure all reagents are at room
temperature before use. b. Prepare working reagents according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration and Controls: a. Run calibrators and quality controls
provided in the assay kit in duplicate. b. Use freshly prepared
calibrators and controls daily.
3. Sample Preparation and Pipetting: a. Thaw plasma samples on
ice. b. Pipette the required volume of each calibrator, control,
and patient sample into designated wells of the microtiter plate.
4. Incubation and Washing: a. Follow the specific incubation steps
as per the kit’s protocol, including temperature and duration. b.
Perform washes as indicated to remove unbound antigens.
5. Detection and Measurement: a. Add detection reagents as per
kit instructions. b. Incubate, wash, and subsequently add the
substrate solution. c. Terminate the reaction with stop solution
when appropriate.
6. Reading and Interpretation: a. Read absorbance at the
specified wavelength using the microplate reader. b. Generate
a standard curve from the calibrator absorbance values. c.
Calculate sample concentrations utilizing the standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run external and internal quality controls with each batch of
samples analyzed.
2. Verify that QC results fall within the established acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
3. Investigate and document any QC deviations, re-calibrate and
re-test if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Input the validated proinsulin concentrations into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results for any inconsistencies or improbable
values.
3. Report results within the defined reference intervals:
◦ Proinsulin, Plasma: < 0.02 ng/mL
4. Critical values or significantly elevated results must be
immediately communicated to the attending physician or
healthcare provider and documented accordingly.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Proinsulin, Plasma: 0.3 – 3.6 pmol/L in fasting individuals.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the specific assay kit insert for
any limitations, such as interference from high levels of biotin or
heterophilic antibodies.

12. DOCUMENTATION Maintain accurate records of all steps
performed, including calibration data, quality control results, and any
deviations or troubleshooting actions.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING For any technical issues or unexpected
results, consult the assay manual and documentation. Seek
assistance from a supervisor or technical support if needed.
REVISION HISTORY
