Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Prolactin,
Pituitary Macroadenoma, Serum Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
accurate measurement and reporting of Prolactin levels in serum for
suspected/present pituitary macroadenoma cases. This protocol aims
to ensure that all steps from sample preparation to result reporting
are performed consistently and efficiently to produce reliable and
valid results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing serum prolactin tests are
responsible for following this protocol. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for training staff and ensuring compliance with this
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
▪ 5 mL of serum collected in a red or gold top (serum
separator) tube.
◦ Collection Instructions:
▪ The specimen should be collected by standard
venipuncture technique.
▪ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature before centrifuging for 10 minutes at 3000
RPM.
▪ Transfer serum to a new labeled transport tube if
required.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen:
▪ Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
▪ Specimens not labeled with patient identification (name,
date of birth).
◦ Storage and Stability:
▪ Serum specimens are stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C
and up to one week if frozen at -20°C, avoiding repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411, Siemens
IMMULITE 2000)
◦ Prolactin reagent kit
◦ Quality control materials (e.g., Bio-Rad Lyphochek
Immunoassay Plus Control)
◦ Serum separator tubes and transport tubes
◦ Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coats)
◦ Centrifuge
3. PROCEDURE
◦ Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify the specimen and requisition form for proper
patient identification and labeling.
2. Inspect the specimen for acceptability as per the
requirements.
3. Document the receipt of the specimen in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
▪ Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer is
calibrated and fully operational.
▪ Prepare reagents and quality control materials
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quality Control:
▪ Run two levels of quality control (low and high)
before performing patient tests. The results must
fall within the acceptable control ranges.
3. Testing:
▪ Load the patient specimens onto the analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Select the appropriate prolactin assay protocol on
the instrument and start the analysis.
4. Results Verification:
▪ Review the analyzer results for quality control and
patient samples.
▪ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot per the
manufacturer’s guidelines and repeat QC testing.
▪ If patient results are flagged by the analyzer,
investigate and repeat the test if necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transferred to the LIS.
◦ Verify the results in the LIS, ensuring patient details are
correct and that prolactin levels are within expected clinical
ranges.
◦ Reference Interval for Serum Prolactin:
▪ Males: 2-18 ng/mL
▪ Non-pregnant females: 2-29 ng/mL
▪ Pregnant females: 10-209 ng/mL
◦ Any results outside reference intervals should be flagged
and reviewed. Critical values must be reported immediately
to the physician or responsible clinician.
5. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND LIMITATIONS
◦ Elevated prolactin levels are typically indicative of pituitary
macroadenoma but can also be influenced by factors like
stress, medications, and other medical conditions.
◦ Laboratory must follow up on abnormally high or unusual
results with repeat testing and appropriate clinical
correlation.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
◦ Follow the internal quality control schedules and document
all QC activities.
◦ Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the
immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
◦ Record all maintenance activities and ensure instrument
performance is within specifications.

IMPORTANT NOTE: All procedures must comply with the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations and
laboratory-specific policies.
By adhering to this protocol, the laboratory ensures reliable and
consistent generation of prolactin results, critical for the accurate
diagnosis and management of patients with pituitary macroadenoma.
