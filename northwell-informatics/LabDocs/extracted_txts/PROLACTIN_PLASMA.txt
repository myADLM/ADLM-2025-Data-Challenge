Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Prolactin, Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to ensure accurate
and precise measurement of Prolactin levels in plasma samples
using specific laboratory equipment and analytical techniques.
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed during the
analytical phase, including sample handling, measurement,
quality control, and result documentation.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
procedure accurately and completely.
• Staff must report any inconsistencies or abnormalities to their
supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen:
▪ Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Collection Protocol:
▪ Ensure proper collection technique to avoid hemolysis.
▪ Immediately invert the specimen tube gently 8-10 times
to mix the anticoagulant.
◦ Stability:
▪ Plasma should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
▪ Plasma is stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C. For longer
storage, freeze plasma at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples with no collection date/time indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Centrifuge for plasma separation.
▪ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer.
▪ Pipettes and sample cups.
◦ Reagents:
▪ Prolactin reagent kits specific to the analyzer.
▪ Calibrators and controls as per manufacturer’s
recommendations.
◦ Supplies:
▪ EDTA collection tubes.
▪ Plasma storage vials.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Quality control material with known prolactin levels should
be run at the start of each shift, after reagent lot changes,
and after maintenance.
◦ The laboratory should use two levels of controls (normal and
abnormal) to monitor precision and accuracy.
◦ Results from control material must be documented and
reviewed to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
◦ If controls are outside accepted ranges, troubleshoot
according to manufacturer’s instructions and do not report
patient results until the issue is resolved.
3. PROCEDURE
◦ Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the sample integrity and documentation.
2. Centrifuge whole blood samples at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate plasma.
3. Aliquot the plasma into labeled vials for analysis.
◦ Analysis:
1. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the reagents, calibrators, and controls on the
analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay
protocol for Prolactin.
4. Load patient samples into the sample compartment
ensuring proper identification and order of testing.
◦ Calibration and Measurement:
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer using the provided
calibrators.
2. Run control samples to verify calibration accuracy.
3. Proceed with the measurement of patient samples.
4. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
◦ Review results for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Validate results against quality control data.
◦ Report prolactin results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Document any deviations, recalibrations, or troubleshooting
steps taken during the analysis.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals may vary by methodology; refer to the
manufacturer's reference range or established laboratory
ranges.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific
limitations and interferences.
◦ Ensure that all reagent and analyzer-specific limitations are
understood and considered during the analysis.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s insert for Prolactin reagent kits.
◦ Laboratory specific protocol documentation and guidelines.
By following this standard operating procedure, laboratory personnel
ensure the accuracy and reliability of prolactin measurements,
maintaining adherence to quality standards and regulatory
requirements.
