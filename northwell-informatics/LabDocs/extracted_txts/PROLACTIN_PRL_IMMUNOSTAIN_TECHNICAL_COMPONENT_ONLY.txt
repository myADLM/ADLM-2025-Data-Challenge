PROTOCOL FOR ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR PROLACTIN (PRL) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the technical steps involved in performing
Prolactin (PRL) immunostaining on tissue specimens in the histology
laboratory. It does not include the interpretation of the stained slides,
which is considered the clinical component and is performed by a
pathologist.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemical staining procedures and performing the
technical component of PRL immunostaining.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for carrying out the PRL
immunostaining procedure as per this SOP and maintaining the
necessary documentation.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure all personnel are trained in the
SOP, review the procedure regularly for updates, and address any
deficiencies or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Improperly fixed tissues or specimens
not embedded in paraffin.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Incubator
• Staining jars
• Humidity chamber
• Microscope
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Deionized water
• Antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or as
recommended by the antibody manufacturer)
• Endogenous peroxidase blocker
• Normal serum block
• Primary antibody: Rabbit anti-human Prolactin (PRL)
• Secondary antibody: Species-specific biotinylated secondary
antibody
• ABC (Avidin-Biotin Complex) reagent
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Cut 4 μm thick sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath (45°C) and then transfer onto
charged microscope slides.
3. Dry the slides on a slide warmer at 60°C for 30 minutes or
overnight at 37°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a graded ethanol series: 100% ethanol for 2
x 3 minutes, 95% ethanol for 1 x 3 minutes, 70% ethanol for 1 x
3 minutes.
3. Rinse sections in deionized water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer, pH
6.0) and heat in a microwave or pressure cooker for 20
minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse sections in deionized water followed by PBS (Phosphate
Buffered Saline).
D. Blocking Steps:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. Rinse in PBS.
2. Block non-specific binding with normal serum block for 30
minutes in a humidity chamber.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate sections with the primary antibody (Rabbit anti-human
Prolactin) at the recommended dilution (as per manufacturer's
instructions) for 1 hour at room temperature in a humidity
chamber.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Incubate sections with biotinylated secondary antibody for 30
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
3. Apply ABC reagent and incubate for 30 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
G. Visualization:
1. Incubate sections with DAB substrate until the desired color
intensity is achieved (typically 1-5 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in running water to stop the reaction.
H. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water until clear.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100% ethanol)
and clear in xylene.
4. Mount slides with a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Use a tissue known to express Prolactin as a
positive control in each staining run.
• Negative Control: Use a specific negative control by omitting the
primary antibody to check for non-specific binding and
background staining.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all procedures, including date, time, and initials, in the
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) logbook.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
9. REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Stained slides are reviewed and verified by the technologist for
quality before being forwarded to the pathologist for interpretation.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for primary and secondary antibodies.
• Literature on immunohistochemical staining techniques and
antigen retrieval methods.
• Internal laboratory manuals and SOPs related to histology and
immunohistochemistry.
11. ATTACHMENTS
• Immunostain worksheet/template for recording staining conditions
and results.
