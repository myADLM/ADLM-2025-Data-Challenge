Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Prolactin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the measurement of
prolactin levels in serum samples.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in performing and reporting the prolactin (PRL) assay
in a clinical laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory
personnel to perform and document the prolactin assay as
outlined in this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring personnel are adequately trained and the procedure is
followed correctly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in an SST (Serum
Separator Tube).
◦ Specimen Volume: Minimum volume required is 500 µL of
serum.
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Room temperature: 8 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
▪ Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Prolactin measurement kit (e.g., Chemiluminescent
Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA), or according to the
laboratory’s specific immunoassay analyzer)
◦ Calibrators and Controls as directed by the assay
manufacturer
◦ Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Abbott Architect i1000SR,
Roche Cobas e411, or similar)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Sample tubes and racks
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation 1. Allow the serum sample to clot at room
temperature and centrifuge to separate serum from the clot. 2.
Ensure serum samples are free from hemolysis or other
artifacts.
Assay Setup 1. Initialize the immunoassay analyzer according
to the manufacturer's instructions. 2. Load the prolactin reagent
kit into the analyzer. 3. Run assay calibrators to ensure proper
calibration of the analyzer. 4. Perform quality control using the
provided controls, ensuring that control results fall within the
acceptable ranges. 5. If QC results are outside acceptable
ranges, troubleshoot as necessary and do not proceed with
patient sample analysis until QC results are acceptable.
Sample Analysis 1. Assign the proper identification to each
sample. 2. Load the serum samples onto the analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 3. Verify that all
reagents and samples are correctly positioned, and initiate the
sample run. 4. Once the run is completed, review the results for
any flags or discrepancies. Investigate any flagged results to
determine if re-analysis is necessary.
Data Review and Interpretation 1. Ensure all assay
calibrations and controls are within range before validating
patient results. 2. Compare patient results with established
reference intervals: - Normal Reference Range: 4.0 - 23.0 ng/
mL (Note: Reference intervals may vary; verify with specific
assay manufacturer’s recommended ranges). 3. Document and
report any critical values to the appropriate clinical staff
immediately.
Quality Control and Documentation 1. Maintain records of all
calibrations, quality control results, and any deviations or
corrective actions taken. 2. Ensure all results are entered into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS). 3. Review and sign off
on results as per laboratory protocol.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are to be reviewed and verified by a licensed
technologist.
◦ Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
and ensure they are transmitted to the electronic medical
record (EMR) system.
◦ For critical results, follow established guidelines on notifying
the appropriate healthcare providers.
