STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
PROLONGED CLOT TIME PROFILE INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE This document outlines the protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for prolonged clot time profile
interpretation. This includes understanding the mechanisms behind
the prolongation, conducting necessary confirmatory tests, and
interpreting results to assist in diagnosis and management of
hemostatic disorders.
2. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved
in the interpretation of prolonged clotting time profiles. The
procedures described herein are to be followed once the specimen
has been collected, received, and accessioned in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists: Perform clotting time tests and document results.
• Supervisors: Review and validate results, ensure compliance
with this SOP, and address any anomalies or issues reported by
technologists.
• Laboratory Director: Overall responsibility for ensuring the
protocol is followed and maintaining standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Citrated plasma
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL
• Storage and Transport: Specimens should be kept at room
temperature and processed within 4 hours of collection. If delay
exceeds 4 hours, plasma can be frozen at -20°C or below and
tested within 30 days.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CS-5100, STAGO STA-R)
• Standard reagents for clotting tests (e.g., PT, APTT, fibrinogen,
thrombin time)
• Calibrators and controls
• Disposable pipettes
• Test tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Initial Testing
• Prothrombin Time (PT)
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the PT reagent and
equipment.
◦ Document the time it takes for the clot to form in seconds.
• Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT)
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the APTT reagent
and equipment.
◦ Document the time it takes for the clot to form in seconds.
• Thrombin Time (TT)
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the TT reagent and
equipment.
◦ Document the time it takes for the clot to form in seconds.
6.2. Confirmatory Testing (If Initial Tests Are Prolonged)
• Mixing Studies
◦ Mix equal volumes of patient plasma with normal pooled
plasma.
◦ Perform APTT and PT tests on the mixture.
◦ If the clotting time corrects to normal, consider factor
deficiency. If it does not, consider the presence of an inhibitor.
• Specific Factor Assays
◦ Perform specific factor assays based on initial PT and APTT
results (e.g., Factor VIII, IX, XI for APTT; Factor II, V, VII, X for
PT).
• Inhibitor Assays
◦ Perform tests for common inhibitors such as lupus
anticoagulant, Factor VIII inhibitors, and direct thrombin
inhibitors if initial clot time does not correct.
6.3. Additional Tests
• Fibrinogen Assay
◦ Measure fibrinogen levels to assess for hypofibrinogenemia.
• D-Dimer Test
◦ Perform D-Dimer testing to evaluate for disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• PT and APTT Normal, Both Prolonged
◦ Consider common pathway defects (e.g., dysfibrinogenemia,
liver disease, consumptive coagulopathy)
• Prolonged APTT, Normal PT
◦ Consider intrinsic pathway defects or presence of inhibitors
(e.g., hemophilia, Lupus anticoagulant)
• Normal APTT, Prolonged PT
◦ Consider extrinsic pathway defects (e.g., Factor VII deficiency)
• Interpret Results
◦ Evaluate results in the context of patient's clinical history for a
comprehensive interpretation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are within their calibration
dates and stored properly.
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift and
whenever a new reagent lot is used.
• Document all calibrations, controls, and maintenance activities in
the laboratory logs.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review results for consistency and accuracy.
• Report critical values to the clinician immediately, following the
laboratory’s protocol for critical result handling.
