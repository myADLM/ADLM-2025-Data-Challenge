Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Prolonged Clot Time Profile, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and responsibilities
involved in the analytical phase of generating results for Prolonged
Clot Time Profile using plasma specimens. This procedure ensures
accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results essential for patient
diagnosis and management.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the test, monitoring quality control, documenting results,
and taking corrective actions when necessary. Supervisors ensure
adherence to the SOP and response to identified deficiencies.
1. DEFINITIONS
Prolonged Clot Time Profile includes assays such as prothrombin
time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin
time (TT).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen type: Plasma
• Specimen container: Citrated blood collection tubes
• Collection volume: Adequate volume to perform all required tests
(typically 2.7 mL in a 3.2% sodium citrate tube)
• Specimen stability: Specimens are stable for up to 4 hours at
room temperature if uncentrifuged. If centrifuged and separated,
plasma is stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tubes filled inadequately or overfilled
• Hemolyzed, clotted, lipemic, or contaminated specimens
• Specimens collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes
B) Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the citrated blood tube at 1500-2000g for 10-15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Carefully transfer the plasma to a secondary tube if necessary,
avoiding any contact with the buffy coat.
C) Equipment and Reagents:
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500)
• PT reagents: Thromboplastin reagent
• aPTT reagents: Activated partial thromboplastin reagent and
calcium chloride
• TT reagents: Thrombin reagent
• Quality control materials: Commercially available normal and
abnormal control plasma
• Calibrations and maintenance: Follow manufacturer's
recommendations
D) Analytical Procedure:
1. Load plasma samples and quality control specimens according
to the analyzer's instructions.
2. Perform daily calibration checks, reagent verification, and
analyzer maintenance as specified by the manufacturer.
3. Conduct each assay as follows:
a. Prothrombin Time (PT):
• Mix thromboplastin reagent with plasma.
• Measure clot formation time.
b. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):
• Mix activated partial thromboplastin reagent with plasma.
• Add calcium chloride.
• Measure clot formation time.
c. Thrombin Time (TT):
• Mix thrombin reagent with plasma.
• Measure clot formation time.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift and
with each batch of patient specimens.
2. Document control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
3. If controls fail, troubleshoot according to manufacturer
guidelines and repeat tests as necessary.
F) Result Interpretation:
• Normal reference ranges: Refer to site-specific reference
intervals.
• Abnormal results: Repeat assays if clinically indicated and consult
with a supervisor.
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
G) Reporting Results:
• Verify all results against quality control parameters.
• Transmit verified results to the LIS for automated reporting.
• Ensure critical values are communicated to the physician
promptly according to site-specific guidelines.
H) Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
• Address any equipment malfunctions or reagent issues per
manufacturer instructions.
• Document and report any issues affecting test accuracy to the
supervisor.
I) Documentation:
• Record test data, calibration, quality control, and maintenance
logs.
• Ensure traceability of specimens, reagents, and results.
