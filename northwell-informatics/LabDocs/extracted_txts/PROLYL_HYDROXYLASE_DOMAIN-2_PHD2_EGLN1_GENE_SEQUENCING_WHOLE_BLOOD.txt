Standard Operating Procedure: PROLYL HYDROXYLASE
DOMAIN-2 (PHD2/EGLN1) GENE SEQUENCING, WHOLE BLOOD
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this standard operating procedure
(SOP) is to outline the analytical process for sequencing the Prolyl
Hydroxylase Domain-2 (PHD2/EGLN1) gene from whole blood
specimens. The protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results for detecting genetic variants in PHD2/EGLN1.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the
preparation, amplification, sequencing, and analysis of PHD2/EGLN1
gene sequencing from whole blood samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Staff: Responsible for following the SOP, performing
quality control checks, maintaining accurate records, and
reporting results.
• Supervisors: Ensure staff are trained on this SOP, oversee the
monitoring of performance, and address any deviations or issues.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA extraction kit (validated for whole blood)
• Qubit fluorometer or NanoDrop spectrophotometer
• PCR reagents (primers specific to PHD2/EGLN1, dNTPs, Taq
polymerase, buffers)
• Thermal cycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis system
• DNA sequencing kit (e.g., Illumina, Sanger sequencing)
• Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer)
• Analytical software for sequence data analysis (e.g., Integrative
Genomics Viewer (IGV), BLAST)
5. SPECIMEN RECEIPT AND PREPARATION
1. Specimen Integrity Check
◦ Verify specimen labeling: Check that the specimen is
properly labeled with patient information.
◦ Inspect for hemolysis or clots: Ensure specimen has no
signs of degradation.
2. DNA Extraction
◦ Use a validated DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a Qubit fluorometer or
NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
◦ Ensure a minimum concentration and purity appropriate for
downstream applications (typically, purity ratios of A260/
A280 between 1.8 and 2.0).
6. AMPLIFICATION OF PHD2/EGLN1 GENE TARGET REGIONS
1. PCR Amplification
◦ Prepare PCR reactions according to the manufacturer's
instructions with primers specific for the PHD2/EGLN1 gene.
◦ Run PCR in a thermal cycler with conditions optimized for
PHD2/EGLN1 amplification.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
2. Verification of PCR Products
◦ Perform agarose gel electrophoresis to verify the size and
integrity of PCR products.
◦ Document results and proceed only if the expected product
sizes are achieved.
7. DNA SEQUENCING
1. Preparation of Sequencing Libraries
◦ Purify PCR products using a suitable purification system
(e.g., magnetic beads, column-based purification).
◦ Quantify purified DNA and prepare sequencing libraries
according to the protocol of the chosen sequencing
platform.
2. Sequencing
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencer.
◦ Run the sequencing protocol as per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
8. DATA ANALYSIS
1. Raw Data Processing
◦ Use sequencing software to generate sequence reads.
◦ Perform quality control checks to assess read quality and
coverage.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling
◦ Align reads to the reference PHD2/EGLN1 gene sequence
using appropriate bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, Bowtie).
◦ Identify genetic variants through variant calling software
(e.g., GATK, VarScan).
3. Variant Annotation
◦ Annalyze detected variants using a variant annotation tool
(e.g., Annovar, SnpEff) for assessing potential impacts.
4. Interpretation of Results
◦ Interpret the significance of detected variants in the context
of relevant clinical and molecular data.
◦ Validate clinical relevance of any pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variants through literature review and database
consultation.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform routine quality control checks on reagents, instruments,
and data analysis.
• Troubleshoot any deviations from expected results (e.g., low-
quality reads, failed amplifications).
• Maintain detailed records and documentation for all performed
steps and results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Prepare a comprehensive laboratory report summarizing the
sequencing findings.
• Include detailed information on detected variants, their potential
impact, and clinical interpretations.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
technologist before reporting.
