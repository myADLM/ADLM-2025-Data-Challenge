LABORATORY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Promethazine (Phenergan)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the systematic procedure for
the accurate and reliable analytical determination of Promethazine
(Phenergan) levels in human plasma. This SOP ensures consistency,
reliability, and accuracy in generating and reporting results for
Promethazine.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all trained and qualified laboratory
personnel to adhere strictly to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure that all personnel
are adequately trained and that the procedures outlined in this
SOP are followed.
1. DEFINITION
Promethazine is a first-generation antihistamine with sedative and
antiemetic properties, commonly known by the brand name
Phenergan.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV/VIS detector.
• Analytical balance.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• pH meter.
3.2 Reagents and Chemicals:
• Promethazine hydrochloride reference standard.
• HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile, water).
• Buffer solution (pH 2.5).
• Internal standard (e.g., chlorpromazine).
3.3 Supplies:
• Plasma separator tubes (PST).
• HPLC columns suitable for Promethazine analysis.
• Auto-sampler vials.
• Syringe filters (0.22 μm).
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and samples are brought to room
temperature.
• Use plasma samples collected and prepared according to
standard venipuncture techniques.
• Aliquot 500 µL of plasma into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
• Add 50 µL of the internal standard to the plasma sample.
• Vortex-mix the sample for 30 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
4.2 Protein Precipitation:
• Add 1 mL of cold acetonitrile to the plasma sample to precipitate
proteins.
• Vortex-mix for 30 seconds.
• Centrifuge the mixture at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a new microcentrifuge
tube.
• Filter the supernatant through a 0.22 μm syringe filter into an
HPLC auto-sampler vial.
4.3 HPLC Analysis:
• Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer instructions.
• Equilibrate the system with the mobile phase (mixture of buffer
solution pH 2.5 and acetonitrile, 70:30 v/v).
• Inject 20 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system.
• Set the flow rate to 1.0 mL/min and the column temperature to
30°C.
• Detect Promethazine using a UV/VIS detector set at 254 nm.
• Run the sample along with Promethazine calibration standards to
construct a calibration curve.
4.4 Data Analysis:
• Quantify Promethazine concentrations in the plasma sample
using the calibration curve.
• Ensure that each run includes quality control samples (low,
medium, high concentration) to validate the analytical results.
• Review the chromatograms for peaks corresponding to both the
internal standard and Promethazine.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Calibration and Controls:
• Calibrate the HPLC system daily with Promethazine reference
standards.
• Use at least two control levels (low and high concentration) with
each batch of samples.
• Ensure that quality control results fall within acceptable limits prior
to reporting results.
5.2 Troubleshooting:
• If the internal standard or control results are out of range,
reanalyze the affected batch.
• Review the HPLC system performance and maintenance logs for
potential issues.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Data Validation:
• Validate the Promethazine sample results against the calibration
curve.
• Check for linearity, precision, and accuracy.
• Document any deviations or anomalies observed during analysis.
6.2 Result Entry:
• Enter the validated results into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Review and verify all results by a second technologist or
supervisor before final release.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Detection limits and quantification limits are determined based on
system sensitivity and sample matrix.
• Potential interferences from other medications or endogenous
substances should be considered.
• Follow manufacturer guidelines and analytical method validation
for any modifications to the procedure.
