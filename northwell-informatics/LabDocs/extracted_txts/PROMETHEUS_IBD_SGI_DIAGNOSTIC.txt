Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PROMETHEUS IBD SGI
Diagnostic
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed procedure for the
analytical phase in generating results for the PROMETHEUS IBD
SGI Diagnostic, ensuring accuracy and consistency in results
reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to adhere to
the guidelines set forth in this SOP when performing the
PROMETHEUS IBD SGI Diagnostic test. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the procedure and
addressing any issues or discrepancies that may arise during the
analytical phase.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Obtain freshly collected blood specimens in SST tubes for serum
preparation.
• Ensure that specimens are properly labeled with patient
identification details including name, date of birth, collection date,
and time.
• Centrifuge SST tubes at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum from blood cells.
• Transfer serum into appropriately labeled aliquots for analysis.
• Store serum aliquots at -20°C or lower until analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PROMETHEUS IBD SGI Diagnostic test kit
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• SST tubes
• Serum aliquot containers
• Temperature monitored refrigerators and freezers
• Traceable thermometers
• Data management system (LIS)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation for Analysis
1. Verify that the PROMETHEUS IBD SGI Diagnostic test kit has
not passed the expiration date.
2. Ensure that all reagents are at the required storage
temperature and have been brought to room temperature as
specified.
3. Perform routine maintenance checks on the automated
immunoassay analyzer to ensure it is functioning correctly.
B) Running the Test
1. Calibration: Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to
the manufacturer's instructions using calibration standards
provided in the test kit.
2. Quality Control: Run internal quality control samples at
specified intervals (beginning of the day, every 4 hours during
continuous operation, end of the day).
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load serum aliquots into the sample rack of the analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer using the PROMETHEUS IBD SGI
Diagnostic protocol.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the progress to ensure proper
function throughout the analytical cycle.
4. Troubleshooting: In case of an alarm or error, follow the
manufacturer's guidelines for troubleshooting and resolution.
Document any issue in the analyzer log.
6. DATA MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING
1. Result Verification:
◦ Review the output data for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Verify that internal quality control results are within
acceptable ranges. If QC fails, repeat analysis after taking
corrective actions.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter results into the LIS.
◦ Ensure data is correctly transmitted from the analyzer to the
LIS without alteration.
3. Result Approval:
◦ Perform a secondary verification of results.
◦ Tag abnormal or critical results for expedited review by the
supervising technologist.
4. Result Reporting:
◦ Report verified results in accordance with site-specific
guidelines.
◦ Communicate critical results immediately to the responsible
clinician as per the critical result reporting procedure.
◦ Provide remarks such as "No result due to interference"
when necessary based on analytical findings.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
A) Instrument Maintenance
• Perform scheduled maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer,
including cleaning and replacing parts as necessary.
• Document all maintenance activities in the instrument log.
B) Reagent and Control Validation
• Validate new batches of reagents and controls before use.
• Ensure traceability and proper storage of reagents in
temperature-monitored conditions.
C) External Quality Assurance
• Participate in proficiency testing programs.
• Compare results with reference laboratories periodically to ensure
consistency and accuracy.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the PROMETHEUS IBD SGI
Diagnostic test kit.
• Laboratory internal QC guidelines.
• Relevant medical and laboratory standards for diagnostic testing.
9. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
• Sample Stability: Serum samples analyzed within 48 hours of
collection are preferred.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples should not be used.
10. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in technology, regulations, and laboratory practices.
