Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PROMETHEUS LACTOTYPE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results using the PROMETHEUS LACTOTYPE test. This
test is used to identify lactate levels in patient specimens, ensuring
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: Designated staff will perform the analytical
procedures, monitor quality control, and document results as defined
in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff
follow the SOP accurately, including any necessary corrective
actions.
1. DEFINITION
PROMETHEUS LACTOTYPE is an analytical test used to measure
lactate levels in patient specimens. It specifically identifies and
quantifies lactate in various types of biological fluids.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• PROMETHEUS LACTOTYPE analyzer
• Lactate reagent kit
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high levels)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Specimen collection tubes (heparinized for blood samples)
• Laboratory timer
• Documentation logs and forms
Specimen Collection and Stability:
• Acceptable specimens include arterial, venous, and capillary
blood, collected into heparinized tubes.
• It is critical that specimens are transported to the laboratory
immediately after collection to prevent lactate degradation.
• Unacceptable specimens include hemolyzed, clotted, or expired
samples and samples collected in incorrect tubes.
Procedure:
1. Pre-Analytical Preparation a. Verify specimen identification
and ensure proper labeling. b. Inspect specimen integrity; reject
any unacceptable specimens. c. Ensure the LACTOTYPE
analyzer is calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Calibrating the Analyzer a. Perform necessary calibration
checks each day the analyzer is used. b. Use the calibration
solution provided within the lactate reagent kit. c. Document
calibration results in the appropriate log.
3. Quality Control a. Run quality control samples at three levels
(low, medium, high) at the beginning of each shift. b. Document
QC results, and ensure they fall within acceptable limits. c. If
QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the instrument and
reagent issues, repeat the QC tests, and document any
corrective actions taken.
4. Analytical Phase a. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10
minutes if necessary for plasma/serum separation. b. Using a
pipette, transfer the required volume of the sample into the
cuvette or sample container, following the PROMETHEUS
LACTOTYPE analyzer’s guidelines. c. Place the sample into
the analyzer and run the test as per the manufacturer's
instructions. d. Monitor the analysis, and ensure the analyzer
indicates the test has been completed successfully.
5. Post-Analytical Phase a. Review the generated results for any
flags or errors. b. Validate the results, ensuring they correlate
with the quality control and calibration data. c. Record results in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. Reporting Results a. Ensure results are delivered to the
requesting physician in an accurate and timely manner. b.
Critical results should be immediately communicated, following
the institution’s protocol for reporting critical values.
7. Troubleshooting and Maintenance a. Follow the
manufacturer’s instructions for daily, weekly, and monthly
maintenance of the analyzer. b. Document all maintenance
activities. c. In case of instrument error or failure, consult the
troubleshooting guide and contact technical support if required.

1. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Target Tolerance Limits:
• Lactate Normal Range: 0.5-2.2 mmol/L
Corrective Actions:
• If QC or calibration fails, the analyzer must not be used until the
issue is resolved and documented.
• For out-of-range patient results, re-run the test or request a new
specimen before reporting.
Staff Training:
• All staff performing this test must be trained and competency-
assessed at regular intervals, documented in the staff training log.
Documentation:
• Record all quality control, calibration, and test results in the
respective logs.
• Maintain proper documentation of any corrective actions and
instrument maintenance.
By following this SOP, we aim to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and
timely delivery of PROMETHEUS LACTOTYPE test results,
supporting high-quality patient care.
