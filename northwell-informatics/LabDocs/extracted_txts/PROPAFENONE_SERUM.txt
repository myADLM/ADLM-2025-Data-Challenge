Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PROPAFENONE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of
Propafenone levels in serum samples, following standard
laboratory procedures from sample preparation to result
generation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this SOP from the point of sample preparation until the
results are generated and reported.
1. SPECIMEN 2.1 Collection:
• Preferred specimen: Serum (collected using a serum separator
tube or plain red-top tube).
• Ensure the blood sample is allowed to clot completely before
centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the sample to separate serum within 2 hours of
collection.
2.2 Handling and Storage:
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within
48 hours.
• If delayed beyond 48 hours, store at -20°C.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or LC-
MS/MS
• Propafenone reference standard
• Calibration standards and quality control (QC) materials
• Mobile phase reagents
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes or plain red-top tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Sample vials
1. PROCEDURE 4.1 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Prepare calibration curves using known concentrations of
Propafenone.
• Include a minimum of six calibration points covering the expected
concentration range.
• Run QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations to
ensure assay accuracy and precision.
4.2 Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix gently.
• Pipet 0.5 mL of serum into a new centrifuge tube.
• Add an internal standard (if applicable) and extraction solvent.
• Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
• Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the phases.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial for analysis.
4.3 HPLC or LC-MS/MS Analysis:
• Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system following the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Inject the prepared serum sample into the system.
• Run the sample using the validated chromatographic conditions
for Propafenone.
• Record the retention time and peak area for Propafenone.
4.4 Data Analysis and Result Calculation:
• Generate the calibration curve by plotting peak area versus
concentration for the calibration standards.
• Calculate the concentration of Propafenone in the serum sample
using the calibration curve.
• Ensure that QC samples fall within the acceptable range before
accepting the results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the Propafenone concentration into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
• Ensure that results are within the expected clinical range.
• Add any necessary comments or notes regarding sample integrity,
potential interferences, or QC performance.
• Ensure the final results are reviewed and approved by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples with every batch of patient samples.
• Perform instrument calibration checks and maintenance as
required.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the accurate
measurement of Propafenone.
• Confirm any unexpected results by re-analysis or repeat sampling
if indicated.
• Ensure all reagents and instruments are within their calibration
dates and specifications.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
• Published method validation studies for Propafenone analysis in
clinical laboratories.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of sample preparation, analysis, QC results,
instrument maintenance, and calibration logs.
• Archive chromatograms and raw data securely as per laboratory
policy.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all specimens and chemicals following standard biosafety
and chemical safety guidelines.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required, including
gloves, lab coats, and eye protection.
