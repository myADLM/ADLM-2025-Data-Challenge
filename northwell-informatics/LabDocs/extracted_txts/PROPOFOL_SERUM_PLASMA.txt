STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Propofol
(Serum/Plasma)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of processing and
generating results for Propofol in serum/plasma samples in the
laboratory. This includes preparation, analysis, documentation, and
reporting of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in the analytical
phase of Propofol testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for ensuring all
steps of the analytical process are followed meticulously to generate
accurate and reliable Propofol results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in a sodium
heparin or lithium heparin tube.
• Volume: Minimum 2 ml.
• Stability: Serum/plasma must be processed within 24 hours of
collection. If not possible, specimens should be stored at -20°C
and be stable for up to 7 days. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instrument: Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC).
• Propofol calibration standards and controls.
• Mobile phase reagents suitable for the chosen analytical method.
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., vials, pipettes).
• Traceable thermometers for maintaining equipment temperature.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Equipment and Reagents:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and deemed functional before
use.
• Prepare mobile phase and standards as per manufacturer
instructions.
• Verify the temperature of refrigerators and freezers used for
reagent and specimen storage, recorded in the Temperature
Monitoring Log.
Specimen Preparation:
• Centrifuge serum/plasma specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the supernatant.
• Transfer supernatant into a clean vial for analysis.
• If stored frozen, thaw specimens to room temperature before
analysis.
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the analytical instrument using Propofol calibration
standards ranging from 0.1 to 10 μg/mL.
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) to validate the system accuracy and precision
before running patient samples.
• Document all calibration and QC results in the appropriate log.
Analysis:
• Inject samples into the LC-MS/MS or HPLC system following
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure all samples are analyzed in duplicate for accuracy.
• Monitor instrument performance and detect any errors or
anomalies during the run.
Data Collection and Documentation:
• Record all raw data and chromatograms for each sample.
• Calculate the concentration of Propofol in each sample based on
the calibration curve.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information Management System
(LIMS).
Troubleshooting:
• If any issues arise, such as unexpected chromatograms or
instrument alarms, follow troubleshooting guides provided by the
instrument manufacturer.
• Verify sample integrity and recalibrate if necessary.
• If unresolved, notify the supervisor and document the issue.
Reporting Results:
• Review and verify all results for accuracy.
• Document results in patient records and LIMS.
• Report any critical results following laboratory procedure for
Propofol testing.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform intralab quality control every week by comparing results
with known standards.
• Validate each new reagent lot or calibration standard by
comparing with previous lots.
• Track performance trends over time and take corrective actions if
deviations are observed.
8. SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all specimens and reagents using proper PPE.
• Ensure waste disposal follows laboratory protocols and
environmental regulations for chemical disposal.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• Review this SOP every 12 months or when significant changes
occur in the analytical method.
• Amendments will be made by the quality assurance team and
approved by the laboratory director.
