Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) Levels in Biological Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the standardized protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)
levels in biological samples, such as plasma or serum. This
procedure ensures accuracy, consistency, and reproducibility of
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing PGD2 analysis in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis as described in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained on
this procedure and for monitoring adherence to the protocol.
• Quality assurance personnel are responsible for reviewing the
data and ensuring that all quality control measures are met.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a UV
detector
• PGD2 ELISA Kit
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated sample storage
• Micropipettes and tips
• Reagent grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water)
• PGD2 standard stock solution
• Sample collection tubes (e.g., EDTA tubes for plasma or serum-
separator tubes)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. DEFINITION
Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is a bioactive lipid involved in various
physiological and pathological processes. It is produced by mast cells
and is measured as an indicator of allergic reactions, inflammation,
and other diseases.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimens: Plasma or serum
◦ Preferred: 5 mL blood collected in EDTA tubes, processed
within 1 hour of collection
◦ Acceptable: 5 mL blood collected in serum-separator tubes,
processed within 2 hours of collection
• Stability:
◦ Processed plasma or serum samples can be stored at -80°C
for up to 6 months.
◦ Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Pre-Analysis
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw stored samples at 4°C overnight or at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
2. Reagent Preparation
◦ Prepare all reagents and standards as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Dilute the PGD2 standard stock solution to prepare a
calibration curve.
7.2 Analysis
1. HPLC Preparation and Setup
◦ Prepare the HPLC system by flushing the column with
acetonitrile followed by water.
◦ Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase (e.g., 60%
acetonitrile:40% water).
◦ Set the UV detector to the appropriate wavelength for PGD2
(e.g., 195 nm).
2. Sample Injection
◦ Inject 20 µL of each standard, control, and sample into the
HPLC system.
◦ Run the HPLC program according to the standard operating
procedures for the chromatography system.
3. Measurement
◦ Record retention times and peak areas for each injection.
◦ Generate a calibration curve using the PGD2 standards for
quantification of unknown samples.
7.3 Quality Control
• Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end of
each analytical batch.
• Verify that QC results fall within the established acceptance
criteria.
• If any QC sample fails to meet criteria, investigate and resolve the
issue before proceeding with sample analysis.
7.4 Data Analysis
1. Calculation of Results
◦ Use the calibration curve to quantify the PGD2
concentration in each sample.
◦ Perform necessary calculations and conversions to report
results in appropriate units (e.g., pg/mL).
2. Review and Verification
◦ Review all generated data for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Verify results according to laboratory protocols before
reporting.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for PGD2 may vary based on the population
and clinical context. Consult the specific reference ranges
established by the laboratory.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Conduct quality control procedures as outlined in the SOP,
including the use of external proficiency testing when available.
• Maintain records of all quality control activities and results.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Always wear appropriate PPE when handling biological
specimens and reagents.
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols to prevent exposure to
hazardous materials.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the PGD2 ELISA Kit
• Standard laboratory references and operational manuals for
HPLC systems
• Relevant scientific literature on the clinical significance of PGD2
13. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes to the SOP with details of revisions and
effective dates.
This SOP ensures the reliable and accurate determination of PGD2
levels in biological samples, maintaining quality standards in the
analytical phase of clinical testing.
