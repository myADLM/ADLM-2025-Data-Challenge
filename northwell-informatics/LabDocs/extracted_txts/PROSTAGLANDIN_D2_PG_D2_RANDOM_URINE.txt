Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Prostaglandin D2 (PG D2), Random Urine Results
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate
and consistent handling, analysis, and documentation of
Prostaglandin D2 (PG D2) in random urine samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel trained in this procedure to perform the analysis of
PG D2 according to the established protocol. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff adhere to
this SOP and for addressing any issues or discrepancies that
arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING 3.1. Specimen
Collection: - Collect random urine in a clean, sterile container
without preservatives. - A minimum volume of 10 mL is required
for the analysis. - Label the container with patient identification,
date, and time of collection.
3.2. Specimen Storage: - Store the urine sample at 2-8°C if
analysis is to be performed within 24 hours. - For specimens
that need to be stored longer than 24 hours, freeze at -20°C or
lower and avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS 4.1. Equipment: - High-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) equipment. - Centrifuge - Vortex
mixer - Calibrated micropipettes and tips - Refrigerator (2-8°C) -
Freezer (-20°C or lower)
4.2. Reagents: - Prostaglandin D2 ELISA kit or HPLC reagents
as specified by the manufacturer. - Calibration standards for PG
D2 - Quality control materials for PG D2
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Sample Preparation: - Thaw frozen samples at room
temperature and mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer. -
Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter. - Aliquot the supernatant for analysis.
5.2. Calibration and Quality Control: - Prepare calibration
standards according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - Run
quality control samples at both low and high PG D2
concentrations to ensure assay accuracy and precision. -
Document results of calibration and quality control runs before
proceeding with patient samples.
5.3. Analytical Procedure Using HPLC: a) Set up the HPLC
system according to the manufacturer’s instructions and ensure
it is properly calibrated. b) Inject the prepared sample aliquots
into the HPLC system. c) Follow the method-specific
chromatographic conditions (e.g., column type, mobile phase,
flow rate, detection wavelength). d) Record the retention time
and peak area. e) Quantify PG D2 concentration using the
calibration curve.
5.4. Analytical Procedure Using ELISA: a) Follow the specific
instructions provided in the ELISA kit. b) Add standards,
controls, and urine samples to the respective wells. c) Perform
the incubation and washing steps as specified. d) Add the
substrate solution and allow the color to develop. e) Measure
the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using a
microplate reader. f) Calculate the sample concentrations from
the standard curve.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Verify all results from the analytical procedure.
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Reference values: Provide interpretation based on
established laboratory reference ranges for PG D2.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples with every batch of patient
samples.
◦ Document all deviations, instrument performance checks,
and maintenance logs.
◦ Review quality control data regularly to identify trends or
issues.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If calibration fails or quality control results are outside
acceptable limits, investigate potential sources of error (e.g.,
reagent integrity, instrument performance).
◦ Recalibrate the instrument and re-run quality controls before
proceeding with patient samples.
◦ Document and report any corrective actions taken.
