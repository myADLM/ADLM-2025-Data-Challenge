STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)
diagnostic, serum. This SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results using appropriate instrumentation and
methodologies.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the analysis of PSA levels in serum samples. It covers the steps
from sample preparation, through measurement, to the
documentation of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff: Perform PSA testing according to this
SOP.
• Supervisory staff: Ensure the adherence to this SOP and address
any technical issues.
• Laboratory director: Oversee the overall compliance with testing
and validate the analytical procedures.
4. DEFINITIONS PSA: Prostate-Specific Antigen, a protein produced
by cells of the prostate gland, measured in blood to help diagnose
and monitor prostate conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Reagents:
• PSA assay reagent kits (specific to the analyzer being used)
• Quality control materials at multiple levels (normal and abnormal
controls)
Equipment:
• Auto-analyzer specific to PSA testing (e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott
Architect, etc.)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower for long-term storage)
Supplies:
• Calibrated serum separator tubes (SST, gold top)
• Sample cups or tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE, such as gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
• Ensure samples are properly accessioned and labeled.
• Use SST to collect blood and allow it to clot for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
• Centrifuge the tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
• Carefully separate the serum without disturbing the cell layer.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis will occur within 24 hours,
otherwise store at -20°C or below for long-term storage.
6.2. Instrument Preparation
• Turn on the analyzer and allow it to warm up according to
manufacturer’s specifications.
• Ensure all reagents and consumables are adequately stocked
and within the expiration date.
• Perform daily maintenance and calibration as required by the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run start-up quality control tests and ensure all control results are
within acceptable ranges before starting patient sample analysis.
6.3. Assay Procedure
• Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and quality
controls onto the analyzer.
• Select the PSA assay from the analyzer menu.
• Verify that the correct sample positions are identified in the
analyzer software.
• Start the assay run and monitor the analyzer for any errors or
alerts.
6.4. Quality Control and Calibration
• Include at least two levels of quality control materials with each
batch of samples.
• Review quality control results to ensure they fall within the
acceptable ranges.
• Document any corrective actions taken if quality control results
are outside acceptable limits.
• Perform recalibration of the assay if required, and recheck quality
controls following any adjustments.
6.5. Result Generation and Review
• Upon completion of the assay, download the results from the
analyzer.
• Review the data for any flags or errors, and repeat tests if
necessary.
• Check that patient results fall within the instrument’s reportable
range; dilute and reanalyze samples if necessary.
• Verify and validate results before reporting.
6.6. Reporting Results
• Enter validated results into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Flag and notify the healthcare provider automatically for critical
PSA results per laboratory protocol.
• Archive the printed result sheets as backup records.
7. REPORTING PARAMETERS
• Reference Interval: Typically, the reference range for PSA is less
than 4.0 ng/mL. Specific ranges may vary based on demographic
factors such as age.
• Critical Limits: Consult laboratory-specific guidelines to determine
critical values and appropriate action steps.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly handled specimens can affect
PSA results.
• Cross-reactivity or interference from other substances (e.g.,
rheumatoid factor) should be noted and assessed.
• Analytical performance may vary with different assay kits; refer to
the manufacturer's package insert for specific limitations.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Assay Kit Insert for PSA
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guidelines
• Relevant peer-reviewed clinical journals on PSA testing
10. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all quality control and calibration data.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and maintenance
performed on the analyzer.
• Ensure that all patient results and quality control logs are retained
according to laboratory retention policies.
This SOP is to be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
incorporate any changes in technology or clinical guidelines.
