Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Prostate-Specific
Antigen (PSA) Screening
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable analytical processing of Prostate-
Specific Antigen (PSA) samples within the laboratory, ensuring
adherence to quality control measures, standardized procedures, and
timely reporting of results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel performing PSA analysis should be trained and
competent in the operation of designated PSA analyzer and should
adhere to all outlined procedures. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to the protocols and addressing any issues or
deviations from the prescribed procedures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PSA Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411, Abbott Architect
i2000SR)
• PSA Calibrators and Controls
• Patient Samples (Serum or Plasma)
• Reagent Packs specific to PSA Assay
• Quality Control Materials (e.g., BioRad Liquichek Immunoassay
Plus)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Tips
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum or plasma
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood in an appropriate tube (serum separator tube or
plasma tubes with EDTA or heparin).
• Avoid hemolysis during collection.
Handling and Stability:
• Centrifuge and separate serum or plasma within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store separated serum or plasma at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48
hours; for longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not properly labeled or without a collection date/time.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and quality control materials to
reach room temperature.
2. Verify that the PSA Analyzer is properly calibrated and that
maintenance and performance checks have been conducted as
per manufacturer's guidelines.
B) Calibration
1. Perform calibration using PSA Calibrators as per the analyzer's
instructions.
2. Document calibration details, including date, time, lot numbers,
and results.
C) Quality Control
1. Run internal quality control (QC) samples at the start of each
day, before patient sample batches, and after any major
maintenance or calibration activities.
2. Use at least two levels of control (normal and elevated).
3. Document QC results, and review for acceptability. Investigate
and resolve any QC failures before testing patient samples.
D) Sample Analysis
1. Load patient samples onto the PSA Analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Input patient identification information into the analyzer.
3. Ensure minimal delay between loading samples and initiating
the run to prevent sample degradation.
4. Once the run starts, the analyzer will perform the immunoassay
and produce PSA results.
E) Post-Analysis
1. Review the results for each sample, paying attention to any
flags or error messages from the analyzer.
2. Troubleshoot flagged results according to the analyzer's
manual, which may include rerunning the sample, checking for
clots, or verifying sample integrity.
3. If results are within the acceptable range, proceed to result
verification.
4. RESULT VERIFICATION AND REPORTING
5. Compare PSA results against reference intervals (may vary
depending on patient age and laboratory standards):
◦ Generally, <4.0 ng/mL is considered within the normal
range.
6. Results outside the normal range should be reviewed closely,
and if necessary, the sample may need to be rerun for
confirmation, especially extremely high or low values.
7. Document all results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Ensure results are electronically transmitted or manually
entered without transcription errors.
8. In instances of critical results, as defined by the laboratory’s
critical value policy, immediately notify the ordering physician
and document the communication.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the PSA Analyzer's manual and reagent package insert
for specific assay limitations.
• Certain medications, therapies, or conditions (e.g., recent prostate
manipulation, prostatitis) may affect PSA levels and interpretation.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
• Participate in proficiency testing if available.
• Regularly review and update the SOP to reflect changes in
technology or best practices.
• Conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the SOP and
improve areas where discrepancies are noted.
