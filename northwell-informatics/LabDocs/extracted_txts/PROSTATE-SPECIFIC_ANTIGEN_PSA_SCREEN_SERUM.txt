Protocol for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Screen, Serum
1. Purpose
This procedure outlines the analytical steps required to accurately
measure and report Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels.
PSA testing is crucial for the screening and monitoring of prostate
health, including the early detection of prostate cancer. This protocol
ensures standardization and consistency across all analyses.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel trained in PSA testing protocols are
responsible for performing the PSA assay, ensuring accuracy, and
documenting all actions required by this procedure. Any deviations or
issues encountered should be reported to supervisors immediately.
1. Specimen
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum obtained from a blood sample drawn into a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume:
◦ A minimum volume of 2 mL of serum is required.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Analyzer:
◦ Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) Analyzer or an
equivalent FDA-approved automated immunoassay system.
• Reagents:
◦ Manufacturer-specific PSA assay reagents.
▪ Calibrators and control materials specific to the PSA assay.
• Supplies:
◦ Red-top or SST tubes for blood collection.
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips.
◦ Sample cups or tubes compatible with the analyzer.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE) for all personnel.
1. Procedure
A. Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Ensure that the serum sample is appropriately labeled with
patient identification and collection time.
2. Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
3. Transfer the serum into a secondary tube if necessary, ensuring
no cell contamination.
B. Analytical Steps:
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
prior to use.
◦ Ensure that the analyzer is properly calibrated and quality
control (QC) has been performed for the day.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated areas of the analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for programming the
analyzer for the PSA assay.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the run on the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ The analyzer will perform steps, including incubation,
washing, reacting with the PSA-specific antibody, and signal
measurement.
4. Result Generation:
◦ Once the assay is completed, results are automatically
generated and transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
C. Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Review of Results:
◦ Review all patient results for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Ensure that all QC results are within acceptable limits before
verifying patient results.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Transmit verified results from the LIS to the Electronic
Health Record (EHR) system.
◦ Notify the relevant healthcare provider of any critical PSA
values (reference critical value policy).
3. Documentation:
◦ Document all assay runs, including QC, any deviations, and
troubleshooting steps taken.
4. Quality Control
• Run controls at multiple levels (e.g., low, medium, high) provided
by the manufacturer or validated third-party controls.
• Perform QC checks according to the laboratory’s QC policy and
the manufacturer's recommendations (typically with each assay
run, or daily).
• Document results in the QC log, investigating and resolving any
out-of-range results before processing patient samples.
1. Reference Intervals
The normal range for PSA may vary depending on the assay used:
• Generally, a PSA level less than 4.0 ng/mL is considered normal.
1. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples may interfere
with the assay.
• High doses of biotin (>5 mg) may interfere with some
immunoassays. Patients should discontinue biotin intake at least
48 hours before the test.

optimal and standardized conditions to achieve reliable, accurate
results that support appropriate clinical decision-making.
