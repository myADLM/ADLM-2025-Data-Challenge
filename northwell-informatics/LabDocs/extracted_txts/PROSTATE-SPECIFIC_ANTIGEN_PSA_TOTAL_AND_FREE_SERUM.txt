STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR PROSTATE-
SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA), TOTAL AND FREE, SERUM
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a comprehensive guide for the
analytical phase of generating results for Prostate-Specific Antigen
(PSA), both total and free, in serum. This document outlines the
procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of PSA
measurements, which are critical for the diagnosis and management
of prostate conditions.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP when performing PSA assays. Supervisors must ensure
compliance with the SOP and address any issues that may arise
during the analytical process.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum: Collect blood in a plain, red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes but no longer
than 1 hour at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum.
• Sample Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 5 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C): Stable for 6 months
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Abbott Architect)
• PSA Total and Free Reagent Kits
• Controls and Calibration Materials
• Micropipettes and Tips
• Centrifuge
• Serological Pipettes or Transfer Pipettes
• Timer
1. Reagents Preparation
• Reconstitute and prepare all reagents, controls, and calibrators as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Store reagents as specified by the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
• Label reagents with the date of preparation and expiration.
1. Quality Control
• Run quality control (QC) samples at multiple levels (e.g., normal
and elevated) along with patient samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken if QC
results are out of range.
• QC materials should be stable unopened till the manufacturer’s
expiry date, and opened controls are stable for 30 days at 2-8°C.
1. Calibration
• Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s instructions
before the initial run, after reagent lot changes, and after any
significant maintenance.
• Use the calibrators provided with the reagent kits.
• Document calibration results and ensure they meet the criteria
before proceeding with the analysis.
1. Procedure
A. Analyzer Preparation:
• Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform daily start-up
procedures as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Load reagents, QC materials, and calibrators on the analyzer.
• Check the analyzer for any error messages or maintenance
requirements.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Label tubes appropriately and ensure proper identification.
• Aliquot the serum from clot tubes to appropriately labeled
secondary tubes.
• All serum samples should be free from hemolysis, lipemia, and
icterus.
C. Assay Procedure:
• Load patient samples onto the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Select the appropriate assay program for total and free PSA.
• Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer for any troubleshooting
messages.
D. Result Interpretation:
• Review results for any error codes or flags.
• Compare patient sample results to relevant clinical decision limits,
ensuring that flagged results are appropriately investigated.
1. Reference Intervals
• Total PSA: < 4.0 ng/mL
• Free PSA:
◦ < 10% free PSA: High risk of prostate cancer
◦ 10-25% free PSA: Borderline, refer to clinical judgement
◦ > 25% free PSA: Low risk of prostate cancer
1. Reporting Results
• Verify and enter patient results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Ensure abnormal/critical results are communicated promptly to
the requestor/physician and documented as per laboratory policy.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for any additional
instructions on reporting critical values.
1. Quality Assurance
• Participate in external proficiency testing for PSA assays.
• Regularly review QC data trends and take appropriate actions to
maintain analytical performance.
• Train and assess personnel competency periodically.
1. Method Limitations
• High dose hook effect: In extremely high PSA concentrations, the
measured result may be falsely low.
• Heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and other factors may
interfere with results.
1. Troubleshooting
• Refer to the analyzer’s manual for troubleshooting error
messages.
• If technical issues persist, contact the manufacturer's technical
support.
