Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Ultrasensitive, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To detail the standardized method for the measurement of
ultrasensitive Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in serum samples
using a validated analytical method. This protocol aims to ensure
accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of the PSA test results.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
the PSA Ultrasensitive test, documenting all pertinent information,
and ensuring that all procedures are followed as outlined in this
protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Ultrasensitive is a blood test that
measures the concentration of PSA, a glycoprotein produced by
prostate cells, to monitor prostate health, especially in men with
prostate cancer.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable: Serum obtained from venous blood
samples.
◦ Use red-top or serum separator tubes (SST).
◦ The specimen should be allowed to clot at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge to separate serum from the cells within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Aliquot the serum if not tested immediately and store it at
2-8°C for up to 48 hours or at -20°C for longer storage.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes like EDTA,
heparin, or sodium citrate.
◦ Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
◦ Samples received with improper labeling (no patient
identification, collection date/time, or test requisition).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Calibrated analytical instrument capable of detecting PSA
ultrasensitive (e.g., chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzer)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Refrigerated storage for reagents and samples
• Reagents and calibrators:
◦ PSA Ultrasensitive test kits
◦ Quality control (QC) materials with high and low PSA
concentrations
• Supplies:
◦ Red-top or serum separator collection tubes
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Biohazard disposal containers
◦ Labels
1. PROCEDURE
• Preparation:
◦ Check the instrument and ensure it is calibrated and ready for
use.
◦ Allow reagents and calibrators to reach room temperature if
stored refrigerated.
◦ Ensure quality control materials are within the expiration date
and prepare them as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Sample Handling:
◦ Ensure that serum samples are free from hemolysis, icterus,
and lipemia.
◦ Aliquot serum to the appropriate test tube and label correctly.
◦ Load the sample, with accompanying QC materials, on the
analytical instrument.
• Procedure Steps:
1. Start the PSA Ultrasensitive test on the instrument.
2. Follow the instrument-specific protocol for loading samples,
calibrators, and QC materials.
3. Initiate the test run as per the instrument's instructions.
• Quality Control:
◦ Perform QC checks:
▪ Run high and low PSA concentration controls with each
batch of tests.
▪ Ensure QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
accepting patient results.
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log.
◦ If QC results are out of acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
following instrument guidelines and rerun QC before testing
patient samples.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Result Calculation:
◦ The instrument will automatically calculate and display the
PSA concentration for each sample.
◦ Reference ranges will be provided by the test kit insert
(typically <0.1 ng/mL for ultrasensitive PSA).
• Documentation:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Verify results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Flag critical values as per lab guidelines and promptly inform
the healthcare provider.
• Result Reporting:
◦ Print results and include the following details:
▪ Patient identification
▪ Sample collection date/time
▪ PSA ultrasensitive concentration
▪ Reference range
▪ Reporting technologist's initials
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Ultrasensitive PSA: <0.1 ng/mL
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on the analytical instrument as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) programs for
PSA testing.
• Regularly review QC logs and maintenance records to identify
and resolve any recurring issues.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the instrument reports error messages, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the instrument's user manual.
• Repeat testing if sample integrity is compromised or if QC results
are out of range.
• Contact the supervisor or the instrument manufacturer's technical
support for unresolved issues.
