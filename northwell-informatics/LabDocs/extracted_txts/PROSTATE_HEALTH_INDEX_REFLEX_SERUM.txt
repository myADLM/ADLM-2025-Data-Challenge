STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR PROSTATE
HEALTH INDEX REFLEX, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for Prostate Health Index (PHI)
Reflex testing using serum specimens. This protocol ensures
accurate, efficient, and standardized testing to support clinical
decision-making.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical testing as defined in this procedure, ensuring adherence to
quality control measures, and documenting results according to
laboratory standards.
1. DEFINITION
Prostate Health Index (PHI) is a test designed to improve specificity
in detecting prostate cancer. It combines three markers: total
Prostate-Specific Antigen (tPSA), free Prostate-Specific Antigen
(fPSA), and [-2] proPSA (p2PSA).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen: Preferred: Serum Volume: Minimum 1 mL serum
Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) and allowed to clot. Samples must be centrifuged within 30
minutes to obtain serum. Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C and
ensure analysis within 24 hours of collection. If storing longer than 24
hours, freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in non-serum tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate).
• Samples that have been stored incorrectly or beyond suitable
stability limits.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (specific model used in the
laboratory)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators and Freezers (storage of reagents and samples)
Reagents:
• PHI Test Kit reagent containing tPSA, fPSA, and p2PSA detection
reagents
• Calibrators and Controls for PHI test
Supplies:
• Pipettes and Tips
• SST tubes
• Labels and Barcodes
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen meets acceptable criteria.
2. Label the specimen appropriately with barcode and patient
details.
3. Centrifuge SST tubes at 2000-3000 RPM for 10-15 minutes.
4. Extract serum and transfer into labeled sample cups for
analysis.
B) Instrument Setup:
1. Perform daily maintenance checks of the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Ensure sufficient reagents, calibrators, and controls are loaded
into the analyzer.
3. Perform calibration and internal quality control checks before
running patient samples (refer to specific guidelines for
instrument calibration and QC passes).
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Load serum sample cups onto the analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Run the PHI test as programmed on the analyzer.
3. Monitor the analyzer to ensure the test is completed without
interruption or error.
4. Ensure all results pass QC before proceeding to analysis
verification.
D) Result Verification:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Apply any necessary manual adjustments or troubleshooting for
flagged results.
3. Verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Ensure transmission of verified results to the LIS for
subsequent review by the clinician.
E) Reporting:
• Results will include values for tPSA, fPSA, p2PSA, and the
calculated PHI score.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for uploading results to
clinical databases.
• Report critical values or any discrepancies to the attending
clinician immediately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
• Two levels of control material should be run daily (low and high).
• Ensure controls are within acceptable limits before testing patient
samples.
Troubleshooting:
• If QC fails, follow instrument-specific troubleshooting guide.
• Repeat analysis with fresh controls.
• Document any corrective actions taken.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Document all sample preparation, instrument maintenance,
calibrations, QC results, and patient sample results in the LIS
according to laboratory protocol.
