STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR PROSTATE
SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the immunostaining of Prostate Specific
Antigen (PSA) in tissue sections. This SOP provides detailed
instructions on the technical aspects of the procedure up to the
generation of stained slides for pathologist review.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying
out this procedure according to the SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory manager to ensure all
personnel are adequately trained on this SOP and that it is
adhered to rigorously.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC): A laboratory technique used to
visualize the presence and localization of specific antigens in
tissue sections by utilizing antigen-antibody interactions.
• PSA: Prostate-Specific Antigen, an enzyme produced by the
prostate, which can be detected in prostate tissue cells.
1. PROCEDURE
A. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
1. Primary Antibody:
◦ Anti-PSA Antibody
◦ Store at 2-8°C, do not freeze.
2. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Appropriate secondary antibody (conjugated with a
detection enzyme like horseradish peroxidase)
◦ Store at 2-8°C.
3. Detection System:
◦ DAB substrate (Diaminobenzidine)
◦ Store as per manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Counterstain:
◦ Hematoxylin
5. Wash Buffers:
◦ Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or Tris-Buffered Saline
(TBS)
6. Mounting Medium
7. General Laboratory Supplies:
◦ Glass slides
◦ Coverslips
◦ Humidity Chamber
◦ Slide rack
B. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections, 3-5
microns thick.
C. PROCEDURE STEPS
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Deparaffinize tissue sections by incubating in a series of
xylenes (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate tissue sections through a graded series of
ethanol (100%, 95%, 85%, 70%; 2 minutes each).
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) by immersing
slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or other appropriate buffer
and heating (typically in a microwave, pressure cooker, or
water bath) according to established laboratory guidelines.
3. Blocking:
◦ Incubate the tissue sections with a protein blocking solution
(such as 5% normal serum from the species in which the
secondary antibody was raised) for 20 minutes to block non-
specific binding sites.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply primary anti-PSA antibody to the tissue sections.
◦ Incubate in a humidity chamber for 60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C, as per antibody
manufacturer's instructions.
5. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides in multiple changes of PBS or TBS (3 changes,
5 minutes each) to remove unbound primary antibody.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody to the tissue sections.
◦ Incubate in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
7. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides in multiple changes of PBS or TBS (3 changes,
5 minutes each) to remove unbound secondary antibody.
8. Detection:
◦ Develop color using DAB substrate solution.
◦ Incubate until the desired staining intensity is achieved,
usually 5-10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
9. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain the tissue sections with hematoxylin.
◦ Wash in running tap water to remove excess stain.
10. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate tissue sections through a series of ethanols
(70%, 85%, 95%, 100%; 2 changes of each).
◦ Clear in xylene (2 changes, 3 minutes each).
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
D. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide with every batch of staining to
ensure proper staining technique.
• Run a negative control without primary antibody to ensure
specificity of staining.
• Document all staining procedures, including any deviations from
the SOP.
E. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak/No Staining: Verify antibody lot number, concentration, and
incubation times. Check the antigen retrieval method and ensure
proper reagent storage.
• Non-specific Staining: Optimize blocking steps, review secondary
antibody specificity, and ensure thorough washing steps.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Once staining is complete, generate stained slides and submit
them for pathologist review.
• Ensure all slides are accurately labeled with the specimen
identifier and the date of staining.
