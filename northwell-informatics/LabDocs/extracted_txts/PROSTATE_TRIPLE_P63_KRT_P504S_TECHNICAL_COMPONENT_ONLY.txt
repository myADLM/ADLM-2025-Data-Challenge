** Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generation of Results for Prostate Triple (P63/KRT/P504S),
Technical Component Only **
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely analysis of Prostate Triple stains
(P63/KRT/P504S) for the purpose of diagnosing prostate cancer and
other prostate-related disorders. This SOP covers procedures for the
analytical phase, focusing on the technical components only.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all technical personnel involved in the
processing, staining, and analysis of Prostate Triple (P63/KRT/
P504S) immunohistochemistry slides in a CLIA-certified pathology
laboratory. This assumes specimens have been received,
accessioned, and appropriately prepared.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Technical staff members are responsible for the preparation,
staining, and analysis of samples as per the outlined procedures.
• Supervisors must ensure compliance with this SOP and address
any procedural deviations or instrument issues.
• All personnel must document activities related to the analysis on
laboratory log sheets and the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
1. DEFINITIONS
• Prostate Triple (P63/KRT/P504S): A combination of
immunostains used to differentiate benign and malignant prostatic
tissue and assist in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
◦ P63: A marker expressed in basal cells, typically negative in
malignant glands.
◦ KRT (Keratin 34βE12): A high molecular weight cytokeratin
expressed in basal cells, typically negative in malignant cells.
◦ P504S (Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, AMACR): A
marker commonly expressed in prostate cancer.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Immunostaining workstation (Automated IHC stainer)
• Prostate Triple antibodies (P63, KRT, P504S) and appropriate
detection systems
• Mounting medium
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Xylene, Ethanol, and other necessary reagents for dehydration
and clearing
• Positive and negative control slides
• Quality Control (QC) materials
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Slides
1. Sectioning
◦ Cut formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
at 4-micron thickness using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged glass slides.
◦ Allow slides to dry overnight at room temperature or for 2
hours at 60°C.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Load slides into a slide holder and place in a series of
xylene baths for deparaffinization.
◦ Follow with graded ethanol baths and then distilled water to
rehydrate slides.
B) Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER)
◦ Use a suitable retrieval buffer (e.g., Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or
Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0) in a pressure cooker, microwave,
or water bath.
◦ Preheat retrieval buffer and immerse slides. Heat at
95-100°C for 15-20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in the retrieval buffer for about 20
minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS buffer.
C) Immunostaining Protocol
1. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Load slides onto an automated immunostaining workstation.
◦ Select the Prostate Triple protocol (P63, KRT, P504S) in the
software.
◦ Apply appropriate primary antibody dilutions for P63, KRT,
and P504S as recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Incubate slides according to instrument and reagent
specifications.
2. Detection System
◦ Apply a polymer-based detection system or any optimized
system as recommended.
◦ Follow the automated instrument instructions for incubation
times and reagent applications.
3. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in running water.
D) Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydration
◦ Immerse slides in a series of graded ethanol baths.
◦ Clear slides in xylene.
2. Mounting
◦ Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
E) Quality Control and Validation
1. Quality Control
◦ Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
◦ Ensure controls show expected staining patterns before
reporting patient results.
2. Validation
◦ Ensure all new antibody lots are validated by comparing
with previously validated lots.
◦ Record validation data and any discrepancies noted.
F) Documentation and Reporting
1. Document all steps
◦ Maintain a log of staining procedures, including date, time,
and initials of the technologist performing the steps.
◦ Record temperatures, instrument maintenance, and reagent
lot numbers in the logbook.
2. Slide Evaluation
◦ Review stained slides under a microscope. Evaluate
staining quality and intensity.
◦ Ensure proper localization of staining (e.g., basal cells for
P63 and KRT, malignant cells for P504S).
3. Reporting and Documentation in LIS
◦ Enter and verify results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure that reports include the date of analysis, technologist
initials, and any relevant comments on staining quality or
deviations.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA
• P63: Positive in basal cells, negative in malignant glands.
• KRT (34βE12): Positive in basal cells, negative in malignant cells.
• P504S (AMACR): Positive in prostate cancer cells.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for primary antibodies and detection
systems.
• Current literature on the diagnostic use and interpretation of
Prostate Triple (P63, KRT, P504S) in prostate pathology.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls in every run.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturer's instructions.
• Review QC results for trends and corrective actions as necessary.
