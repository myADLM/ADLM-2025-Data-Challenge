Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Prostatic Acid Phosphatase
(PACP) Immunostain – Technical Component
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the technical
component of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PACP) Immunostaining.
The goal is to ensure consistent and accurate immunostaining
results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained
in immunohistochemistry to perform this procedure. All results must
be reviewed and verified by a designated pathologist.
1. DEFINITION
Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PACP) Immunostain: An
immunohistochemical staining process used to detect the presence
of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase in tissue samples to aid in the
diagnosis and study of prostatic carcinoma.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Reagents and Supplies:
• PACP primary antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated to a suitable label (e.g., HRP)
• Blocking solution
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) or appropriate chromogen
• Hematoxylin
• Xylene, ethanol, and distilled water
• Mounting medium
• Positive control slides
• Negative control slides (slides without primary antibody)
B) Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide rack and staining jars
• Incubator
• Coverslips
• Immunostaining workstation (optional)
• Light microscope
C) Sample Preparation:
1. Retrieve previously accessioned and block-sectioned formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
2. Cut 4μm-thick sections using a microtome and place sections
on charged or silane-coated glass slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for at least 30 minutes to ensure
adherence.
D) Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: a. Immerse slides in xylene
twice for 5 minutes each. b. Rehydrate through a graded
alcohol series:
◦ 100% ethanol: 3 minutes twice
◦ 95% ethanol: 3 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol: 3 minutes c. Rinse slides in distilled water for
5 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval: a. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution
(such as citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heat for 20 minutes at
95-98°C in a water bath or microwave. b. Allow slides to cool for
20 minutes at room temperature. c. Rinse slides in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes.
3. Blocking: a. Apply blocking solution to slides and incubate for
10 minutes at room temperature to reduce nonspecific binding.
4. Primary Antibody: a. Apply the PACP primary antibody to each
slide and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight
at 4°C in a humidified chamber. b. Rinse slides in PBS for 5
minutes, three times.
5. Secondary Antibody: a. Apply the secondary antibody and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. b. Rinse slides in
PBS for 5 minutes, three times.
6. Chromogen Development: a. Apply DAB solution or other
appropriate chromogen to slides and incubate for 5-10 minutes
or until the desired color intensity is achieved. b. Rinse slides in
distilled water for 5 minutes.
7. Counterstaining: a. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes. b. Rinse slides in distilled water and then into a bath of
0.02% ammonium hydroxide or PBS until the desired blue color
is achieved.
8. Dehydration and Mounting: a. Dehydrate slides through graded
alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) for 3 minutes each. b. Clear in
xylene for 5 minutes. c. Apply a coverslip using a xylene-based
mounting medium.
E) Quality Control:
1. Each run must include positive and negative control slides.
2. Positive control slides must exhibit the presence of the
expected staining pattern.
3. Negative control slides must show no specific staining.
F) Troubleshooting:
1. If control slides do not stain as expected, review all steps,
solutions, and reagents for compliance with the SOP.
2. Repeat the staining procedure on a new section if necessary.
3. Notify the supervisor of any persistent issues or
inconsistencies.
G) Reporting: Technical components of the PACP staining will be
reviewed and verified by a designated pathologist before results are
reported.

1. DOCUMENTATION
All procedural steps, any deviations, occurrences of control failures,
and corrective actions must be documented in a laboratory logbook
