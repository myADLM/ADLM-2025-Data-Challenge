Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Prostatic Acid Phosphatase, Serum
1. PURPOSE This procedure provides the necessary steps to
analyze Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) in serum samples. It
includes details on specimen requirements, equipme\nt,
reagents, testing procedure, quality control, and reporting
results to ensure accurate and timely test results. This SOP
aims to maintain the integrity and reliability of laboratory testing
for patient care.
Responsibility:
• All laboratory personnel performing PAP assays.
• Supervisors ensure that staff follow the protocol and take
appropriate corrective actions when deviations occur.
1. DEFINITION Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) is an enzyme
produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels in serum may
indicate prostate cancer or other prostate diseases.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL of serum. Blood should be collected in
a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection
to avoid hemolysis and other interferences.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as soon as
possible. If testing is delayed, refrigerate the serum at 2-8°C and
analyze within 48 hours.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, severely lipemic, or icteric
specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Automated analyzer capable of performing PAP
assays (e.g., Roche Cobas or Abbott Architect).
• Reagents:
◦ PAP assay reagent kit specific to the instrument in use (stored
as per manufacturer’s instructions).
◦ Calibrators and control materials.
• Supplies:
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Laboratory-grade water.
◦ Quality control materials.
1. PROCEDURE
• Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the appropriate calibrators.
• Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift,
after calibration, after reagent change, and with each batch of
patient samples.
◦ Verify that quality control results are within acceptable ranges
before proceeding with patient testing.
• Patient Sample Testing:
1. Ensure the thawed serum samples are at room temperature;
mix thoroughly but gently.
2. Load patient samples, quality control materials, and
calibrators into the analyzer according to the instrument’s
specifications.
3. Select the appropriate PAP assay program on the analyzer.
4. Start the analysis, ensuring that the instrument’s
temperature and settings meet the assay requirements.
5. Follow the analyzer prompts to complete the testing
sequence.
• Post-Analysis:
◦ Ensure that the analyzer prints the results or transmits them to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review the results for any flags or error messages.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate and verify the results in the LIS system.
• Report any critical values immediately to the requesting physician
according to the laboratory’s critical value policy.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for documenting and
communicating results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that all quality control materials are within the expiration
date and stored correctly.
• Document all quality control results, including corrective actions
for out-of-range values.
• Perform routine maintenance and periodic calibration of the
analyzer as recommended by the manufacturer.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Reference Range: 0-3.5 ng/mL (may vary based on the
specific assay method and population; refer to the manufacturer’s
insert or local laboratory-established ranges).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interfering substances such as bilirubin, hemoglobin, or lipids can
affect PAP measurements. Always assess sample integrity.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for limitations specific
to the assay reagent and analyzer in use.
