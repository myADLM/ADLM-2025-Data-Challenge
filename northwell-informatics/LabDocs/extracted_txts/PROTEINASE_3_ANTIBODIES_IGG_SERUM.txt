Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Proteinase 3 Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and
consistent measurement of Proteinase 3 (PR3) Antibodies, IgG in
serum specimens. This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical
phase, including preparing samples, calibration, quality control, and
result transmission.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel are responsible for
adhering to this protocol to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the
generated results. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for training
staff and monitoring adherence to procedures.
3. DEFINITION Proteinase 3 Antibodies, IgG are autoantibodies
directed against the proteinase 3 enzyme. The measurement of these
antibodies in serum is pivotal for diagnosing and monitoring certain
autoimmune conditions such as Wegener's Granulomatosis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit specific for
Proteinase 3 Antibodies, IgG
• Calibrators provided in the ELISA kit
• Quality control (QC) materials: Positive and negative controls
• Microplate reader
• Micropipettes and appropriate tips
• Incubator
• Plate washer
• Laboratory timer
• Disposable test tubes
• Serum specimens
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure serum specimens are properly labeled with date of
collection, time, and patient identification.
2. Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature before
beginning analysis.
3. Samples should be clear and free from any particulate matter. If
necessary, centrifuge at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
B. Assay Calibration
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing calibrators.
2. Run calibrators in duplicate as per ELISA kit instructions to
construct a standard curve.
C. Quality Control
1. Prepare QC materials according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
3. Record QC results in the laboratory log and verify that they fall
within the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
samples.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Label the appropriate number of wells in the ELISA plate for
samples, calibrators, and controls.
2. Pipette the serum samples, calibrators, and controls into their
designated wells.
3. Add the assay buffer to each well as per the kit instructions.
4. Incubate the plate at the recommended temperature and
duration provided in the kit insert.
5. Wash the plate using the automated plate washer or manual
wash technique.
6. Add the secondary antibody conjugate to each well and
incubate again as per the kit instructions.
7. Perform additional washes as specified in the kit insert.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time.
9. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well.
E. Reading and Calculations
1. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
2. Calculate the concentration of Proteinase 3 Antibodies, IgG in
each sample by referring to the standard curve generated from
the calibrators.
3. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and verification.
F. Reporting Results
1. Verify all results against QC materials and standard curves.
2. Any results outside the expected ranges should be flagged and
reviewed by a supervisor.
3. Report verified results to the appropriate healthcare provider
following the site-specific guidelines.
G. Quality Assurance
1. Regularly review standard curves and reagent performance.
2. Document all procedural steps and results in the laboratory log
for traceability.
3. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
accurate result generation.

7. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION This SOP should be reviewed
annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in equipment,
reagents, or procedures.
8. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
1. Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and eye protection when handling specimens and
reagents.
2. Follow waste disposal procedures for biohazardous and
chemical materials per the laboratory guidelines.
