Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PROTEINASE 3
ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a standardized procedure for the analytical phase
of generating results for Proteinase 3 Antibody (PR3 Ab), Serum
using an ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) method.
Ensuring that all steps are conducted accurately to obtain reliable
and reproducible results is critical.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
procedure, maintaining equipment, and ensuring that quality control
measures are followed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader with appropriate software
• Microplate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Proteinase 3 Antibody ELISA Kit (including standards, controls,
and reagents)
• Timer
• Plate shaker (optional)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Allow the specimen to clot completely at room temperature
(usually 30 minutes) and separate the serum within 2 hours of
collection.
• Ensure the serum is free of hemolysis and lipemia.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 6 months
Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens exhibiting gross hemolysis,
lipemia, or collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA or heparin.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Setup and Calibration:
1. Turn on the ELISA reader and microplate washer.
2. Ensure that the incubator is set to 37°C.
3. Prepare reagents according to the ELISA kit manufacturer's
instructions. Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
B) Assay Preparation:
1. Label all microplates, standards, controls, and sample wells as
directed.
2. Prepare the calibrator (standard) dilutions according to the kit
instructions.
3. Vortex mix samples for 5 seconds.
4. For each test run, include negative control, positive control, and
blank (no sample or antibody).
C) Sample and Reagent Addition:
1. Add the recommended volume of each serum sample,
standard, and control to the respective wells.
2. Add the specified volume of assay buffer or diluent to each well
containing samples or controls.
3. Pipette the enzyme conjugate into all wells except the blanks.
4. Cover the plate with adhesive foil or lid and incubate at 37°C for
the specified time (usually 60 minutes).
5. Wash the plate according to the kit instructions (e.g., five
washes using the microplate washer).
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark at
room temperature for the specified time (usually 20 minutes).
D) Reading the Results:
1. Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzyme reaction.
2. Read the absorbance on the ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength (typically 450 nm).
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials (negative and positive controls) must be
included in each assay to validate the test results. Results for these
controls should fall within the designated ranges as specified by the
kit manufacturer.
Corrective Action: If control results are out of range:
• Repeat the assay with new reagent preparations.
• Check instrument calibration and performance.
• Notify the supervisor if discrepancies persist.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are calculated based on the standard curve obtained from
the calibrators. Software associated with the ELISA reader may be
used for this purpose. The concentration of Proteinase 3 Antibody in
the serum samples will be reported in U/mL.
Reference Interval: Refer to the kit manufacturer’s insert for specific
reference ranges.
Critical Results: Any critical values must be reviewed and verified by
laboratory personnel and communicated to the healthcare providers
as required.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are properly clotted and separated.
Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect results.
• Follow kit instructions exactly for preparation and incubation
periods to ensure consistent and accurate results.
