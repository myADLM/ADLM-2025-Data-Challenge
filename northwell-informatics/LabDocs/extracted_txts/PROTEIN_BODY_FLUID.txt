STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical steps necessary to generate
results for protein analysis in body fluids such as pleural fluid,
peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and synovial fluid. The
protocol aims to ensure accurate and precise measurements to
assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of various medical conditions.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing protein analysis on body fluid specimens within the
clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists performing protein analysis are responsible
for following this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
staff compliance and addressing any deviations from the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Preferred Specimen Containers:
▪ Plain sterile containers (e.g., for pleural, peritoneal, and
synovial fluids)
▪ CSF collection tubes for cerebrospinal fluid
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Body fluids should be analyzed as soon as possible after
collection.
▪ If immediate analysis is not possible, samples should be
stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48 hours.
▪ Avoid repeated freezing and thawing, which can degrade
protein integrity.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Protein assay kits (e.g., Dye-binding method with
Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or Turbidimetric method)
◦ Calibrators and control materials
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Spectrophotometer or automated analyzer
◦ Sterile specimen containers
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Mix the body fluid specimen thoroughly by inverting the
container several times.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any cells or debris (if necessary).
3. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh sterile tube for
analysis.
B. Protein Assay
Dye-binding method:
1. Prepare a series of protein standards and blank according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Add 20 μL of each standard, control, and patient
specimen to the designated wells of the microplate.
3. Add 200 μL of Coomassie Brilliant Blue working reagent
to each well.
4. Mix the contents thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
5. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
6. Measure the absorbance at 595 nm using a
spectrophotometer or the plate reader.
7. Generate a standard curve using the protein standards.
Determine the protein concentration of the specimens by
comparing their absorbance to the standard curve.
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high
protein concentrations) alongside patient specimens.
2. Ensure that the QC results fall within the acceptable
range. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the
assay according to the manufacturer's instructions before
reporting patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the protein concentrations in mg/dL or g/L, as per
laboratory reporting standards.
2. Verify the results against the reference intervals:
▪ Pleural fluid: <45 g/L
▪ Peritoneal fluid: <30 g/L
▪ CSF: 15-45 mg/dL
▪ Synovial fluid: 10-30 g/L
3. Enter the results into the laboratory information system
(LIS) following verification procedures.
4. Notify the clinician of any critical or unusual results as per
the critical values reporting policy.
5. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
◦ Turbidity, hemolysis, or xanthochromia in body fluids can
interfere with protein measurements.
◦ Samples with high lipid content or gross contamination
should be clearly noted and interpreted with caution.
◦ Refer to the protein assay kit insert for specific interferences
and limitations.
6. REFERENCES
◦ Protein assay kit manufacturer's insert.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
◦ Laboratory internal quality control protocols and guidelines.
7. REVIEW AND RESPONSIBILITIES
• This protocol will be reviewed annually by the laboratory
supervisor and updated as necessary.
• All laboratory personnel must be trained on the revised SOPs
promptly.
