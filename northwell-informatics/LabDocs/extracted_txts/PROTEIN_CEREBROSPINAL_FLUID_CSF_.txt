STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the
quantitative analysis of protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.
This analysis is critical for diagnosing and monitoring various
neurological and systemic diseases.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff performing the analysis to
adhere to this SOP to ensure consistency, reliability, and accuracy of
results.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer
• Protein reagent kit appropriate for CSF (e.g., Biuret method,
Pyrogallol Red, or BCA assay)
• Calibrators and control samples
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Test tubes or cuvettes
• Water bath or heating block (if required)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and eye protection
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, collected in a sterile container.
Specimen stability and handling:
• CSF samples should be transported to the laboratory immediately
after collection.
• Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours.
If not analyzed immediately, samples can be frozen at -20°C for
up to one week.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the samples.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with visible signs of blood contamination (hemolysis).
• Samples not properly labeled or without collection date/time.
• Samples with insufficient volume for analysis.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation
1. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare protein standards and control samples according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Allow all reagents to come to room temperature before use.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure CSF samples are at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove any cellular debris.
5.2. Assay Procedure (Example using Pyrogallol Red Method):
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the working reagent as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Calibration Curve:
◦ Pipette specified volumes of protein standards into separate
test tubes or cuvettes.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of working reagent to each test
tube, mix well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature or in a heating block at
specified temperature for the required time.
◦ Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength (e.g., 600
nm) against a reagent blank.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette an aliquot of the CSF sample into a test tube or
cuvette.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of working reagent to the
sample, mix well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature or in a heating block at
specified temperature for the required time.
◦ Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength against a
reagent blank.
4. Calculation:
◦ Plot the calibration curve using the absorbance values of the
standards.
◦ Determine the concentration of protein in the CSF sample
by comparing its absorbance value to the calibration curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze control samples with each batch of CSF samples to
ensure the accuracy and precision of results.
• Run at least one high and one low control per batch.
• Results must fall within the established control limits. If not,
identify and rectify the issue before analyzing patient samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the protein concentration in the CSF samples and
report the results in mg/dL.
• Record any anomalies or deviations observed during the analysis.
• Validate and verify results by a second qualified technologist if
required.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference range for CSF protein: 15-45 mg/dL. (Note:
Reference intervals may vary based on patient age and method
used).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis or contamination of the CSF sample can interfere with
the assay and affect the accuracy of the results.
• Refer to the reagent kit manual for specific limitations regarding
interference from other substances.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's reagent and calibration kit inserts.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all data in the laboratory information system (LIS) or
appropriate logbook.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions taken, and all quality
control results.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory staff can ensure the
generation of accurate and reliable results for CSF protein analysis.
