Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PROTEIN/CREATININE, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of protein and creatinine in
random urine samples to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis of
urine protein and creatinine as defined in this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all procedures are
followed correctly and for reviewing any discrepancies or
abnormalities in results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred/acceptable: 10 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a
clean, sterile container.
• Unacceptable: Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than
24 hours after collection, specimens with no collection date/time
indicated, or visibly contaminated specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine containers
• Automated chemical analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman AU)
• Calibrators and controls for protein and creatinine
• Urine protein reagent kit
• Urine creatinine reagent kit
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and lab coat
1. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the automated chemical analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions using the provided calibrators.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift and
with each batch of samples. Ensure that the results are within
the acceptable limits before proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document calibrations and quality control results in the
logbook.
B) Preparation of Samples
1. Verify that the received urine samples meet the acceptable
criteria.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette the required volume of urine into the sample cups or
tubes as per the analyzer’s requirements.
C) Analyzing the Samples
1. Load the sample cups or tubes into the automated analyzer
following the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Select the appropriate assay settings for both protein and
creatinine.
3. Initiate the analysis process on the instrument.
D) Recording and Reviewing Results
1. The analyzer will automatically measure the concentration of
protein and creatinine in the urine samples and calculate the
protein/creatinine ratio.
2. Review the generated results for any flags or errors indicated
by the analyzer.
3. Document the analyzer’s output in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
E) Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the results for consistency and compare them with the
reference intervals:
◦ Protein (normal range): <150 mg/L
◦ Creatinine (normal range): 10-250 mg/dL
◦ Protein/Creatinine ratio (normal range): <0.2
2. Any results outside the reference intervals should be flagged
and reviewed by a supervisor.
3. Report the final validated results through the LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal quality control materials should be analyzed with each
batch of patient samples. If control results are out of the
acceptable range, do not proceed with patient samples until the
issue is resolved.
• Quality control results should be reviewed and documented as
per the laboratory’s policy.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance checks on the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Maintain a log of maintenance activities and any troubleshooting
performed.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manuals and inserts for the automated analyzer
and reagent kits.
• Laboratory's calibration and quality control procedures.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
