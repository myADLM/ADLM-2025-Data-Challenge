Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Protein/Creatinine
Ratio, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to standardize the analytical method for
determining the Protein/Creatinine Ratio (PCR) in random urine
specimens. This ensures accurate, repeatable results that support
clinical decision-making.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of Protein/Creatinine Ratio in random urine specimens within
the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• All personnel performing the analysis must be trained and
competent in the procedure described.
• Quality control and equipment maintenance records must be
managed regularly.
• Supervisors must ensure compliance with this SOP and evaluate
the periodic review of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred:
• Random urine specimen collected in a sterile, leak-proof
container.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated or not properly labeled.
• Specimens that are too dilute (specific gravity < 1.002) or not
stored properly.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated clinical chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas® 6000,
Beckman Coulter AU480)
• Urine protein reagent kits
• Urine creatinine reagent kits
• Calibrators, controls, and quality control material
◦ Control levels: Low, Medium, High
• Sterile, leak-proof urine containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, lab coat)
• Pipettes and tips
• Deionized water for system cleaning
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preliminary Setup
• Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and maintenance records are
up-to-date.
• Prepare quality control samples following the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Verify that all reagents are within the expiration date.
6.2. Specimen Preparation
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gently swirling the container.
• Aliquot an appropriate volume into a sample cup (minimum 2 mL).
6.3. Analysis on Analyzer
• Load the sample cups onto the analyzer following its specific
guidelines.
• Select the program for urine protein and creatinine analysis.
• Ensure the identification (ID) of each sample is correctly logged
into the system.
6.4. Measuring Urine Protein
• The analyzer will add the urine protein reagent to the sample.
• Incubate as specified by the reagent kit instructions.
• The optical density (OD) will be measured and reported by the
analyzer.
• Record the result in grams per liter (g/L).
6.5. Measuring Urine Creatinine
• The analyzer will add the urine creatinine reagent to the sample.
• Incubate as specified by the reagent kit instructions.
• The OD will be measured and reported by the analyzer.
• Record the result in millimoles per liter (mmol/L).
6.6. Calculation of Protein/Creatinine Ratio
• The analyzer will automatically calculate the PCR as: [
\text{Protein/Creatinine Ratio (mg/mmol)} = \left( \frac{\text{Protein
(g/L) × 1000}}{\text{Creatinine (mmol/L)}} \right) ]
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Internal Quality Control
• Run quality control (QC) samples at the start of each shift, after
any major maintenance, and with each batch of patient samples.
• QC must be within acceptable limits before patient results are
reported. Document and address any failures as per laboratory
protocol.
7.2. External Quality Assurance
• Participate in a recognized external quality assurance program
(e.g., CAP proficiency testing).
• Analyze external control samples provided and document
performance.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before being released.
• Results outside of reference range or with any additional
comments (e.g., sample contamination concerns) must be flagged
and reviewed by a supervisor before reporting.
9. REFERENCE RANGES
• Protein/Creatinine Ratio:
◦ Normal: <15 mg/mmol
◦ Borderline: 15-45 mg/mmol
◦ Elevated: >45 mg/mmol
10. PROCEDURAL NOTES
• If the sample is flagged by the analyzer due to high concentration
requiring dilution, manually dilute the sample, rerun the analysis,
and multiply the result by the dilution factor.
• Ensure cross-contamination is avoided by thoroughly rinsing and
cleaning equipment between samples.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all biological samples as potentially infectious.
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
• Dispose of waste following biohazard protocols.
12. REFERENCES
• Ensure equipment and reagent kit references are up-to-date and
accessible.
• Refer to the manufacturer's kit inserts for technical details.
