Laboratory Protocol for Generating Results for Protein/
Creatinine Ratio, Urine, Random
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and reporting of the
Protein/Creatinine Ratio in a random urine sample.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and reporting the Protein/Creatinine Ratio (PCR) in urine.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this
procedure to ensure the accurate and timely reporting of PCR
results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• PCR: Protein/Creatinine Ratio is a measure used to assess the
amount of protein excreted in the urine.
• Random Urine Sample: A urine sample collected at any time of
the day without any specific timing.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Urine Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Beckman Coulter
AU480)
• Protein reagent test kits
• Creatinine reagent test kits
• Calibrators and controls
• Sample cups
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. REAGENTS
• Protein reagent
• Creatinine reagent
• Quality control materials (two levels: normal and abnormal)
• Calibrators
7. PROCEDURES
7.1 Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Random urine sample collected in a clean,
dry container.
• Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of urine is required for testing.
• Storage and Stability: Store at 2-8°C if not tested immediately.
Urine samples should be analyzed within 48 hours of collection.
7.2 Quality Control
• Run quality control samples (both levels) at the beginning of each
shift, after any reagent change, and whenever there is a shift in
instrument performance.
• Record QC results in the QC log and verify they fall within the
acceptable range. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and
repeat until QC is acceptable before proceeding with patient
testing.
7.3 Calibration
• Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions before running patient samples.
• Perform calibration verification every six months or whenever a
new lot number of reagents is used.
7.4 Analytical Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature.
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Pour the urine sample into a sample cup.
◦ Place the sample cup in the sample rack of the analyzer.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Select the Protein/Creatinine Ratio panel on the analyzer.
◦ Start the test run on the analyzer.
4. Results Verification:
◦ Once the analysis is complete, the analyzer will display the
results.
◦ Review the results for any flags or errors.
◦ If results fall outside the expected range or there are
analyzer flags, re-run the sample or troubleshoot as
necessary.
7.5 Post-Analytical
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Reference Range:
▪ Protein: <150 mg/L
▪ Creatinine: 40-300 mg/dL
▪ PCR: <0.2 mg/mg
2. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify and authorize reports.
3. Reporting:
◦ Abnormal or critical values must be communicated to the
requesting physician according to the laboratory’s protocol
for reporting critical values.
4. Specimen Retention:
◦ Retain tested samples at 2-8°C for one week before
disposal.
5. CALCULATIONS
• PCR (mg/mg) = (Protein (mg/dL) / Creatinine (mg/dL))
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the instrument’s troubleshooting guide for any technical
issues encountered with the analyzer.
• Ensure reagents are not expired and have been stored correctly.
• Check for adequate sample volume and proper sample handling
to minimize errors.
10. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
PPE.
• Dispose of biological waste according to biohazard regulations.
