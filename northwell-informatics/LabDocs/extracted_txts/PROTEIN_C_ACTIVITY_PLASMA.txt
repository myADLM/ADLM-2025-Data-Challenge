Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Protein C Activity, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process for the quantitative measurement of Protein C
activity in plasma samples. This measurement is critical for assessing
the anticoagulant capacity of protein C in patients, which can aid in
diagnosing conditions such as protein C deficiency, hereditary
thrombophilia, and other coagulation disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay and ensuring all steps are followed accurately according to this
SOP. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
that personnel are adequately trained and that quality control
measures are maintained.
3. DEFINITIONS
Protein C Activity: A functional assay that measures the ability of
protein C in the plasma to inactivate factors Va and VIIIa, which are
essential components of the clotting cascade.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation Analyzer
• Protein C reagent kits (chromogenic or clot-based assay)
• Calibrators and controls specific for Protein C assays
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Test tubes and racks
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. SPECIMEN CRITERIA
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate)
• The specimen must be centrifuged immediately after collection at
2000-2500 g for 15 minutes at 18-24°C to obtain platelet-poor
plasma.
• Plasma should be tested immediately or stored at -20°C if not
tested within 4 hours of collection for up to one month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Clotted or improperly filled tubes.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify that all necessary reagents and equipment are available
and within the calibration, expiry date.
2. Allow reagents and controls to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
3. Ensure all specimens and controls are properly transported and
stored according to protocol.
B. Calibrator and Control Preparation
1. Prepare calibrators and controls as specified by the reagent kit
instructions.
2. Run calibrators and controls before patient samples to ensure
the assay is performing correctly.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Set up the coagulation analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for the Protein C assay.
2. Load the prepared reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient
samples onto the analyzer.
3. Input necessary data (patient ID, specimen details) into the
analyzer.
4. Initiate the assay process, ensuring samples are tested in
duplicate for accuracy.
5. Monitor the assay run and document any deviations or
anomalies.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Ensure that quality control samples are included in each assay
run.
2. Results of controls must fall within the specified range provided
by the manufacturer before reporting patient results.
3. Document all quality control results and take corrective actions
if controls are out of range. Repeat the assay or troubleshoot as
necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all patient and control results for validity.
2. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) and must be manually reviewed for any
flagged results or QC issues.
3. Report Protein C activity levels with reference intervals
provided by the assay kit. For adults, reference ranges:
70-140% (may vary based on population study and specific test
used).
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Normal Range: 70-140%
Critical Results:
• Protein C activity levels significantly below the normal range may
indicate hereditary or acquired protein C deficiency, enhancing the
risk of venous thromboembolism.
• Protein C levels above the range may suggest effective ongoing
anticoagulant therapy.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
1. Maintain detailed records of all assays conducted, including
patient identification, assay runs, calibrator and control results,
operator’s initials, and any corrective actions taken.
2. Ensure proper documentation in the laboratory log and the LIS
to maintain traceability and compliance with regulatory
requirements.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. For instrumentation errors, consult the coagulation analyzer’s
troubleshooting guide.
2. If assay calibration fails or controls are out of range, examine
reagent preparation and instrument maintenance records.
3. Contact the reagent manufacturer’s technical support for
persistent issues and document all troubleshooting steps taken.
