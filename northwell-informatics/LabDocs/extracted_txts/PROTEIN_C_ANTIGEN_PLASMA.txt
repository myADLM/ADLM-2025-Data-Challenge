STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR PROTEIN C
ANTIGEN ANALYSIS IN PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analysis of Protein C
Antigen levels in plasma samples to ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results.
Responsibility: Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis and ensuring that all procedures are followed
as outlined in this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Protein C Antigen: A protein in the blood that helps regulate blood
clotting. Elevated or decreased levels can indicate certain health
conditions, including clotting disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Acceptable Specimens
• Plasma collected using citrate anticoagulant (3.2% Sodium
Citrate).
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL.
3.2. Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not properly labeled or without collection date/time
indicating on the container or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Protein C Antigen ELISA kit or equivalent
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposable pipette tips
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Timer
• 3.2% Sodium Citrate tubes
• Distilled or deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Sample Preparation
• Upon receipt, verify that the sample is properly labeled and within
the acceptable condition criteria.
• Centrifuge the citrated blood at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
• Aliquot the plasma into clean, labeled tubes and store at -20°C if
not analyzing immediately. Plasma samples should be tested
within a month if stored at -20°C.
5.2. Reagent Preparation
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(approximately 22-25°C) before use.
• Prepare reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions provided
in the Protein C Antigen ELISA kit.
5.3. Assay Procedure
• Add the appropriate volume of samples, standards, and controls
into the designated wells of the microplate.
• Follow the kit insert instructions for incubation times and
conditions, typically involving: a) Adding the capture antibody to
the wells and incubating for 60 minutes at room temperature. b)
Washing the wells 3-5 times with the provided wash buffer. c)
Adding the detection antibody and incubating for another
specified time period. d) Performing another wash step to remove
unbound antibodies. e) Adding the substrate solution and
incubating until color development. f) Stopping the reaction with
the stop solution provided in the kit.
• Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
5.4. Calculation of Results
• Create a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their known concentration.
• Determine the concentration of Protein C Antigen in the patient
samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both low and high positive controls and a negative control
with every assay run.
• Ensure that the control results fall within the specified range
before accepting the assay run.
• If controls are out of range, investigate potential issues (e.g.,
reagent preparation errors, instrument malfunction) and resolve
before rerunning the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and validated by a trained
technologist.
• Calculated concentrations of Protein C Antigen should be
reported in mg/L or IU/dL based on standard conversion factors.
• Document any issues encountered and add notes about
resolution steps taken.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Plasma samples must be properly handled and stored to avoid
degradation of Protein C.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with accurate
readings and should be avoided.
• Ensure adherence to the kit's specific limitations highlighted in the
insert.
