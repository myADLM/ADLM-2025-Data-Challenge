Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Protein C Deficiency (PROC Gene) via Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase in generating results for Protein C Deficiency (PROC gene)
using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). This procedure ensures
accurate and reliable analysis of DNA sequences to detect mutations
or variations in the PROC gene.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible
for performing and documenting the steps outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors and quality control personnel are responsible for
reviewing and verifying the accuracy and integrity of results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): Modern DNA sequencing
technology that allows for high-throughput sequencing of multiple
DNA strands simultaneously. PROC Gene: A gene that encodes
Protein C, which is essential for blood coagulation regulation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Peripheral blood in EDTA tubes. Specimen Stability:
Store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at
-20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• NGS Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq)
• DNA Extraction Kits (e.g., Qiagen Blood DNA Mini Kit)
• Library Preparation Kits for NGS (e.g., NEBNext Ultra DNA
Library Prep Kit)
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA Quantitation Tools (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer)
• Bioinformatics Software (e.g., GATK, BWA)
• Standard Laboratory Consumables (tips, tubes, plates, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the blood samples using the
designated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using the Qubit Fluorometer.
3. Ensure DNA quality by measuring the A260/A280 ratio
(acceptable range: 1.8-2.0).
B) Library Preparation:
1. Fragment the genomic DNA to the desired size using a Covaris
instrument.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the library preparation kit to
construct DNA libraries.
3. Perform adapter ligation and PCR amplification as per the kit
protocol.
4. Purify the PCR products using AMPure XP beads.
5. Quantify the purified libraries.
C) Next-Generation Sequencing:
1. Dilute the libraries to the appropriate concentration as per the
NGS sequencer requirements.
2. Pool the libraries and load them onto the NGS sequencer.
3. Begin the sequencing run following the instrument-specific
protocol.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Raw Data Generation: The sequencer generates raw sequence
data (FASTQ files).
2. Quality Control: Assess the raw data quality using
bioinformatics tools (e.g., FastQC).
3. Sequence Alignment: Align the reads to the reference genome
using BWA or an equivalent tool.
4. Variant Calling: Identify variants using GATK or an equivalent
variant calling software.
5. Annotation: Annotate the identified variants using a suitable
annotation tool (e.g., ANNOVAR).
E) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review the annotated variants to identify clinically significant
mutations in the PROC gene.
2. Verify the quality and accuracy of the sequencing data and the
interpretation.
3. Generate a comprehensive report detailing the findings,
including any identified variants and their potential clinical
significance.
4. Review and sign off the report by a qualified clinical geneticist
or laboratory director.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each sequencing run.
• Utilize internal quality control standards (QC metrics) to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of results.
• Document and address any deviations from the standard
procedure.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Ensure compliance with site-specific reporting guidelines for
NGS-based results.
• Communicate significant findings to the ordering physician or
healthcare provider promptly.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Specific reference intervals for the PROC gene will be as defined
by the clinical geneticist or established laboratory guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Sequencing depth and coverage may affect the detection of
certain mutations.
• Ensure adequate DNA quality and quantity to prevent false-
negative results.
