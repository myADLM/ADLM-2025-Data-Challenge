Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Serum Protein Electrophoresis
with Reflex Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardized, quality-
controlled process for performing serum protein electrophoresis with
reflex interpretation in order to ensure consistent and accurate results
for clinical diagnosis.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out the steps
in this procedure, including specimen processing, performing the
electrophoresis, and the interpretation of results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring all laboratory staff are trained on and adhere
to this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPE): A laboratory test that
separates proteins in the blood serum based on their size and
charge. Reflex Testing: Additional testing that is automatically
triggered based on initial test results. Interpretation: The assessment
and clinical significance of electrophoresis results by a qualified
professional.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Collection: Use a serum separator tube
(SST) - allow blood to clot and centrifuge to separate serum.
Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum Specimen Stability: Stored
refrigerated at 2-8°C, stable for up to 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Samples not properly labeled with patient identification and
collection time
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Electrophoresis apparatus (e.g., Sebia HYDRAGEL)
• Densitometer for scanning gels
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerated storage
Reagents:
• Agarose gel or polyacrylamide gel
• Buffer solutions specific to the electrophoresis system
• Staining solutions (e.g., Amido Black, Coomassie Brilliant Blue)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation: a) Verify patient sample is properly labeled.
b) Centrifuge the clotted blood sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes. c) Carefully transfer serum to a labeled secondary tube,
avoiding cell contamination.
5.2 Performing Electrophoresis: a) Pre-warm electrophoresis buffer
and gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. b) Load buffer
solutions into the electrophoresis apparatus. c) Prepare the gel
according to manufacturer's instructions and allow it to set. d) Pipette
5-10 µL of serum sample into each designated well on the agarose or
polyacrylamide gel. e) Run the electrophoresis process under the
specified conditions (e.g., voltage, time), as per the manufacturer's
instructions. f) After electrophoresis, stain the gel to visualize the
separated proteins. g) Destain the gel as necessary to achieve
optimal band resolution.
5.3 Densitometry: a) Place the stained gel into the densitometer. b)
Scan the gel to measure the densitometric pattern of the separated
serum proteins. c) Analyze the densitogram to identify and quantify
the protein fractions: albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, and gamma
regions.
5.4 Reflex Testing: a) If a monoclonal protein band is detected, reflex
to Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE) for further characterization.
b) Follow the laboratory's IFE SOP to identify the specific
paraprotein(s).
5.5 Interpretation and Reporting: a) Interpret results considering both
the densitometry scan and any reflex testing outcomes. b) Provide an
integrated report that includes the quantification of the protein
fractions and, if applicable, the characterization of any monoclonal
proteins. c) Document any interpretive comments that explain clinical
relevance, note any abnormalities, and make recommendations for
further testing if needed.
5.6 Quality Control and Maintenance: a) Run control samples with
each batch of patient specimens to ensure assay accuracy. b)
Document and review control results; ensure they are within
established acceptable limits. c) Perform regular maintenance and
calibration of electrophoresis equipment as per manufacturer's
guidelines. Document maintenance activities in the logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a) Review all patient results for accuracy and consistency before
reporting. b) Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
with appropriate interpretative comments. c) Ensure interpretation
and report are reviewed and verified by a qualified professional.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Albumin: 3.5-5.0 g/dL Alpha-1 globulin: 0.1-0.3 g/dL Alpha-2 globulin:
0.6-1.0 g/dL Beta-globulin: 0.7-1.4 g/dL Gamma-globulin: 0.7-1.6 g/dL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
a) Hemolyzed samples can interfere with separation and staining of
proteins. b) Incomplete separation can lead to inaccurate
quantification and interpretation. c) Reflex testing might be necessary
for accurate characterization of abnormal proteins.

1. DOCUMENTATION
a) Document all procedures, quality control results, and maintenance
activities in appropriate logbooks. b) Ensure all patient results and
interpretations are accurately recorded and filed according to
laboratory policy.
