Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Protein
Electrophoresis, Serum with Interpretation
1. PURPOSE: To standardize procedures for performing protein
electrophoresis on serum samples and subsequent result
interpretation.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
trained in the execution and interpretation of protein
electrophoresis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to perform this procedure accurately and report findings
according to the guidelines detailed below. Each staff member must
be appropriately trained, with individual responsibilities for specific
steps of the process outlined.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Protein Electrophoresis: A method used to separate proteins
based on their size and charge in a serum sample.
• Interpretation: The analysis of serum protein electrophoresis
results to identify patterns indicative of specific clinical conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Electrophoresis system (e.g., Sebia Capillarys, Beckman Coulter
Paragon Electrophoresis System)
• Serum samples
• Buffer solutions
• Gel or capillary materials
• Staining reagents
• Densitometer
• Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE:
Sample Preparation:
• Ensure that the serum samples have been collected properly and
are free from hemolysis.
• Centrifuge samples to remove any particulate matter, if necessary.
• Ensure each sample is correctly labeled and corresponds to the
accompanying documentation.
Electrophoresis Set-Up:
• Load the prepared serum into wells or capillaries as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Use an appropriate buffer solution to maintain pH and ionic
strength.
• Operate the electrophoresis system under conditions specified by
the reagent and equipment manufacturers, generally around 20
minutes at a constant voltage.
Separation and Staining:
• After separation, ensure the proteins are fixed and stained
appropriately to make them visible for analysis.
• Typically, Coomassie Blue, silver staining, or other commercial
stains can be used.
Densitometry:
• Once staining is complete, scan the gels or capillaries using a
densitometer.
• Obtain a densitogram, which provides: albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2,
beta, and gamma globulin peaks as illustrated by the
electrophoretic profile.
7. INTERPRETATION:
• Analyze the densitogram peaks in terms of their relative mobility
and concentration.
• Evaluate increases or decreases in specific protein fractions (e.g.,
monoclonal protein spikes, decreases in albumin) to identify
potential clinical conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy,
multiple myeloma, hypoalbuminemia, etc.
• Verify the presence of any abnormal proteins and correlate with
the patient’s clinical background provided in the documentation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Quality controls must be run at the beginning of each batch and
after every 10-15 samples.
• Use known control samples to ensure the accuracy and precision
of the electrophoretic measurements.
• Document all quality control results in the quality control logbook,
including any deviations and corrective actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Generate a detailed report with a full interpretation of the
electrophoresis results.
• Include details such as protein percentages, abnormalities
detected, and a clinical interpretation based on the observed
patterns.
• Ensure results and interpretations are reviewed and signed off by
a qualified pathologist or senior laboratory technologist.
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
electronic reviewing and distribution to the appropriate healthcare
providers.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow standard laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, lab coats, and
eye protection.
• Ensure electrical equipment is properly maintained and monitored
for any malfunctions.
• Dispose of waste materials in accordance with institutional waste
disposal protocols.
11. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for electrophoresis system and
reagents.
• Current clinical guidelines and literature relevant to protein
electrophoresis interpretation.
12. RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain logs for patient samples, quality control results,
maintenance of equipment, and any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure records are secure, easily retrievable, and stored for the
required retention period as per regulatory guidelines.
13. CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT: Regularly review and update this
SOP to incorporate new methods, reagents, or updated guidelines to
ensure continued accuracy and relevance of the processes.
By adhering to this standardized protocol, we can ensure the reliable
and accurate generation and interpretation of serum protein
electrophoresis results, ultimately contributing to improved patient
outcomes.
