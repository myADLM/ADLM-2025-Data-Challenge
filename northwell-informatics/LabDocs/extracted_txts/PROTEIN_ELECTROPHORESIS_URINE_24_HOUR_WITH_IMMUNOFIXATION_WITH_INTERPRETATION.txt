Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Protein
Electrophoresis, Urine 24-hour with Immunofixation and
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps for conducting protein electrophoresis on urine
that has been collected over a 24-hour period, including
immunofixation and interpretation of results. This procedure ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability in test results, providing
valuable diagnostic information for patient care.
2. PRINCIPLE
Protein Electrophoresis (PE) separates proteins based on their size
and charge by applying an electric field. Immunofixation (IFE) further
identifies specific proteins using antibodies. This test is commonly
used for the detection of paraproteins, Bence-Jones proteinuria, and
for the assessment of kidney function and multiple myeloma.
3. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ A 24-hour urine collection. Proper patient instructions must be
provided to ensure complete and accurate collection.
◦ Transport the urine collection to the laboratory as soon as
possible after the collection period.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens collected over a period other than 24 hours.
◦ Specimens contaminated with feces or toilet tissue.
◦ Samples mixed with preservatives other than those specified.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Electrophoresis system with power supply
• Immunofixation kit
• Gel electrophoresis trays and combs
• Buffer solution (appropriate for the electrophoresis system used)
• Staining and destaining solutions
• Deionized water
• Centrifuge
• Urine sample containers
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly by inverting the
container several times.
2. Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
collection.
3. Aliquot a standardized volume of urine (typically 50 mL) into a
centrifuge tube.
4. Centrifuge the urine aliquot at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove cellular debris.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean container. Ensure no
sediment is included.
B. Protein Electrophoresis:
1. Load the urine sample and appropriate controls onto the
electrophoresis gel according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run electrophoresis at the specified voltage and time,
depending on the gel and buffer system used.
3. Stain the gel using the staining solution (e.g., Coomassie
brilliant blue or silver stain) for the required time.
4. Destain the gel to visualize the protein bands clearly.
C. Immunofixation:
1. Overlay separate sections of the stained gel with specific
antisera (anti-IgG, anti-IgA, anti-IgM, anti-kappa, anti-lambda).
2. Incubate as per the immunofixation kit instructions to allow for
antibody binding.
3. Wash the gel to remove unbound antibodies.
4. Visualize the gel under appropriate lighting (e.g., UV light) to
identify immunofixed bands.
D. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Analyze the electrophoresis gel for the presence of protein
bands in the γ, β, α2, and α1 regions.
2. Identify monoclonal spikes and other abnormal bands based
on the gel pattern.
3. Compare immunofixation results with the electrophoresis
pattern to confirm and type monoclonal proteins.
4. Document findings on a results sheet, noting the presence,
type, and concentration of abnormal proteins.
5. Include interpretation remarks summarizing significant
findings and possible clinical implications.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples with known protein patterns in
parallel with patient samples.
• Review control results to ensure electrophoresis and
immunofixation processes function correctly.
• Perform maintenance and calibration of electrophoresis
equipment per manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Record all quality control and maintenance activities in the
laboratory log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before final approval.
• Critical results or abnormal findings must be communicated to the
ordering physician promptly, following laboratory protocol for
critical value reporting.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Protein electrophoresis may not detect very low concentrations of
monoclonal proteins.
• Immunofixation can generate false positives due to non-specific
antibody binding.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or highly concentrated urine samples can
interfere with results.
