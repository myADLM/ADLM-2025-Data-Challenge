Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Protein S Activity, Plasma
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of Protein S Activity
in plasma samples. The goal is to ensure accuracy, reliability, and
consistency in the results while maintaining compliance with
regulatory standards.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedure as defined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any issues affecting test results
and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Type:
• Citrated plasma.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood into a 3.2% sodium citrate tube.
• Ensure the tube is filled to the correct volume to maintain the
correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio.
• Gently mix the tube immediately after collection by inverting 4-5
times.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
• Carefully separate the plasma without disturbing the cell layer.
• Transfer plasma to a plastic transport tube promptly after
centrifugation.
Specimen Storage:
• Store plasma at 2-8°C if processed within 4 hours of collection.
• If testing is delayed, freeze plasma at -20°C or below. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Samples collected in tubes other than 3.2% sodium citrate.
• Improperly labelled or unlabelled specimens.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT:
Reagents:
• Protein S reagent kit (refer to the manufacturer's instructions for
specific reagents required).
• Quality control materials (2 levels – Negative and Positive).
Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer calibrated for Protein S testing.
• Centrifuge.
• Timer.
• Pipettes.
• Laboratory glassware and plasticware, as needed.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
Quality Control Procedure:
• Run two levels of quality controls (QC) with each batch of patient
samples.
• Record QC results in the QC log.
• Acceptable limits are determined based on the mean and
standard deviation provided in the control package insert.
Corrective Actions:
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, recalibrate the
instrument and repeat the QC.
• Report any persistent QC failures to the supervisor and
discontinue testing until resolved.
1. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses).
2. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
3. Calibrate the coagulation analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
Testing:
1. Thaw plasma samples rapidly at 37°C if frozen. Mix gently by
inversion.
2. Load patient samples and controls onto the analyzer according
to the instrument's operation manual.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the Protein S activity
assay.
4. The analyzer will automatically mix, incubate, and measure clot
formation.
5. Results will be displayed and printed automatically.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
Reference Intervals:
• Normal Protein S activity range: 60-130% (may vary by laboratory
and based on methodology).
Reporting Results:
• Review results for technical errors and ensure they fall within the
expected range for patient or control samples.
• Critical values or significantly abnormal results should be verified
and immediately reported to the clinical team.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
Common Issues and Solutions:
• Samples not clotting: Ensure proper centrifugation and sample
preparation. Re-run the test.
• QC out of range: Follow corrective actions outlined in the QC
procedure.
• Instrument errors: Refer to the instrument manual for specific
error codes and troubleshooting steps.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all patient results, QC results, and instrument
maintenance activities in the laboratory information system (LIS)
or the relevant logbook.
• Document any corrective actions taken for out-of-range controls
or instrument errors.
1. REFERENCE MATERIALS:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Protein S reagent kit and
coagulation analyzer.
• Current laboratory procedural manual.
• Regulatory guidelines (e.g., CLIA, CAP).
1. REVISION HISTORY:
• List revisions with dates and brief descriptions of changes.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
reliable analysis of Protein S Activity in plasma, leading to high-
quality patient care and compliance with regulatory standards.
