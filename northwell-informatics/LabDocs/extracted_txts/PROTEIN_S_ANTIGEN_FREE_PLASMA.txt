Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for PROTEIN S ANTIGEN,
FREE, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for the analytical phase of testing
for Protein S antigen, free, in plasma specimens. It ensures
consistent, accurate results are generated and reported, adhering to
laboratory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analytical
procedures as outlined in this SOP. Staff are to ensure proper
documentation, accurate testing, and appropriate reporting.
Supervisors are to oversee the process and ensure compliance with
the SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Citrate plasma (blue top tube).
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be processed within 4 hours of collection.
• Plasma should be separated from cells and can be stored at
2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze plasma at -20°C or below. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with visible hemolysis.
• Samples not processed within specified timeframes.
• Inappropriately labeled or unlabeled specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500).
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Protein S antigen, free reagent kit.
• Calibrators and controls specific to Protein S antigen testing.
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips.
• Sample cups.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify that all reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates and have been stored appropriately.
2. Prepare the coagulation analyzer by performing daily
maintenance as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Specimen Handling:
1. Centrifuge citrate plasma specimens at 1500 x g for 15 minutes
to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Transfer the plasma to a clean,
labeled tube.
2. For specimens stored at 2-8°C, allow the plasma to warm to
room temperature before testing. For frozen specimens, thaw
rapidly at 37°C and mix gently.
Testing:
1. Set up the coagulation analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions for Protein S antigen testing.
2. Load the specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
3. Select the appropriate assay protocol for Protein S antigen,
free.
4. Initiate the testing sequence.
5. Monitor the analyzer throughout the testing process to ensure
proper functioning and address any errors or alerts promptly.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials (controls) before patient
specimens to validate the testing process. Ensure that QC
results fall within acceptable ranges.
2. Document QC results and any corrective actions taken if QC
results are out of range.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Review:
1. After analysis, review all results for accuracy and ensure they
meet established criteria.
2. Validate the results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Ensure that critical values are promptly communicated to the
requesting physician and documented as per lab protocol.
Reference Intervals:
• Protein S antigen, free: Established reference intervals will be
used for result interpretation.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations related to the
Protein S antigen, free assay. Common limitations include:
• Interference from hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Potential assay interference from certain medications or
pathophysiological conditions.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
If issues arise during testing:
1. Verify that reagents and controls are properly prepared.
2. Check the analyzer for mechanical or software issues.
3. Review specimen integrity.
4. Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide or contact
customer support.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND REFERENCES
Maintain thorough records of all steps performed during the analytical
phase. Include:
• Specimen accession logs.
• Quality control records.
• Calibration records.
• Maintenance logs for equipment used.
• Detailed testing procedure references from the reagent kit insert.
By following this SOP for Protein S antigen, free, plasma testing,
laboratory staff will ensure high standards of accuracy and reliability
in patient results, contributing to effective clinical decision-making.
