Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
PROTEIN S ANTIGEN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for PROTEIN S ANTIGEN in plasma samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated medical laboratory scientists (MLS) are responsible
for performing the assay procedures, analyzing specimens, and
validating the test results.
• It is the responsibility of the designated supervisor or senior
technologist to ensure the adherence to this SOP and to provide
guidance in case of any deviations or troubleshooting.
1. PRINCIPLE
The Protein S Antigen test quantifies the level of Protein S in plasma,
a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein involved in the regulation of
blood coagulation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Freshly drawn venous blood collected into sodium citrate
anticoagulant tubes (blue top).
◦ Ensure that the collection tube is filled to the marked fill line to
maintain the correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio.
• Handling and Transport:
◦ Immediately mix the sample by gentle inversion (8-10 times) to
ensure anticoagulation.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 15 minutes at
room temperature to obtain plasma.
◦ Aliquot the plasma into a labelled secondary tube and store at
-20°C if not analyzed immediately. Plasma can be stored for
up to one week at -20°C or up to six months at -70°C.
Unacceptable Specimen:
- Hemolyzed samples.
- Samples collected in the incorrect anticoagulant.
- Samples with visible clots.
- Samples that have not been centrifuged within 2 hours of collection.
Sample Stability:
- At room temperature (20-25°C): Plasma should be tested within 2 hours.
- Refrigerated (2-8°C): Plasma can be tested within 24 hours.
- Frozen (-20°C or lower): Plasma can be stored for up to six months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA plate reader.
• Protein S Antigen assay kit (including calibrators, controls, and
reagents).
• Pipettes and tips (variable volume).
• Centrifuge.
• Storage vials (for plasma aliquots).
• Proper PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature and mix
gently.
◦ Prepare the equipment following manufacturer instructions
for calibration and quality control checks.
3. Assay Procedure (Automated Immunoassay Analyzer):
◦ Load the Protein S Antigen assay kit reagents into the
analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer using the assay-specific software or
manual input following the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Load patient plasma samples, calibrators, and quality
controls into the analyzer.
◦ Start the assay run.
4. Assay Procedure (ELISA):
◦ Dilute plasma samples according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Add diluted samples, controls, and calibrators to the
appropriate wells in the ELISA plate.
◦ Follow the assay-specific steps including incubation,
washing, and adding substrates and stop solutions.
◦ Read the ELISA plate at the specified wavelength using the
ELISA plate reader.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) checks with each batch of tests.
• Utilize at least two levels of control material (normal and
abnormal) provided by the assay kit.
• Record QC results in the designated log and ensure they are
within acceptable ranges before releasing patient results.
• If QC results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot the
issue and repeat the control. Document corrective actions taken.
1. CALCULATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• For automated analyzers, ensure that results are properly
transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• For manual or ELISA methods, calculate the concentration of
Protein S Antigen from the standard curve and enter the results
into the LIS.
• Review and verify results before releasing them. Report any
values that fall outside the reference range.
Reference Intervals: - Adult males: 70-140% - Adult females:
55-125%
1. REPORTING CRITICAL RESULTS
• Notify the physician or appropriate clinical staff immediately if
results are critically low or high.
• Document the notification according to the lab’s protocol for
critical result reporting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with the assay and must be
rejected.
• Ensure proper sample collection and handling to avoid pre-
analytical errors.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific troubleshooting guidelines
if discrepancies or unexpected results occur.
• Engage the technical support team from the analyzer
manufacturer if hardware or software issues arise.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all calibration, QC, and patient results.
• Record any corrective actions taken in the event of QC failure or
assay troubleshooting.
• Ensure all documentation is checked regularly for completeness
and accuracy.

This SOP is effective immediately and will be reviewed annually or as
needed based on updates to testing procedures or equipment.
