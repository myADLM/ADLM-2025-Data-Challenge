Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Protein S Antigen, Total, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical phase procedures for quantifying
Protein S Antigen, Total, Plasma levels. The goal is to ensure reliable,
accurate, and reproducible results that can effectively be used for
diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists and scientific
staff are responsible for performing the procedures and documenting
the results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring procedural
adherence, including any corrective actions required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: 3 mL of plasma collected in a sodium citrate tube (light
blue top)
• Unacceptable: EDTA and heparinized specimens
Stability:
• Ambient: Process within 4 hours of collection
• Refrigerated: Stable up to 24 hours
• Frozen: Specimens can be stored long-term at -20°C. Ensure
specimens are thawed at room temperature prior to analysis
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Protein S Antigen assay kit (following the manufacturer’s protocol)
• Microplate reader capable of required wavelength detection (e.g.,
450 nm)
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Sodium citrate blood collection tubes
• Laboratory Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) – lab coat, gloves, goggles
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Specimens:
1. Centrifuge sodium citrate tubes at 2000 - 2500 RPM for 10
minutes to obtain plasma.
2. Aliquot plasma into properly labeled microcentrifuge tubes if
multiple assays or further analysis is required.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s specific instructions for assay
preparation and reagent handling.
4. Maintain specimens at room temperature, handling them as
efficiently as possible to adhere to stability limits.
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare and calibrate the microplate reader according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Arrange all required materials and reagents on a clean,
organized workbench.
3. Prepare standards and controls as per the kit instructions.
4. Pipette appropriate volumes of plasma into designated assay
wells ensuring to avoid cross-contamination.
5. Add reagents to each well per the manufacturer’s protocol.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature or specified conditions
mentioned in the kit’s protocol.
7. Wash wells as indicated in the assay protocol to remove
unbound material.
8. Add substrate and incubate as per manufacturer’s instructions.
9. Stop the reaction using the specific stop solution provided in the
kit.
10. Measure the absorbance using the microplate reader set at the
specified wavelength.
11. Record absorbance readings meticulously.
12. VALIDATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs as applicable
to maintain consistency.
• Validate initial readings and correct discrepancies before reporting
results.
Corrective Action:
• If controls fall outside the expected range, check for potential
procedural errors and repeat the assay.
• Document all corrective actions taken and review them
periodically.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze the data using the software or calculation protocols
provided by the assay kit.
• Compare the absorbance readings of test specimens to standard
curves to determine Protein S Antigen concentrations.
• Record the results accurately in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Verify the results and implement peer review as per laboratory
guidelines.
Critical Values and Notification:
• Identify and document critical values according to laboratory
policy.
• Notify the prescribing physician immediately if critical values are
encountered.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed specimens or those not meeting stability criteria may
yield inaccurate results and should be rejected.
• Verify reagent lot numbers and expiry dates before initiating any
assay procedures.

This SOP must be reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to
accommodate any procedural changes or new regulatory
requirements. Staff must be trained on the SOP before they are
allowed to conduct the assay independently.
