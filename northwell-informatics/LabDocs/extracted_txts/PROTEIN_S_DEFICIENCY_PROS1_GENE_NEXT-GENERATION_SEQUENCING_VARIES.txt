Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase: Protein S Deficiency, PROS1 Gene, Next-
Generation Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the process for the analytical phase of
generating results for Protein S Deficiency caused by mutations in
the PROS1 gene using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
technology. The protocol ensures accurate, reproducible, and high-
quality results to support clinical diagnosis and patient care.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The responsibility for conducting this analytical procedure lies with
designated laboratory staff trained in NGS techniques, data analysis,
and bioinformatics.
3. DEFINITION
Protein S Deficiency: A hereditary disorder characterized by a
deficiency in Protein S leading to increased risk of thrombotic events.
PROS1 Gene: The gene encoding Protein S, mutations in which can
lead to Protein S Deficiency. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A
high-throughput sequencing technology used to determine the
nucleotide sequence of gene segments.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-sequencing Preparation
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure the DNA sample from the patient has been properly
extracted, quantified, and quality checked (e.g., using a
spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis).
◦ Typically, a concentration of 10-50 ng/µL is appropriate with
A260/280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0.
2. Library Preparation:
◦ Use a designated library preparation kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
▪ Fragmentation: Fragment the DNA to the desired size
range (~300-500 bp).
▪ End repair and A-tailing: Perform end-repair and add an
A-tail to the fragments.
▪ Adapter Ligations: Ligate sequencing adapters to the
fragments.
▪ Purification: Purify the ligated fragments using magnetic
beads or another purification method.
▪ Amplification: Amplify the library fragments using PCR
with specific primers.
▪ Quantification and Quality Control: Quantify the library
and verify fragment size distribution using an instrument
such as a bioanalyzer.
B) Sequencing
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Load the purified and quantified libraries onto the
sequencer, following the sequencer-specific loading
protocol.
◦ Ensure appropriate controls (positive, negative, and non-
template controls) are included in the sequencing run.
2. Run Sequence:
◦ Configure the sequencer with the correct parameters (read
length, paired-end/single-end reads, etc.).
◦ Initiate the sequencing run, ensuring to monitor the progress
and make necessary adjustments as dictated by the
sequencer's performance and status.
C) Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing:
◦ Convert raw sequencing data (e.g., FASTQ files) into
aligned data using appropriate bioinformatics software (e.g.,
BWA, Bowtie).
◦ Align reads to the reference human genome (e.g., hg19 or
hg38).
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Process aligned data to detect variants using variant calling
software (e.g., GATK, Samtools).
◦ Filter and annotate variants to identify potential pathogenic
mutations in the PROS1 gene using databases such as
dbSNP, ClinVar, and custom laboratory databases.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Validate the accuracy of the NGS results through the
following:
▪ Coverage Depth: Ensure the target regions of the
PROS1 gene have adequate sequencing depth (e.g.,
>20x coverage).
▪ Mapping Quality: Check the mapping quality score to
confirm reliable read alignment.
▪ Variant Quality Score: Apply filters to retain high-
confidence variant calls (e.g., VQSLOD score
thresholds).
4. Data Interpretation:
◦ Interpret detected variants considering known pathogenicity,
conservation across species, and any reported clinical
significance.
D) Reporting Results
1. Report Generation:
◦ Compile the sequencing and variant data into a coherent
report summarizing identified mutations, their potential
clinical significance, and any recommended follow-up
testing or genetic counseling.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory scientist or geneticist.
2. Data Retention and Privacy:
◦ Store sequencing data, variant files, and interpreted results
securely in the laboratory information management system
(LIMS).
◦ Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements concerning
patient privacy and data security.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Controls:
◦ Implement quality control measures at each stage (e.g.,
control specimens in sequencing, bioinformatics checks).
◦ Periodically run proficiency testing to maintain high
standards of analytical accuracy and reliability.
2. Validation:
◦ Validate new reagents, library preparation kits, and
sequencing platforms by comparing results against known
standards and clinical specimens.
