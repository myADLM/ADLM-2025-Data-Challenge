Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
Protein S, Free, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results
for Protein S, Free, Plasma, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and
compliance with regulatory guidelines.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring all steps are followed meticulously. Quality Control
personnel oversee the accuracy and precision of results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected in sodium citrate tubes.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled.
• Specimens collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Automated Coagulation Analyzer
• Protein S reagent kit (including appropriate controls and
calibrators)
• Disposable pipettes
• Specimen tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. REAGENTS AND STORAGE
• Reagents used for Protein S analysis must be kept at 2-8°C
unless specified otherwise by the manufacturer.
• Follow manufacturer guidelines regarding reagent preparation
and stability.
6. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Verify specimen integrity.
◦ Confirm the specimen meets acceptance criteria (proper
labeling, no hemolysis, appropriate collection time).
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the plasma samples at 1500-2000g for 15
minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube avoiding platelet
contamination.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run controls (normal/abnormal) to ensure the instrument is
calibrated and functioning correctly.
◦ Document control results in the QC log.
B. ANALYSIS
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Verify the coagulation analyzer is properly calibrated.
◦ Load reagents and specimens following manufacturer
instructions.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Place the prepared plasma specimens into the analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the specific Protein S
assay.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay and monitor for any errors or alerts.
◦ Record any issues or troubleshooting in the logbook.
C. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
1. Data Review:
◦ After completion, review results for accuracy.
◦ Verify the results against control values to ensure they fall
within acceptable ranges.
2. Documentation:
◦ Log each result in the lab information system (LIS), ensuring
proper entry and verification.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for result reporting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
A. Quality Control:
1. Initial QC:
◦ Perform QC with each new batch of reagents.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they are within the
acceptable range.
2. Ongoing QC:
◦ Continuously monitor QC results during routine assays.
B. Troubleshooting:
1. Out of Range Results:
◦ If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, review
reagent preparation and instrument settings.
◦ Re-run QC following troubleshooting. Document all actions
taken.
2. Instrument Alerts:
◦ Follow manufacturer guidelines for resolving instrument
errors.
◦ Notify the supervisor if the issue persists.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations related to the
Protein S assay. For example, high lipid levels, icteric samples, or
interfering substances may affect results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Verification:
◦ Review all results before reporting to ensure accuracy and
completeness.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Immediately notify the relevant healthcare provider for any
critical values. Document the notification according to the
lab’s protocol.

11. DOCUMENT CONTROL
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in procedures, equipment, or reagents. All revisions
must be approved by the laboratory director and relevant
stakeholders.
By following this protocol, we ensure the accurate and efficient
generation of Protein S, Free, Plasma results, upholding the highest
standards of laboratory practice.
