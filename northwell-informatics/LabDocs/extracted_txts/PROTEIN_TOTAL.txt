Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Measuring Total Protein
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for accurately
measuring and reporting total protein concentration in patient
samples. This protocol ensures that sample handling, instrument
calibration, and result verification are standardized to maintain the
integrity and reliability of laboratory measurements.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated staff to follow this procedure
and ensure that the steps outlined are adhered to. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and providing
support for troubleshooting and verification.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Serum
• Plasma (Use anticoagulant EDTA or heparinized plasma - not
preferred but acceptable if serum is unavailable)
• Urine
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis
• Clotted plasma specimens
• Urine specimen if older than 24 hours without preservative
Specimen Stability:
• Serum and Plasma: Stable for up to 72 hours at 4°C
• Urine: Stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature or up to 72
hours at 4°C if properly preserved
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Required Supplies:
• Protein reagent kit (appropriate reagent specific to the utilized
instrument, e.g., Biuret reagent for spectrophotometry)
• Calibrator
• Control materials (Low, Medium, High)
• Reagent grade distilled water
• Test tubes/cuvettes
• Spectrophotometer or appropriate automated analyzer
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase: Sample Preparation
1. Verify specimen suitability and ensure it meets the acceptable
criteria.
2. Centrifuge serum or plasma samples for 10 minutes at 3000
RPM if required.
3. Inspect samples for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus, noting any
abnormalities that may require alternate methods or affect
results.
B) Analytical Phase: Measuring Total Protein
1. Prepare the instrument/calibrator per manufacturer instructions.
a) Ensure all volumetric glassware, pipettes, and cuvettes are
clean and calibrated. b) Power on and initialize the
spectrophotometer or automated analyzer.
2. Prime and calibrate the instrument using the protein reagent kit
and calibrators. a) Perform initial calibration using a blank
(reagent grade distilled water) and standard provided in the kit.
b) Record calibration and confirm it is within the acceptable
range.
3. Quality Control (QC) Analysis: a) Run the included control
materials at various levels (low, medium, high) to verify
calibration accuracy. b) Document QC results and confirm they
are within acceptable limits. If outside limits, troubleshoot as
necessary.
4. Sample Analysis: a) Load samples into the analyzer or
manually pipette samples into cuvettes. b) Add appropriate
volume of reagent to each sample according to manufacturer
specifications. c) Mix gently and allow reaction to proceed per
reagent instructions (usually involves incubation at a specified
temperature and time). d) Measure absorbance or
concentration using the spectrophotometer or analyzer.
5. Result Verification: a) Verify analysis results against controls
and standards. b) Record patient results in the LIS. c) Manually
review any critical or flagged results.
6. RESULT REPORTING
A) Reporting:
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS after review.
• For any critical values, follow the established protocol for
notification, documenting any actions taken.
B) Reference Intervals:
• Serum/Plasma Total Protein: 6.0–8.0 g/dL
• Urine Total Protein: < 150 mg/dL
C) Comments on Method Limitations: Refer to specific reagent kit
insert for potential interferences and limitations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND INSTRUMENT MAINTENANCE
A) Quality Control:
• Perform QC analysis at the beginning of each shift or as indicated
by the manufacturer.
• Document all QC results and actions taken after any QC failures.
• After analyzing patient samples, repeat high/low QC to ensure
continued accuracy.
B) Maintenance:
• Perform routine maintenance on the spectrophotometer or
automated analyzer per manufacturer instructions.
• Document all maintenance activities in the instrument logbook.
