Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidelines for the quantitative analysis of
total protein in a 12-hour urine collection. Proper execution of this
protocol ensures accurate and precise measurement of total urinary
protein.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and reporting the total protein results from 12-hour urine
collections.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis as per the
procedure.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensure adherence to the SOP and
address any issues related to equipment or reagents.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor QC and ensure equipment is
properly calibrated and functioning.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 12-hour urine collection or aliquot from the collection. The
collected urine must be kept refrigerated during and after the
collection period.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens not collected or stored under the recommended
conditions, specimen containers with missing or incomplete
labeling (missing patient identification or collection times).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine collection container (with preservatives if required)
• Analytical balance (calibrated)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Urine Total Protein Reagent Kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Analyzing equipment (spectrophotometer or automated analyzer)
• Timer
• Standard laboratory supplies (gloves, tubes, etc.)
6. PROCEDURE
Note: Refer to the Urine Total Protein Reagent Kit insert for detailed
reagent handling and preparation.
Preparation and Pre-Analysis:
1. Collect 12-hour urine sample:
◦ Provide the patient with a properly labeled, clean urine
collection container.
◦ Instruct the patient on proper collection methods and
storage requirements (keep container refrigerated).
2. Upon receipt:
◦ Verify patient information and collection times on the
specimen container and request form.
◦ Mix the urine sample well and measure total volume.
Record this volume.
◦ If analyzing a portion, aliquot and properly label the new
container with necessary details.
◦ Centrifuge aliquot prior to analysis to remove particulates.
◦ Bring the aliquot to room temperature before proceeding
with testing.
Quantitative Analysis:
1. Calibration and QC:
◦ Run blank, low, medium, and high calibrators.
◦ Perform quality control using positive and negative control
materials.
2. Perform the assay using the urine total protein reagent kit:
◦ Pipette the specified volume of urine into the reaction tube/
cuvette.
◦ Add reagents as per the reagent kit insert instructions.
◦ Incubate/mix as specified.
◦ Measure absorbance using a spectrophotometer or process
using an automated analyzer.
3. Calculate concentration:
◦ Use the calibration curve generated from calibrators.
◦ Record results, ensuring proper unit conversions based on
total urine volume.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run controls with each batch of patient specimens.
• Acceptable control ranges must be determined and adhered to
according to laboratory and reagent insert specifications.
• Document all quality control activities, including any corrective
actions taken for out-of-range results.
8. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS:
• Reference Intervals: (Note: Determine these based on your
reference texts or established lab references):
Males: <150 mg/24 hours
Females: <150 mg/24 hours (adjust appropriately for 12-hour
collections based on intervals).
• Report result in mg/dL and total protein excretion in mg/12 hours,
considering the total sample volume.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations related to
interference substances that may affect the assay's accuracy.
