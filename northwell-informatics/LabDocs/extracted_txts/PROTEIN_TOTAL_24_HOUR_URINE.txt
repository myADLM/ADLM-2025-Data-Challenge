Standard Operating Procedure for Protein, Total, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps required to perform a
total protein analysis on a 24-hour urine collection, providing reliable
and accurate results to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of various
conditions, such as kidney disease and proteinuria.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
total protein analysis on 24-hour urine samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory personnel to perform and document the analysis according
to this protocol, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the test results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 24-hour urine collection.
◦ Urine must be collected over a full 24-hour period.
◦ Collection container must be labeled with patient's name, date
of birth, and collection start and end times.
◦ Sample should be kept refrigerated during collection and
transportation.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Urine collected outside the 24-hour period.
◦ Urine samples that have not been properly labeled or stored.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Urine collection containers
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Spectrophotometer or automated analyzer with protein assay
capability
• Protein reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Water bath/incubator (if required by assay)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis
1. Verify the sample:
◦ Confirm that the sample is a 24-hour urine collection.
◦ Ensure that the collection container is properly labeled.
◦ Inspect the sample for proper storage conditions; it must be
refrigerated.
2. Measure and record the total urine volume:
◦ Using a graduated cylinder, measure the total volume of the
24-hour urine collection.
◦ Record the total volume in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Mix the sample thoroughly before aliquoting.
B. Sample Processing
1. Transfer an aliquot of the urine to a clean, labeled tube.
2. If necessary, centrifuge the aliquot to remove any particulates
or sediments.
3. If required by the test method, dilute the urine sample as
specified by the reagent kit instructions.
C. Reagent Preparation and Calibration
1. Prepare the reagents as per the instructions provided in the
protein reagent kit.
2. Calibrate the spectrophotometer or automated analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the provided
calibrators.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of urine sample, standards, and
quality control materials into the designated wells of the assay
plate or cuvettes.
2. Add the required reagents as specified in the protein reagent kit
instructions.
3. Incubate the samples at the specified temperature and for the
required duration as instructed by the reagent kit (e.g., 37°C for
10 minutes).
4. Measure the absorbance of each sample, standard, and control
using the spectrophotometer or automated analyzer.
E. Calculations
1. Calculate the total protein concentration in the urine samples
using the standard curve generated from the calibrators.
2. Multiply the protein concentration by the total volume of the 24-
hour urine collection to obtain the total protein excretion per 24
hours.
F. Quality Control
1. Include quality control samples at two levels (low and high) in
each assay run.
2. Ensure that quality control results fall within the acceptable
range before reporting patient results.
3. Document any corrective actions taken if quality control results
are out of range.
G. Reporting Results
1. Enter the total protein concentration and the total protein
excretion per 24 hours into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Verify and validate the results before releasing them to the
requesting clinician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals will be method-specific and should be
obtained from the reagent kit instructions or established by the
laboratory.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent kit instructions for specific limitations related
to interference, sensitivity, and specificity.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE), such as lab coats, gloves,
and safety goggles, when handling biological specimens and
reagents.
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain detailed records of all calibration, quality control, and
patient test results according to laboratory policies and regulatory
requirements.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions provided with the protein reagent kit.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the
consistent, accurate, and reliable measurement of total protein in 24-
hour urine samples, aiding in the proper diagnosis and monitoring of
patients.
