Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Total
Protein in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedure for determining the
concentration of total protein in body fluids. Accurate and dependable
results are crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring of various medical
conditions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing total protein analysis of body fluids.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory personnel to adhere
to this SOP, ensuring all steps are performed accurately and
effectively recorded. A supervisor is to be contacted for any
deviations or challenges encountered during the procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Pleural fluid
• Peritoneal fluid (ascitic fluid)
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Synovial fluid
• Pericardial fluid
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated or severely hemolyzed
• Specimens that are clotted or stored improperly
• Specimens received in unapproved containers
Storage and Transport:
• Specimens should be collected in a sterile container and
transported to the laboratory as soon as possible.
• If a delay in testing is anticipated, store the specimen at 2-8°C.
For longer storage periods, freezing at -20°C is recommended.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or automated analyzer capable of measuring
protein concentrations
• Protein reagent kit (containing Biuret reagent or equivalent)
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes or cuvettes
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory timer
• Protective gloves and lab coat
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow specimens and reagents to reach room temperature prior
to analysis.
2. Inspect the specimen for clarity and record any pertinent
observations (e.g., turbidity, color).
Testing Protocol:
1. Calibration: a. Prepare calibrator solutions according to the
manufacturer's instructions. b. Calibrate the spectrophotometer
or analyzer using the provided calibrators to ensure the
accuracy of the assay. c. Document calibration results and
verify against required specifications.
2. Quality Control: a. Run quality control (QC) samples at the
beginning of each testing batch, and ideally at intervals
throughout the testing session. b. Document and verify QC
results. QC must pass before proceeding with patient
specimens.
3. Sample Preparation: a. Mix the specimen thoroughly to
ensure homogeneity. b. Pipette an appropriate volume of the
body fluid specimen into a microcentrifuge tube or cuvette
according to the reagent kit instructions.
4. Reagent Addition: a. Add the specified volume of Biuret
reagent or equivalent to the specimen. b. Mix the solution using
a vortex mixer.
5. Incubation: a. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for
the time specified by the reagent kit instructions.
6. Measurement: a. Insert the prepared sample into the
spectrophotometer or place into the designated well of the
automated analyzer. b. Measure the absorbance or
concentration at the specified wavelength (commonly 540 nm
for Biuret reaction).
Reporting Results:
1. Compare sample absorbance/concentration to that of the
standard/calibration curve to determine the total protein
concentration in the body fluid.
2. Document the results appropriately in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Ensure results that are critical or outside normal reference
ranges are flagged for review.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
QC Materials:
• Use commercially available protein control materials suitable for
body fluids.
• Store QC materials as recommended by the manufacturer.
Documentation and Reporting:
• Record all QC data, including lot numbers, expiry dates, and
observed values.
• Review and verify that QC results comply with established
acceptable ranges before analyzing patient samples.
• Investigate any QC failures immediately and take corrective
actions as necessary.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Provide reference intervals specific to the type of body fluid being
tested, typically determined and validated by laboratory-specific
historical data.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the accuracy of
results.
• Refer to the reagent kit instructions for specific limitations related
to interfering substances.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Protein Reagent Kit.
• Laboratory equipment user manuals.
• Clinical laboratory standards and guidelines.
11. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect any changes in procedures, reagents, or equipment.
