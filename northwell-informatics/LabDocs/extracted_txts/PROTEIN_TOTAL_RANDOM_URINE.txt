Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Total Protein Analysis
in Random Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides standardized methods for the analysis of total
protein in random urine samples. Proper implementation ensures
accurate and reliable results that are essential for patient diagnosis
and treatment.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to total protein analysis in random urine
specimens received in the laboratory. It encompasses the analytical
processes from specimen preparation to results generation and
includes quality control measures to ensure consistency and
accuracy.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the total
protein analysis according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring compliance and resolving any issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Preferred Specimen:
• Random urine specimen collected in a clean, leak-proof container.
4.2 Specimen Volume:
• Minimum Volume: 10 mL
• Ideal Volume: 20 mL
4.3 Handling and Storage:
• Store at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed immediately. All
urine specimens should be processed within 2 hours of receipt, or
kept refrigerated for no more than 72 hours.
4.4 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in unlabelled or improperly labelled containers.
• Specimens with visible contamination (fecal matter, foreign
objects).
• Collecting date/time not indicated.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer calibrated for urine protein assays.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes.
• Specimen containers.
5.2 Reagents:
• Urine protein reagent kit specific to the instrument in use.
• Quality Control (QC) materials.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Centrifuge the urine specimen at 1500-2000x g for 5 minutes to
remove debris and cells.
6.2 Calibration:
• Perform calibration and verify using urine protein standards
according to the instrument manufacturer's instructions.
6.3 Control Materials:
• Run quality control samples (normal and abnormal levels) at the
beginning and end of each analytical batch and with each new
reagent kit/lot.
6.4 Analysis:
1. Load the prepared and properly labelled urine specimens onto
the analyzer.
2. Select the appropriate urine protein analysis program on the
analyzer.
3. Follow prompts to ensure sample analysis, ensuring all
pipetting steps are accurate and precise.
4. Verify that quality control samples fall within predefined ranges.
6.5 Results Verification:
• Monitor instrument tapes or electronic outputs for flags or error
codes.
• Repeat the analysis if QC results are out of range or if instrument
errors occur.
• Document and troubleshoot any unanticipated occurrences or
deviations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Frequency:
• Quality control specimens must be analyzed at the start of each
shift, with each batch of patient specimens, and after any analyzer
maintenance or reagent changes.
7.2 Acceptance Criteria:
• Results of QC samples should be within the manufacturer's
specified range. If out of range, troubleshoot according to the
instrument manual and re-run QC and patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 Calculation:
• Total protein concentration is expressed in mg/dL or g/L,
according to the results generated by the analyzer.
8.2 Documentation:
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify results for abnormal patterns and consult with a supervisor
if necessary.
8.3 Reference Interval:
• Normal range for total protein in random urine: < 150 mg/L (this
range may vary slightly depending on the specific reagent and
analyzer in use).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Highly turbid or hemolyzed samples may interfere with the
analysis and should be indicated if results are questionable.
• Ensure samples are free from contamination that may affect the
measurement.
