1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for PROTEIN, TOTAL, SERUM to ensure accurate
and reliable measurement.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and reporting total serum protein tests.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred: Serum collected in a plain, red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST). Unacceptable: Specimens collected in tubes
containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, citrate, oxalate).
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated: 48 hours
• Frozen: ≤ -20°C; stable for 1 month
Note: Specimens should be transported to the laboratory promptly
and processed immediately upon receipt.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501 or
similar)
• Total protein reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific for total protein measurement
• Pipettes and appropriate tips
• Centrifuge
• Specimen tubes
• Waste disposal containers
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and controls are within
acceptable ranges.
2. Prepare reagents according to manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify specimens are acceptable. Reject and document any
unacceptable specimens.
4. Centrifuge specimens at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
5.2 Testing
1. Load specimens onto the automated chemistry analyzer.
2. Select the total protein test protocol on the analyzer.
3. Ensure calibrators and quality control materials are included in
the test run.
4. Initiate the test and allow the analyzer to perform
measurements.
5. Monitor the analyzer for any errors or irregularities during the
test run.
5.3 Analysis
1. Review the raw data generated by the analyzer.
2. Validate the data against controls and calibrators to ensure
accuracy.
3. Apply any necessary corrective actions for data outside
acceptable limits.
5.4 Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples at the start of each new batch of
tests.
2. Document quality control results and any necessary corrective
actions.
3. If quality control fails, do not report patient results until the issue
is resolved.
5.5 Reporting Results
1. Results should be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results in the LIS.
3. Ensure that the results are reported according to site-specific
guidelines.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Adults (≥18 years):
• Total Serum Protein: 6.0 – 8.3 g/dL
Pediatric reference ranges should be consulted for specimens from
patients <18 years.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for method limitations
specific to the reagent kit used.

1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing total serum protein tests must
adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor
to ensure compliance and provide training.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All activities related to total serum protein testing should be
documented in the appropriate logs and quality control records.
All documentation should be reviewed periodically to ensure
continuous compliance with the SOP and regulatory requirements.
