SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Protein, Total, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the accurate measurement
and reporting of total protein in spinal fluid specimens.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of
total protein in spinal fluid specimens within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure accurate analysis, documentation, and reporting of total
protein in spinal fluid. All equipment must be regularly maintained and
calibrated to ensure precise and accurate measurements.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimens: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), typically
collected via lumbar puncture.
• Volume: Minimum of 1.0 mL of CSF is required.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is not
performed immediately. For longer storage, freeze the specimens
at -20°C.
5. SPECIMEN REJECTION CRITERIA
• Specimens that are not properly labeled.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed.
• Specimens that are contaminated or show evidence of leakage.
• Insufficient volume to perform the test.
• Specimens that have not been stored correctly may be
considered unsatisfactory for analysis.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Spectrophotometer or automated analyzer capable
of measuring absorbance at the appropriate wavelength.
• Reagents:
◦ Protein determination reagent (e.g., Biuret reagent).
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to total protein analysis.
◦ Deionized water.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Calibration: Calibrate the analyzer using a protein standard
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Controls: Run low, normal, and high control materials to
ensure the accuracy and precision of the analyzer. Document
control results as per laboratory protocol.
B) Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Bring all CSF samples to room temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix the CSF sample gently by inverting the specimen tube
several times.
2. Blank and Calibration:
◦ Zero the spectrophotometer/automated analyzer with a
reagent blank (deionized water).
3. Sample/Test Procedure:
◦ Pipette the required amount of CSF sample into a clean test
tube.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of protein determination reagent
to the CSF sample and mix thoroughly.
◦ Incubate the mixture at room temperature or as per the
reagent manufacturer's recommendations.
◦ Measure the absorbance of the sample at the specified
wavelength (commonly 540-600 nm) using the
spectrophotometer/automated analyzer.
4. Data Recording:
◦ Record the absorbance readings for each sample and
compare them to the calibration curve to determine the total
protein concentration.
C) Quality Assurance
1. Control Results: Ensure that control results fall within the
acceptable range. If controls are out of range, recalibrate the
analyzer and repeat the analysis of patient samples.
2. Documentation: Document all calibrations, controls, and
sample measurements in the appropriate logs. Any deviations
or anomalies should be noted and reviewed as part of the
quality assurance process.
D) Reporting Results
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter the total protein concentration into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Verify and validate the results according to the laboratory’s
standard verification protocols.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Reference Intervals: Normal total protein levels for CSF are
typically 15-45 mg/dL, but this range may vary. Refer to the
laboratory’s established reference intervals for reporting.
3. Critical Values:
◦ Any results exceeding the laboratory’s critical values should
be immediately reported to the requesting physician or
clinical team according to the laboratory’s critical result
reporting policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• The total protein analysis should be performed in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions and laboratory protocols.
• Check reagents for expiration dates and proper storage
conditions.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
the laboratory’s equipment maintenance schedule.
• Document any discrepancies and corrective actions taken as part
of the quality control measures.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• CSF Total Protein: 15–45 mg/dL (or as defined by the
laboratory’s established reference range)
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or contaminated samples can interfere with the
accuracy of the protein measurement.
• Ensure proper sample handling and storage to avoid pre-
analytical errors.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert and operating manual for the protein
determination reagent kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
CSF analysis.
• Laboratory’s internal procedure manuals and quality control
documentation.
By adhering to this Standard Operating Procedure, the laboratory
ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible measurement of total
protein in spinal fluid specimens.
