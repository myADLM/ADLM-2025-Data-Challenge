Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Protein, Total, Urine, 24 Hour
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analysis and reporting of total protein in a 24-hour urine specimen
collected for clinical laboratory testing. This procedure ensures
accuracy, reliability, and consistency in testing results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis following
the procedures outlined in this document. It is the responsibility of the
staff to ensure that quality control measures are adhered to and that
any deviations or issues are promptly addressed and reported to the
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
The total protein in urine is determined to evaluate kidney function
and detect abnormal protein levels which may indicate disease.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection.
Urine Collection: - Ensure that the patient has collected all urine over
a 24-hour period. - The collection container should be refrigerated
throughout the collection period. - Ensure that the total volume of the
urine sample is measured and recorded. - Mix the collected urine
thoroughly before taking aliquot for testing.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Urine samples collected for less than 24
hours. - Samples without proper labeling (missing collection date/
time, patient identification). - Samples with visible contamination or
improper storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Urine containers
◦ Pipettes
◦ Protein reagent kit (manufacturer specific)
◦ Calibrators and Controls
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Spectrophotometer
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
2. Measure and record the total volume of the urine collection.
3. Aliquot a sample of the mixed urine into a labeled container for
analysis.
Analysis:
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform instrument calibration according to manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Run calibrators before analyzing patient samples to ensure
accuracy.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples (normal and abnormal) as per site-specific
guidelines to ensure proper instrument functioning.
◦ Record results and review for acceptance.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette a measured volume of urine sample into a test tube.
◦ Add the specific reagent according to the protein reagent kit
instructions.
◦ Mix the contents thoroughly.
◦ Incubate the mixture as per reagent kit instructions.
◦ Insert the tube into the spectrophotometer and record the
absorbance at the specific wavelength.
◦ Calculate the concentration of protein in the sample using
the calibration curve derived from the calibrators.
4. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the total protein concentration in the 24-hour urine
sample: Total Protein (mg/24 hours) = (Protein concentration
in the aliquot (mg/L)) * (Total volume of 24-hour urine (L))
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and verification:
1. Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before
reporting patient results.
2. Enter the calculated total protein concentration into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review.
3. Ensure that any flagged results or abnormal values are verified
and, if necessary, followed up with a repeat analysis or
additional checks.
Critical Results:
1. Report any critical values according to the facility’s critical
values policy.
2. Notify the appropriate clinical personnel with the necessary
documentation.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions or local reference values for
interpretation of total protein levels in 24-hour urine.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the protein reagent kit insert for individual assay limitations
and interfering substances. Ensure any deviations are documented
and addressed.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Record all results, QC data, calibration information, and any
troubleshooting actions taken during the analysis. Ensure data is
logged accurately in the LIS and in laboratory records.
