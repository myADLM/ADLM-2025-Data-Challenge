Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PROTEIN, TOTAL, URINE, RANDOM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for
analyzing and generating results for Total Protein in random
urine samples. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and
consistent results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of processing and reporting Total Protein in
random urine samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
adhering to this SOP during the analytical process.
◦ The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with this SOP and for addressing any issues
that arise during the testing process.
4. DEFINITION
◦ Total Protein in Urine, Random: A laboratory test that
measures the total amount of protein excreted in a random
urine sample. This test is valuable for detecting kidney
disease and monitoring various conditions affecting kidney
function.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Urine sample
◦ Reagent kit for Total Protein (Store according to
manufacturer instructions)
◦ Calibrators and controls (as per manufacturer's
recommendations)
◦ Automated or semi-automated chemical analyzers
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Urine cups or containers
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Urine Sample Handling and Preparation
1. Upon receipt, confirm that the urine sample is properly
labeled and has a collection time noted.
2. Ensure the urine sample is at room temperature before
beginning the analysis.
3. Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gentle inversion or
stirring.
4. If the sample contains visible particulate matter, centrifuge
the sample at 1500-2000 g for 5 minutes and use the
clear supernatant for analysis.
B) Reagent Preparation
1. Prior to use, inspect reagents for any signs of
contamination or expiration.
2. Prepare reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Reagents should be allowed to come to room temperature
before use.
C) Analyzer Preparation and Quality Control
1. Turn on the analyzer and allow it to complete initialization
and calibration steps as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples using known control
materials at appropriate levels (low, normal, high).
3. Document QC results on the QC log. Ensure that QC
results fall within the acceptable range. If QC results are
out of range, troubleshoot and re-run QC samples until
acceptable results are obtained.
D) Analytical Procedure for Total Protein
1. Load urine samples into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. If a manual procedure is used, pipette a specified volume
of the urine sample into the designated container or
cuvette.
3. Add the required volume of reagent(s) to the urine
sample.
4. Incubate the mixture at the recommended temperature
and time as specified in the reagent kit insert.
5. Measure the absorbance or signal generated by the
reaction product according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
6. Calculate the concentration of Total Protein using the
analyzer software or manually using the calibration curve.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Compare the result obtained with the reference interval
provided in the reagent kit insert or lab-specific guidelines.
◦ Distinguish between normal, borderline, and abnormal
results based on established clinical decision points.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ For abnormal results, immediately inform the responsible
clinician as per laboratory protocol.
◦ Document any comments or interpretations as required by
laboratory policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
◦ Reference intervals for Total Protein in random urine should
be obtained from the reagent kit insert or may be
determined by each laboratory based on population studies.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality control checks at the beginning of each shift,
after maintenance, and when a new reagent lot is used.
◦ Document all QC activities and results.
◦ Follow corrective actions for out-of-range QC results.
11. SAFETY AND HANDLING
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
when handling urine samples and reagents.
◦ Follow proper waste disposal protocols for biohazardous
materials.
12. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hematuria, pyuria, and high specific gravity can interfere
with protein measurements.
◦ Follow the limitations specified in the reagent kit insert.
13. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s reagent kit insert.
◦ Laboratory Safety and Quality Control Manuals.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated regularly to accommodate
any changes in technology, reagents, or practice guidelines to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability in the laboratory’s analytical
procedures.
