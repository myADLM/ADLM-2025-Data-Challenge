SOP for Analytical Testing of Protein, Total, Urine, Timed
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides the standard operating procedure for the
analytical phase of measuring total protein in timed urine samples.
This ensures consistent and accurate results critical for patient
diagnosis and management.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the clinical biochemistry laboratory
performing total protein analysis on timed urine specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow the
SOP for the total protein measurement in timed urine samples. It is
also their responsibility to report any discrepancies or issues
encountered during the process to the supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Timed Urine Collection: Urine samples collected over a
specified period, typically 24 hours.
• Total Protein (TP): The sum of all types of proteins present in the
urine.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Collection:
◦ Instruct the patient to discard the first urine sample upon
waking and then collect all urine for the next 24 hours,
including the first morning urine on the following day.
◦ Ensure the urine is collected in a clean, properly labeled
container and stored in a cool place during the collection
period.
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Complete and properly timed 24-hour urine collection, stored
at 4-8°C during and after collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected over a period different from the specified
time.
◦ Specimens not stored appropriately or samples with significant
contamination (e.g., feces).
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Clinical chemistry analyzer
• Calibrators and controls
• Urine reagent test strips for initial screening
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Test tubes and sample cups
• Centrifuge (if required per analyzer instructions)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. REAGENTS AND CONTROLS
• Total Protein reagent kits compatible with the clinical chemistry
analyzer
• Quality control materials at multiple levels (e.g., low, normal, high
protein concentrations)
• Calibrators for the specific measurement range
8. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Verify that the patient’s urine collection is complete and
properly labeled.
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Screen the urine sample with a reagent test strip to check
for interference substances (e.g., blood, glucose).
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Transfer an aliquot of the mixed urine sample to a sample
cup or test tube.
◦ Ensure the sample aliquot is appropriate for the analysis as
per the analyzer’s instructions.
3. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Turn on the clinical chemistry analyzer and allow it to warm
up according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform any required calibration using the appropriate
calibrators.
◦ Run quality control samples and ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
4. Measurement:
◦ Load the urine sample aliquot into the designated sample
holder or position on the analyzer.
◦ Enter the unique identification number for the patient
specimen in the analyzer's software.
◦ Select the appropriate assay method for total protein.
◦ Initiate the analysis as per the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Result Validation:
◦ Review flagging or error messages generated during the
test run.
◦ Compare the patient’s result with reference intervals and
controls.
◦ If controls are out of range, do not report results and
troubleshoot the issue.
6. Post-Analysis:
◦ Properly dispose of used materials following biohazard
waste protocols.
◦ Document all results and ensure proper data entry into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Store remaining urine samples as required by laboratory
policy for potential retesting.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS for review.
• Technologists validate and verify results as per the laboratory’s
verification process.
• Abnormal or critical values must be reviewed and communicated
as per established protocols.
• Final verified results are reported to the referring physician or
healthcare provider.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality controls with each assay batch.
• Document QC results and take corrective actions if QC results fall
outside acceptable ranges.
• Perform comparisons with previously validated results to ensure
instruments' consistency.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the clinical chemistry analyzer and
reagent kits.
• Laboratory quality control and assurance protocols.
• Relevant clinical biochemistry guidelines for total protein
measurement.
12. REVIEW/REVISION HISTORY
• Document review dates and any revisions made.
By following this SOP, laboratory technicians will ensure accurate and
reliable measurement of total protein in timed urine samples, aiding
in the proper diagnosis and treatment of patients.
Please ensure that the specific details of your laboratory’s equipment,
reagents, and procedures are incorporated as necessary.
