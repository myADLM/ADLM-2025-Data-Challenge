Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Prothrombin (Factor 2)
Gene Mutation Detection
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for detecting the Prothrombin
(Factor 2) gene mutation (G20210A) in human DNA samples through
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent analysis. The
purpose is to identify individuals carrying the mutation, which is
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred sample: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Alternative samples: Buccal swabs or saliva.
• Unacceptable specimens: Whole blood in tubes other than EDTA,
clotted blood samples, samples with low volume (< 1 mL), and
samples without proper labeling.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Sterile pipette tips
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents (e.g., Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific for
G20210A mutation)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Agarose gel
• Ethidium bromide or other DNA staining reagent
• Transilluminator
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from the collected specimen using the DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Quantify and check the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B. PCR Setup
1. PCR Reaction Preparation:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mixture containing:
▪ 10-20 ng of genomic DNA template
▪ Specific primers for the Prothrombin gene mutation
(forward and reverse)
▪ PCR buffer
▪ dNTPs
▪ Taq polymerase
▪ Sterile distilled water to make up the final volume
(typically 25-50 µL)
◦ Mix the components thoroughly by gently vortexing and
briefly centrifuge to collect the mixture at the bottom of the
tube.
2. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Set up the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
▪ Hold: 4°C until the samples can be processed further
C. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Preparation of Agarose Gel:
◦ Prepare 2% agarose gel in 1X TAE buffer and allow it to gel.
◦ Load the PCR products in separate wells of the agarose gel
alongside a DNA ladder as a molecular weight marker.
2. Running the Gel:
◦ Run the gel at 100-120 volts for approximately 45-60
minutes or until the dye front has migrated an appropriate
distance.
3. Visualization:
◦ Stain the gel with ethidium bromide or an alternative DNA
staining reagent according to standard protocols.
◦ Visualize the bands under a UV transilluminator and capture
the gel image.
D. Analysis
1. Interpretation:
◦ Assess the presence or absence of the mutation by
comparing the size of the PCR product bands.
◦ Homozygous normal individuals will show a single band
(wild-type allele)
◦ Heterozygous individuals will show two bands (one wild-type
and one mutant allele)
◦ Homozygous mutant individuals will show a single band
(mutant allele)
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings carefully, including the gel image, band
sizes, and interpretation of results in the appropriate
logbook or LIS (Laboratory Information System).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure the specificity and sensitivity of the assay.
◦ Validate each batch of reagents before use and maintain
records.
2. Troubleshooting:
• If any discrepancies or issues arise (e.g., nonspecific bands,
absence of bands), review the PCR reaction setup, cycling
conditions, and gel electrophoresis protocol.
• Repeat the experiment if necessary and inform the supervisor.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are documented and verified in the LIS. Critical or unusual
findings must be reviewed by the supervising technologist and, if
needed, confirmatory testing should be performed.
7. REFERENCES
Refer to the specific product inserts for the DNA extraction kit, PCR
reagents, and safety data sheets for ethidium bromide or alternative
staining agents.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to respective product inserts for specific limitations related to
reagent performance, potential PCR inhibitors, and environmental
factors that may impact amplification and detection sensitivity.
Note: All personnel handling PCR reagents, samples, and
equipment must be appropriately trained in molecular biology
techniques and adhere to laboratory safety regulations.
