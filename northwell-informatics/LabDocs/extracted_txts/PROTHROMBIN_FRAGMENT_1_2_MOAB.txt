Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Prothrombin
Fragment 1+2 MoAb Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Prothrombin Fragment 1+2
Monoclonal Antibody (MoAb) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) method in the laboratory, ensuring accuracy,
consistency, and compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel (technologists and technicians) are
responsible for executing the specific steps in this protocol, including
quality control, reagent preparation, sample analysis, and data
management. The supervising laboratory scientist ensures
adherence to the protocol and resolves issues arising during the
procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Specimen Type: Plasma collected in EDTA or citrate.
• Volume Required: At least 1 mL of plasma.
• Specimens should be centrifuged within 1 hour of collection to
separate plasma.
• Plasma should be aliquoted and stored at -20°C if not analyzed
immediately. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated ELISA reader with appropriate software
• ELISA microplate washer
• Microplate
• Adjustable pipettes and pipette tips
• Prothrombin Fragment 1+2 MoAb ELISA kit (store and handle
according to manufacturer's instructions)
• Deionized water
• Calibrated timer
• Disposable gloves and laboratory coat
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Plate Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before starting the assay.
2. Set up the microplate layout considering standards, controls,
and samples (duplicates recommended).
3. Prepare wash buffer by diluting the concentrated wash solution
provided in the ELISA kit (follow manufacturer’s instructions for
dilution ratio).
5.2 Sample and Reagent Addition
1. Pipette 100 μL of standards, controls, and samples into the
corresponding wells in duplicate.
2. Add 100 μL of the conjugate solution to each well.
3. Gently mix the plate by tapping the side or using a plate shaker
at low speed.
5.3 Incubation
1. Cover the plate with a plate cover or adhesive plate sealer.
2. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature (20-25°C).
5.4 Washing
1. After incubation, carefully remove and discard the plate sealer.
2. Aspirate the contents of each well.
3. Wash the wells 3-5 times with the prepared wash buffer using
an automated plate washer, following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Ensure complete removal of liquid after the
last washing step.
5.5 Substrate Addition and Incubation
1. Add 100 μL of substrate solution (TMB) to each well.
2. Incubate the plate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature,
avoiding direct sunlight.
5.6 Stopping Reaction
1. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well using the same
sequence and rate as for substrate addition to ensure uniform
color development.
5.7 Reading the Plate
1. Read the plate immediately using an ELISA reader set to the
appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620-690 nm).
2. Save and print the plate results.
6. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT GENERATION
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their concentrations.
2. Determine the concentrations of Prothrombin Fragment 1+2 in
the samples by interpolation from the standard curve using the
ELISA reader software.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run low and high control samples with each assay. Verify that
control results are within the acceptable range provided by the
manufacturer.
2. Document control results and analyze trends to detect shifts or
drifts.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all control data before reporting patient results.
2. Any questionable results must be re-evaluated, and the assay
repeated if necessary.
3. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review by the laboratory scientist.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Assay performance is reliable only when manufacturer’s
instructions are strictly followed.
2. Potential cross-reactivity or interfering substances in patient
samples must be considered.
