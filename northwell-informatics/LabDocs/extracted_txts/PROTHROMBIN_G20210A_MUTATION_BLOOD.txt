STANDARD OPERATING
PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF
PROTHROMBIN G20210A
MUTATION, BLOOD TESTING
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedure for the detection of Prothrombin G20210A
mutation in blood specimens following accessioning in the laboratory.
This document will detail the necessary steps to ensure the accurate
and reliable determination of the Prothrombin G20210A mutation
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel authorized and
trained to perform the Prothrombin G20210A mutation test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis, recording observations, and reporting results
according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that personnel are
trained and competent to perform the procedure.
• All personnel must comply with biosafety and quality assurance
protocols as specified.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 3 mL.
• Specimen Stability: Blood specimens should be stored at 2-8°C
if not processed immediately, and may be stored for up to 72
hours. Longer storage times require freezing at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• PCR workstation equipped with thermal cycler.
• Reagents for DNA extraction including lysis buffer, protease, and
ethanol.
• PCR Master Mix containing DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and MgCl2
(commercially prepared).
• Primers specific for Prothrombin G20210A mutation.
• Positive and negative control samples.
• PCR tubes and appropriate pipetting tools.
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus and reagents (for post-PCR
product analysis).
• UV transilluminator for visualization of gel results.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) DNA EXTRACTION:
1. Lysis of Blood Cells:
◦ Add 200 µL of blood to 800 µL of lysis buffer.
◦ Incubate at 56°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Add 20 µL of protease enzyme and incubate at 56°C for
additional 15 minutes.
2. DNA Precipitation:
◦ Add 400 µL of a precipitation reagent (e.g., ethanol or
isopropanol).
◦ Mix by inverting the tube 5-10 times.
◦ Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
3. DNA Resuspension:
◦ Remove the supernatant carefully.
◦ Rinse the DNA pellet with 70% ethanol.
◦ Air-dry the pellet and resuspend it in 50 µL of nuclease-free
water.
B) PCR AMPLIFICATION:
1. PCR Mixture Preparation:
◦ Prepare PCR Master Mix as follows for each reaction:
▪ 12.5 µL Master Mix containing DNA polymerase
▪ 0.5 µL Forward Primer (10 µM concentration)
▪ 0.5 µL Reverse Primer (10 µM concentration)
▪ 10.5 µL Nuclease-free water
▪ 1 µL Template DNA (extracted above)
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Load the PCR mixture into PCR tubes.
◦ Place tubes in the thermal cycler and run the following
program:
1. Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
2. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
3. Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds for 35 cycles
4. Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
5. Final Extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
C) POST-PCR ANALYSIS:
1. Gel Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
◦ Load 5 µL of each PCR product mixed with loading dye into
the wells of the gel.
◦ Perform electrophoresis at 100 volts for approximately 45
minutes.
2. Gel Visualization:
◦ Visualize the gel under a UV transilluminator.
◦ Compare the PCR product sizes to a known DNA ladder
and determine the presence or absence of the mutation
based on the resulting band patterns.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Compare the band pattern of the test samples with the positive
and negative controls:
◦ Presence of bands identical to positive control indicates the
mutation.
◦ Absence of bands indicates negative for the mutation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Follow routine calibration and maintenance schedules for thermal
cyclers and gel electrophoresis equipment.
• Document all steps, controls, and observations in the laboratory
records.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Transmit results to the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
• Report should include collection details, test performed, and final
mutation status (positive/negative with band size details).
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow all laboratory biosafety guidelines including use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all blood samples as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all waste materials appropriately according to
laboratory protocols.
11. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction kit.
• PCR Master Mix and thermal cycler user manuals.
• Relevant scientific literature for Prothrombin G20210A mutation
detection.
