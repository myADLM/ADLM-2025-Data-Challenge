SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Prothrombin
Time Mix 1:1, Plasma
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
ensure the accurate and precise determination of Prothrombin Time
(PT) Mix 1:1 in plasma samples.
2. Scope:
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analysis of
Prothrombin Time using the PT Mix 1:1 method in the laboratory.
3. Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing all steps involved in the analysis.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any issues or deviations promptly.
4. Definitions:
• PT: Prothrombin Time is a measure of the time taken for blood to
clot.
• Mix 1:1: Refers to the diagnostic procedure where patient plasma
is mixed with normal pooled plasma to determine if a prolonged
PT is due to a deficiency of clotting factors or the presence of an
inhibitor.
5. Equipment and Reagents:
• Coagulation Analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500)
• Normal Pooled Plasma (NPP)
• PT Reagent (e.g., Thromboplastin)
• Calibration and Quality Control (QC) materials (e.g., normal and
abnormal control plasmas)
• Pipettes and tips
• Tubes for mixing
• Timer
• Plasma samples from patients
6. Procedure:
6.1 Preparation:
1. Ensure the Coagulation Analyzer is set up and calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Verify that the PT reagent, normal pooled plasma, and QC
materials are not expired and are within their stability period.
3. Allow all reagents and normal pooled plasma to come to room
temperature before use.
6.2 Mixing Procedure:
1. Prepare a 1:1 mix by combining equal volumes (e.g., 0.5 mL
each) of patient plasma and normal pooled plasma in a clean
tube.
2. Gently mix the contents of the tube by inverting it 3-5 times. Do
not vortex.
6.3 Measurement:
1. Aspirate the mixed plasma into the Coagulation Analyzer.
2. Run a PT assay on the mixed sample as per the analyzer’s
standard operation procedure.
3. Record the clotting time in seconds as indicated by the
analyzer.
6.4 Analysis and Calculation:
1. Perform the PT test on the patient’s plasma sample alone (non-
mixed) if not already done.
2. Compare the PT time of the patient plasma with the PT time of
the 1:1 mixed plasma sample.
3. Interpret the results: A significant correction (approaching the
normal range) indicates a factor deficiency. Minimal or no
correction suggests the presence of an inhibitor.
7. Quality Control:
1. Run normal and abnormal control plasmas with each batch of
tests to ensure the accuracy and precision of results.
2. Document all QC results in the QC log. Any QC failures must
be investigated and resolved before reporting patient results.
8. Reporting Results:
1. Record and verify all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Include the PT time for both the patient sample (non-mixed) and
the 1:1 plasma mix.
3. If necessary, include additional comments based on the
interpretation (e.g., suggestive of factor deficiency or inhibitor).
9. Reference Intervals:
• Refer to laboratory-specific reference intervals for PT. Typically,
PT is provided with a reference interval for normal plasma based
on laboratory calibrations and analyzer specifications.
10. Method Limitations:
• Hemolysis or lipemia in plasma samples may interfere with PT
measurements.
• Ensure proper mixing; incomplete mixing can lead to erroneous
results.
11. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Coagulation Analyzer
• Thromboplastin reagent insert
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
Coagulation Testing
12. Documentation:
• All steps, results, QC data, and any corrective actions taken must
be documented and reviewed for completeness and accuracy.
