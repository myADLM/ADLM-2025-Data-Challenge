Standard Operating Procedure
Prothrombin Time (PT) - Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for measuring Prothrombin Time (PT) in
plasma samples using the laboratory’s designated analyzer, ensuring
accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing
PT testing. PT testing is used to evaluate the extrinsic pathway of
coagulation and monitor patients on anticoagulant therapy.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
PT testing according to this SOP. The supervisor must ensure all
personnel are trained and competent.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Plasma collected in sodium citrate
anticoagulated tube (light blue top).
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2.7 mL
• Processing: Centrifuge specimens at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at
room temperature to obtain plasma.
• Stability: Plasma specimens are stable at room temperature for
up to 4 hours. If analysis cannot be performed within 4 hours,
plasma should be frozen at -20°C and is stable for up to one
week. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PT reagent kit validated for use with the analyzer
• Calibrators and controls specific for PT testing
• Analyzer with appropriate software
• Pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Supplies for reporting results: Laboratory Information System
(LIS)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Analyzer Preparation:
1. Turn on the analyzer and ensure it completes its initialization
procedures.
2. Verify that necessary reagents, controls, and calibrators are
loaded and within their expiration date.
3. Run quality control (QC) samples for PT following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure QC results are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
4. Document QC results in the QC log along with date, time, and
initials.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Obtain plasma sample and allow it to reach room temperature if
previously refrigerated or thawed.
2. Mix the sample by gentle inversion to ensure homogeneity.
3. Load the patient sample into the sample holder of the analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
C. Running Patient Samples:
1. Access the PT testing menu on the analyzer.
2. Enter patient identification details as required.
3. Select the patient sample for analysis and initiate testing as per
the analyzer’s instructions.
D. Result Interpretation:
1. Once the analyzer completes the test, review the PT result.
2. Check for any flags or error messages. If an error occurs,
address according to the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide, and
repeat the test if necessary.
3. Verify that results are within reasonable and expected ranges.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Enter the PT results into the LIS following site-specific
guidelines.
2. If results are critical, follow the laboratory’s critical result
notification procedure to inform the responsible clinician
immediately.
3. Document all steps performed, any issues encountered, and
actions taken during testing in the laboratory log.
F. Post-Analysis:
1. Dispose of all biohazard waste according to the laboratory
safety protocol.
2. Perform routine maintenance on the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Store reagents, controls, and calibrators under specified
conditions.
G. Quality Control:
1. Perform QC tests according to the laboratory’s QC plan.
2. Review and document QC data for any trends or shifts, and
take corrective action if necessary.
3. Keep a log of all calibrations, maintenance, and troubleshooting
performed on the analyzer.
7. REFERENCE INTERVAL & REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Interval:
◦ Normal Range: 11-14 seconds
◦ INR (International Normalized Ratio): 0.8-1.2 (Note: Reference
ranges may vary based on the reagent and instrument used;
validate according to manufacturer's guidelines).
• Results must be reviewed, verified, and reported in compliance
with site-specific reporting guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations related to the
PT reagent kit used. Results can be affected by:
• Improper specimen collection
• Hemolyzed or clotted samples
• Incorrect handling and storage of reagents and samples
• Technical errors during analysis
