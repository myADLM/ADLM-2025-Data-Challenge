Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Prothrombin Time (PT),
50:50 Mix, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide the procedure for determining Prothrombin Time (PT) and
50:50 mix for plasma samples to ensure accurate and reliable
results. This test evaluates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and
monitors the effectiveness of oral anticoagulant therapy. The 50:50
mix study is performed to identify the presence of factor deficiencies
or inhibitors.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing PT and 50:50 mix in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
the test accurately and to follow this protocol meticulously. It is the
supervisor's responsibility to verify the results and maintain quality
control standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Freshly collected plasma in sodium citrate (3.2%) tube.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted samples.
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples that have been stored at room temperature for more
than four hours.
• Samples without proper labeling or patient information.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulometer or automated coagulation analyzer
• Thromboplastin reagent (commercially available, validated
according to the manufacturer's instructions)
• 0.9% normal saline
• Pipettes and tips, calibrated
• Test tubes
• Water bath or heat block (37°C)
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal levels)
• Timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Verify the patient information with the test request form.
2. Label the test tubes with appropriate identifiers.
3. Obtain the reagents and equipment as listed above.
B. Prothrombin Time (PT) Test:
1. Centrifuge the sodium citrate tube at 1,500-2,500 g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Transfer the plasma into a labeled test tube, avoiding the buffy
coat and red cells.
3. Set up the coagulometer or automated analyzer following the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Pipette 100 µL of plasma into a test well.
5. Add 200 µL of thromboplastin reagent prewarmed at 37°C.
6. Initiate the timer simultaneously with the addition of the reagent.
7. Record the clotting time when the analyzer signals the end of
the test.
C. 50:50 Mix Study:
1. Prepare patient plasma by combining equal volumes with
normal pooled plasma (NPP).
2. Example: Mix 100 µL of patient plasma with 100 µL of NPP.
3. Pipette 100 µL of the prepared 50:50 mix into a test well.
4. Add 200 µL of thromboplastin reagent prewarmed at 37°C.
5. Initiate the timer simultaneously with the addition of the reagent.
6. Record the clotting time when the analyzer signals the end of
the test.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples (both normal and abnormal) at the
beginning of each shift, after reagent change, and after
maintenance.
2. Record and review QC results to ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
3. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to
laboratory protocol, and do not report patient results until the
issue is resolved.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify the PT time and the 50:50 mix results.
2. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
3. Enter results into the LIS and ensure timely and accurate
reporting to the physician.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• PT: 11-13.5 seconds (or as per laboratory standard)
• INR: 0.8-1.2 (for patients not on anticoagulant therapy)
Note: Reference intervals should be validated by the laboratory in
coordination with the clinical guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with results.
• Samples older than 4 hours may not provide accurate results.
• Thromboplastin reagent variations require validation with each lot.
11. REFERENCES
• Thromboplastin reagent manufacturer’s insert.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory internal validation and quality control procedures.

This protocol ensures the accuracy and reliability of the PT and 50:50
mix plasma tests, meeting the diagnostic needs while maintaining
compliance with regulatory standards. This document should be
regularly updated and reviewed for adherence to the latest clinical
practices.
