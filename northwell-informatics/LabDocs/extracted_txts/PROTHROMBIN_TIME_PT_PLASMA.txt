Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
TITLE: Prothrombin Time (PT) Testing - Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for generating accurate and
reliable Prothrombin Time (PT) results in plasma samples in the
laboratory environment.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing PT
testing and ensuring accurate, timely results. It is the responsibility of
all staff to identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the testing
process and report them to a supervisor immediately.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PT Analyzer
• PT Reagent (such as RecombiPlasTin)
• Calibration and control materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable cuvettes or test tubes
• Centrifuge (if required for plasma separation)
• Plasma samples
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Freshly collected citrated plasma.
• Acceptable: Plasma stored at 2-8°C (must be tested within 24
hours of collection).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples collected in tubes other than citrate.
• Clotted samples.
Procedure:
1. Sample Collection and Storage:
◦ Ensure samples are collected in properly labeled 3.2%
sodium citrate tubes.
◦ Centrifuge specimens at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to obtain
platelet-poor plasma.
◦ Aliquot plasma into a clean tube, avoiding the buffy coat and
red cells.
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C if not tested immediately. Plasma
may be stored frozen at -20°C for longer storage, ensuring
samples are thawed and mixed thoroughly before analysis.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare PT reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Reconstitute lyophilized reagents using distilled water, if
applicable.
◦ Allow reagents to reach room temperature before use.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the PT analyzer using calibration
material from a recognized supplier.
◦ Document the calibration procedure, results, and any
adjustments made to the analyzer.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run at least two levels of control material (normal and
abnormal) with each batch of tests and at the start of each
shift.
◦ If controls fall outside of the acceptable range, recalibrate
the instrument and repeat controls before running patient
samples.
◦ Document control results, corrective actions taken, and
supervisory reviews.
C) Testing Procedure
1. Running the Test:
◦ Equilibrate the PT reagent and samples to room
temperature (18-24°C).
◦ Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 100 µL) of plasma into
a cuvette or test tube.
◦ Add the prepared PT reagent (e.g., 200 µL) to the plasma.
◦ Start the analyzer timer upon reagent addition and measure
the clotting time.
D) Result Interpretation
1. Calculations:
◦ The analyzer will display the Prothrombin Time in seconds.
◦ Calculate the International Normalized Ratio (INR) using the
formula: [ \mathrm{INR} = \left( \frac{\mathrm{PT(patient)}}
{\mathrm{PT(normal)}} \right)^{\mathrm{ISI}} ]
◦ Where PT(patient) is the patient's Prothrombin Time,
PT(normal) is the normal control PT, and ISI is the
International Sensitivity Index of the reagent.
2. Reference Ranges:
◦ PT: 10-14 seconds (may vary depending on method and
reagents, refer to specific laboratory reference interval).
◦ INR: 0.8-1.2 for non-anticoagulated patients.
E) Troubleshooting
1. Abnormal Results:
◦ Ensure there are no pre-analytic errors (e.g., improper
specimen collection/storage).
◦ Repeat the test if results are outside the expected ranges
and controls were acceptable.
◦ Verify the ISI value with the reagents and analyzer
documentation.
2. Instrument Alerts/Errors:
◦ Follow analyzer's troubleshooting guidelines for resolving
errors.
◦ Contact technical support if issues persist.
5. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Document all patient results, control results, calibration data, and
any issues or corrective actions taken.
• Report results according to laboratory policies, including critical
values.
• Review and verify results prior to releasing to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Maintain records of all quality control and calibration activities.
• Participate in regular proficiency testing as mandated by
regulatory authorities.
• Review and update the SOP annually or as needed based on
changes in procedures or equipment.
