Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Protoporphyrins Fractionation in
Washed Erythrocytes
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical processes required for generating accurate and
reliable results for Protoporphyrins, Fractionation, Washed
Erythrocytes testing. This protocol ensures standardized procedures
for the determination of Protoporphyrins to deliver consistent and
reproducible results while maintaining the highest quality standards.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing and documenting the analytical procedures as outlined
in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to report any anomalies
or deviations during the testing procedure to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Protoporphyrins are a group of organic compounds that are critical
intermediates in the biosynthesis of hemoglobin. Fractionation of
Protoporphyrins in erythrocytes involves isolating and quantifying
various Protoporphyrin species present in the red blood cells.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen:
• Acceptable Specimen: Blood collected in EDTA tubes, washed
erythrocytes prepared according to the appropriate pre-analytical
procedure.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens with improper labeling,
hemolyzed samples, or those arriving after the stipulated stability
period.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• Fluorometer or HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography)
system as specified in the procedural methods.
• Calibrated pipettes and micropipettes.
• Lab centrifuge.
• Washing buffer, extraction solvents, and fractionation reagents.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
Sample Preparation:
1. Receive washed erythrocytes sample as per pre-analytical
procedure.
2. Transfer required volume of washed erythrocyte suspension
into labeled centrifuge tubes.
3. Centrifuge the tubes at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes, carefully
remove the supernatant.
4. Wash erythrocytes twice with washing buffer, centrifuging and
removing supernatant after each wash.
5. Resuspend erythrocytes in appropriate buffer for fractionation
process.
Protoporphyrins Extraction:
1. Aliquot resuspended erythrocytes into designated extraction
tubes.
2. Add extraction solvent in a ratio of 2:1 (solvent:sample).
3. Vortex the tubes for 30 seconds to ensure complete mixing.
4. Incubate the tubes in the dark at room temperature for 30
minutes.
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes. Carefully
collect the supernatant.
Fractionation Procedure: HPLC Method:
1. Prepare HPLC system adhering to manufacturer guidelines.
2. Set the HPLC column suitable for Protoporphyrin fractionation
as specified in the method.
3. Inject aliquots of the supernatant onto the HPLC column.
4. Run the gradient elution program optimized for Protoporphyrins
separation.
5. Monitor the effluents using a fluorescent or UV detector
dependent on the specific Protoporphyrin absorption spectra.
6. Collect chromatogram data, identify peaks corresponding to
different Protoporphyrins.
7. Analyze and quantify Protoporphyrin fractions by comparing
them to standard calibration curves.
Fluorometric Assay:
1. Calibrate the fluorometer using Protoporphyrin standards
before sample analysis.
2. Pipette extracted supernatant into fluorometer cuvettes.
3. Measure fluorescence intensity at appropriate excitation/
emission wavelengths specified for Protoporphyrin subtypes.
4. Record fluorescence readings and correlate them with the
standard calibration curves to quantify Protoporphyrins.
Reporting Results:
1. Validate and review chromatogram or fluorescence data.
2. Enter the quantified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Verify and sign-off results ensuring compliance with quality
control norms.
4. If there are any deviations or unexpected results, consult with
the supervisor for further guidance.
Quality Control:
• Run Protoporphyrin standards and internal controls alongside
patient samples to ensure consistency.
• Document any anomalies during instrument runs and take
corrective action as needed.
