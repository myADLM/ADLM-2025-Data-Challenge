Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analysis of Protoporphyrins
Fractionation in Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for generating
analytical results for protoporphyrins fractions (free
protoporphyrin and zinc protoporphyrin) in whole blood
specimens. This SOP ensures reliability and consistency in the
results generated.
2. SCOPE: This protocol applies to the analysis of protoporphyrins
fractions in whole blood using a fluorometric method. It is
intended for use by all laboratory staff trained in this procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis following this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance, proper
maintenance of equipment, and calibration of instruments used in
the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
◦ Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA
anticoagulant tubes.
◦ Volume: At least 2 mL of whole blood.
◦ Stability: Samples should be analyzed within 7 days of
collection if stored at 2-8°C.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Fluorometer: Calibrated and maintained according to
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Reagents:
▪ Acidic extraction solution (e.g., dilute trichloroacetic acid)
▪ Calibration standards for free protoporphyrin and zinc
protoporphyrin
▪ Internal Quality Controls
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Test tubes
◦ Vortex mixer
3. PROCEDURE: A. Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the whole blood sample gently to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Pipette 0.5 mL of whole blood into a test tube.
3. Add 2.0 mL of acidic extraction solution to the test tube
containing the blood.
4. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute to ensure complete
extraction of protoporphyrins.
B. Centrifugation:
1. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube.
C. Fluorometric Analysis:
1. Turn on the fluorometer and perform a blank reading with
acidic extraction solution.
2. Calibrate the fluorometer using calibration standards for
free protoporphyrin and zinc protoporphyrin.
3. Analyze the prepared sample by placing the supernatant
into the sample holder of the fluorometer.
4. Record the fluorescence intensities for both free
protoporphyrin and zinc protoporphyrin.
D. Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control materials with known
concentrations of protoporphyrins immediately before,
during, and after the batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure that all quality control results are within acceptable
limits before validating patient results.
4. CALCULATIONS:
◦ Using the fluorescence readings, calculate the
concentrations of free protoporphyrin and zinc
protoporphyrin based on the calibration curve obtained from
the standards.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and verify the results according to laboratory protocols.
◦ Report results with reference intervals:
▪ Free Protoporphyrin: Refer to clinical guidelines.
▪ Zinc Protoporphyrin: Refer to clinical guidelines.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
◦ Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure all reagents and quality control materials are stored
and used according to manufacturer recommendations.
◦ Document any deviations from the procedure and notify the
supervisor immediately.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer instructions for the fluorometer and reagents.
• Clinical guidelines for protoporphyrin fractionation in blood.
1. REVISION/REVIEW DATE:
◦ Document to be reviewed annually or more frequently if
required due to updates in methodology or instrumentation.
This SOP provides a comprehensive guide for the analysis of
protoporphyrins in whole blood, ensuring the accuracy and reliability
of test results. All staff must adhere strictly to these procedures to
maintain the quality and integrity of laboratory services.
