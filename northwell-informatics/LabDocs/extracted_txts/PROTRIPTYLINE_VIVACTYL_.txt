Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Generating Protriptyline
(Vivactyl) Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate and reproducible
results for the clinical testing of Protriptyline (Vivactyl) levels in blood
samples. This process will involve preparing samples, running tests,
performing quality control, and reporting results in accordance with
established laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
these procedures and ensure accurate results. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing and verifying the results before they are
reported.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the quantitative analysis of Protriptyline
(Vivactyl) in human blood specimens using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) or another suitable analytical method as per
the laboratory’s capabilities.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• 5 mL of whole blood collected in a gold or red top (serum) tube.
• Samples should be properly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Samples with insufficient volume or improperly labeled
specimens.
1. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Protriptyline standard
• Internal standard (if applicable)
• Mobile phase solvents for HPLC (water, acetonitrile, etc.)
• Buffer solutions
• Calibration verifiers
Materials:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge tubes
• Vials for HPLC
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Water bath or heating block
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, centrifuge the blood sample at 2000-3000 RPM
for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
2. Transfer the clear serum to a labeled transfer tube, avoiding
any cellular components.
B. Standard Preparation:
1. Prepare a Protriptyline standard solution series for calibration
using appropriate diluents.
2. Store prepared standards at 2-8°C until use.
C. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Run calibration standards and internal quality control samples
at the beginning of each run and after every 20 samples or as
required.
2. Ensure calibration curves meet laboratory acceptance criteria.
D. Test Procedure:
1. Inject a fixed volume (e.g., 10 µL) of sample into the HPLC
system.
2. Use a column temperature of 30°C and a mobile phase at a
flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3. Detect protriptyline at a suitable wavelength (e.g., 220 nm).
E. Data Analysis:
1. Use the HPLC software to generate a chromatogram and
interpret the peaks.
2. Compare sample peak areas with those of the standards to
quantify the Protriptyline concentration.
F. Results Reporting:
1. Verify results by comparing measured quality control results to
expected ranges.
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Flag any critical or significantly out-of-range results for
supervisor review.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control samples (negative, low, medium, and high)
in each batch of testing.
• Document all QC data and ensure it falls within the specified
limits.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat the analysis of affected samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All validated results must be entered and verified in the LIS before
reporting.
• Ensure that any flagged or critical results are reviewed and
verified by a supervisor.
• Notify requesting physicians of critical results as per laboratory
protocol.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic Range: 150-250 ng/mL
• Toxic Range: >300 ng/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and other sample interferences can affect the
results.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained regularly per
laboratory protocol.
