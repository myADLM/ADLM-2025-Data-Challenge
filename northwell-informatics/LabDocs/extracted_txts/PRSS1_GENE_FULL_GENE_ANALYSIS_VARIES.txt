1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedure for the accurate and
reliable analysis of the PRSS1 gene, full gene analysis. The
procedure covers all aspects of the analytical phase, including DNA
extraction, amplification, sequencing, and data interpretation to
ensure the generation of accurate genetic test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of molecular laboratory personnel to perform
the test according to this protocol and to handle and analyze samples
in compliance with established laboratory safety and quality
procedures.
1. DEFINITIONS
PRSS1 Gene: Encodes for cationic trypsinogen, a pancreatic
enzyme precursor, and mutations in this gene are associated with
hereditary pancreatitis.
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
i) Purpose: To extract high-quality genomic DNA from peripheral
blood or other acceptable tissue types. ii) Equipment and Reagents: -
DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit) -
Microcentrifuge tubes - Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab
coat, eye protection) - Ethanol (96-100%) - Reagents and buffers
included in the kit iii) Procedure: 1. Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for the DNA extraction kit. Ensure to include appropriate
controls. 2. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA
using spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and gel electrophoresis.
B) PCR Amplification of PRSS1 Gene
i) Purpose: To amplify the full coding region and exon-intron
boundaries of the PRSS1 gene. ii) Equipment and Reagents: -
Thermal cycler - PCR primers specific for PRSS1 gene exons - DNA
polymerase (e.g., Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase) - dNTP mix - PCR
buffer with MgCl2 - Nuclease-free water - PCR tubes iii) Procedure:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix on ice with the following
components: - DNA template: 50-100 ng - Forward and reverse
primers: 0.4 µM each - dNTP mix: 200 µM - DNA polymerase: 1.25
units - PCR buffer to final volume as specified by manufacturer -
Nuclease-free water to complete the final volume (usually 50 µL) 2.
Set up the thermal cycler program: - Initial denaturation: 95°C, 5
minutes - Denaturation: 95°C, 45 seconds - Annealing: temperature
according to primer melting temperature, 45 seconds - Extension:
72°C, 1 minute per kb - Final extension: 72°C, 10 minutes - Hold: 4°C
indefinitely 3. Verify amplification by running a sample of the PCR
product on an agarose gel.
C) Sanger Sequencing
i) Purpose: To sequence the PCR-amplified regions for the detection
of mutations in PRSS1. ii) Equipment and Reagents: - Capillary
electrophoresis sequencer (e.g., ABI 3730) - BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit - PCR cleanup reagents (e.g., ExoSAP-IT) iii)
Procedure: 1. Purify the PCR product using appropriate cleanup
methods. 2. Set up the sequencing reaction using BigDye Terminator
chemistry. 3. Purify sequencing products. 4. Load samples onto the
sequencer and perform capillary electrophoresis as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
D) Data Analysis
i) Purpose: To analyze sequencing results and identify mutations. ii)
Equipment and Reagents: - Bioinformatics software (e.g., Sequencer,
Geneious) iii) Procedure: 1. Import sequencing data into the analysis
software. 2. Align sequences to the reference PRSS1 gene
sequence. 3. Identify and annotate variants in the amplified regions.
4. Interpret clinical significance of detected variants based on
literature and mutation databases (e.g., ClinVar).
E) Quality Control
i) Purpose: To ensure accuracy and reliability of test results. ii)
Procedure: 1. Include positive and negative controls in every assay
run. 2. Verification of sequencing quality metrics (Phred score ≥ 20).
3. Document and report any anomalies or unexpected results to the
supervisor.
F) Reporting Results
i) Purpose: To generate and report test results in compliance with
laboratory standards. ii) Procedure: 1. Review and validate sequence
data to ensure completeness and accuracy. 2. Draft a comprehensive
report including detected variants and their clinical significance. 3.
Review results with a board-certified molecular geneticist for final
approval. 4. Submit report to the ordering physician and maintain a
copy in the laboratory information system (LIS).
