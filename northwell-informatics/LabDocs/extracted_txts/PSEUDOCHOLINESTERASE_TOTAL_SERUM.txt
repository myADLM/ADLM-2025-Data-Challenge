Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Pseudocholinesterase, Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures necessary for the accurate and
consistent analysis of Pseudocholinesterase, Total, Serum levels in
patient specimens. The goal is to ensure reliable and timely results
for clinical decision-making.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all
staff to identify, document, and report any issues or deviations in
testing to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Preferred Collection Container: Red-top tube
Alternate Collection Container: Serum separator tube (SST)
Specimen Handling:
◦ Collect venous blood via standard venipuncture technique.
◦ Allow the specimen to clot completely at room temperature
(usually about 30 minutes).
◦ Centrifuge the clotted specimen as soon as possible to
avoid hemolysis.
Specimen Stability and Storage:
◦ Serum specimens are stable at:
▪ Room temperature (15-25°C) for up to 8 hours.
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 72 hours.
▪ Frozen (-20°C or colder) for up to 1 month.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated Chemistry Analyzer
◦ Pseudocholinesterase Reagent Kit (Ensure it is compatible
with the analyzer)
◦ Calibrators and Controls
◦ Micropipettes and Tips
◦ Test Tubes/ Sample Cups
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Reagents Setup and Storage:
• Store reagents as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Reconstitute reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure that all reagents and controls are within their expiration
date before use.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration as specified in the analyzer's user
manual.
◦ Use manufacturer-provided calibrators. Ensure calibrators'
expiration dates are checked and recorded.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, normal, and high) before
patient samples.
◦ Document QC results and verify that they fall within the
established acceptable range.
◦ Repeat any out-of-range QC results and resolve issues
before proceeding with patient samples.
B. Sample Preparation and Analysis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix gently
by inversion.
◦ Inspect the serum for any hemolysis or clot formation and
document any specimen condition issues.
◦ Label the sample cups appropriately.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the samples, reagents, and controls onto the
automated analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Select the appropriate test protocol for
Pseudocholinesterase, Total, Serum on the analyzer.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Initiate the run process as per analyzer operating
procedures.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any errors or warnings during the
run.
◦ Review the initial results for duplicate or delta checks.
C. Result Validation:
1. Validation:
◦ Check that results for control samples are within the
acceptable range before validating patient results.
◦ Review flagged results and re-run tests if necessary.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all results in the Lab Information System (LIS).
◦ Record any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis and your corresponding corrective actions.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS from the
analyzer.
◦ Confirm the accuracy of data entry by cross-checking
against initial analyzer printouts.
◦ Review results in the LIS for consistency and flag any
critical values requiring immediate clinician notification.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal Range: [Insert Reference Range based on laboratory-
specific data and manufacturer recommendations]
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure QC material storage, preparation, and handling
follow manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Verify that controls are analyzed correctly with every batch
of patient specimens.
◦ Note any methodological limitations, including possible
interferences or sample conditions that could affect results.
