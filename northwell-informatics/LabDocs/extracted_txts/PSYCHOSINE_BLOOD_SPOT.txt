Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for PSYCHOSINE, BLOOD SPOT
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedures for analyzing
PSYCHOSINE levels in blood spot specimens following collection,
receipt, and accessioning to ensure consistent and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for executing the
analysis of PSYCHOSINE in blood spot specimens according to
this procedure.
• Supervisors must ensure the protocol is followed strictly, manage
any deviations, and facilitate necessary corrective actions.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Blood spot collected on specialized filter paper
(e.g., Whatman® 903 or equivalent).
• Volume: A minimum of five properly collected and dried blood
spots.
• Storage: Keep blood spots at room temperature or refrigerated
until analysis. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight and high humidity.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or other
approved analytical instrument.
• Specialized reagents for PSYCHOSINE extraction and
quantification.
• Pipettes and microcentrifuge tubes.
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles.
• Standard Operating Procedure documentation
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
1. Prepare all required reagents and calibration standards
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Use freshly prepared reagents and ensure that all expiration
dates are within valid range.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Punch out predetermined areas from the dried blood spot using
a standardized puncher.
2. Place each blood spot puncher into labeled microcentrifuge
tubes.
3. Add the extraction solvent and internal standard solution
specific to the PSYCHOSINE assay.
4. Vortex the tubes for a specified duration to ensure complete
extraction.
5. Centrifuge the samples at high speed for the recommended
duration.
C. Instrument Setup and Calibration
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibrate the instrument with prepared calibration standards.
3. Ensure the instrument’s temperature, humidity, and other
operation conditions are within specified tolerances.
D. Analysis
1. Inject the prepared samples into the LC-MS/MS instrument.
2. Run the analysis according to the specified instrument
parameters.
3. Verify the instrument settings periodically and intervene if any
alerts or abnormal readings occur.
E. Data Collection and Quality Control
1. Gather the raw data from the instrument for each sample.
2. Run quality control samples and check that they fall within the
expected range.
3. If QC samples are outside the expected parameters,
troubleshoot, and re-run as necessary. Notify the supervisor.
F. Result Calculation and Reporting
1. Calculate the concentration of PSYCHOSINE in each specimen
using the instrument’s software.
2. Review all result data carefully. Remove any data with
significant deviations or instrument errors and reanalyze.
3. Report results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by a trained technologist.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Prior to analysis, run three levels of control material to ensure
instrument accuracy.
• Document all QC procedures and results in the laboratory logs.
• Investigate any QC failures immediately and take corrective
action until the integrity of the analysis is restored.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure to refer to the instrument and reagent insert for any
limitations or interferences associated with the PSYCHOSINE
assay.
• Be aware of potential issues with age or condition of blood spot
specimens affecting the result accuracy.
8. REFERENCES
Refer to manufacturer's product insert for liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) details and guidelines specific to
PSYCHOSINE assay and blood spot specimens.
9. REVIEW AND VERIFICATION
• Results should be reviewed by a supervisory level technologist
before verification in LIS.
• Ensure all calculations are verified and recorded accurately in
patient reports.
10. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow standard corrective actions for instrument calibrations and
deviations.
• Notify supervisor immediately for any significant deviations that
can't be rectified through routine procedures.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all instrument logs, QC data, and reports as part of the
permanent laboratory records.
• Ensure all documentation complies with regulatory and
accreditation standards.
This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with latest industry standards and technological
advancements.
