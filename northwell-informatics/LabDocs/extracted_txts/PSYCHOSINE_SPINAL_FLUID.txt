Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Psychosine in
Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of testing spinal fluid samples for psychosine levels in the
laboratory. The analytical phase includes the proper handling,
preparation, analysis, and reporting of results to ensure accurate and
timely results for patient care.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel trained in this
procedure are responsible for performing the analysis according to
this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
that all staff members are adequately trained and that the procedure
is followed consistently.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• A minimum of 1 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected in a
sterile container.
• The specimen must be stored and transported at 2-8°C and
should be processed within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 2 hours or refrigerated for more than 24 hours.
• Specimens collected with visible hemolysis or contamination.
• Specimens with incorrect labeling or missing collection time.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Psychosine standard solutions (calibrator and control material)
• Internal standard (if applicable)
• Reagent kits specific for psychosine analysis
• Appropriate chromatographic columns for the analytical technique
used (e.g., HPLC, LC-MS/MS)
• Mobile phases as required by the analytical method
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., pipettes, centrifuge tubes,
filters)
• Sterile containers for receiving CSF specimens
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and personal protective equipment
(PPE)
1. EQUIPMENT
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) system
• Centrifuge capable of maintaining 2-8°C
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes with disposable tips
• Analytical balance (calibrated)
• Data acquisition and analysis software
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify the specimen for correct labeling and
integrity.
2. Record specimen details in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Centrifuge the CSF sample at 2-8°C for 10 minutes at 1500 x g
to remove any particulate matter.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and store at 2-8°C until
analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run calibration standards and QC samples at the beginning of
each analytical batch.
3. Verify that calibration curves and QC results meet the
acceptance criteria specified by the analytical method.
C. Analytical Procedure (using LC-MS/MS):
1. Prepare the chromatographic system as per manufacturer’s
instructions and equilibrate the system with the appropriate
mobile phase.
2. Inject blank, calibration standards, QC samples, and CSF
specimens into the LC-MS/MS system in the prescribed
sequence.
3. Set the detection parameters specific to psychosine, ensuring
optimal sensitivity and specificity.
4. Acquire and record chromatographic data for all injections.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatographic data using the software
associated with the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Validate calibration curves and ensure QC results are within
acceptable limits.
3. Calculate psychosine concentrations in CSF samples using the
calibration curve.
4. Review and verify the results for accuracy.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Enter the psychosine concentrations into the LIS.
7. Ensure all calculated results are within the assay’s dynamic
range. For values above the upper limit, report as "> [limit]." For
values below the lower limit, report as "< [limit]."
8. Include appropriate comments on the report for any sample that
required special handling or demonstrated any interference.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Quality control samples should be analyzed with each batch of
patient samples to verify the accuracy and reliability of results.
11. Document and investigate any QC failures. Repeat analysis if
necessary.
12. Participate in external quality assessment programs to ensure
the method’s performance is maintained.

• Analytical method insert and protocol provided by the reagent kit
manufacturer.
• Instrument manuals for HPLC or LC-MS/MS system used.

1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
2. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
3. Handle all specimens with care, following standard precautions
to prevent exposure to biohazards.
4. Dispose of waste according to established laboratory safety
protocols and local regulations.
5. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP must be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
reflect new guidelines, method modifications, and laboratory
experiences.
