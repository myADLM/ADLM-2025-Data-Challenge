Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Psychosine, Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase in generating
accurate and reliable laboratory results for psychosine levels in whole
blood specimens.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as defined in this SOP.
• Supervisory personnel are responsible for ensuring that staff are
adequately trained and that all procedures are followed and
documented correctly.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of whole blood specimens for
psychosine levels using appropriate instrumentation and
methodologies within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Psychosine: A glycosphingolipid that accumulates in individuals
with Krabbe disease, making it a crucial biomarker for diagnosis
and monitoring.
• Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• 2-5 mL of whole blood collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection. If
delayed, refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or collected in tubes other
than EDTA or heparin.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
instrument
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrated analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Reagent kit for Psychosine analysis
• Control and calibrator materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use two levels of Psychosine quality control materials (low and
high) with each batch of specimens.
• Controls and calibrators should be stored and prepared as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all QC results and take corrective action if any results
fall outside the acceptable range.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Allow whole blood specimen to reach room temperature if
refrigerated.
2. Mix the specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
3. Aliquot 200 µL of whole blood into a labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
4. Add 600 µL of extraction reagent (provided in the reagent kit) to
the aliquot.
5. Vortex mix for 1 minute.
B) Centrifugation:
1. Centrifuge the mixture at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean labeled tube
without disturbing the pellet.
C) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Perform system checks on the LC-MS/MS instrument, including
calibration, tuning, and blank runs.
2. Prepare a calibration curve using calibrators at different
concentration levels of psychosine.
3. Inject 10 µL of extracted supernatant into the LC-MS/MS for
analysis.
4. Ensure the presence of proper quality control samples (low/
high) in the run.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatograms and mass spectrometry data using
the instrument’s software.
2. Compare the results to the calibration curve to quantify
psychosine levels.
3. Review the QC results. If controls fall outside the acceptable
range, initiate corrective actions and do not report patient
results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) where
they must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
• Critical values should be reviewed and, if necessary,
communicated to the ordering physician promptly.
• Record any unusual findings or potential issues that might affect
the accuracy of the results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range for psychosine levels will be established based on
validation studies and indicated in the LIS.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly participate in external quality assessment (EQA)
programs.
• Review and update SOP annually or as needed based on
advancement in technology, best practices, or accreditation
requirements.
1. REFERENCES
• Package insert for psychosine reagent kit.
• Manufacturer's instructions for LC-MS/MS equipment.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
PPE.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to established
protocols.
• Handle all chemicals according to their Material Safety Data
Sheets (MSDS).
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure high-quality and
accurate results for psychosine analysis in whole blood specimens.
