Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Psychotropic Pharmacogenomics Gene
Panel
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for psychotropic
pharmacogenomics gene panel testing, which informs personalized
medication management for patients undergoing treatment with
psychotropic drugs.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow this procedure
meticulously to ensure the quality and accuracy of test results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this protocol and for addressing any issues that may arise during the
analytical phase.
3. SAMPLE
Specimen Requirement:
• Preferred: Whole blood collected in EDTA (purple-top) tubes.
• Alternative: Buccal swab or saliva sample collected using an
appropriate collection device.
Specimen Stability:
• Whole blood: Stable for up to 7 days when stored at 4°C.
• Buccal swab/saliva: Stable for up to 14 days at room temperature
when collected in the appropriate preservation medium.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are clotted or hemolyzed.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens not received in designated collection containers.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kit (validated for gene panel use)
• Real-time PCR reagents and consumables
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Nanodrop spectrophotometer
• Genotyping software
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Verify the specimen and accession number.
2. Perform DNA extraction using a validated DNA extraction kit.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer.
4. Check the quality and concentration of DNA. Adjust the
concentration to 20 ng/µL for PCR.
5.2 PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the reagent
manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Add DNA template to each tube/plate well.
4. Load tubes/plate into the thermal cycler.
5. Run the PCR using the validated cycling parameters for the
gene panel.
5.3 Real-Time PCR and Genotyping:
1. Prepare the real-time PCR reaction mix, including probes
specific for the targeted gene variants.
2. Aliquot the reaction mix into the real-time PCR plate.
3. Add amplified DNA to each well.
4. Perform real-time PCR on the designated instrument.
5. Monitor the amplification curves and derive genotypes using
genotyping software.
5.4 Data Analysis:
1. Review amplification curves to assess the quality of the PCR
run.
2. Generate genotype calls using validated genotyping algorithms.
3. Confirm variant detection and validate against control samples.
4. Interpret results according to the established reference ranges
and medical guidelines for psychotropic pharmacogenomics.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls in parallel with patient
samples to ensure assay integrity.
2. Document all QC results and corrective actions for any
deviations.
External Quality Assessment:
1. Participate in proficiency testing and external quality
assessment programs.
2. Evaluate performance by comparing results with external
benchmarks.
7. ERROR HANDLING
Invalid Results:
1. Invalidate and document any results with poor amplification
curves or inconclusive genotypes.
2. Investigate and resolve the cause of the invalid result.
3. Repeat the test from re-extracted DNA if necessary.
Critical Results:
1. Flag and prioritize reporting of critical gene variants that may
significantly impact psychotropic medication efficacy and safety.
2. Notify the ordering physician promptly following institutional
guidelines for reporting critical results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify and review all results before reporting.
2. Transmit results electronically to the LIS.
3. Ensure results are available for clinician review and
interpretation.
