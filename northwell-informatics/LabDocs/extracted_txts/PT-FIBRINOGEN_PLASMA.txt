Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PT-Fibrinogen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedure for
analyzing PT-Fibrinogen (Prothrombin Time-Fibrinogen) in plasma,
ensuring accurate and reliable results for patient diagnosis and
treatment.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
procedure, documenting the results, and maintaining quality control.
It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues with the
procedure that could affect laboratory test results and bring them to
the attention of a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
PT-Fibrinogen is a test that measures both the prothrombin time and
the fibrinogen level in plasma. It is used to assess the blood clotting
ability and to diagnose bleeding disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Sodium citrate anticoagulated plasma.
• Specimens must arrive in the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection. If a delay is unavoidable, specimens should be
centrifuged, and plasma should be frozen at -20°C and tested
within 2 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in any anticoagulant other than sodium
citrate.
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or excessively lipemic samples.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 2 hours after
collection without prior centrifugation and freezing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer
• PT reagent (containing thromboplastin and calcium)
• Fibrinogen calibrator
• Quality control plasma (normal and abnormal)
• Sodium citrate tubes
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature
unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.
2. Check the expiration date of the reagents and controls. Do not
use expired reagents.
3. Verify the calibration status of the coagulation analyzer.
B) Specimen Handling:
1. Centrifuge the sodium citrate blood samples at 1500g for 15
minutes at room temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Carefully transfer the plasma into labeled tubes, avoiding the
buffy coat and red cells.
3. If immediate testing is not possible, freeze the plasma aliquots
at -20°C.
C) Running the Test:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for loading reagents,
controls, and plasma specimens into the coagulation analyzer.
2. Perform a test run with quality control plasmas at the beginning
of each day, whenever a new lot of reagents is opened, and
with each new batch of patient specimens.
3. Load patient plasma specimens into the analyzer according to
the instrument protocol.
4. Document the start time, date, and initial of the operator.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run two levels of quality control (normal and abnormal) with
each batch of patient specimens.
2. Review and document quality control results.
3. Acceptable control ranges should be determined by the
manufacturer and verified by the laboratory.
4. If quality control results are out of range, do not report patient
results. Investigate and troubleshoot the issue, rerun controls,
and document all actions.
E) Interpreting Results:
1. PT results will be displayed in seconds and the International
Normalized Ratio (INR).
2. Fibrinogen levels will be displayed in mg/dL.
3. Review both PT and fibrinogen results for each patient
specimen.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results should be reviewed for accuracy and consistency by
the technologist.
6. Verified results should be promptly transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. Critical values should be reported immediately to the ordering
physician per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals:
• PT: Refer to manufacturer’s guidance or laboratory-defined
reference ranges.
• Fibrinogen: 200-400 mg/dL (or as defined by the laboratory).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control materials should be run daily or according to the
laboratory’s quality control plan.
• Any deviation from established quality control ranges should be
investigated, and corrective actions documented.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for specific limitations
of the reagents and analyzer.

1. REVISIONS
• This SOP is subject to revision based on updated guidelines or
procedural changes.
