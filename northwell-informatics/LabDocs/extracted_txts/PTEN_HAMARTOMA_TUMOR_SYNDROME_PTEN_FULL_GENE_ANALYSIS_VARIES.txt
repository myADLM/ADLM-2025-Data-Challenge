Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for PTEN Hamartoma Tumor
Syndrome (PHTS) Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP aims to outline the procedures for the comprehensive
analysis of the PTEN gene to diagnose PTEN Hamartoma Tumor
Syndrome (PHTS). This includes the guidelines for DNA extraction,
amplification, sequencing, and interpretation of results to ensure
consistent, accurate, and reliable detection of PTEN gene mutations.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel performing PTEN gene analysis are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance and to address any
deviations from the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
• Saliva or buccal swabs are stored in DNA stabilization solution.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed blood samples.
• Clotted samples.
• Specimens not properly labeled or lacking collection information.
Specimen Storage:
• Blood specimens: Store at 2–8°C and extract DNA within 48
hours.
• Saliva/buccal swabs: Store at room temperature up to 30 days
before DNA extraction.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen)
• PCR equipment and reagents
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Sanger sequencing reagents and instruments (e.g., ABI 3500
Genetic Analyzer)
• PTEN-specific primers
• Automated sequencer (alternatively NGS platform)
• Thermal cycler
• Pipettes and filter tips
• PCR tubes and plates
1. PROCEDURE
DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from blood or saliva/buccal samples using a
validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Follow manufacturer instructions for DNA quantification and
ensure DNA concentrations are appropriate for downstream
processing (typically 10-50 ng/µL).
PCR Amplification:
1. Design primers to cover all coding exons and flanking intronic
regions of the PTEN gene.
2. Set up PCR reactions using extracted DNA as templates, PCR
buffer, MgCl2, dNTPs, forward and reverse primers, Taq DNA
polymerase, and nuclease-free water.
3. Amplify using a thermal cycler with the following conditions:
Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes Denaturation: 95°C for
30 seconds Annealing: 58-62°C (primer-specific) for 45
seconds Extension: 72°C for 1 minute Repeat for 35 cycles
Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
4. Confirm successful amplification by running 10 µL of PCR
product on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Prepare sequencing reactions according to the protocol for
Sanger sequencing.
3. Use the ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer for sequencing, adhering to
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Data Analysis:
1. Analyze sequencing data using appropriate software (e.g.,
SeqScape).
2. Align sequences to a reference PTEN sequence (e.g.,
GenBank Accession Number: NM_000314).
3. Identify and annotate any variants detected.
4. Confirm findings with a secondary method if necessary.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Include positive control samples (known PTEN mutations) and
negative controls (water blanks) in each run.
7. Ensure all equipment and reagents are calibrated and
validated.
8. Participate in proficiency testing programs and compare results
with external laboratories.
9. Document and review all QC results regularly.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Interpret the results based on detected mutations and clinical
relevance.
12. Generate a comprehensive report including:
• Patient identification
• Specimen information
• Methodology
• Results, including detected mutations
• Interpretation of findings
• Recommendations for clinical follow-up
1. Review and sign off on reports before releasing to the
requesting healthcare provider.
2. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Pathogenic mutations: Report as positive with clinical
significance.
• Likely pathogenic mutations: Recommend further clinical
correlation and family studies.
• Variants of uncertain significance (VUS): Report with
recommendations for additional testing or pedigree analysis.
• Benign and likely benign variants: Report as negative/
inconsequential.

the procedures.
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to
remain current with advancements in methodology and technology.
