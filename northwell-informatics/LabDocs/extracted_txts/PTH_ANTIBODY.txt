SOP Title: Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to provide guidelines for the analytical phase of generating
results for Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) antibody testing. This
procedure ensures the reliability and accuracy of the test results.
2. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to all personnel performing the
PTH Antibody test in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to ensure that this procedure is followed
accurately to produce valid and reliable test results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-sensitivity immunoassay analyzer
• Calibrated micropipettes (20-200 µL; 100-1000 µL)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator
• Freezer (-20°C)
Reagents and Supplies:
• PTH Antibody reagent kit
• PTH control samples (low, medium, high)
• Calibrators
• Sample cups or tubes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Gloves
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL
• Specimen Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if
analyzed within 24 hours or frozen at -20°C for prolonged storage.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
should be avoided as they may interfere with the test results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control: Include low, medium, and high controls
with each batch of tests. Ensure results are within the acceptable
range before releasing patient results.
• External Quality Control: Participate in an external quality
assessment (EQA) program to compare laboratory performance
with peer laboratories.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation: a. Upon receipt, allow reagents and samples to
reach room temperature. b. Gently mix the reagents by
inversion or vortexing. Do not shake. c. Verify expiry dates and
document any kit lot numbers.
2. Calibrator and Control Preparation: a. Prepare calibrators
and controls according to the manufacturer’s instructions. b.
Label tubes appropriately.
3. Assay Procedure: a. Load reagents, calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into the analyzer according to manufacturer’s
instructions. b. Set up the analyzer as per the specific assay
protocol, including selecting the PTH assay program if
applicable.
4. Running the Test: a. Start the run according to the instrument-
specific SOP. b. Monitor the run periodically to ensure there are
no instrument errors or reagent issues.
5. Result Validation: a. Upon completion of the assay, review the
quality control results to ensure they are within the acceptable
range. b. Validate and release patient results only if quality
control results meet acceptance criteria.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify results before reporting to the appropriate
medical personnel.
• Any results outside the set reference range must be flagged and,
if necessary, revalidated.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference range for PTH levels should be established
based on internal validation and compared with manufacturer’s
guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Any factors that may affect PTH results such as hemolysis,
lipemia, and improper storage should be carefully managed.
• Cross-reaction with other antibodies or high-dose hook effect
should be considered when interpreting results.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control results fall outside the acceptable range: a. Recheck
reagent and calibrator preparation. b. Re-run controls. If the issue
persists, do not report results and consult a supervisor.
• Instrument malfunctions should be addressed according to the
instrument manual. Contact technical support if necessary.
