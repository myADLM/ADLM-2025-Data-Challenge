Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PUMPKIN SEED, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed guidelines for the
analysis of pumpkin seed-specific IgE levels in serum specimens
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the testing
and analysis of serum specimens for pumpkin seed-specific IgE
levels.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
adhere to this SOP during the analytical phase of testing. Laboratory
personnel must ensure that results are accurate, timely, and properly
documented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Specimen Type - Serum
4.2. Specimen Collection - Collect blood specimens using standard
venipuncture technique. - Transfer blood into a serum separator tube
(SST).
4.3. Specimen Handling and Stability - Allow blood to clot at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes. - Centrifuge for 10 minutes at
1500-2000 x g to separate serum. - Transfer the serum into a clean,
labeled specimen container. - Store serum at 2-8°C if tested within 7
days. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
4.4. Unacceptable Specimens - Severely hemolyzed, lipemic, or
icteric specimens. - Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin, citrate). - Specimens with insufficient volume or
improper labeling.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
5.1. Reagents - Pumpkin seed-specific IgE ELISA kit. - Wash buffer,
substrate solution, stop solution, and controls provided with the
ELISA kit.
5.2. Equipment - ELISA reader (capable of measuring absorbance at
the required wavelength) - Centrifuge - Micropipettes (variable
volumes) - Vortex mixer - Timer
5.3. Supplies - Micropipette tips (sterile, disposable) - ELISA plates
(96-well) - Laboratory tissues/wipes - Additional control and calibrator
materials as required
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation - Bring all reagents and specimens to room
temperature before starting the assay. - Perform all steps at room
temperature unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer’s
instructions.
6.2. Assay Procedure (following manufacturer’s protocol) Steps may
include but not be limited to: 1. Label required number of wells on the
ELISA plate for standards, controls, and specimens. 2. Add
standards, controls, and serum specimens to designated wells. 3.
Add the enzyme conjugate to each well. 4. Incubate the plate at room
temperature for a specific time (as per kit instructions). 5. Wash the
plate multiple times using the supplied wash buffer. 6. Add substrate
solution to each well and incubate at room temperature for
designated time. 7. Add stop solution to each well. 8. Measure
absorbance at the specified wavelength using the ELISA reader.
6.3. Result Calculation - Generate a standard curve by plotting the
absorbance values of the standards versus their concentrations. -
Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of IgE in the
specimens. - Ensure that control results fall within the expected
range before validating patient results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Internal Quality Control - Run positive and negative controls in
each assay to ensure assay performance. - Ensure controls fall
within the manufacturer’s specified acceptable range. If controls fail,
do not report patient results and troubleshoot the assay.
7.2. Documentation - Record all observations, control results, and
specimen results in the corresponding laboratory log. - Any
deviations from the protocol and corrective actions taken must be
documented.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1. Result Interpretation - Interpret pumpkin seed-specific IgE levels
based on the standard curve results. - Report units as specified by
the ELISA kit manufacturer (e.g., IU/mL).
8.2. Result Verification - Review and validate all results before
entering them into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
8.3. Critical Results - If critical values are identified, notify the
requesting physician immediately and document the communication
in the laboratory records.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Utilize the reference intervals provided by the ELISA kit
manufacturer or those established by the laboratory as per
validation.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific troubleshooting
guidelines. Address potential issues with assay performance,
including failed controls, inadequate sample volume, or equipment
malfunctions. Consult with a supervisor or technical support as
needed.
