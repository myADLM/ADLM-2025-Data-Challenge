Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Purines and Pyrimidines Panel, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing purines and pyrimidines in
plasma samples to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated trained personnel to follow
this protocol strictly to generate results for purines and pyrimidines
analysis. It is also their responsibility to ensure the equipment is
properly maintained and calibrated, and to document all procedures
and results according to laboratory standards.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Plasma
Collection Tubes:
• Collect blood in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
• Centrifuge the blood samples at 1500 for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Carefully transfer the plasma to a properly labeled polypropylene
tube.
Specimen Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of plasma is required.
Storage and Stability:
• Plasma specimens should be stored at -80°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Specimens are stable for up to 6 months when stored at -80°C.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system.
• Mass Spectrometer (MS) or diode array detector.
• Purine and pyrimidine standards.
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid).
• Column specifically designed for nucleotide analysis.
• Sample vials and caps.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Calibration and quality control materials.
4. REAGENTS PREPARATION
Mobile Phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid. Mobile Phase B:
Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
Standards Preparation:
• Prepare purine and pyrimidine standards at the required
concentrations by diluting appropriate stock solutions in mobile
phase A.
• Store standards at -20°C when not in use.
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration using a series of standard concentrations for
each analyte.
• Quality control samples should be run with each batch of patient
samples to ensure accuracy of analysis.
• Document calibration curves, quality control results, and any
deviations or corrective actions taken.
Quality Control Check:
• Three levels (low, medium, and high) of quality control (QC)
materials should be prepared.
• Run QC materials at the beginning, middle, and end of the
sample batch.
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw the plasma samples at room temperature and mix by
gentle vortexing.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 15000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial.
Instrument Setup and Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC/UHPLC system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and ensure that the column is
equilibrated with the mobile phase.
2. Program the gradient elution method appropriate for nucleotide
analysis.
3. Inject an appropriate volume (e.g., 10-20 µL) of standards,
QCs, and plasma samples into the system.
4. Analyze samples under the set chromatographic conditions and
detect using MS or diode array detector.
Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Process the chromatographic data using the instrument
software.
2. Integrate the peaks corresponding to each analyte.
3. Compare the sample analyte peaks to the calibration curve to
quantify the concentration of each purine and pyrimidine in the
plasma samples.
4. Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify for accuracy.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the results for quality control outliers, and sample
integrity.
2. Validate the results by cross-referencing with quality control and
previous runs if necessary.
3. Report the concentrations of each purine and pyrimidine
analyte in the plasma specimen to the ordering physician or
electronic medical records (EMR) as per laboratory protocols.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Every analytical run must include calibration standards and
quality controls to ensure accuracy.
2. If quality control fails, do not report patient results. Re-calibrate,
rerun controls, and troubleshoot the potential sources of error
until resolved.
3. Document any deviations, corrective actions taken, and
revalidate the system if necessary.
9. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
1. Follow all safety guidelines for handling biological specimens
and hazardous chemicals.
2. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
3. Dispose of samples and reagents following biohazard and
chemical waste protocols.
10. DOCUMENTATION
1. Maintain detailed records of all procedures, maintenance,
calibrations, quality controls, sample data, and reported results.
2. Ensure all logs and documentation comply with CLIA
regulations and laboratory standards.

pyrimidine analysis.
End of Protocol
This protocol should be reviewed and updated regularly to
incorporate advances in technology and changes in regulatory
guidelines. Ensure all laboratory personnel are trained on this SOP
before performing analysis.
