Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Purines and
Pyrimidines Panel, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedural steps required for the analysis of purines
and pyrimidines in a random urine sample, ensuring accurate and
reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting this analysis according to the defined procedures. It is
the duty of all laboratory personnel to bring any discrepancies or
issues to the attention of their supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Random urine sample.
Collection Instructions:
• Collect the urine sample in a clean, dry, leak-proof container.
• Send the sample to the laboratory as soon as possible. If a delay
is unavoidable, refrigerate the sample.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples that are not correctly labeled or lack patient
identification.
• Urine samples that have been improperly stored, leading to
contamination or degradation.
• Any sample received more than 24 hours after collection if not
properly refrigerated.
4. EQUIPMENT AND GENERAL SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system.
• Analytical balance.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Appropriate tubes and vials.
• Purine and pyrimidine standards.
• Mobile phase solvents.
• Calibration curves and control samples.
• Reagent-grade water.
5. REAGENTS AND PREPARATION
• Mobile Phase: Prepare according to manufacturer or validated in-
house protocol.
• Internal Standards: Prepare according to protocol. Store at
appropriate conditions.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Sample Handling
1. Receiving and Accessioning:
◦ Verify the sample against the requisition form.
◦ Accession the sample into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500-2000 RPM for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial without disturbing
the sediment.
3. Aliquoting:
◦ Use a micropipette to transfer a defined volume (e.g., 1 mL)
of the urine sample into an analytical vial.
◦ Add the internal standard (if applicable) following the
validated protocol.
Instrument Setup and Calibration
1. Calibrating the HPLC:
◦ Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
recommendations and validated protocols.
◦ Run calibration standards to ensure the system accuracy.
Calibration should include at least five levels covering the
expected analytical range.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning, after every 10
samples, and at the end of the batch.
◦ Acceptable ranges for QC samples must be defined by the
laboratory validation data.
Sample Analysis
1. Injecting Samples:
◦ Load the prepared samples, standards, and controls onto
the HPLC auto-sampler.
◦ Start the run sequence, ensuring all samples are correctly
labelled and tracked in the system.
2. Data Acquisition:
◦ Monitor the instrument continuously to ensure it remains
within operational parameters.
◦ Document any instrument deviations or issues in the
instrument maintenance log.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ After the run, review chromatograms and integration data for
accuracy.
◦ Use the calibration curve to quantify the concentrations of
purines and pyrimidines in the urine samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Validation and Verification:
◦ Verify that all quality control samples are within the defined
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
◦ Investigate and resolve any out-of-range QC values before
proceeding.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter the results into the LIS manually or through an
automated interface, ensuring that all data transfer is
accurate.
◦ Any discrepancies found during data entry must be rectified
immediately and documented.
3. Result Reporting:
◦ Review the preliminary results before authorization.
◦ Upon verification, authorize the release of the results in
compliance with laboratory policies.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Regularly maintain and verify the calibration of all instruments.
• Perform regular internal and external quality assessments in
alignment with the laboratory’s quality management system.
• Record and investigate any quality control failures, implement
corrective actions, and document all quality-related activities.
9. MAINTENANCE
• Routine maintenance and cleaning schedules for the HPLC and
other instruments must be adhered to as per manufacturer
guidelines.
• Carry out preventive maintenance, performance checks, and
recalibrate instruments as needed.
