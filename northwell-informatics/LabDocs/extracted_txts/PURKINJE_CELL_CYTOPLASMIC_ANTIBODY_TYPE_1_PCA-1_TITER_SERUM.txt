Standard Operating Procedure for PCA-1 Titer, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytic procedure for the titration and
determination of Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody Type 1 (PCA-1)
in serum. This protocol ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and
reliability of test results.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform these
procedures and to identify any issues that may affect the integrity of
the results. Supervisors must ensure the procedure is executed and
documented as defined.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL serum collected in a red-top tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed serum samples.
• Serum samples not stored at 2-8°C prior to analysis.
• Samples that are not clearly labeled with patient information and
collection time/date.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader calibrated for the appropriate wavelength.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge for serum separation.
• Water bath or heating block.
Reagents:
• ELISA kit for PCA-1 (including all necessary buffers, controls, and
substrate).
• Wash buffer solution.
• Substrate solution.
• Stop solution.
Supplies:
• Micropipettes (10-100 µL).
• Reagent reservoirs.
• Microplates.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents to room temperature before starting the
assay.
2. Prepare wash buffer according to ELISA kit instructions.
3. Label microplate according to the assay layout.
Assay Procedure:
1. Serum Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge collected blood specimens at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a new tube, avoiding cellular components,
and store at 2–8°C until analysis.
2. ELISA Protocol:
◦ Add standards and controls to the appropriate wells as
outlined in the kit instructions.
◦ Dilute test serum samples as necessary (typically 1:100 in
specimen diluent or as specified by the manufacturer).
◦ Add diluted serum samples to the designated wells (usually
100 µL per well).
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Wash the microplate 3 times with the wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugated detection antibody to
each well and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash the microplate 3 times with the wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate
at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength (typically 450 nm) using a microplate reader.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Record the absorbance values for each standard, control, and
sample.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
each standard against its known concentration.
3. Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
PCA-1 in the serum samples.
4. Interpret results based on the laboratory's established reference
intervals and clinical guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Include both positive and negative controls in each assay run to
ensure assay integrity.
Quality Control Measures:
• Review standard curve and control results: If the controls fall
outside of predetermined ranges, the run is invalid and must be
repeated.
• Perform regular equipment maintenance and calibration
according to the equipment manufacturer’s guidelines.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate results before releasing them to ensure
accuracy.
• Critical results, if identified (e.g., unexpectedly high PCA-1 titers),
should be promptly communicated to the attending physician and
documented as per lab policy.
