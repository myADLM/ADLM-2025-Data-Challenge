Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Purkinje Cell
Cytoplasmic Antibody Type 1 (PCA-1) Titer, Spinal Fluid
Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for analyzing and reporting Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody
Type 1 (PCA-1) Titer in spinal fluid specimens in a CLIA-
certified laboratory setting.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all medical laboratory staff
involved in the processing, analysis, and reporting of PCA-1
Titer, Spinal Fluid.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to follow this SOP accurately to ensure the
integrity of the test results. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the protocol and
addressing any deviations.
4. DEFINITIONS Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody Type 1
(PCA-1): An autoantibody associated with certain
paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, targeting neuronal cells
in the cerebellum.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL CSF required
◦ Stability:
▪ Room Temperature (20-26°C): Stable for 4 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for 5 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for 1 month
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) slides specific for PCA-1
◦ Fluorescent microscope
◦ Control samples (positive and negative)
◦ Diluent buffer
◦ PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
◦ Coverslips
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Humid chamber
◦ Gloves and lab coat
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform a quality control check with each batch of tests
using positive and negative control samples
◦ Document all QC results; any deviations must be resolved
before continuing with patient specimens
8. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Review and verify specimen information to ensure proper
identification and integrity.
2. Gently mix the CSF sample if it has been refrigerated or
frozen and brought to room temperature.
B. Dilution of Specimen
1. Prepare a series of dilutions of the CSF sample using the
diluent buffer (e.g., 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, etc.).
C. Application to Slides
1. Apply 10 µL of each diluted specimen to the designated
well on the IIF slide.
2. Add 10 µL of positive and negative controls to their
respective wells on the slide.
3. Place the slides in a humid chamber and incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
D. Washing
1. After incubation, wash the slides gently in PBS for 5
minutes.
2. Repeat the wash step twice for a total of three washes.
3. Carefully dry around the wells by blotting paper to remove
excess liquid.
E. Staining
1. Apply the fluorescent-tagged anti-human immunoglobulin
reagent to each well.
2. Incubate the slides in a humid chamber at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Repeat the washing steps as detailed above.
F. Mounting and Microscopy
1. Apply a coverslip to each slide using mounting medium.
2. Observe each well under a fluorescent microscope at an
appropriate magnification.
3. Identify and record the presence of characteristic PCA-1
staining patterns.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record the titer of the highest dilution at which specific
PCA-1 staining is identifiable.
◦ Include both qualitative (positive/negative) and quantitative
(titer) results in the report.
◦ Review and verify all results before entering them into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Report results to the requesting clinician following site-
specific reporting guidelines.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No significant staining
• Positive: PCA-1 staining observed, with the titer indicating the
highest dilution at which staining is seen.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inappropriate specimen handling can compromise result validity.
• Non-specific staining can occur; results should be interpreted in
the context of clinical findings.
