STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR PURKINJE
CELL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODY TYPE 2 (PCA-2) TITER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody Type 2 (PCA-2) Titer, Serum
test is used to detect the presence of antibodies specific to Purkinje
cells in the cerebellum. This protocol outlines the steps to be followed
during the analytical phase to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel trained in the handling and
processing of serum samples, and in conducting immunoassays, are
responsible for carrying out and documenting the procedures outlined
in this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
PCA-2 antibodies are autoantibodies targeted against antigens
present within the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The
presence of these antibodies in a patient's serum is associated with
paraneoplastic neurological syndromes and some autoimmune
conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) and allow it
to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1,500-2,000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum from the clot.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled tube.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected using EDTA, citrate, or other anticoagulants.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) Kit specific for PCA-2
• PBS buffer (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-human IgG
secondary antibody
• Positive and negative control sera
• Glass slides with fixed and prepared cerebellar tissue sections
• Cover slips
• Fluorescence microscope
Procedure:
A. Preparation of Serum Sample:
1. Aliquot serum into properly labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
2. Store the serum at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours; for longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Dilution of Serum:
◦ Prepare serial dilutions of the patient serum (e.g., 1:10,
1:20, 1:40 up to 1:1280) in PBS buffer.
2. Slide Preparation:
◦ Place 10 µL of each serum dilution onto separate pre-fixed
cerebellar tissue sections on glass slides.
◦ Incubate the slides in a humid chamber at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
3. Washing Steps:
◦ Rinse the slides gently with PBS buffer to remove unbound
antibodies.
◦ Wash the slides by immersing in fresh PBS buffer for 5
minutes. Repeat this step twice.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply 10 µL of FITC-labeled anti-human IgG secondary
antibody to each section.
◦ Incubate slides in a humid chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes in the dark.
5. Final Washing Steps:
◦ Rinse slides gently with PBS buffer to remove unbound
secondary antibody.
◦ Wash slides by immersing in fresh PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
Repeat this step twice.
6. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and cover slips to each slide.
7. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope at 400x
magnification.
◦ Identify specific fluorescence patterns indicative of PCA-2
antibodies.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control sera in each run to ensure
assay validity.
2. Record fluorescence intensity and pattern for both controls and
patient samples.
3. If controls do not yield expected results, investigate and correct
assay procedures before reporting patient results.
Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Compare patient serum fluorescence patterns to controls.
2. Report antibody titers based on the highest dilution that gives a
specific fluorescence pattern.
3. Use the following template for results reporting:
◦ Negative: No specific fluorescence pattern at 1:10 dilution.
◦ Positive: Specific fluorescence pattern observed at [X]
dilution.
