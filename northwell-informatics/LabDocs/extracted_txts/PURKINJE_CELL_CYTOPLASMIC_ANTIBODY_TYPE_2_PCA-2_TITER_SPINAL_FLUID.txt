1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate analysis and
generation of results for Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody Type 2
(PCA-2) Titer in Spinal Fluid samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the analysis following the procedures outlined in this
document. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the integrity and
accuracy of the results generated.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen type:
• Spinal fluid (CSF).
Specimen collection:
• A sterile, leak-proof container is required.
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL.
Specimen storage and stability:
• Immediate analysis is recommended.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, refrigerate the sample at
2-8°C for a maximum of 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze the sample at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm and
620 nm.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Adjustable micropipettes and sterile pipette tips.
• Polypropylene microtubes (1.5 mL).
• Vortex mixer.
• Purified water.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) appropriate for handling
spinal fluid.
Reagents:
• Commercially available PCA-2 ELISA kit designed for CSF
analysis.
• Kit components typically include:
◦ Precoated 96-well microtiter plate.
◦ Calibrators and controls.
◦ Wash buffer.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Sample diluent.
◦ Conjugated secondary antibody.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample preparation:
• Centrifuge CSF samples at 1,000 x g for 10 minutes.
• Collect the supernatant carefully and transfer it to a clean
microtube.
• Dilute the sample as per the kit manufacturer's instructions using
the provided sample diluent.
ELISA procedure:
• Follow the ELISA kit insert instructions precisely.
1. Prepare reagents and perform all required calibrations as
defined in the kit instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and diluted
patient samples into the appropriate wells of the precoated
microtiter plate.
3. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature for the
designated incubation time.
4. Wash the plate as directed to remove unbound substances.
5. Add the conjugated secondary antibody to each well.
6. Incubate again for the specified time and temperature.
7. Wash the plate as instructed.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate until color development is adequate, preventing
overdevelopment as advised in the kit insert.
10. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
11. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 620 nm using an ELISA reader.
Quality Control:
• Include both positive and negative controls with each assay run.
• Ensure all controls are within the acceptable ranges. If any control
falls outside the specified range, do not report results and rectify
the issue following troubleshooting guidelines before repeating
the assay.
1. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Select appropriate software, compute the mean absorbance for
each set of calibration standards, controls, and patient samples.
• Construct a calibration curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
each standard against its concentration.
• Use the calibration curve to determine the PCA-2 titer value in
patient samples.
• Report results in consistent units - titers are typically expressed
as standard IU/mL as indicated by the assay kit manufacturer.
Reference Values:
• Normal reference range: Non-reactive or undetectable levels.
• Positive result: A titer value above the established cutoff indicative
of PCA-2 presence.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report findings consistently per laboratory policy ensuring correct
electronic or manual data entry into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Interpret results aligning with correlating clinical data and provide
appropriate notes on reports to guide clinical decisions.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Regular maintenance of equipment should be conducted following
manufacturer guidelines. Any reagents or equipment malfunctions
must be documented and addressed immediately. Repeat analysis
should be performed where necessary and all corrective actions
adhered to laboratory guidelines.
1. STORAGE AND DISPOSAL
• Any residual and completed test samples should be stored in
biohazard containers and disposed of according to biohazard
disposal policies.
• Storage conditions for reagents and waste, proper
decontamination processes should follow laboratory safety
procedures.
Note: Ensure that the procedure is updated as per the latest available
scientific information or changes in the assay kit.
