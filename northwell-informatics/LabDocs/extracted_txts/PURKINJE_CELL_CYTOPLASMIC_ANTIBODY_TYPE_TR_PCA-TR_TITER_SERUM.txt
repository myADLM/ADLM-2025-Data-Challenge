Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to describe the process
for the analytical phase of generating results for Purkinje Cell
Cytoplasmic Antibody Type TR (PCA-TR) titer, in serum.
2. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE The Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic
Antibody Type TR (PCA-TR) is an autoimmune antibody
directed against Purkinje cells, often associated with
paraneoplastic syndromes. The testing will be performed using
indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect and quantify
the antibodies in patient serum samples.
3. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL serum collected in a red-top tube (or serum separator tube).
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens with visible bacterial contamination
• Specimens not labeled with patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopes with fluorescence capability
• Slides with Purkinje cell substrate
• Wash buffer (PBS)
• Anti-human IgG conjugate labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)
• Cover slips
• Humid chamber
• Positive and negative control sera
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive and negative controls must be run with each batch of
patient samples.
• Controls must be stored and prepared according to
manufacturer's guidelines.
• The laboratory should maintain records of QC results and
troubleshoot any out-of-range values before proceeding with the
analysis of patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation of Slides
2. Allow all reagents and patient sera to come to room
temperature.
3. Label the slides with patient and control identifiers.
B. Preparing the Specimen
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
2. Pipette serum into a clean tube, avoiding any pelleted material.
C. Dilution of Sera
1. Dilute patient sera, positive control, and negative control 1:20
with PBS.
2. Further serial dilutions (1:40, 1:80, 1:160, etc.) must be
prepared to determine the antibody titer.
D. Incubation (Primary Antibody)
1. Place 10 µL of the diluted patient serum, positive control, and
negative control onto respective sections of the slide.
2. Place the slide in a humid chamber, and incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
E. Washing
1. Gently wash the slides with PBS buffer to remove unbound
antibodies.
2. Repeat washing 3 times.
3. Gently tap the side of the slide to remove excess buffer.
F. Applying Secondary Antibody
1. Apply 10 µL of FITC-labeled anti-human IgG to each well.
2. Place the slide back in the humid chamber and incubate at
room temperature for 30 minutes.
G. Washing and Mounting
1. Repeat the washing step described above.
2. Permit slides to dry.
3. Apply a drop of mounting medium onto the slide and place a
cover slip over it.
H. Examination
1. Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope with the
appropriate filters.
2. Analyze each specimen and controls for specific fluorescence
in Purkinje cells.
3. Determine the titer of the PCA-TR antibodies by the highest
dilution at which specific fluorescence is visible.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the titer as the highest dilution showing specific
fluorescence.
• Document positive/negative findings along with the titer in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• If the sample is positive, report the result with reference to the
clinical significance of the titer.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS A negative result is generally
expected in healthy individuals. Positive results could be
indicative of paraneoplastic syndromes and should be clinically
correlated.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Proper interpretation requires a trained technologist familiar with
the pattern of PCA-TR.
• Non-specific fluorescence or artifacts can be misinterpreted as
positive results.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
• Proper disposal of biohazardous materials and reagents must be
adhered to according to laboratory policy.
