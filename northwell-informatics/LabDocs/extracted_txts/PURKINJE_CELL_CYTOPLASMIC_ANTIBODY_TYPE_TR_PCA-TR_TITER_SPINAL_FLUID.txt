1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody, Type TR
(PCA-TR) Titer, Spinal Fluid.
Responsibility:
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for validating the procedures and
ensuring compliance.
1. DEFINITION
The PCA-TR titer test is used to detect and measure the level of
antibodies targeting Purkinje cells in the central nervous system. This
test is performed on spinal fluid specimens.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
1. Specimen Type: Spinal fluid (CSF) Accepted forms of collection:
◦ Lumbar puncture using a sterile technique.
◦ Collected in a sterile, leak-proof container with proper
labeling (patient name, date, and time of collection).
2. Stability:
◦ Specimens must be tested within 72 hours of collection if
stored at 2-8°C.
◦ For longer storage, specimens must be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
B. Equipment and Reagents:
1. Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micro-pipettes and tips
◦ Incubator
◦ ELISA reader or fluorescence microscope
◦ Glass slides and cover slips
2. Reagents:
◦ PCA-TR antigen-coated plates or slides
◦ Primary and secondary antibodies
◦ Conjugated enzyme or fluorescent label
◦ Substrate for enzymatic reaction (if ELISA)
◦ Mounting medium (if fluorescent microscopy)
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Positive and negative control samples
C. Testing Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the CSF specimen at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any cellular debris.
◦ Aliquot the supernatant into clean, labeled tubes.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ For ELISA: a) Add 50µL of antigen-coated well with 50µL of
diluted CSF specimen. b) Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C. c)
Wash the wells 3 times with wash buffer. d) Add 100µL of
secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme and incubate
for 30 mins at 37°C. e) Wash the wells 3 times with wash
buffer. f) Add 100µL of substrate solution to each well and
incubate in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature. g)
Stop the reaction with 50µL of stop solution and read the
absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using an ELISA
reader.
◦ For Indirect Immunofluorescence: a) Apply 25µL of diluted
CSF specimen to the antigen-coated slide. b) Incubate for
30 minutes at room temperature in a humid chamber. c)
Wash the slides 3 times with wash buffer. d) Apply 25µL of
secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent dye. e)
Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in a humid
chamber. f) Wash the slides 3 times with wash buffer. g)
Mount the slides with mounting medium and cover slips. h)
Examine the slides under fluorescence microscopy.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ ELISA: a) Compare the absorbance of patient samples to
standard curves or reference values to determine the
presence and titer of PCA-TR antibodies. b) Positive control
should exhibit a strong signal, while the negative control
should show minimal or no signal.
◦ Indirect Immunofluorescence: a) Examine slides for specific
fluorescent staining pattern indicating the presence of PCA-
TR antibodies. b) Record the results based on intensity and
distribution of fluorescence. c) Positive control should exhibit
distinct staining patterns consistent with PCA-TR, while the
negative control should show little or no fluorescence.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens tested to ensure assay performance.
2. Document the results of controls and verify that they meet
established criteria before reporting patient results.
3. Repeat testing if controls do not perform as expected.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Record the titer of PCA-TR antibodies detected in the spinal
fluid specimen.
2. Use site-specific reporting guidelines to enter results into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Report any critical findings immediately to the appropriate
clinical personnel following standard protocols.
F. Method Limitations:
1. Results must be interpreted in the context of the patient’s
clinical condition and other diagnostic results.
2. Cross-reactivity with other autoantibodies may occasionally
occur.

3. SAFETY AND HANDLING
4. Follow all applicable safety guidelines for handling biological
specimens.
5. Dispose of biohazardous waste according to local regulations.
