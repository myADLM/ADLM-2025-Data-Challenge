SOP for PU.1 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed procedures for the technical component
of the PU.1 immunostain in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This includes
preparation, staining, and initial evaluation steps required to ensure
proper staining quality. This procedure does not include final
interpretation, which is the responsibility of the designated
pathologist.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to perform
the PU.1 immunostain according to this SOP and to ensure quality
control measures are strictly followed.
1. DEFINITIONS
PU.1: A transcription factor and a protein used as a marker in
immunohistochemistry for detecting certain hematopoietic cells.
Immunostain: A staining technique used to detect specific antigens in
cells or tissue sections using antibodies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections. Section Thickness: 4-5 microns. Unacceptable
Specimens: Non-FFPE tissues, improperly fixed tissues, excessively
thick or thin sections. Labelling Requirements: Each slide must be
labelled with two patient identifiers (e.g., patient name and accession
number).
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Primary Antibody: PU.1 antibody (SP15 clone recommended)
• Buffer Solutions: PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Substrate-Chromogen: DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) or equivalent
• Hematoxylin Counterstain
Equipment:
• Automatic stainer (if applicable)
• Positive and Negative Control Slides
• Microscope
• Humidifying chamber
• Hot plate or incubator set to 60°C
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 micron sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath and pick them up on positively
charged glass slides.
3. Dry slides overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C on a hot
plate.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols: 100%, 95%,
70%, and distilled water.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval according to manufacturer’s
instructions (most commonly with citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA
pH 8.0 in a pressure cooker or microwave).
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in running
tap water, followed by washing in PBS.
5.4 Staining Procedure:
1. Place slides in a humidifying chamber.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in methanol for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4. Incubate slides with the primary PU.1 antibody, diluted as
recommended by the manufacturer, for 1 hour at room
temperature (or overnight at 4°C if recommended).
5. Wash slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
6. Apply an appropriate secondary antibody, incubate as per the
protocol.
7. Wash slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
8. Apply the substrate-chromogen solution (DAB) and monitor the
development of color under the microscope. Development time
varies but typically is about 5-10 minutes.
9. Stop the reaction by rinsing in distilled water.
5.5 Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water.
3. Blue slides with dilute ammonia water (0.1%) for 30 seconds.
4. Rinse in running tap water.
5. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and
clear in xylene.
5.6 Mounting:
1. Mount slides with a permanent mounting medium.
2. Allow slides to dry.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Verify the staining quality using positive and negative control
slides.
5. Document control results and ensure they meet predefined
criteria.
6. Repeat staining if controls do not show expected results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
8. Technical personnel are responsible for providing a stained
slide for the pathologist.
9. Ensure all slides are correctly labelled and include control slide
outcomes.
10. Document the completion of the staining procedure in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
11. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
12. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
13. Dispose of chemical waste according to the laboratory’s
hazardous waste disposal guidelines.
14. Handle all biological specimens using standard precautions.
