Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Pyrethrum
IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for Pyrethrum IgE testing in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. The procedure ensures accurate testing
and reliable results for Pyrethrum IgE quantification.
Responsibility:
Designated technologists are responsible for performing the
Pyrethrum IgE test according to this protocol. It is the responsibility of
all staff to report any discrepancies or issues observed during the
testing process to the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected via venipuncture in a red stopper tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Serum must be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store separated serum at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within
48 hours of collection.
• For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens received in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA,
Citrate, etc.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Micropipettes and Tips
• Plate shaker
• Pyrethrum-specific IgE ELISA Kit (including standard calibrators,
controls, and reagents)
• Adhesive plate covers
• Laboratory Timer
• De-ionized Water
• Logbooks for temperature and equipment monitoring
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare reagents as per the instructions provided in the
Pyrethrum IgE ELISA Kit Insert.
• Ensure all components are brought to room temperature prior to
use.
B. Plate Setup:
• Securely mount ELISA plate in the washer.
• Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum samples
into designated wells.
C. Incubation:
• Cover plate with adhesive covers and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour
on a plate shaker set to low speed (approx. 300 rpm).
D. Washing:
• Wash the plate according to ELISA kit instructions (usually 3-5
times with wash buffer).
• Ensure no residual wash buffer is left in wells post-washing.
E. Secondary Antibody and Incubation:
• Add secondary anti-IgE antibody conjugated with enzyme (as per
kit instructions).
• Incubate again at 37°C for the required duration specified in the
kit insert (usually 1 hour).
F. Substrate Reaction:
• Add substrate solution and incubate at room temperature in dark
for the recommended time (usually 15-30 minutes).
• Monitor color development.
G. Reading and Result Capturing:
• Run ELISA plate through reader to measure absorbance at the
specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
• Record absorbance values and calculate Pyrethrum IgE
concentration by plotting against standard curve.
H. Quality Control:
• Verify assay performance using control samples (negative and
positive controls as provided in the ELISA kit).
• Document all temperature logs, reagent preparation, and
procedural steps in respective logbooks.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results are cross-verified before transmission to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Results are stored and reports generated according to site-
specific guidelines.
• Properly flagged and reviewed by designated personnel to ensure
accuracy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results may be influenced by high levels of total IgE in patient
serum which may require additional dilution.
• Interference from rheumatoid factors or other potential inhibitors
should be considered.
