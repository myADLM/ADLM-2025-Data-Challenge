PYRIDOSTIGMINE, SERUM/PLASMA ASSAY
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analysis of
Pyridostigmine in serum or plasma samples. The analysis will be
performed to determine the concentration of Pyridostigmine using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow
the procedures as outlined in this SOP to ensure the integrity and
accuracy of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain
red top tube.
◦ Plasma collected in lithium heparin or EDTA tubes.
Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens that have not been stored as per guidelines.
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect assay
results.
◦ Specimens received in heparinized collection tubes other
than lithium heparin.
Specimen Storage: - Serum/plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up to
5 days or frozen at -20°C for longer periods.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ LC-MS/MS system
◦ Pyridostigmine calibration standards and quality control
materials
◦ Methanol, acetonitrile, water (HPLC grade)
◦ Formic acid
◦ Sample preparation kits (e.g., protein precipitation or solid-
phase extraction)
◦ Vortex mixer, centrifuge, pipettes, and tips
◦ Laboratory glassware and polypropylene tubes
2. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration Standards: - Calibration standards for Pyridostigmine will
be prepared in blank matrix (serum or plasma) at concentrations
appropriate for the expected range of patient samples. - Store
calibration standards as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Quality Control: - Quality controls (QCs) will be included in each
assay run at low, medium, and high concentrations. - Each QC must
be within +- 15% of the nominal concentration. - Document all QC
results in the QC log. Review QC data before reporting patient
results.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: 1. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
Mix thoroughly. 2. Aliquot 200 µL of serum/plasma into a
polypropylene sample tube. 3. Add 50 µL of internal standard working
solution to each sample. 4. Vortex mix for 10 seconds. 5. Add 200 µL
of methanol for protein precipitation. Vortex for 1 minute. 6.
Centrifuge the samples at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. 7.
Transfer the supernatant to an autosampler vial for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
LC-MS/MS Analysis: 1. Set up the LC-MS/MS according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Load calibration standards, QCs, and
prepared specimens onto the autosampler. 3. Begin the
chromatographic run with the following conditions (example):
- Column: C18, 2.1 × 50 mm, 2.7 µm
- Mobile Phase A: 0.1% formic acid in water
- Mobile Phase B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile
- Flow Rate: 0.4 mL/min
- Injection Volume: 5 µL
- Gradient Program: Linear gradient from 5% B to 95% B over 5 minutes
4. Acquire data in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode monitoring the parent to daughter transitions specific for Pyridostigmine and the internal standard.
Data Analysis: 1. Integrate the peak areas of the Pyridostigmine and
internal standard in each sample. 2. Calculate the concentration of
Pyridostigmine in patient samples using the calibration curve and the
response ratio of the Pyridostigmine to the internal standard. 3.
Ensure all QC samples are within the specified acceptable ranges
before sample results are reported.
1. RESULT REPORTING
◦ Enter data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Validate report with verification of QC results.
◦ Report results with units (ng/mL) and reference intervals.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the LC-MS/MS kit instructions for specific reagent
limitations.
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with assay
accuracy.
3. REFERENCES
◦ LC-MS/MS kit insert and user manual.
◦ Pyridostigmine assay validation records.
◦ Instrument calibration and maintenance logs.
4. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain all logbooks for specimen preparation, calibration,
QC, and sample analysis.
◦ Record any deviations and corrective actions in the
appropriate log.
