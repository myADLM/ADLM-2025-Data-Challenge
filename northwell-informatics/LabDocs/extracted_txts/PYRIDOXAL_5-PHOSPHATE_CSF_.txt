Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (CSF)
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed procedures for the analytical phase of testing
Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (PLP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens.
This SOP ensures accurate and reliable results for clinical
diagnostics, patient management, and research purposes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following these
procedures and maintaining quality control.
• Supervisors should regularly review practices and ensure
adherence to all procedural steps.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable:
• CSF collected in a sterile, labeled, and screw-capped container.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of CSF.
• Specimens must be transported and stored on ice or at
temperatures between 2-8°C.
• Specimens should be analyzed within 24 hours. If analysis cannot
be conducted within 24 hours, aliquot and freeze specimens at
-80°C for longer storage (up to 1 month).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in non-sterile containers.
• Grossly hemolyzed, contaminated, or inadequately labeled
specimens.
• Specimens subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Note: Proper documentation for sample collection and storage must
accompany each specimen.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
fluorescence detector.
• Centrifuge (capable of reaching a speed of 2000 x g).
• Pipettors and sterile pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate standard.
• HPLC-grade methanol, acetonitrile, and water.
• Mobile phase buffer (phosphate buffer, pH 6.0).
• PLP-free serum for calibration standards.
• Plastic tubes and screw-capped vials for specimen processing.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Upon receipt, document the specimen details in the CSF
Specimen Logbook.
2. Centrifuge the CSF sample at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot the supernatant into separate labeled tubes if not
immediately analyzed.
4. Store aliquots at -80°C if analysis will be delayed beyond 24
hours.
B. Preparation of Standards and Calibration Curve:
1. Prepare a series of PLP standard solutions in PLP-free serum
with known concentrations.
2. Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high PLP
concentration ranges.
3. Run the standards and QC samples through the HPLC system
to create a calibration curve (linearity must be confirmed).
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system and equilibrate with the mobile phase.
2. Inject a blank sample to ensure no carry-over from previous
runs.
3. Inject standards, QC samples, and then the CSF specimens
into the HPLC system.
4. Monitor and document chromatographic peaks, focusing on the
retention time specific for PLP.
D. Data Analysis and Result Generation:
1. Analyze the data using the HPLC software to quantify PLP
concentration in the CSF samples.
2. Validate the results by comparing QC sample outcomes to
established control ranges.
3. Document any discrepancies and reanalyze if necessary.
4. Record the final PLP concentrations for each sample in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run QC samples with each batch of CSF samples analyzed.
7. Ensure that QC results fall within acceptable ranges.
Recalibrate or troubleshoot the HPLC system if QC results are
outside these ranges.
8. Record all QC data and maintain it as part of the permanent
laboratory records.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Verify and review all results to ensure accuracy before
reporting.
11. Enter the validated results into the LIS with appropriate units
(e.g., nmol/L).
12. Notify the clinician or researcher of any critical values or
discrepancies in sample integrity.
13. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Any interference or contamination by hemolysis or other
contaminants can affect the accuracy of the results.
• The stability of CSF under various storage conditions should be
considered.
