Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (PLP), Plasma
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures and responsibilities involved
in the analytical testing phase to determine Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate
(PLP) levels in plasma. This ensures accurate, reliable, and timely
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel trained in
performing PLP assays are responsible for carrying out this SOP.
Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are appropriately trained
and that quality control measures are observed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING A. Specimen
Type: - Preferred Specimen: Plasma from EDTA or heparinized
blood. - Volume: At least 2 mL of plasma is required for the assay.
B. Specimen Collection: - Draw blood using standard venipuncture
technique. - Collect blood into tubes containing EDTA or heparin. -
Mix gently by inversion 8-10 times to ensure proper anticoagulation.
C. Specimen Processing: - Centrifuge the blood sample at
1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma. - Aliquot
the plasma into labeled transport tubes. - Store plasma at -20°C or
lower until analysis. If analysis is delayed more than 24 hours, store
at -70°C.
D. Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed or lipemic samples. -
Samples not properly labeled with collection date, time, and patient
identification. - Plasma samples stored at room temperature for over
2 hours.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES A. Equipment: -
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. -
Centrifuge capable of operating at 1500-2000 x g. - Refrigerated
storage (-20°C or lower).
B. Reagents: - PLP standard stock solution. - Mobile phases for
HPLC/LC-MS/MS. - Derivatization reagent (if HPLC with
fluorescence detection is used). - Internal standard (if required).
C. Supplies: - Pipettes and tips. - Vials and caps for HPLC/LC-MS/
MS. - Tubes for specimen collection and storage.
5. PROCEDURE A. Calibration and Quality Control: - Calibrate the
instrument with a series of PLP standards ranging from low to high
concentrations. - Run quality control samples at low, mid, and high
levels at the beginning of each batch and after every 10 samples.
B. Sample Preparation: - Thaw plasma samples at 4°C if frozen. -
Vortex samples briefly to ensure homogeneity. - Aliquot 100 µL of
plasma into a clean vial.
C. Extraction/Preparation (if required): - Add an appropriate
volume of internal standard (if used). - Follow the solvent extraction
or protein precipitation protocol specific to your laboratory’s method. -
Derivatize if the method involves fluorescence detection (HPLC).
D. Instrumental Analysis: - Load prepared samples onto the HPLC
or LC-MS/MS system. - Ensure all instrument settings, such as flow
rate, column temperature, and detection parameters, are optimized. -
Inject the sample and start the chromatographic run. - Record
detection signals for PLP and, if used, the internal standard.
6. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING A. Data Analysis: - Analyze
chromatograms and quantify PLP concentration using a calibration
curve prepared during instrument calibration. - Ensure peak
identification and integration are accurate.
B. Reporting Results: - Results will be automatically transmitted to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS). - Review chromatograms
and analytical data to verify accuracy. - Report PLP concentration in
µg/L or nmol/L. - Document any deviations or observations during
analysis.
7. QUALITY CONTROL - Utilize quality control materials to verify
method performance. - Follow laboratory-specific guidelines for
acceptable quality control limits. - Document and address any QC
failures as per laboratory policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS - Analytical sensitivity and specificity
depend on the chosen methodology (HPLC vs. LC-MS/MS). - Matrix
effects can influence the accuracy of results; ensure matrix-matched
calibration standards are used.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS - Follow all laboratory safety
guidelines when handling biological samples and reagents. - Ensure
proper disposal of hazardous waste materials.
