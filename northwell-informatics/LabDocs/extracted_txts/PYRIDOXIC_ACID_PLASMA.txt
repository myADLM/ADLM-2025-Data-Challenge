Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Pyridoxic
Acid in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the systematic procedures for the accurate and reliable
determination of Pyridoxic Acid in plasma samples using high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence
detection. This SOP ensures the reproducibility of results, maintains
quality control, and complies with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff will adhere to this procedure to ensure
accurate and reliable results. It is the joint responsibility of all staff
members to identify and report any deficiencies or deviations from
this protocol to the laboratory supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Pyridoxic Acid: A major metabolite of Vitamin B6 in the body, which is
typically measured to assess Vitamin B6 status.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of plasma collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Following collection, the plasma must be separated from the cells
via centrifugation within 45 minutes. Transfer the plasma to a
polyethylene vial and freeze immediately at -20°C or lower until
analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed plasma.
• Plasma samples that have not been frozen or have been exposed
to multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
• Samples not stored at appropriate temperatures or those with
inadequate labeling.
Note: Allow frozen plasma samples to reach room temperature
before the analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with a
fluorescence detector.
• Centrifuge.
• Polyethylene vials for sample storage.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents:
• Mobile phase: Methanol and deionized water (95:5, v/v).
• Derivatization reagent: O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) solution in 0.1
M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
• Pyridoxic Acid (standard) for calibration curve.
• Internal standard (e.g., 4-deoxypyridoxine).
Supplies:
• HPLC-grade solvents.
• Disposable centrifuge tubes.
• Gloves, lab coat, safety goggles.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
3. Pipette 200 µL of plasma into a disposable centrifuge tube.
4. Add 10 µL of the internal standard to each sample.
5. Add 40 µL of OPA derivatization reagent, vortex to mix.
6. Incubate samples at room temperature for 5 minutes.
7. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
8. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for HPLC analysis.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Ensure the HPLC system is properly calibrated and the column
has been conditioned.
2. Inject 20 µL of prepared sample into the HPLC.
3. Set the flow rate of the mobile phase to 1 mL/min and the
fluorescence detector to an excitation wavelength of 330 nm
and an emission wavelength of 450 nm.
4. Run the sample through the HPLC column and monitor the
fluorescence signal.
5. The retention time for Pyridoxic Acid should be within a
specified range (e.g., 8-10 minutes).
Calibration and QC:
1. Prepare a calibration curve using known concentrations of
Pyridoxic Acid standard.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples alongside patient samples to
ensure accuracy and precision. Acceptable ranges must be pre-
defined based on historical data.
3. Include blanks and replicates to monitor any potential carry-
over or contamination.
Data Analysis:
1. Integrate the area under the curve (AUC) for each peak
corresponding to Pyridoxic Acid and the internal standard.
2. Calculate the concentration of Pyridoxic Acid in plasma using
the calibration curve.
3. Verify the results against QC criteria.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results should be reviewed by the designated laboratory staff
for consistency and accuracy.
6. Any anomalies or deviations from the expected results must be
flagged and re-checked.
7. Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for reporting.
8. Notify the relevant healthcare provider of any critical results
following the established procedure.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Perform internal quality control checks with each batch of
samples.
11. Document all QC results in the logbook.
12. In case of QC failure, troubleshoot the HPLC system, reagents,
and sample preparation steps. Document corrective actions
taken.
13. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
14. Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
15. Handle all biological specimens with care to prevent
contamination and exposure.
16. Dispose of all waste materials, including plasma samples and
chemical reagents, in accordance with safety regulations.
