Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for PYRIMIDINE 5' NUCLEOTIDASE (P5'N),
BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The aim of this procedure is to outline the standardized process for
the analysis of Pyrimidine 5’ Nucleotidase (P5’N) in blood samples to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing tests according to this procedure, documenting results,
and taking necessary corrective actions if any anomalies are
identified. Supervisors must ensure compliance and address any
deviations.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimen:
• EDTA whole blood - 1-2 mL
◦ Collected in a lavender-top tube (EDTA).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted or hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature (15-25°C): 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C): Not recommended
Handling:
• Mix the EDTA tube gently to avoid hemolysis.
• Store appropriately if analysis is not performed immediately.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 405 nm
• Pipettes and tips (variable volumes)
Reagents:
• Tris buffer, pH 8.0
• Substrate: Uridine monophosphate (UMP)
• Reaction stop solution (e.g., 1N sodium hydroxide)
• Enzyme standard or control samples (known P5’N activity levels)
Supplies:
• Microplates
• Test tubes
• Micropipette tips
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Prepare working buffer and substrate solutions as per
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up the microplate reader for absorbance reading at 405 nm.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
◦ Collect the plasma supernatant for analysis.
◦ Prepare a test sample by diluting plasma 1:10 with the
assay buffer.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of the working substrate solution into each
well.
◦ Add 10 µL of diluted plasma or control sample into the
designated wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
4. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 405 nm using the microplate
reader.
Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Calculate the average absorbance for blanks, controls, and
patient samples.
2. Use the standard curve to determine the enzyme activity in
patient samples.
3. Report the P5'N activity in units per liter (U/L).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• The control results should fall within the established range. If not,
troubleshoot and re-run the controls before continuing with patient
samples.
Inter-lab Comparisons:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as available.
• Compare results periodically with those from an external standard
laboratory.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and interpretation:
• Results should be reviewed by the responsible technologist and
the supervisor.
• Any atypical or outlier results should be verified for pre-analytical
or analytical errors and addressed accordingly.
Automated Transmission:
• Results are recorded into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
Manual Entry (if applicable):
• Enter results manually into the patient’s electronic medical record,
ensuring accuracy and verification by a second technologist.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference intervals for P5'N activity should be established
according to patient population and validated periodically.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis and lipemia can interfere with assay results.
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid degradation or
interference.
