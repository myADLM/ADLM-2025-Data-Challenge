Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
PYRUVATE KINASE ENZYME ACTIVITY, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the measurement of pyruvate
kinase enzyme activity in blood samples. This process ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results necessary for the
diagnosis and monitoring of related conditions.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform and document
the analysis of pyruvate kinase enzyme activity following the outlined
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
3.1. Specimen
• Preferred: Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL.
3.2. Specimen Handling and Storage
• Store the sample at 4°C immediately after collection.
• Samples should be processed within 48 hours of collection. If
processing is delayed, samples can be frozen at -20°C for up to
30 days.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens containing clots
• Specimens with inappropriate labeling or lack of collection time
indicated
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1. Equipment
• Centrifuge
• UV-Vis spectrophotometer
• Pipettes and tips
• Water bath (set to 37°C)
4.2. Reagents
• Pyruvate kinase assay kit
• NADH solution
• ADP
• Phosphoenolpyruvate
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation of Reagents
• Prepare all reagents per the manufacturer's instructions included
with the pyruvate kinase assay kit.
5.2. Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge the whole blood sample at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes at
4°C to obtain plasma.
• Collect the plasma supernatant for the assay.
5.3. Assay Procedure
1. Zero the spectrophotometer at 340 nm using a blank solution.
2. In a reaction cuvette, mix the following:
◦ 100 µL plasma sample
◦ 900 µL reaction buffer from the assay kit containing NADH,
ADP, and phosphoenolpyruvate.
3. Place the cuvette into the spectrophotometer.
4. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C.
5. Measure the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm every minute
for 5 minutes.
6. Record the absorbance readings.
5.4. Calculation
• The pyruvate kinase activity is determined by the rate of NADH
oxidation, which corresponds to the decrease in absorbance at
340 nm per minute.
• Use the formula provided by the assay kit manufacturer to
calculate the pyruvate kinase activity, usually expressed in µmol/
min/mL or U/mL.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1. QC Materials
• Two levels of control (normal and abnormal) must be included
with each set of patient samples.
6.2. QC Procedure
• Analyze the QC materials as described in the assay procedure.
• Ensure the QC results fall within the established acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the assay and
investigate possible causes. Verify device calibration and reagent
integrity.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Verify and validate results before releasing.
• Report critical values as per the laboratory's critical value policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals are method-dependent and should be
established based on population studies or provided assay kit
data. Typical ranges should be validated within the laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may yield erroneous results.
• Samples should be processed within the stated stability window to
ensure accurate measurements.

This SOP remains effective until updated or revised and must be
reviewed annually.
