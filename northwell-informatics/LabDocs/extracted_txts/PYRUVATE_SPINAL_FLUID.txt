Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Pyruvate Analysis in
Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analysis and generation of results for pyruvate in spinal fluid
(cerebrospinal fluid, CSF). This ensures accurate, consistent, and
timely analysis that meets CLIA certification requirements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of pyruvate in spinal fluid samples. Pyruvate measurements will be
performed using the appropriate instrumentation according to
manufacturer guidelines and laboratory policies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to adhere to this SOP and
ensure that all steps are followed as outlined. Supervisors are
responsible for training staff and ensuring compliance.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Spinal fluid (CSF)
Collection:
• Lumbar puncture performed by a clinician.
• Collect in a sterile CSF collection tube.
Volume:
• A minimum of 2 mL of CSF is required.
Labeling:
• Properly label the collection tube with patient information, date,
and time of collection.
Transport:
• Transport the sample to the laboratory immediately at 2-8°C. If
delayed, freeze at -70°C.
Acceptance Criteria:
• CSF that is visibly free of blood contamination.
• Properly labeled and collected within the last 24 hours if kept cold;
otherwise, promptly frozen.
Unacceptable Criteria:
• Samples with visible contamination or improper labeling.
• Samples collected more than 24 hours before analysis if not
frozen.
5. MATERIALS REQUIRED
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Cold storage (refrigerator and -70°C freezer)
• Pyruvate assay kit
• Standard laboratory glassware
• Water bath/ heating block
• Timer
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Pyruvate assay reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls (as per manufacturer)
• Milli-Q or deionized water
• Quality control materials (2 levels: normal and abnormal)
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and calibrators as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Store reagents as indicated in the product insert.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen CSF samples at room temperature.
◦ Mix well to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Use supernatant for pyruvate analysis.
B. Analysis:
1. Calibration and Controls:
◦ Perform calibration using the pyruvate standard provided in
the assay kit.
◦ Include quality control samples (low and high) with each
analytical run.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette appropriate volumes of standard, samples, and
controls into wells of the assay plate.
◦ Add assay reagents following the sequence and volume
specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Mix the plate contents gently using a plate shaker or
manually.
◦ Incubate the plate at the temperature specified in the assay
procedure (usually 37°C) for the indicated time.
◦ Measure absorbance at the required wavelength using a
plate reader.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of pyruvate in CSF samples
using the standard curve generated from calibrators.
◦ Ensure the quality controls are within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each analytical run to ensure
the accuracy and precision of results.
• Document and verify control results before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures or discrepancies
immediately, following laboratory protocols.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report pyruvate concentrations in spinal fluid in mg/dL or μmol/L.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure verification by a laboratory technologist.
• Critical values should be flagged and reported to the requesting
clinician immediately, following laboratory policy.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the pyruvate assay kit insert for specific limitations
regarding potential interfering substances and assay sensitivity.
• Proper specimen handling is crucial; hemolyzed or contaminated
samples can yield inaccurate results.
