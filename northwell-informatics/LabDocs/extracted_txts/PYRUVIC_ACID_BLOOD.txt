Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Pyruvic Acid, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the analytical procedures for
accurate and precise quantification of pyruvic acid in blood samples.
This ensures consistent and reliable results across the laboratory for
clinical assessment of metabolic conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel performing this test are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that all testing and documentation are
completed as per the guidelines and to address any deficiencies
identified.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole Blood collected in Sodium Fluoride (gray top) tubes to
prevent glycolysis and stabilize pyruvic acid.
• Serum or plasma obtained from appropriately centrifuged whole
blood.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than Sodium Fluoride tubes.
• Specimens that were not preserved on ice immediately after
collection.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 30 minutes
before analysis or freezing.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Refrigerated Centrifuge
• HPLC system or spectrophotometer configured for the specific
pyruvic acid analysis.
• Pipettes and tips calibrated for accurate sample measurement.
• Ice bucket.
• Vortex Mixer.
Reagents:
• Standard pyruvic acid solution.
• Sodium Fluoride.
• Perchloric Acid.
• NADH solution.
• Buffer solution.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
1. Upon receipt, immediately place the blood sample in an ice
bucket.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 4°C at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes within
30 minutes of collection.
3. Aliquot plasma/serum into cryovials and store at -80°C if not
analyzing immediately.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma/serum sample on ice.
2. Prepare a protein-free filtrate by adding 0.5 mL of plasma/
serum to 0.5 mL of 8% perchloric acid.
3. Vortex the mixture and centrifuge it at 4°C for 15 minutes at
3000 rpm.
4. Carefully collect the supernatant, avoiding the protein pellet,
and transfer it to a new tube.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Prepare a series of pyruvic acid standards in the range of 0-100
µmol/L.
2. Set up the HPLC system or spectrophotometer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. For HPLC: Inject the standards and sample extracts into the
system. For Spectrophotometry: Mix the sample extract or
standard with NADH solution and buffer in a cuvette.
4. Measure the absorbance or detector response at the
appropriate wavelength (usually 340 nm for NADH).
5. Calculate the pyruvic acid concentration in samples using the
calibration curve derived from the standards.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control (QC) samples (low, medium, and high) with
each batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. Any deviations from expected QC values must be investigated,
and the source of error must be corrected before analyzing
patient samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results should be reported in µmol/L.
2. Review and verify results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Flag any abnormal results and notify the appropriate healthcare
provider as per lab protocol.
8. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
1. Regularly clean and maintain the HPLC system or
spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform routine calibration checks with standard solutions to
ensure the accuracy and precision of the equipment.
9. LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolysis can interfere with accurate measurement of pyruvic
acid and should be avoided.
2. Sample storage and handling conditions can affect pyruvic acid
stability.
3. Ensure consistent and immediate processing of samples to
prevent degradation.
