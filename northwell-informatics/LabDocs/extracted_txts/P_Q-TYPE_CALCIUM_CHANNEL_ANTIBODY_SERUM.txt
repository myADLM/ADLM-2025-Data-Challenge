Protocol for P/Q-Type Calcium Channel Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of P/Q-Type Calcium Channel Antibody in serum
specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
◦ Specimen Type: Serum.
◦ Volume: 1 mL.
◦ Collection: Serum should be collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Handling: Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes, then
centrifuge at 1500-2000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum from cells.
◦ Storage: Serum may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ ELISA Kit for P/Q-Type Calcium Channel Antibody
(manufacturer-specific)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Timer
4. PROCEDURE: Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents are brought to room temperature before
use.
◦ Prepare standard solutions and controls according to the
ELISA kit instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add appropriate volume (as specified by the kit) of
calibrators, controls, and serum samples to the wells of
the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate for the specified period at room
temperature.
3. Following incubation, wash the plate as directed by the kit
instructions to remove unbound antibodies.
4. Add the enzyme-conjugated antibody to each well and
incubate for the specified time.
5. Wash the plate again to remove any unbound conjugate.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate until
the color change is sufficient (time specified in kit
instructions).
7. Stop the reaction with the stop solution provided in the kit.
8. Measure absorbance using a microplate reader at the
wavelength described in the kit.
Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the P/Q-Type Calcium Channel Antibody
concentration by comparing the absorbance readings of the
samples to the standard curve generated from the
calibrators. Detailed instructions on calculation are provided
in the insert specific to the ELISA kit.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Run controls with each batch of samples. Controls should
fall within the acceptable range defined by the kit
manufacturer.
◦ Deviations in control results may indicate issues with the
reagent, equipment, or sample handling, and corrective
actions should be taken as needed.
6. REPORTING RESULTS: Verification and Reporting:
◦ Ensure all quality control measures are met before releasing
results.
◦ Transmit results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review.
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for the reference intervals
specific to the ELISA kit used.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Refer to the ELISA kit insert for limitations related to
interference, cross-reactivity, and other potential sources of
error.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND TRACEABILITY:
◦ Document lot numbers of reagents, details of controls,
calibrators, and any deviations or corrective actions taken
during the assay in the laboratory QC logs.
