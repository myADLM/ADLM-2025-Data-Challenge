STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Quad Screen (Second Trimester) Maternal Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To ensure reliable and accurate processing of maternal serum
samples for the Quad Screen, which includes measuring levels of
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG),
Unconjugated Estriol (uE3), and Inhibin-A, for the detection of
potential fetal anomalies in the second trimester.
2. SCOPE:
This protocol applies to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of the Quad Screen testing procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP. The supervisor or designated qualified personnel are
responsible for monitoring compliance and addressing any deviations
from the SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Quad Screen (Second Trimester) Maternal Serum: A prenatal
test that measures levels of AFP, hCG, uE3, and Inhibin-A in
maternal serum.
• AFP: Alpha-fetoprotein.
• hCG: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin.
• uE3: Unconjugated Estriol.
• Inhibin-A: A hormone produced by the placenta during
pregnancy.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer.
• Calibration and control materials specific to AFP, hCG, uE3, and
Inhibin-A assays.
• Sample cups or test tubes.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes for sample
collection.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Appropriate pipettes and tips.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen: 5-10 mL of maternal serum collected
between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation.
• Stability and Storage: Once separated from cells, serum
samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and tested within 14
days. For long-term storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or
lower.
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Preparation
1. Identify and verify the patient’s sample using two unique
identifiers.
7.2 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Verify calibration status of the analyzer. Perform calibration, if
needed, following the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) materials according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Analyze QC materials at the beginning of each test run and
ensure quality control results fall within acceptable ranges prior
to proceeding with patient samples.
7.3 Sample Analysis
1. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw completely and equilibrate
to room temperature. Mix thoroughly before analysis.
2. Load appropriate sample cups or tubes onto the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
3. Select the Quad Screen protocol on the immunoassay analyzer.
4. Input patient demographic data and sample identification
numbers into the analyzer.
5. Initiate the analysis sequence as per analyzer instructions,
ensuring the correct test parameters for AFP, hCG, uE3, and
Inhibin-A.
7.4 Result Validation
1. After analysis, review the generated results for consistency and
accuracy.
2. Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges. If QC fails,
troubleshoot per analyzer guidelines and repeat the QC and
patient sample analysis steps.
3. Compare patient results with reference ranges and flag any
results that fall outside the normal limits for further review.
8. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING:
1. The results are transmitted automatically to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review by the technologist.
2. Reference intervals for AFP, hCG, uE3, and Inhibin-A specific to
the testing population should be applied.
3. Report critical findings immediately to the physician or
designated healthcare provider according to laboratory policy.
9. DOCUMENTATION:
1. Record all calibration, QC results, patient result check, and any
troubleshooting actions in the laboratory logbook or
electronically as per laboratory procedures.
10. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the automated immunoassay
analyzer and reagent kits.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and reference materials for prenatal
screening.
11. TRAINING AND COMPETENCY: Lab personnel must complete
training in the processing, analysis, and interpretation of Quad
Screen results. Competency is assessed annually.

This SOP will be reviewed and updated regularly to comply with new
standards, technology upgrades, and analytical requirement
changes.
