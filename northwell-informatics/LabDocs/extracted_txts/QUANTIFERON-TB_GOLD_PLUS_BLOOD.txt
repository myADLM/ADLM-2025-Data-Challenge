Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for QUANTIFERON-TB GOLD PLUS, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for the QUANTIFERON-TB GOLD PLUS (QFT-
Plus) test. This assay is intended for the detection of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure
proper performance of the test and accurate reporting of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel performing the QFT-Plus assay
procedures are responsible for adhering to the guidelines set forth in
this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
compliance with the SOP and to address any deviations that may
occur.
1. DEFINITIONS
QFT-Plus refers to the QUANTIFERON-TB GOLD PLUS test, an in
vitro diagnostic aid for detecting latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred Specimens:
• Blood should be collected in QFT-Plus Blood Collection Tubes
(QFT-Plus Tubes) from the patient and must be processed within
the time frame specified by the kit instructions (typically within 16
hours of blood collection).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• QFT-Plus Tubes that are not filled to the required volume.
• Specimens that have clotted or show visible hemolysis.
• Specimens that have not been incubated within the required time
frame (typically within 16 hours).
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• QFT-Plus Blood Collection Tubes
• QFT-Plus ELISA Kit
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Calibrated incubator set to 37°C ± 1°C
• Microplate reader with a 450 nm filter
1. REAGENT STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store QFT-Plus Blood Collection Tubes at room temperature
(17-25°C).
• Store QFT-Plus ELISA Kit components according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Do not use any reagents or QFT-Plus Tubes beyond their
expiration date.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Blood Collection and Incubation:
• Collect blood directly into each of the QFT-Plus Tubes (Nil, TB1,
TB2, and Mitogen).
• Gently shake tubes 10 times ensuring the entire bottom surface of
the tube is coated with blood.
• Place tubes upright in a 37°C ± 1°C incubator and incubate for
16-24 hours.
• After incubation, centrifuge tubes at 2000-3000 RCF for 15
minutes to separate plasma.
7.2 Plasma Collection:
• Using a pipette, carefully collect the plasma from each tube
without disturbing the cell layer.
• Store plasma at 2-8°C if immediate use is not possible. Plasma
may be stored up to 28 days.
7.3 ELISA Setup:
• Utilize the ELISA kit reagents ensuring all kit components are at
room temperature.
• Prepare the ELISA plate by adding 50 µL of conjugate to each
well.
• Add 50 µL of standards, controls, and patient plasma samples to
the appropriate wells.
• Cover the plate with an adhesive strip and incubate at room
temperature for 120 minutes.
7.4 Washing and Substrate Reaction:
• Aspirate each well to remove liquid and wash the plate with 400
µL of 1x Wash Buffer.
• Repeat the wash procedure 6 times.
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in dark
at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
7.5 Reading and Calculation:
• Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a microplate
reader.
• Subtract the background OD (Nil tube) from the TB1, TB2, and
Mitogen readings.
• Calculate the results according to the Manufacturer's Instructions
for Use (IFU) to determine if the samples are positive, negative, or
indeterminate for M. tuberculosis infection.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the kit-provided positive and negative controls with each
assay.
• Ensure that the controls fall within the acceptable range provided
by the manufacturer.
• If controls do not meet criteria, do not report patient results and
troubleshoot the assay.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Positive Result: IFN-γ response that is significantly higher than
the Nil control, as per manufacturer cut-off values.
• Negative Result: IFN-γ response similar to that of the Nil control
or significantly higher response with Mitogen stimulation only.
• Indeterminate Result: High Nil response (which may indicate high
background or non-specific activation) or low Mitogen response
(could indicate a lack of immune responsiveness).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all incubation times, temperatures, reagent lot numbers,
and equipment calibration checks are documented.
• Record all raw data and final calculated results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Report results to the ordering clinician following site-specific
reporting protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure that all testing personnel are familiar with the kit insert's
limitations, especially potential factors that may affect test
performance, such as specimen handling, incubation times, and
cross-reactivity.
