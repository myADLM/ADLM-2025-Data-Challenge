STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
QUANTITATIVE LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS: T, B, AND NATURAL
KILLER (NK) CELLS, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To accurately measure and report the quantity of T cells (CD3+), B
cells (CD19+), and Natural Killer (NK) cells (CD16+/CD56+) in a
blood sample, using flow cytometry techniques.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of authorized laboratory personnel to perform
the assay accurately and report results as required. Any issues
encountered during the process should be promptly reported to the
supervisor on duty.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Flow Cytometer with appropriate filter sets
• Fluorochrome-labeled antibodies: Anti-CD3, Anti-CD19, Anti-
CD16/CD56
• Isotype controls for fluorochrome-labeled antibodies
• Hemolytic agent (e.g., ammonium chloride lysis buffer)
• Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Sample tubes
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Documentation logs
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Samples should be processed within 24-48 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable: Clotted blood, severely hemolyzed samples,
incorrect anticoagulant used.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Label sample tubes with unique patient identifiers.
2. Gently mix blood sample by inverting the collection tube several
times.
3. Aliquot 100 μL of whole blood into each labeled flow cytometry
tube.
C. Staining Protocol:
1. Add appropriate volumes of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies to
each aliquoted blood sample:
◦ Anti-CD3 (fitc)
◦ Anti-CD19 (pe)
◦ Anti-CD16/CD56 (APC)
◦ Corresponding isotype controls.
2. Vortex each tube gently to mix.
3. Incubate tubes in the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes.
D. Red Blood Cell Lysis:
1. Add 1 mL of hemolytic agent to each tube.
2. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature, protected from
light.
3. Centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
4. Remove and discard supernatant without disturbing the cell
pellet.
E. Washing:
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of PBS.
2. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
3. Discard the supernatant.
4. Repeat wash step once more.
F. Acquisition:
1. Resuspend the final cell pellet in 500 μL of PBS.
2. Vortex gently before running on the flow cytometer.
3. Set up the flow cytometer using appropriate controls and
compensation settings.
4. Acquire a minimum of 10,000 lymphocyte events per tube.
5. DATA ANALYSIS
A. Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Use gating strategy to exclude debris and doublets.
2. Gate on lymphocyte population using forward and side scatter
characteristics.
3. Determine the percentage of T-cells (CD3+), B-cells (CD19+),
and NK-cells (CD16+/CD56+) within the lymphocyte gate.
4. Calculate absolute cell counts if needed by multiplying
percentage by total lymphocyte count obtained via hematology
analyzer.
B. Quality Control:
1. Regularly check flow cytometer performance using calibration
beads.
2. Include isotype controls to assess non-specific binding.
3. Use known positive and negative controls to monitor assay
performance.
4. RESULT REPORTING
A. Documentation:
• Record patient identifiers, sample details, reagents used, and any
deviations or issues encountered in the worksheet/log.
• Ensure all flow cytometry data and analysis are saved and
backed up appropriately.
B. Report:
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report the percentage and absolute count (if applicable) of T-cells
(CD3+), B-cells (CD19+), and NK-cells (CD16+/CD56+).
• Flag abnormal results following laboratory's critical values and
reporting guidelines.
1. INTERPRETATION AND LIMITATIONS
• Refer to published reference intervals for interpretation.
• Be aware of potential limitations such as sample quality, reagent
performance, and instrument calibration.
