Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for QUEEN PALM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing
serum samples for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to QUEEN
PALM antigen using an immunoassay system. The aim is to
ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of test results.
2. DEFINITION QUEEN PALM, IgE, Serum testing involves the
detection and quantification of specific IgE antibodies in the
patient’s serum directed against QEEN PALM allergens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing and documenting the analysis of
QUEEN PALM, IgE, Serum following this SOP. It is also their
responsibility to identify and report any issues or deviations
during testing to their supervisor immediately.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP System or similar)
• QUEEN PALM allergen-specific IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum sample tubes
• Centrifuge
• Quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE 5.1 Specimen Preparation
• Ensure that the received specimen is correctly labeled and
accessioned.
• Verify that the specimen type is serum. Specimens must be fresh
or adequately stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7 days or
frozen at -20°C if stored longer.
• Centrifuge the serum sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain
clear serum.
5.2 Equipment Preparation
• Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to warm up as per
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Load the QUEEN PALM-specific IgE reagent kit into the analyzer,
following the kit’s package insert for reagent preparation and
loading requirements.
• Prepare calibrators and controls as instructed in the reagent kit
insert.
5.3 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration of the analyzer using the provided calibrators.
Follow manufacturer guidelines for calibration procedure.
• Run quality control samples (both positive and negative controls)
at the start of each testing session to ensure the system's
performance is within accepted parameters.
• Document the QC results. If QC results are not within acceptable
limits, troubleshoot according to the instrument manual and
repeat until acceptable results are achieved. Do not proceed with
testing patient samples until QC is acceptable.
5.4 Sample Analysis
• Label and prepare sample racks or holders according to the
analyzer’s specifications.
• Pipette the required volume of clear serum into the appropriate
sample holder or well.
• Load the samples into the analyzer.
• Initiate the analysis by selecting the QUEEN PALM, IgE assay
from the analyzer’s test menu.
• Follow manufacturer instructions for the duration of the run and
any specific operational procedures.
5.5 Results Retrieval and Validation
• Once the run is complete, retrieve test results from the
immunoassay analyzer.
• Review the results for any flags or error codes that may indicate
potential issues with sample integrity or assay performance.
• Validate the results by comparing to the established reference
intervals:
◦ IgE level indicating sensitization: ≥ 0.35 kU/L
◦ Intervals for each grade (e.g., Grade 1: 0.35-0.70 kU/L, Grade
2: 0.70-3.50 kU/L, and so on).
5.6 Critical Results and Reporting
• Any results that are significantly elevated and could impact patient
care must be flagged as critical and reported immediately to the
designated medical professional.
• Verified results must be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) ensuring correct patient identification and test
codes. Cross-check the data entry for accuracy.
• Use site-specific reporting guidelines to ensure standardized
result communication.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow the immunoassay analyzer’s maintenance schedule for
routine and preventive maintenance.
• Address any troubleshooting using the analyzer’s manual or
contacting technical support if necessary.
• Document all maintenance and troubleshooting activities
performed.
