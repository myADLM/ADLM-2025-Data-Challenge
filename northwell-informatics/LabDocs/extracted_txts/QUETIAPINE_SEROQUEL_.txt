Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Quetiapine (Seroquel)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide the standardized procedure for
the analysis of Quetiapine (Seroquel) levels in serum or plasma
samples. This document outlines the steps involved from sample
preparation to the instrumental analysis and reporting of results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Quetiapine: Quetiapine, marketed as Seroquel, is an atypical
antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
and major depressive disorder.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The personnel responsible for conducting these procedures are
laboratory technologists and technicians trained in the methods
described within this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this SOP.
4. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma collected in lithium heparinized tubes.
• Acceptable: Serum from SST tube, ensuring no gel separation.
Volume:
• Minimum: 0.5 mL
Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 30 days
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Improperly labeled or timed samples
• Insufficient volume
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Mobile phase solutions
• Calibration standards for Quetiapine
• Internal standards
• Quality control materials
Supplies:
• Pipette tips
• Sample vials with caps
• Centrifuge tubes
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Reagent and Calibration Preparation:
◦ Prepare mobile phase solutions according to manufacturer's
specifications.
◦ Calibrate the instrument using Quetiapine calibration
standards ranging from 25 to 1000 ng/mL.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 3000-3500 rpm for 10-15
minutes to separate serum or plasma.
◦ Transfer the serum or plasma into labeled sample vials.
Analytical Method:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Ensure that the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system is calibrated
and in proper working condition.
◦ Set up the instrument with appropriate parameters for
Quetiapine detection:
▪ Column type: C18 reverse-phase column
▪ Mobile phase: Mixture of acetonitrile and water with
formic acid
▪ Flow rate: 0.3-0.5 mL/min
▪ Detection wavelength for HPLC: 220 nm or as specified
▪ Mass spectrometry parameters for LC-MS/MS:
Optimized for Quetiapine ionization
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared serum or plasma samples into the
autosampler.
◦ Include calibration standards and quality control samples in
each batch of analysis.
◦ Run the samples through the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Analyze internal quality control samples with each batch to
ensure the accuracy and precision of the results.
◦ Acceptable QC ranges should be within ±15% of the target
concentration.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs for Quetiapine
analysis.
◦ Ensure external QC results fall within the acceptable range
provided by the proficiency testing program.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Verification:
◦ Review the chromatograms or mass spectra for each
sample to ensure proper peak identification and integration.
◦ Verify the calculated Quetiapine concentrations against the
calibration curve.
2. Result Entry:
◦ Enter the verified Quetiapine concentrations into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Include any notable comments regarding sample integrity or
analysis issues.
3. Reference Intervals:
◦ Therapeutic range: 50-500 ng/mL (may vary based on
clinical guidelines)
◦ Critical value: >1000 ng/mL (immediate physician
notification required)
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
1. Maintain Records:
◦ Keep detailed records of all analyzed samples, including
sample identification, analysis dates, and results.
◦ Retain quality control and calibration data for audit
purposes.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING AND NOTIFICATION
1. Troubleshooting:
◦ If any issues arise with the instrument or results, follow the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guidelines.
◦ Notify the supervisor immediately for any deviations or
errors observed during the procedure.
2. Corrective Actions:
◦ Document and implement corrective actions for any
identified issues to prevent recurrence.
11. PROCEDURE REVIEW AND UPDATE
1. Annual Review:
◦ This SOP should be reviewed annually to ensure it remains
relevant and accurate.
2. Updates:
◦ Update the SOP as necessary to reflect any changes in
procedures, equipment, or reagents.
