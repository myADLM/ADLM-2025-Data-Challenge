Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Quinidine in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the method for quantifying quinidine in serum
samples, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory staff designated to handle quantitative serum quinidine
tests must adhere to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure's proper
execution and resolving any issues that may arise during testing.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) System
• Analytical Balance
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Centrifuge
• Water bath (if required)
• Reagent-grade water
• Acetonitrile (HPLC Grade)
• Methanol (HPLC Grade)
• Quinidine Reference Standard
• Mobile Phase Preparation:
◦ 70% Acetonitrile
◦ 30% Reagent grade water
• Serum Controls (negative and positive for quinidine)
• Calibrators and Quality Control Materials
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum samples collected using standard venipuncture technique.
Use red-top vaccutainer tubes or serum separator tubes (SST).
• The specimen must be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and then
centrifuged as soon as possible to separate the serum.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours or freeze at
-20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable:
• Samples with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial
contamination.
• Tubes with EDTA, heparin, or other anticoagulants.
• Improperly labeled specimens lacking patient information.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare a series of quinidine standards in serum: 0 ng/mL, 25
ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 250 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/
mL.
2. Prepare serum-based quality control samples (low, medium,
high concentration) within the expected quinidine range.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples if applicable and bring them to
room temperature.
2. Vortex each serum sample thoroughly.
3. Pipette 0.5 mL of serum into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
4. Add 1.0 mL acetonitrile to each tube to precipitate proteins.
5. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds then centrifuge at 10,000 rpm
for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean labeled tube for HPLC
analysis.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up HPLC system according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase (70% Acetonitrile / 30% Water) and
degas it before use.
3. Inject the prepared standards, quality controls, and serum
samples (typically 20 µL).
4. Use an appropriate column (e.g., C18) and validate column
temperature and flow rate (usually 1 mL/min).
5. Monitor and record peaks at the selected wavelength (e.g., 254
nm).
Calculations:
1. Measure the peak areas of quinidine in standards, controls, and
patient samples.
2. Generate a standard calibration curve by plotting peak areas
vs. concentration for standards.
3. Determine the concentrations of quinidine in patient serum
samples using the calibration curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both low, medium, and high concentration controls with each
analytical batch.
• Verify that the controls are within +/- 2 SD of their target values.
• If controls fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot the assay
and repeat testing after resolving the issue.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Manually or electronically input test results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Validate all results before reporting to ensure accuracy.
• The reference interval for quinidine in serum: typically 2-5 mcg/
mL, verify with laboratory-specific reference ranges.
Critical Results:
• Serum quinidine levels above 5 mcg/mL should be immediately
reported to the patient’s clinician as they may indicate toxicity.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other serum constituents should be
evaluated.
• Any deviation from the standard protocol must be documented
and justified.
