SOP for Analytical Phase: QUINOA (CHENOPODIUM QUINOA) IGE
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the accurate and
consistent analysis of CHENOPODIUM QUINOA IgE antibodies
in patient specimens, ensuring reliable and valid test results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis, ensuring all steps of this SOP are adhered
to, and maintaining accurate documentation of the process and
results.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the processing and analysis of patient specimens for
the detection and quantification of CHENOPODIUM QUINOA
IgE antibodies.
2. DEFINITION
• CHENOPODIUM QUINOA IgE: Immunoglobulin E antibodies
specific to quinoa, indicative of an allergic response.
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a common method
used for detecting and quantifying IgE antibodies in patient
samples.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ELISA reader
• Microplate washer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator (37°C)
• Timer
• Computer with appropriate software for data analysis
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• CHENOPODIUM QUINOA IgE ELISA kit (including standards,
controls, conjugate, substrate, stop solution)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Laboratory-grade cleaning supplies for maintaining equipment
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Handling:
• Ensure all patient specimens (serum or plasma) are correctly
labeled and received in an appropriate condition.
• Centrifuge specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum/plasma from cells.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will be completed within 72
hours; otherwise, store at -20°C or lower.
B. Reagent Preparation:
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare all reagents
included in the ELISA kit.
• Ensure all reagents reach room temperature before use.
• Prepare standard dilution series for the calibration curve.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Designate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples
in duplicate.
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to
appropriate wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Wash the plate 3-4 times using an automatic microplate
washer with the provided wash buffer to remove unbound
components.
3. Antibody Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to
each well.
◦ Incubate plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate 3-4 times.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) substrate
solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
5. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
6. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.
D. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
• Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards.
• Determine the concentration of CHENOPODIUM QUINOA IgE
antibodies in patient samples by comparing their absorbance
values to the standard curve.
• Record and analyze the results using appropriate software.
E. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
tested.
• Ensure that control values fall within the specified range to
validate the run.
• Document all QC results in the QC log, including any corrective
actions taken for out-of-range controls.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results to the originating provider following the laboratory's
standard reporting procedures.
• Include patient identification, test method, CHENOPODIUM
QUINOA IgE concentration, and any relevant comments or
interpretations.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer's
instructions for specific limitations and potential interferences of
the ELISA kit used.

1. DOCUMENTATION All steps taken during the analysis,
including reagent lot numbers, instrument calibration data, QC
results, and patient specimen results, must be accurately
documented in the laboratory information system (LIS).
By strictly adhering to this SOP, we ensure the reliability and
accuracy of CHENOPODIUM QUINOA IgE testing results,
contributing to high-quality patient care. This SOP must be reviewed
periodically and updated as necessary to align with current best
practices and technological advancements.
