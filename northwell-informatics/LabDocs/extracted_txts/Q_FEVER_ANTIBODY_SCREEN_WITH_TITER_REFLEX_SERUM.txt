Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Q Fever Antibody Screen
with Titer Reflex, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for performing Q Fever Antibody Screen
with Titer Reflex on serum specimens to ensure accurate and reliable
test results. This procedure includes the initial antibody screening as
well as the titer determination for positive screening results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
2.1 Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Minimum volume: 1 ml of serum.
2.2 Stability:
• Serum is stable for up to 7 days when stored at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
2.3 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than those specified above.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
3.1 Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage unit (2-8°C)
• ELISA reader
• Micropipettes with appropriate range (10 µL to 1000 µL)
• Timer
• Incubator (37°C)
3.2 Reagents:
• Q Fever Antibody ELISA Kit
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Calibrators and controls
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
the Q Fever Antibody Screen with Titer Reflex assay, and to ensure
that all equipment and reagents are properly maintained and quality
control measures are adhered to.
1. PROCEDURE:
5.1 Initial Q Fever Antibody Screening:
5.1.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature before
testing.
• Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any particulate
matter.
5.1.2 Test Setup:
• Bring ELISA kit reagents to room temperature before testing.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the preparation of
reagents and washes.
5.1.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Add calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples (diluted as
specified in the kit instructions) to appropriate wells.
2. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the specified time (usually
30-60 minutes).
3. Wash the plate according to the kit instructions.
4. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate at room
temperature for the specified time (usually 10-20 minutes).
5. Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
6. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.
5.1.4 Interpretation of Results:
• Compare the absorbance values of the samples to the cutoff
values.
• Positive Screening Result: Absorbance values higher than the
cutoff indicate a potential presence of Q Fever antibodies.
5.2 Titer Reflex:
5.2.1 Specimen Preparation for Titer:
• Prepare serial dilutions of the positive serum samples using
diluent provided in the ELISA kit.
5.2.2 Titer Determination:
1. Repeat the assay procedure as described in section 5.1 on
each dilution.
2. Record the absorbance values for each dilution.
5.2.3 Interpretation of Titer Results:
• The titer is defined as the highest dilution that still gives an
absorbance value above the cutoff.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
6.1 Internal Controls:
• Run kit-provided controls with each batch of tests to monitor
assay performance.
• Controls should yield results within the manufacturer's specified
range.
6.2 External Quality Controls:
• Participate in an external quality assessment program for Q Fever
antibody testing, if available.
6.3 Troubleshooting:
• If control results fall outside the acceptable range, do not report
patient results until issues are resolved.
• Check equipment calibration, reagent expiration dates, and
procedural adherence.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
7.1 Manual Entry:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific guidelines.
• Enter antibody screen results as "Positive" or "Negative".
7.2 Reflex Testing:
• If the screen is positive, include the titer result in the report.
• Report titer results as the highest serum dilution that produced a
positive result.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Negative: No detectable Q Fever antibodies.
• Positive: Detectable antibodies with titer indicated.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for detailed limitations
related to the ELISA kit being used.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's Q Fever Antibody ELISA Kit Insert
• Standard laboratory guidelines and reference texts for serological
testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Ensure all results, QC data, and any corrective actions are
documented according to laboratory standards.
• Record any deviations from the procedure and notify the
laboratory supervisor.
