Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Q Fever IgM and IgG
Titer Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analysis of Q Fever IgM and IgG titers in
serum samples at a CLIA-certified laboratory. This protocol
ensures accurate and reliable results, complying with CLIA
standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated staff to
follow this procedure. All staff members must ensure proper
handling and analysis of specimens and adhere to quality
control protocols to maintain the integrity of results.
3. SCOPE This SOP applies to the analysis of serum samples for
Q Fever IgM and IgG titers.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Q Fever IgM and IgG Titers: Detects the presence and
concentration of Q Fever-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in
serum.
• Serum Specimens: Blood-derived samples used for serological
testing.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Q Fever Serology Kit (IgM/IgG), e.g., ELISA Kit
• Calibrators, controls, and standards specific to the serological
assay
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Micropipettes (10 μL to 1000 μL)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Deionized water
• Timer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Wash buffer according to Q Fever Serology Kit instructions
• Laboratory-grade tissue paper
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Collection:
◦ Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques.
◦ Allow blood to clot in a serum separator tube.
◦ Centrifuge the sample to separate serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
• Specimen Storage:
◦ Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours.
◦ For longer storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens exhibiting hemolysis, microbial contamination, or
lipemia.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled or identified.
1. PROCEDURE
• Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and verified.
◦ Prepare wash buffer as instructed by the kit manufacturer.
• Assay Procedure (ELISA-based):
1. Sample Dilution: Dilute serum samples 1:100 in sample
diluent.
2. Loading Samples: Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls,
and diluted samples into designated wells.
3. Incubation: Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing: Wash the wells 3 times with wash buffer.
5. Addition of Conjugate: Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to
each well.
6. Second Incubation: Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
7. Second Washing: Wash the wells 3 times with wash buffer.
8. Substrate Addition: Add 100 µL of substrate solution to
each well.
9. Third Incubation: Incubate for 15 minutes at room
temperature, protecting the plate from light.
10. Stopping Reaction: Add 100 µL of stop solution to each
well.
11. Reading: Read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance values for each standard,
control, and sample.
◦ Plot a standard curve using the standards' absorbance
values.
◦ Determine the concentration of Q Fever IgM/IgG titers in the
samples from the standard curve.
• Reference Ranges:
◦ Negative: < 20 RU/mL
◦ Equivocal: 20 - 25 RU/mL
◦ Positive: > 25 RU/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay.
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the manufacturer's specified
range for valid results.
◦ Record all result discrepancies or abnormal occurrences in
a QC log.
◦ Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Verify all results before reporting.
◦ Results should be reported according to site-specific
guidelines.
1. REFERENCE AND LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for detailed reagent-
specific instructions and limitations.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other infections may occur.
