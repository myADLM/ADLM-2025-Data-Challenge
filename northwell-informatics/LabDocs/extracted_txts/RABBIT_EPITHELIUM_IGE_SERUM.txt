Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Rabbit
Epithelium IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing Rabbit Epithelium IgE in serum
samples using an immunoassay technique. This SOP ensures
accurate and reproducible test results, promoting consistency and
reliability in laboratory operations.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory staff members are responsible for
following this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff adherence and
addressing any discrepancies or issues during the process.
1. DEFINITION
Rabbit Epithelium IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to rabbit
epithelium, an indicator of rabbit allergy. IgE assays typically involve
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunoCAP
technology for allergen-specific IgE detection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood into an SST (Serum Separator Tube).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (15-25°C) for 30
minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 2000-3000g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Aliquot serum into pre-labeled secondary tubes.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 7 days;
otherwise, store at -20°C or lower for longer term storage.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature (15-25°C): 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen at -20°C or lower: 1 month
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Rabbit Epithelium IgE Immunoassay Kit
• Calibrators
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Plate washer (optional)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure the microplate reader, incubator, and other equipment
are calibrated and validated.
2. Follow kit-specific instructions for reagent preparation.
3. Bring all reagents, controls, and samples to room temperature
before starting the assay.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Label the required number of wells in the microplate for
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Add an appropriate volume (e.g., 50 µL) of standards, controls,
and patient samples to the designated wells.
3. Add an appropriate volume (e.g., 50 µL) of enzyme conjugate
to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit
instructions (common: 60 minutes).
5. Wash the plate according to the kit instructions (typically 3-5
times) to remove unbound materials.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time (common: 10-15 minutes).
7. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
8. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Calculation and Reporting
1. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance values of the
standards.
2. Determine the IgE concentration in each patient sample by
comparing the absorbance values to the standard curve.
3. Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review.
4. Verify and report the results according to the laboratory's
standard reporting protocol.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Ensure control results fall within the established range before
reporting patient results.
3. Document control results and any corrective actions taken if
controls fall outside the acceptable range.
B. External Quality Assurance
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
2. Review external quality assurance results and take corrective
actions if required.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
4. Low or High Control Values:
◦ Recheck reagents and equipment calibration.
◦ Repeat the assay with fresh controls.
5. Poor Standard Curve:
◦ Ensure proper dilution and pipetting accuracy.
◦ Confirm wavelength settings on the microplate reader.
6. Non-specific Binding/High Background:
◦ Ensure thorough washing steps are performed.
◦ Check for contamination of reagents.

1. DOCUMENTATION
All records including reagent preparation, calibration, control results,
and patient results must be maintained according to the laboratory's
documentation policy to ensure traceability and regulatory
compliance.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will be able to accurately
and consistently measure Rabbit Epithelium IgE concentration in
serum samples, facilitating proper diagnosis and management of
rabbit allergy in patients.
