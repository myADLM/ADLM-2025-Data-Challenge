Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Rabbit Meat, IgE,
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a comprehensive SOP for
the analytical phase of generating results for Rabbit Meat, IgE,
Serum. The procedure ensures accurate, consistent, and
reproducible results using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) methodology.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately and consistently. Responsibility includes the
preparation, analysis, result generation, and documentation of the
Rabbit Meat, IgE, Serum tests.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Rabbit Meat, IgE: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to
rabbit meat.
• Serum: The component of blood that is typically used for testing
Rabbit Meat, IgE levels.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum volume of 200 µL
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable when stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric,
or contaminated specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microplate reader with a 450nm filter (with 620-650nm correction
filter)
• Microplate washer
• ELISA kit specifically designed for Rabbit Meat, IgE (including
reagents, standards, controls, and microplates)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated)
• Distilled or deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare all reagents according to the
ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions. Allow all reagents and
samples to reach room temperature before use.
2. Microplate Setup: Set up the microplate(s) with appropriate
controls, calibrators, and samples, ensuring to keep track of
their positions for result interpretation.
B. Sample and Control Preparation
1. Dilution: Dilute serum samples when necessary following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Pipetting: Pipette appropriate volumes of standards, controls,
and serum samples into designated wells on the microplate.
C. Incubation and Washing
1. Incubation: Incubate the plate as directed by the kit
manufacturer. This typically involves allowing the antigen-
antibody reaction to occur at specified temperatures and
durations.
2. Washing Steps: Following incubation, wash the microplate
using the microplate washer with the wash buffer provided in
the kit. Follow the washing procedure indicated by the kit to
minimize background noise and ensure accuracy.
D. Detection
1. Addition of Substrate: Add the enzyme-substrate solution to
each well. Incubate for the time specified until the color change
is sufficient.
2. Stop Reaction: Add the stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
7. RESULT MEASUREMENT
1. Microplate Reading: Read the optical density (OD) of each
well at 450nm with a correction wavelength of 620-650nm using
the microplate reader.
2. Result Calculation and Interpretation: Use the standards and
controls to generate a standard curve. Determine the IgE
concentration in each sample by referencing the OD values to
the standard curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control: Include both high and low control
samples in each assay run to validate results. Control results
must fall within established ranges.
2. Troubleshooting: If controls fall outside the established range,
the assay must be repeated. Record and investigate the cause
following laboratory guidelines.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Documentation: Document all raw OD readings,
calculations, and final results in the laboratory’s information
system.
2. Review and Verification: The data must be reviewed and
verified for accuracy and consistency by the responsible
technologist before the release of results.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit datasheet for specific limitations of the Rabbit
Meat, IgE assay. Common limitations include potential cross-
reactivity and interference from other serum components.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Establish the reference intervals for Rabbit Meat, IgE per the
manufacturer's recommendation or validated laboratory in-house
data.
12. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow laboratory biosafety guidelines.
• Use appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection) when
handling patient specimens and reagents.
• Properly dispose of all biohazardous waste.

14. AMENDMENTS
Any amendments or deviations from this SOP shall be documented,
justified, and authorized by the laboratory supervisor.
