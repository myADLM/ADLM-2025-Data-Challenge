Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase
Analysis of Rabbit Serum Proteins and IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Rabbit Serum Proteins and IgE from
serum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures as defined in this protocol,
including ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results. The
supervisors are responsible for monitoring adherence to the SOP and
addressing any deviations or issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Method: Blood collected by venipuncture.
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Transport and Storage: Transport specimens on ice and store at
-20°C if not analyzed immediately. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Lipemic samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than serum
separator tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for Rabbit
Serum Proteins and IgE
• Microplate reader (capable of reading at 450 nm)
• Pipettes (20-200 µL and 50-1000 µL)
• Multichannel pipette (50-300 µL)
• Plate washer or manual washing materials
• Adjustable micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Calibrated traceable thermometer
• Cold storage (-20°C freezer and 2-8°C refrigerator)
• Eppendorf tubes
• Deionized or distilled water
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize positive and negative controls provided in the ELISA kit.
Follow manufacturer's recommendations for control preparation
and usage.
• Perform a quality control run with each new lot of reagents or kit.
For lot-to-lot consistency, perform side-by-side comparisons when
switching to new lots.
• Maintain internal quality controls and external proficiency testing
as per laboratory standards.
• Document results of quality control runs on a Quality Control Log
and monitor regularly for trends or deviations.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples and reagents completely, mix well before
use. Vortex samples to ensure homogeneity.
2. Set microplate reader to detect at 450 nm frequency.
3. Prepare and label all reagents according to the ELISA kit insert.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents as instructed in the ELISA kit insert.
◦ Dilute serum samples if necessary according to kit
instructions.
2. Setup:
◦ Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
◦ Arrange samples, standards, and controls on ELISA plate as
depicted in the layout provided by the kit insert.
3. Washing Steps:
◦ Ensure proper washing steps as specified in the kit protocol,
typically involving multiple washes with wash buffer to
remove unbound substances.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time.
◦ Observe color change, indicative of the target analyte
presence.
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to halt the enzymatic reaction. The
resultant color changes from blue to yellow, ensuring the
reaction is stopped effectively.
6. Reading Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate
reader.
7. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
8. Standard Curve:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the standards provided,
plotting absorbance vs. concentration.
◦ Determine the concentration of Rabbit Serum Proteins and
IgE in each sample from the standard curve.
9. Reporting:
◦ Document the results accurately and input into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals (normal ranges) should be established based
on existing literature or by analyzing a large sample of healthy
rabbit serum specimens.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, re-test the
controls. If further issues arise, troubleshoot based on the ELISA
kit manual.
• Ensure the microplate reader is properly calibrated.
• Check for reagent expiration or misuse, and repeat the assay if
necessary.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Keep records of all specimens, reagents, and quality control
results.
• Ensure all equipment maintenance and calibration logs are up to
date.
• Store raw data and assay results securely and adhere to data
retention policies.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Record any modifications or updates to the protocol with
appropriate justification and authorization.
