SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for RABBIT URINE
PROTEINS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of testing
rabbit urine proteins, IgE levels, and serum analysis. It ensures that
proper techniques and standard procedures are followed to yield
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the assigned medical laboratory scientist
to perform all steps in this procedure accurately and record
results accordingly.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for monitoring
compliance with this procedure and verifying the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Rabbit Urine:
◦ Specimen: Freshly voided urine collected in sterile containers.
◦ Volume: Minimum 5 mL.
◦ Stability: Analyzed within 6 hours of collection. If refrigerated at
2-8°C, stable for up to 24 hours.
• Serum (for IgE and other protein analysis):
◦ Specimen: Blood collected by venipuncture in suitable tubes
(red-top or serum separator tubes).
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
◦ Stability: Serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours of collection or frozen at -20°C for
longer storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Urinalysis analyzer (for protein analysis)
• ELISA kit specific for rabbit IgE
• Protein assay kits (e.g. BCA or Bradford methods)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
A) Urine Protein Analysis
1. Mix the urine sample thoroughly before analysis.
2. Calibrate the urinalysis analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Pipette the appropriate volume of urine into the sample
container provided by the analyzer.
4. Place the sample container in the analyzer.
5. Start the analysis following the analyzer’s operating
instructions.
6. Record and print the results. Document the results in the
laboratory information system.
B) IgE Analysis (ELISA)
1. Allow serum samples and ELISA reagents to reach room
temperature.
2. Prepare all reagents, standards, and samples as described in
the ELISA kit manual.
3. Add controls, standards, and serum samples into the microplate
wells.
4. Follow the incubation, washing, and detection steps as outlined
in the ELISA kit instructions.
5. Read the optical density at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
6. Analyze the data and calculate the IgE concentration using the
standard curve.
7. Record results in the laboratory information system.
C) Serum Protein Analysis
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum into assay tubes.
3. Prepare standards and reagents according to the chosen
protein assay kit (e.g., BCA or Bradford).
4. Add the reagents to the serum samples as specified by the
assay protocol.
5. Incubate the samples for the recommended time and
temperature.
6. Measure the absorbance at the wavelength specified in the
assay kit instructions using a spectrophotometer.
7. Calculate the protein concentration from the standard curve.
8. Record the results in the laboratory information system.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality controls for urinalysis analyzers using control
solutions at the start of the day and after running every 20
samples.
• Include positive and negative controls for the ELISA assay with
each run.
• Use standard and blank controls for serum protein assays.
• Document all quality control results. If controls do not pass,
troubleshoot and rerun tests before proceeding with sample
analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Urine Protein: Results are reported as mg/dL as recorded from
the urinalysis analyzer.
• IgE: Results are documented in the units specified by the ELISA
kit (e.g., ng/mL or IU/mL).
• Serum proteins: Results are expressed in mg/mL and recorded in
the laboratory information system.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for urinalysis analyzer.
• ELISA kit manual for rabbit IgE.
• Protein assay kit manuals (BCA or Bradford).
This protocol is effective from the date of approval and will be
reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate new practices or
changes.
