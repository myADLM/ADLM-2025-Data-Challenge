Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating
Rabies Antibody Endpoint Test Results
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the analytical phase of the
Rabies Antibody Endpoint test to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This document describes the procedure for the analysis of rabies
antibody levels in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
assay and generate results accurately following this SOP. It is also
their responsibility to ensure that all equipment and reagents are
maintained and calibrated according to the defined standards.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents are prepared as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Verify that all reagents are within their expiration dates and
properly stored.
2. Equipment Calibration:
◦ Ensure all equipment involved in the procedure (pipettes,
incubators, ELISA readers, etc.) are calibrated and
functioning appropriately.
◦ Document calibration details in the Equipment Calibration
Log.
4.2. Specimen Preparation
1. Sample Retrieval:
◦ Retrieve serum samples from storage and allow them to
equilibrate to room temperature.
◦ Inspect samples for any hemolysis or turbidity, which can
interfere with results.
2. Controls:
◦ Prepare positive and negative control samples according to
the kit instructions.
4.3. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Label the assay plate and add control and patient serum
samples to designated well positions as specified by the
assay protocol.
◦ Ensure proper duplication for all samples to ensure reliable
results.
2. Antibody Binding:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of antigen to each well
containing the serum or control samples.
◦ Incubate the plate under the specified conditions
(temperature and time) as defined by the assay protocol.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly as per the manufacturer's
instructions to remove unbound components.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate for the required duration under the
specified conditions.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Following another wash step, add the substrate solution to
each well.
◦ Incubate for the required time or until desired color
development.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to halt the enzymatic reaction.
◦ Ensure consistent and timely addition to all wells.
4.4. Reading and Interpretation
1. Reading Results:
◦ Read the absorbance values at the appropriate wavelength
using an ELISA reader.
◦ Record the absorbance values for each well.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the antibody concentrations using the provided
standard curve by plotting absorbance against known
concentrations.
◦ Utilize the formula or software provided with the assay kit to
determine the endpoint titers of the rabies antibodies in the
serum samples.
4.5. Quality Control
1. Run Controls:
◦ Validate each test run by ensuring that the positive and
negative control results fall within predefined ranges.
◦ If controls fail, the test run is invalid, and the entire
procedure must be repeated.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all raw data, calculations, and any deviations or
issues encountered during the procedure in the Rabies
Antibody Testing Logbook.
4.6. Reporting Results
1. Verification:
◦ Verify results with the values obtained from standard
controls.
◦ Ensure no discrepancies are present before logging the final
results.
2. Recording:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review.
3. Review:
◦ Ensure a secondary technologist or a supervisor reviews the
results.
5. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
◦ Use appropriate PPE, including gloves, lab coats, and eye
protection at all times.
2. Spill Management:
◦ Follow the laboratory’s spill management guidelines in case
of any accidental spills.
3. Biohazard Handling:
◦ Dispose of all waste materials in designated biohazard
containers as per the laboratory’s waste disposal
procedures.
