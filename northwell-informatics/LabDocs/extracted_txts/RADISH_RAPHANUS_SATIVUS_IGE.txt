SOP Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for RADISH
(RAPHANUS SATIVUS) IGE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures followed for the
analysis of RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVUS) Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
levels in patient serum samples.
Responsibility:
All designated staff members are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable
results. The supervisor is responsible for monitoring adherence to the
protocol and implementing corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVUS) IgE: Specific Immunoglobulin E
antibodies directed against Radish (Raphanus sativus) allergens.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Reagents and Supplies
1. Calibration and Quality Control Materials
2. Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
3. RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVUS) IgE-specific Reagents
4. Quality Control material with known levels of IgE
5. Sample tubes and related consumables
6. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3.2 Equipment Preparation
1. Ensure the automated immunoassay analyzer is turned on,
calibrated, and functioning according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Check the reagents for expiration date and proper labelling.
3. Perform daily maintenance procedures on the analyzer
according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
3.3 Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the patient serum samples have been properly
collected, received, and accessioned in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Verify patient details and sample identifiers.
3. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1000-1500xg for 10-15
minutes to remove cellular components.
4. Transfer the clarified serum to appropriately labelled test tubes,
ensuring no cross-contamination.
3.4 Running the Assay
1. Load patient samples, calibration standards, and quality
controls onto the automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Follow the specific loading instructions for the RADISH
(RAPHANUS SATIVUS) IgE-specific reagents.
3. Set up the assay run, including the acceptance criteria for
calibration and quality control.
4. Initiate the assay run according to the analyzer's standard
operating procedures.
5. Monitor the analyzer during assay run to ensure proper
function. Address any alerts or errors promptly.
3.5 Result Review and Verification
1. Review the raw data and ensure quality control results fall
within the acceptable ranges.
2. If quality control results do not meet specifications, troubleshoot
the issue, recalibrate the instrument if necessary, and repeat
the assay.
3. Verify results: Compare the obtained RADISH (RAPHANUS
SATIVUS) IgE levels with reference ranges.
4. Document any discrepancies and take corrective actions if
needed.
5. Approve the results for reporting.
3.6 Reporting Results
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the designated technologist.
2. Confirm that patient identifiers and sample details match those
on the test results.
3. Report and record the results in compliance with laboratory
reporting guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Utilize internal quality control materials as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
6. Ensure daily, weekly, and monthly quality control procedures
are adhered to, including QC with each new batch/lot of
reagents.
7. Document quality control results and take appropriate actions
for any out-of-range results.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference interval for RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVUS) IgE is
specified in the reagent's package insert and has been validated by
the laboratory. Interpret results according to these intervals:
• Normal: < 0.35 kU/L
• Elevated: ≥ 0.35 kU/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for specific limitations of
the RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVUS) IgE assay.
1. REFERENCES
Include references to applicable literature, reagent package inserts,
and equipment manuals:
• Manufacturer’s package insert for RADISH (RAPHANUS
SATIVUS) IgE assay.
• Manufacturer’s manual for the automated immunoassay analyzer.
All staff members are expected to be familiar with this SOP and
adhere strictly to the procedures herein. Compliance will be
monitored and any deviations will be documented and addressed
accordingly.
