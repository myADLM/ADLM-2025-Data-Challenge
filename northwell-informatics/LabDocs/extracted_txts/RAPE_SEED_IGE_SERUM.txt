Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Generating Results for RAPE
SEED, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures
for the analysis of RAPE SEED-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in
serum samples. This will ensure consistency and accuracy in the
generation of test results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis of RAPE SEED, IGE, SERUM in the
designated laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated staff to
perform the specified analytical procedures accurately and to ensure
that quality control measures are strictly followed. It is also the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to verify results and
maintain documentation.
4. DEFINITION RAPE SEED, IGE, SERUM: A specific allergen test
aimed to measure the concentration of IgE antibodies against Rape
Seed in a patient's serum.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Receive serum sample and ensure it has been properly
accessioned and labeled.
2. Verify that the sample volume is appropriate (recommended
minimum of 2 mL serum).
3. Store the sample at 2-8°C if not immediately processed and
must be processed within 48 hours of collection. For delayed
processing, store at -20°C or lower.
4. If the sample has been frozen, thaw it at room temperature and
mix gently before analysis.
B. Equipment and Reagents:
1. Immunoassay Analyzer specific for IgE quantification (e.g.
Phadia™ ImmunoCAP™ System or equivalent)
2. RAPE SEED specific IgE reagent kits
3. Calibrators and controls specific to the analyzer used
4. Pipettes and pipette tips
5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – gloves, lab coat, and
safety goggles
6. Sample tubes and racks
C. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform a system calibration using manufacturer-supplied
calibrators according to the immunoassay analyzer’s
instructions.
2. Run two levels of quality control samples (positive and negative
controls) prior to analyzing patient samples.
3. Document quality control results in the Quality Control Log and
ensure they fall within the acceptance criteria.
4. If QC fails, troubleshoot according to manufacturer guidelines
and do not proceed with patient sample analysis until QC is
acceptable.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Input necessary sample information into the analyzer’s software
system.
3. Begin the analysis cycle following the manufacturer’s
operational instructions.
4. Once the run concludes, review the data for any flags or error
messages.
E. Result Review and Verification:
1. Verify that the control results are within the acceptable range
before interpreting patient results.
2. Review patient results for consistency and accuracy, ensuring
no errors were flagged by the analyzer.
3. Any results beyond the reportable range should be reanalyzed
or diluted appropriately as per the analyzer’s guidelines and
rerun.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Record the results in the laboratory information system.
2. Print or electronically transmit results to the patient’s medical
record.
3. Ensure all abnormal or critical results are flagged and
communicated to the requesting physician as per laboratory
protocol.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the ImmunoCAP™ system or
equivalent product insert for any specific limitations related to RAPE
SEED, IGE, SERUM testing.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE: Analyze quality control
samples with every batch of patient samples to ensure the accuracy
and precision of the results. Maintain detailed records of all QC
activities and any corrective actions taken.
8. REFERENCES: ImmunoCAP™ Product Insert (or equivalent
system documentation). Manufacturer's guidelines for the specific
immunoassay system in use.
9. DOCUMENTATION: Maintain records of all calibrations, quality
control checks, patient results, troubleshooting activities, and any
corrective actions in accordance with laboratory regulatory
requirements.
