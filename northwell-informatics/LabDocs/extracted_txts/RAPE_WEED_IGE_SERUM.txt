Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
RAPE WEED, IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of RAPE WEED specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples.
This SOP ensures accurate and reliable results in accordance with
laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting results. It is the responsibility of the
designated staff and supervisors to ensure adherence to this SOP,
including any corrective actions that may be required.
2. DEFINITION
RAPE WEED IgE analysis refers to the measurement of specific IgE
antibodies in the serum that react to RAPE WEED allergens. This
analysis helps diagnose allergic sensitization to RAPE WEED.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred specimens: 2 ml of serum collected in a serum-
separating tube (SST).
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in non-SST tubes or tubes containing
anticoagulants.
◦ Specimens with signs of hemolysis or lipemia.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled or arriving in the lab more
than 24 hours after collection.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP)
• Specific IgE test kits
• Pipettes, tips, and other standard laboratory glassware
• Serum-separating tubes (SST)
• Controls and calibrators
Procedure Steps
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Upon receiving the serum sample, ensure it is properly
labeled and check for any signs of hemolysis or improper
collection.
◦ If the sample has been refrigerated, allow it to warm to room
temperature prior to processing.
2. Loading Samples on Analyzer
◦ Load the serum sample into the designated sample racks of
the Phadia ImmunoCAP analyzer.
◦ Ensure that positive and negative controls are included in
the assay run.
◦ Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and specify the IgE analysis for RAPE WEED.
3. Running the Assay
◦ Initiate the assay run on the analyzer. The immunoassay will
automatically process the samples and provide quantitative
results for RAPE WEED specific IgE.
◦ Monitor the analyzer during the run to ensure it is
functioning properly.
4. Result Documentation
◦ Upon completion of the assay, review the results generated
by the analyzer.
◦ Document the IgE levels for RAPE WEED in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify the results, ensuring they meet the acceptable quality
control standards.
Quality Control
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly quality control checks as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Include positive and negative controls with each assay run to
ensure accuracy.
• If any QC fails, follow the troubleshooting methods provided by
the analyzer’s manufacturer, and notify the supervisor.
Reporting Results
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Ensure critical results are communicated to the appropriate
healthcare providers per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals
• The reference interval for RAPE WEED specific IgE will be
provided in the test kit insert. Commonly, specific IgE results are
categorized into classes (0-6) based on concentration.
Method Limitations
• Refer to the specific test kit insert for limitations related to patient
conditions, interfering substances, and cross-reactivity.
• Ensure specimens are handled according to the stability
requirements to prevent degradation.

Review and Approval
• This SOP must be reviewed annually and approved by the
laboratory management.
• Any updates to this SOP should be documented and
communicated to all relevant staff.
