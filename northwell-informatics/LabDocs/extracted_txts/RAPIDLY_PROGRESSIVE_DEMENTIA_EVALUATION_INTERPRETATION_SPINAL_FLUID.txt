SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Rapidly
Progressive Dementia Evaluation Interpretation (Spinal Fluid)
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for the analysis and interpretation of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the evaluation of rapidly progressive
dementia (RPD). Proper procedures ensure accurate, timely, and
reliable test results to support the diagnosis and management of
patients with RPD.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all CSF samples received for the evaluation
of rapidly progressive dementia within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff and technologists will follow this SOP for
the analysis and interpretation of CSF specimens. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure accuracy, completeness, and
reliability of results reporting.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Microscopes
• Automated Cell Counter (if available)
• CSF collection tubes
• Protein and glucose assay reagents
• Immunoassay kits for specific biomarkers
• Various staining agents (Gram stain, Cytology stains)
• Specimen transport cooler
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Handling and Preparation
• Acceptance Criteria:
◦ CSF must be collected in sterile tubes and transported
immediately to the laboratory.
◦ The sample should be free from visible blood contamination
(except traumatic tap).
• Rejection Criteria:
◦ Samples not transported on ice.
◦ Specimens with leakage or not properly sealed.
◦ Insufficient sample volume for performing required tests.
• Initial Processing:
◦ Log and accession the CSF sample into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Store samples on ice and process immediately.
5.2 Analytical Procedures
5.2.1 Macroscopic Examination
• Record color and clarity.
• Note any visible abnormalities.
5.2.2 Microscopic Examination
• Cell Count:
◦ Manual/Lumbar Cell Count:
▪ If an automated cell counter is not available, perform a
manual cell count using a hemocytometer.
▪ Report WBC and RBC per µL.
◦ Automated Cell Count:
▪ Load CSF into the automated cell counter as per
manufacturer's instructions. Verify results visually if
needed.
• Differential Cell Count:
◦ Cytospin the sample and stain with an appropriate cytology
stain.
◦ Perform a detailed differential count (lymphocytes, monocytes,
neutrophils).
5.2.3 Biochemical Analysis
• Total Protein:
◦ Use biuret method or an equivalent chemistry analyzer
method.
◦ Reference interval: Up to 45 mg/dL.
• Glucose:
◦ Determine glucose concentration using enzymatic methods in
chemistry analyzer.
◦ Reference interval: 40-70 mg/dL.
• Other Biomarkers (as ordered):
◦ Use specific immunoassays or enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISA) for detecting dementia-associated biomarkers
such as:
▪ Tau proteins
▪ Beta-amyloid proteins
▪ 14-3-3 protein (where RPD is suspected to be prion
disease).
5.2.4 Microbiological Testing
• Gram Stain and Culture:
◦ Prepare CSF samples for Gram staining and culture on
appropriate media if infection is suspected.
• PCR Testing:
◦ Perform any PCR tests as ordered, specifically targeting
pathogens associated with neuroinfection contributing to RPD.
5.3 Quality Control
• All CSF assays should include appropriate controls, and results
should be recorded in the QC log.
• Any outlier QC results should be addressed immediately, with
appropriate troubleshooting and corrective action taken.
5.4 Reporting Results
• Review and Verification:
◦ All findings should be reviewed by a secondary technologist.
◦ Results entered into the LIS should be verified before being
made available to clinicians.
• Critical Results:
◦ Any results that are critically abnormal should be immediately
communicated to the requesting clinician and documented as
per laboratory protocol.
• Report Interpretation:
◦ A detailed report will include the following sections:
macroscopic observations, cell count, biochemical results, and
microbiological findings.
◦ Interpretation and summary should provide insights relevant to
the diagnosis of RPD.

• Document any amendments and updates to this SOP as required
by the latest clinical and laboratory guidelines, and record the
date and details of changes.
