Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE DEMENTIA EVALUATION,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the analysis of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected for the evaluation of
rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) in compliance with CLIA
regulations.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to carry
out the analytical procedures ensuring accuracy and precision,
maintain records of analysis, and report results promptly and
correctly.
1. DEFINITIONS
Rapidly Progressive Dementia (RPD): A form of dementia that
progresses quickly over weeks to months. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):
A clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spine.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: CSF collected into sterile leak-proof
containers. Preferably 3-5 mL distributed across three to five
aliquots.
• Storage Conditions: CSF must be stored at 2-8°C if analyzing
within 24 hours, otherwise freeze at -80°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens mixed with blood, or
collected in a non-sterile container.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical balance
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Reagents and standards for protein, glucose, and lactate
measurements
• PCR equipment for genetic and infectious disease testing
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for tau protein,
Aβ42 and 14-3-3 protein
• Spectrophotometer
• Safety equipment: gloves, lab coat, eye protection
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-analytical Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples promptly at room temperature or on ice.
2. Mix gently by inverting the sample tube. Avoid vigorous
shaking.
3. Centrifuge all samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
cellular debris.
4. Aliquot CSF into labeled tubes for each specific analysis to
avoid freeze-thaw cycles.
B) Analytical Procedures:
1. Total Protein Measurement:
◦ Use the Biuret method or Lowry method for protein
quantification.
◦ Prepare standards and reagent blanks.
◦ Measure absorbance using a spectrophotometer at the
appropriate wavelength.
◦ Run a quality control sample with each batch of assays.
2. Glucose Measurement:
◦ Analyze using the glucose oxidase-peroxidase method.
◦ Prepare standards and reagent blanks.
◦ Measure absorbance using a spectrophotometer at 540 nm.
◦ Include quality control samples for each run.
3. Lactate Measurement:
◦ Perform lactate analysis using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
method.
◦ Measure absorbance spectrophotometrically.
◦ Ensure quality control standards are included.
4. Protein Analysis for Tau Protein, Aβ42, and 14-3-3 Protein:
◦ Perform ELISA assays as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Pipette standards, controls, and samples into the
designated wells.
◦ Add detection antibodies and substrates as per protocol.
◦ Measure optical density using a microplate reader at the
appropriate wavelength.
5. PCR for Genetic and Infectious Disease Testing:
◦ Extract DNA/RNA from the CSF sample using standard
procedures.
◦ Set up the PCR reactions with specific primers for target
genes or pathogens.
◦ Run the PCR and interpret the data as per the kit's
guidelines.
C) Post-analytical Procedures:
1. Verify and cross-check results against quality control standards.
2. Document all steps, including any deviations from the protocol.
3. Record final values in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and flag any abnormal results.
4. All results should be reviewed by a qualified laboratory
technologist or supervisor before release.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run daily quality control checks utilizing high, medium, and low-
level QC samples.
2. Document the QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before analyzing patient samples.
3. If QC is out of range, troubleshoot and resolve the issue prior to
processing patient samples.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Transmit results automatically to the LIS where applicable.
6. Manually review results for accuracy.
7. Report critical or abnormal findings immediately to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider per laboratory
policy.
8. Record and store results securely in accordance with laboratory
policies and regulatory requirements.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Any limitations of the methods used as described in the individual
assay kit inserts or manufacturer instructions should be noted,
including the potential for interference, sensitivity range, and
specificity.
1. REFERENCES
Include references to all standard methodologies, reagent kits, and
instrument manuals used in the analysis.
End of Protocol
Please follow this procedure meticulously to ensure accurate and
reliable results for the evaluation of Rapidly Progressive Dementia
through CSF analysis.
