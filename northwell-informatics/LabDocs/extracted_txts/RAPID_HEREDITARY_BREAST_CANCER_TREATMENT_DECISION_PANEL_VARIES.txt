1. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for
the analysis of specimens using the Rapid Hereditary Breast
Cancer Treatment Decision Panel. This test is designed to
assist in the clinical decision-making process for hereditary
breast cancer treatment.
2. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
The Rapid Hereditary Breast Cancer Treatment Decision Panel
uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect mutations in
genes associated with hereditary breast cancer. The panel is
specifically developed to rapidly identify actionable genetic
variants that can guide treatment decisions.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
◦ 5-10 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA tube.
◦ Saliva collected using the provided saliva collection kit.
◦ DNA extracted from peripheral blood or saliva with a
concentration of at least 50 ng/μL and a total volume of 1-2
μg.
Stability:
◦ Whole blood: stable at room temperature for up to 48 hours,
stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
◦ Saliva: stable at room temperature for up to 14 days.
◦ Extracted DNA: kept at -20°C for long-term storage.
Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, clotted, or severely lipemic blood samples.
◦ Saliva samples improperly collected or exposed to
contaminants.
◦ Insufficient or degraded DNA samples.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ NGS library preparation kit
◦ NGS sequencing platform
◦ Thermal cycler
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ DNA extraction kits and reagents
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Enzyme Mixes
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ 1.5 mL microfuge tubes
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for extracting DNA
from the appropriate specimen type.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of DNA using a
spectrophotometer or other suitable methods.
3. Document DNA concentration and quality metrics.
B. Library Preparation
1. Normalize DNA concentration to the required input
amount as specified by the library preparation kit.
2. Construct DNA libraries following the NGS library
preparation protocol.
3. Assess library quality and quantity using a bioanalyzer or
equivalent systems.
4. Pool the libraries as required for sequencing.
C. Sequencing
1. Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS sequencing
platform.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the sequencing
run.
3. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure proper completion.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Transfer the raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics
pipeline.
2. Perform data quality control and filter out low-quality
reads.
3. Align sequences to the reference genome.
4. Call variants and annotate relevant mutations.
5. Validate and interpret genetic variants according to clinical
significance guidelines (e.g., ACMG/AMP).
6. Generate a comprehensive report of findings.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Controls
◦ Include known positive and negative controls in each
sequencing run to ensure accurate results.
◦ Validate and document internal control results before
analyzing sample data.
B. External Controls
◦ Participate in proficiency testing and external quality
assurance programs to maintain assay accuracy.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Verify and review the final report by a qualified laboratory
technologist. B. Results should be reviewed and signed off by a
clinical geneticist or designated supervisor. C. Ensure that the
report includes relevant findings, interpretations, and
recommended clinical actions. D. Adhere to site-specific
reporting guidelines for final result documentation and
communication with clinicians.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND ACTIONABLE RESULTS
◦ Refer to clinical guidelines and consensus reference
databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD) for defining pathogenic
and likely pathogenic variants.
◦ Establish action protocols for identified high-risk mutations,
including BRCA1, BRCA2, and other associated genes.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ The NGS-based panel may not detect all genetic variants,
particularly large deletions, duplications, or regions with high
sequence homology.
◦ Interpretation should be performed considering the patient's
clinical context, family history, and supplementary diagnostic
tests.
