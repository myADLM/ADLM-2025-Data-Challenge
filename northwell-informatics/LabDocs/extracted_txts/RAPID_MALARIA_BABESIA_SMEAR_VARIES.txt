Standard Operating Procedure: Rapid
Malaria/Babesia Smear Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the preparation, examination, and
reporting of rapid Malaria/Babesia smears in order to identify the
presence of Plasmodium species or Babesia in patient blood
samples. This protocol ensures standardized and accurate results
critical for diagnosing malaria and babesiosis.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
rapid malaria/babesia smear in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the smear preparation, staining, and evaluation.
• Supervisors must ensure compliance with this SOP and verify that
personnel are proficient in this technique.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Microscope: For examination at various magnifications (e.g.,
1000x with oil immersion).
• Microscope slides: Clean, non-pre-cleaned slides.
• Blood collection materials: Lancets, alcohol swabs, capillary
tubes (if applicable).
• Stains: Giemsa or Wright-Giemsa staining solution.
• Buffered water: pH 7.2.
• Immersion oil: High-quality, low-fluorescence oil.
• Cover slips (optional).
• Timer: For precise staining times.
• Protective gear: Gloves, lab coat, safety goggles.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Fresh capillary or venous blood obtained
via fingerstick or venipuncture.
• Volume: At least 2 mL of blood collected into an EDTA-
anticoagulated tube.
• Transport and storage: Analyze within 6 hours of collection.
Keep at room temperature and avoid delays.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Staining:
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Place a small drop of blood (approximately 2-3 µL) onto the
clean microscope slide.
◦ Using a second slide held at a 30-45 degree angle, spread
the drop to create a thin smear (feathered edge).
2. Label the slide: At the frosted end, write the patient ID and
date using a pencil or slide marker.
3. Air-Dry the Smear: Allow the smear to air dry completely. Do
not use artificial heat.
4. Fixation (if required):
◦ Methanol fixation: Briefly dip the air-dried smear into
methanol for 1-2 seconds. Allow to air dry again.
5. Staining:
◦ For Giemsa stain:
▪ Prepare Giemsa working solution (1:10-1:20 dilution with
buffered water, pH 7.2).
▪ Stain the slide for 10-15 minutes.
◦ For Wright-Giemsa stain:
▪ Apply the stain and let stand for 1-3 minutes.
▪ Add an equal amount of buffered water (pH 7.2) and mix.
Let stand for 10 minutes.
6. Rinse: Gently rinse the stained slide with buffered water to
remove excess stain. Do not use tap water.
7. Dry: Allow the slide to air dry in an upright position to prevent
pooling of stain.
Microscopic Examination:
1. Mount Slide: Place a cover slip if using.
2. Microscopy:
◦ Examine under low power (10x) to locate the feathered
edge.
◦ Use oil immersion (100x) for detailed examination.
3. Evaluation:
◦ Scan fields systematically.
◦ Identify and count parasites (Malaria: Plasmodium species;
Babesia: intraerythrocytic protozoa).
◦ Determine species of Plasmodium if present (P. falciparum,
P. vivax, etc.).
4. Quantification: If parasites are found, quantify parasitemia
(percentage of infected red blood cells) by counting parasites in
multiple fields.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Control Smears: Use known positive and negative control
smears with each batch of patient specimens.
• Reagent Quality: Check and document the expiry date of stains
and reagents prior to use.
• Temperature & Humidity: Record room conditions to account for
variations that may affect staining.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Documentation: Enter patient data and results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Presence/Absence of Parasites: Report findings as positive or
negative.
• Parasitemia Level: If positive, report the percentage of
parasitemia and species identified.
• Critical Results: Notify clinician immediately for results indicating
high parasitemia or presence of P. falciparum.

• WHO Guidelines: Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria, third
edition.
• Clinical Protocols: Reference relevant clinical protocols and
package inserts for specific details on staining solutions.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Poor Staining: Check pH of buffered water and age of stain;
repeat with new solutions if necessary.
• No Parasites Observed: Ensure proper blood film preparation;
obtain a new sample if required.
• Quality Control Failure: Review control smear results and
reagent expiry; recalibrate microscope if needed.

Refer to clinical guidelines and authoritative texts on the laboratory
diagnosis of malaria and babesiosis for standardized practices.
Note: Maintain this SOP in a readily accessible location within the
laboratory and ensure all personnel are trained in its implementation.
Regular reviews and updates should be conducted to incorporate
new advancements or changes in clinical guidelines.
