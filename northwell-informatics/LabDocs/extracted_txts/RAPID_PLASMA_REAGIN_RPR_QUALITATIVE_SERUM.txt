Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) Qualitative Test Protocol
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to outline the
standard operating procedure for the qualitative analysis of
Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) in serum samples for the
detection of antibodies associated with syphilis infection.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to ensure the proper execution of this procedure
while adhering to all safety protocols and guidelines.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
verifying results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen:
• Preferred: Freshly collected serum.
• Acceptable: Serum samples stored at 2-8°C for no more than 48
hours.
• Unacceptable: Hemolysis, lipemia, icteric samples, or samples
stored beyond the acceptable timeframe or improperly labeled
samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• RPR Test Kit (containing RPR antigen suspension)
• Test cards
• Mixing sticks
• Pipettes
• Mechanical rotator
• Timer
• Control serum (positive and negative)
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
1. PROCEDURE A) Preparation:
2. Ensure the RPR test kit is at room temperature prior to use.
3. Organize all necessary equipment and supplies on a clean, flat
surface, ensuring proper labeling of patient samples and control
serum.
B) Testing:
1. Pipette 50 µL of serum sample onto the designated area of a
test card.
2. Pipette 50 µL of positive control serum and negative control
serum onto separate areas of a test card for quality control.
3. Mix the RPR antigen suspension according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Use a pipette to add one drop (approximately 50 µL) of RPR
antigen onto each serum sample and control serum.
5. Mix each antigen-serum mixture using a mixing stick, spread
over the entire circle of the test card.
6. Place the test card on a mechanical rotator set at 95-100 rpm
for 8 minutes.
C) Interpretation:
1. After rotation, examine the test card under direct light.
2. Observe for the presence of agglutination (flocculation) in each
test area.
◦ Positive result: Presence of agglutination indicating
antibodies.
◦ Negative result: No presence of agglutination.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Include a positive and negative control with each batch of tests
performed.
5. Record the results of the controls in the log. The batch must be
invalid if the controls do not produce the expected results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS Results are documented in the
laboratory information system (LIS) ensuring proper labeling
and verification by the supervisory personnel.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s
instructions for specific limitations related to reagent
performance, serum quality, and potential interference that may
affect the test results.
8. SAFETY AND HANDLING Follow standard laboratory safety
protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment
(PPE) while handling serum samples and reagents.

Quality Control guidelines.
This protocol is effective immediately and remains in effect until
further notice. Please ensure all laboratory personnel are trained in
this procedure and understand its importance in maintaining accurate
and timely diagnosis for patients.
