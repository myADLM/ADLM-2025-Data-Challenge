Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for RAPID PLASMA
REAGIN (RPR) SCREEN WITH REFLEX TO TITER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for conducting Rapid Plasma
Reagin (RPR) screening with reflex to titer using serum specimens.
RPR testing is used to screen for syphilis and diagnose Treponema
pallidum infections. Reflex testing involves titration to quantify
antibody levels when the screening test is positive.
Responsibility:
Designated personnel, typically clinical laboratory scientists, are
responsible for performing RPR screens and reflex titers following
this SOP. All staff members must adhere to this procedure to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
1. DEFINITION
Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) is a non-treponemal serologic screening
test for syphilis. The test detects antibodies produced against
antigens related to the Treponema pallidum bacterium. Reflex to titer
is performed to determine the concentration of antibodies in positive
specimens.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ 5-10 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or
plain red-top tube. Serum should be separated from cells
within 2 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
◦ Specimens not separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• RPR test kit (including antigen suspension)
• Test cards
• Test rotator
• Pipettes
• Timer
• Serum separator centrifuge
• Positive and negative controls
• Titration reagents for reflex testing
Procedure Steps:
1. RPR Screening: 1.1 Ensure test reagents and specimen are at
room temperature before testing. 1.2 Label the test cards with
patient identifiers and control designations. 1.3 Pipette 0.05 mL
(50 µL) of patient serum onto a designated circle on the test
card. 1.4 Pipette 0.05 mL (50 µL) of positive and negative
control serum onto designated circles. 1.5 Add one drop of RPR
antigen suspension onto each serum sample and control. 1.6
Place the test card onto a rotator and rotate at 100 ± 5 RPM for
8 minutes. 1.7 After rotation, visually inspect the test card under
adequate lighting for the presence of reagin (flocculation/
agglutination).
2. Interpretation of Results: 2.1 Negative Result: No
agglutination observed. 2.2 Positive Result: Presence of
noticeable agglutination. 2.3 If positive, proceed with reflex
titration.
3. Reflex Titration: 3.1 Serially dilute the serum using saline in
doubling dilutions (e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.). 3.2 Prepare
separate test circles for each diluted sample on a new test card.
3.3 Pipette 0.05 mL (50 µL) of each diluted serum onto
corresponding circles. 3.4 Add one drop of RPR antigen
suspension onto each dilution. 3.5 Rotate the test card at 100 ±
5 RPM for 8 minutes. 3.6 Inspect the test card for agglutination,
starting with the lowest dilution. 3.7 Record the highest dilution
showing agglutination.
4. Quality Control: 4.1 Run positive and negative controls with
each batch of tests. 4.2 If controls do not perform as expected,
do not report patient results and troubleshoot reagent or
procedural issues. 4.3 Document all QC results and any
corrective actions taken.
5. Reporting Results: 5.1 Report quantitative results as RPR titer
(the highest dilution at which agglutination is observed). 5.2
Refer to site-specific guidelines for entering and verifying
results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. Reference Intervals:
◦ RPR screen: Negative (no agglutination)
◦ RPR titer: Report the highest dilution showing agglutination
7. Method Limitations:
◦ False positives can occur due to conditions such as lupus,
malaria, or pregnancy.
◦ False negatives may occur in primary syphilis or late latent
syphilis with low antibody levels.
