Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) with Reflex to Treponema pallidum
Particle Agglutination (TP-PA), Serum
1. PURPOSE: Provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test, with
reflex testing to Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination (TP-PA)
for detecting syphilis in serum specimens.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing the RPR test
and reflex testing to TP-PA should be adequately trained and perform
the testing according to this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen type: Serum
• Volume requirement: Minimum 1 mL serum
• Specimen stability: Refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 7 days, or
frozen at -20°C or below for longer storage.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• RPR test kit (including antigen suspension, control sera, and test
cards)
• TP-PA kit (including test and control reagents, microtiter plates)
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Rotator/shaker
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (for TP-PA)
• Laboratory bench with appropriate biosafety measures
4. PROCEDURE:
A) Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) Testing:
i. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and serum specimens to reach room
temperature.
2. Gently mix RPR antigen suspension before use.
ii. Testing Procedure:
1. Add 50 μL of patient serum to a circle on the RPR test card.
2. Add one drop (17-23 μL) of the RPR antigen suspension to the
serum.
3. Using a disposable stirrer, mix the serum and antigen
thoroughly within the circle.
4. Place the card on the rotator and rotate at 100 rpm for 8
minutes.
5. After agitation, read the results immediately with good lighting.
iii. Result Interpretation:
• Non-reactive: No clumping or minimal clumping.
• Reactive: Presence of clumping.
iv. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of test
cards. Controls must show appropriate reactions (positive control
showing clumping and negative control showing no clumping) to
validate the test run.
B) Reflex to Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination (TP-PA)
Testing:
Note: Reflex testing is initiated if the RPR test result is reactive.
i. Preparation:
1. Allow TP-PA kit reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature.
2. Prepare the microtiter plate as per the kit instructions.
ii. Testing Procedure:
1. Dilute patient serum according to the TP-PA kit instructions; use
the recommended dilution ratio.
2. Add the diluted serum to the designated wells of the microtiter
plate.
3. Add control reagents to the corresponding control wells.
4. Add sensitized gel particles to the wells containing patient
serum and controls.
5. Seal the microtiter plate with a cover and place it in an
incubator at 37°C for the recommended incubation time (usually
2 hours).
iii. Result Interpretation:
• Non-reactive: Smooth, even suspension; no clumping.
• Reactive: Agglutination or clumping of particles.
iv. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control sera in each test run.
Controls must show the appropriate reactions (positive control
showing agglutination and negative control showing no
agglutination).
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• RPR Non-reactive: Report as "Non-reactive."
• RPR Reactive: Report as "Reactive" and proceed to TP-PA
testing.
• Combined results interpretation:
◦ RPR Non-reactive, no further action.
◦ RPR Reactive and TP-PA Non-reactive: Indicate further
investigation may be needed, possible biological false positive
for RPR.
◦ RPR Reactive and TP-PA Reactive: Report as presumptive for
syphilis.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Perform periodic proficiency testing to ensure test accuracy.
• Maintain documentation of all quality control procedures and
results.
• Review and update this SOP annually or as changes in
procedures or equipment occur.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the RPR test kit and TP-PA kit.
• Current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for syphilis serology testing.
