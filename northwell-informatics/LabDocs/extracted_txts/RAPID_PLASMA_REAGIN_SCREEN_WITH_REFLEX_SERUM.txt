Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for RAPID PLASMA
REAGIN (RPR) SCREEN WITH REFLEX, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing Rapid Plasma
Reagin (RPR) screening tests with reflex serology for confirming
positive results. This assay is used for the detection of reagin
antibodies to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained in RPR
screening to perform and document the results of this test and to
ensure reflex confirmatory testing is carried out as stipulated.
3. DEFINITION & PRINCIPLE:
The RPR test is a non-treponemal serological test for the detection of
syphilis reagin antibodies. When antibodies are present, they react
with a lipid antigen to form visible clumps (flocculation).
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum, collected in a red top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Serum samples should be centrifuged and separated from the clot
within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Samples that are frozen and thawed more than once.
• Specimen collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• RPR antigen suspension
• RPR cards (disposable)
• Applicator sticks or equivalent
• Mechanical rotator
• Serum-safe pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Quality control sera (positive and negative controls)
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Serum samples must be at room temperature before testing.
2. Mix the serum thoroughly before testing.
B) Test Execution:
1. Label RPR card with patient identification and control sera
spots.
2. Pipette 50 µL of serum onto the corresponding circle on the
RPR card.
3. Resuspend the RPR antigen suspension.
4. Using a calibrated dispensing bottle, place 1 drop (about 20-30
µL) of RPR antigen suspension onto the serum spot.
5. Mix the serum and antigen using an applicator stick, ensuring
even distribution over the entire circle.
6. Place the RPR card on the mechanical rotator set at 100 rpm
for 8 minutes at room temperature.
C) Interpretation:
1. After rotation, immediately inspect the test circles for the
presence or absence of flocculation (clumping) under a bright
light.
2. Grade the flocculation reaction from 0 to 4+ based on the
manufacturer's grading criteria.
3. Record the results promptly.
D) Reflex Testing:
1. If the initial RPR screen is reactive (positive), perform a
confirmatory treponemal-specific test such as Treponema
pallidum Particle Agglutination (TP-PA) or other specific
treponemal tests.
2. Follow the specific procedural steps for the confirmatory test as
outlined in the respective SOP.
3. Document both the RPR screen and the confirmatory test
results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run internal quality controls (positive and negative sera)
alongside patient samples.
2. Ensure control results fall within the expected ranges:
◦ Positive control must demonstrate respective flocculation.
◦ Negative control must demonstrate absence of flocculation.
3. Record and review QC results before patient results to assure
test precision and accuracy.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Report RPR results as non-reactive (negative) or reactive
(positive) including semiquantitative assessment if available.
2. Report reflex confirmatory test results separately with their
respective interpretations.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• RPR result: Non-Reactive (negative)
• Confirmatory Treponemal Testing Result: Non-reactive/Reactive
with titration if indicated.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to RPR kit insert instructions for limitations associated with the
test. Non-treponemal testing can give false results influenced by
various factors including other infections, autoimmune conditions, or
pregnancy.
