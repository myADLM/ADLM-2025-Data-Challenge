Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for RAPID PLASMA
REAGIN (RPR) SCREEN WITH REFLEX TO TITER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for performing the Rapid
Plasma Reagin (RPR) test for the screening of syphilis, with reflex to
titer for reactive samples, using serum specimens. The RPR test
detects non-treponemal antibodies as an indicator for syphilis
infection. The reflex titer is performed to quantify the antibody levels
in reactive samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel will perform the
RPR screen and reflex titer as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of
all staff to ensure adherence to the procedure and report any
inconsistencies or issues to the supervisor.
2. DEFINITION This protocol applies to the analysis phase, which
includes performing the RPR screen and, if reactive, proceeding to
the quantitative RPR titer.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL
• Storage:
◦ Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze specimens at ≤ -20°C. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for:
◦ 48 hours at 2-8°C.
◦ Up to 6 months at ≤ -20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• RPR card test kits (antigen suspension)
• Disposable stirrers or rotators
• Test cards or slides
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Appropriate controls (positive and negative)
• Microscopes (for titration if needed)
5. PROCEDURE
A) RPR Screening Test:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before use.
◦ Ensure the test area is clean and free from contaminants.
2. Test Performance:
◦ Label the test card with the specimen identification number.
◦ Pipette 50 µL of serum onto the test circle on the card.
◦ Add one drop of RPR antigen suspension to the serum.
◦ Use a disposable stirrer to spread the mixture evenly over
the entire test circle.
◦ Place the test card on a mechanical rotator and rotate at
100 rpm for 8 minutes.
3. Reading Results:
◦ After rotation, immediately observe the test card under a
good light source.
◦ Non-reactive: No clumping or very minimal noticeable
clumping.
◦ Reactive: Visible clumping or flocculation within the test
circle.
B) Reflex to Titer: Performed for reactive RPR screens to quantify
antibody levels.
1. Preparation:
◦ Set up serial dilutions of the serum specimen in saline (1:1,
1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, etc.).
◦ Label separate test circles for each dilution on a new test
card.
2. Test Performance:
◦ Add 50 µL of each dilution to the appropriate test circle.
◦ Add one drop of the RPR antigen suspension to each circle.
◦ Spread the mixture evenly with a new stirrer for each
dilution.
◦ Place the test card on the rotator and rotate at 100 rpm for 8
minutes.
3. Reading and Recording Results:
◦ Observe each test circle for clumping.
◦ The highest dilution with visible clumping indicates the
endpoint titer.
◦ Record the titer as the dilution factor (e.g., 1:16, 1:32).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• The positive control should show visible clumping; the negative
control should show no clumping.
• Record control results in the quality control log.
• If controls do not perform as expected, do not proceed with
patient samples and notify the supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report RPR screen results as "Non-reactive" or "Reactive."
• For reactive samples, report the titer to the highest dilution that
demonstrates visible clumping.
• Document all results and verify in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8. LIMITATIONS
• The RPR test is a non-treponemal test and may yield false
positives due to conditions such as pregnancy, autoimmune
diseases, or other infections.
• Reactive results should be confirmed with a specific treponemal
test for confirmation of syphilis.
