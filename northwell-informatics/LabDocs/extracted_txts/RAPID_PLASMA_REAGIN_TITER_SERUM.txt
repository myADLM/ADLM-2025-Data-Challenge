STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)
Title: RAPID PLASMA REAGIN (RPR) TITER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for performing Rapid
Plasma Reagin (RPR) titer testing in serum specimens to
screen and monitor infection with Treponema pallidum
(syphilis).
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained
on the RPR test procedure to perform titers following this SOP,
including quality control and proper documentation of results.
Supervisors must ensure compliance with this procedure.
1. DEFINITION Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test: A non-
treponemal serology test to detect antibodies produced in
response to Treponema pallidum infection.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Serum from a blood specimen collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Specimens must be handled according to standard
guidelines to avoid hemolysis or contamination.
Unacceptable: - Specimens with severe hemolysis. - Serum from an
SST not completely filled. - Specimens received more than 72 hours
after collection without proper refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Charcoal RPR antigen suspension (commercially available
kits)
◦ Disposable 20-μL pipettes
◦ Glass slides or test cards
◦ Mechanical rotator capable of 100 RPM
◦ Stopwatch
◦ Needle-tipped dropper bottles
◦ Micropipettes or calibrated syringes for titrations
◦ Control sera: positive and negative control sera from
reputable suppliers
◦ Microscope (optional for end-point determination)
2. PROCEDURE 5.1 Preparing Serum Specimen:
◦ Allow the serum specimen to come to room temperature.
◦ Mix the serum gently.
5.2 Performing the Initial RPR Screen: - Place 1 drop (50 µL) of
serum onto the test card. - Add 1 drop (20 µL) of RPR antigen
suspension next to the serum. - Mix the serum and antigen
thoroughly using the pipette tip. - Rotate the card at 100 RPM for 8
minutes. - At the end of 8 minutes, observe the card for reactive
(clumping) and non-reactive (smooth) results.
Note: If clumping is observed, proceed with the titration steps. If the
result is non-reactive, report as negative without further titration.
5.3 Titration: - Prepare serial dilutions of the reactive serum in saline
(e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.) - Place 1 drop (50 µL) of each dilution onto a
separate area of the test card. - Add 1 drop (20 µL) of RPR antigen
suspension to each dilution. - Mix thoroughly and rotate the card at
100 RPM for 8 minutes. - Observe the card to determine the highest
dilution showing reactive clumping.
1. QUALITY CONTROL Quality control is performed with each
batch of tests:
◦ Run positive and negative control sera with each batch.
◦ Controls should react within expected ranges (positive
control shows clumping, negative control shows smooth
results).
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report non-reactive results as RPR negative.
◦ For reactive specimens, report the highest dilution that
shows reactive clumping as the RPR titer.
◦ Example: 1:16 (titer is reported as the dilution factor).
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Non-reactive: No clumping observed.
◦ Reactive: Presence of clumping, titrated to the highest
dilution showing clumping.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ False positives may occur due to other conditions (e.g.,
pregnancy, autoimmune diseases).
◦ False negatives may occur in early or late stages of
infection.
5. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all results, including patient identifiers, date/time of
testing, reagents and lot numbers, control results, and
technologist initials.
◦ Maintain records according to laboratory policy for
traceability and compliance.

management before implementation. Ensure all laboratory personnel
are trained on this procedure and any updates to it.
