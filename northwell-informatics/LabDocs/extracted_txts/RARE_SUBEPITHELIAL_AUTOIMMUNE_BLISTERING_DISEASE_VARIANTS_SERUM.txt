STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) RARE
SUBEPITHELIAL AUTOIMMUNE BLISTERING DISEASE
VARIANTS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized protocol for the
detection and analysis of rare subepithelial autoimmune
blistering disease variants in serum samples. This includes
ensuring proper specimen handling, utilizing appropriate
reagents and equipment, and generating accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
• All designated staff must follow this SOP to ensure standard
practices are met.
• It is the responsibility of staff to report any deviations or concerns
to a supervisor immediately.
• Laboratory managers are responsible for ensuring all staff are
appropriately trained and competent to perform the procedures
within this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY A. Acceptable
Specimens:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow the
blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and centrifuge
as soon as possible.
• Minimum volume: 2 mL of serum.
B. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
heparin).
C. Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature (20-25ºC): 8 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8ºC): 7 days.
• Frozen (-20ºC or lower): 1 month. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtiter plates
• Wash buffer (PBS with tween-20)
• Blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS)
• Primary antibodies specific to subepithelial autoimmune blistering
disease variants
• Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution (1M H2SO4)
• Microplate reader (450 nm)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Laboratory timer
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
2. Take out all required solutions and allow them to come to room
temperature.
3. Label microtiter plates according to the batch and specimens.
B. Assay Protocol:
1. Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples, positive and negative
controls to each well of the microtiter plate. Incubate for 1 hour
at room temperature.
2. Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
3. Add 100 µL of blocking solution to each well. Incubate for 15
minutes at room temperature.
4. Add 100 µL of primary antibody to each well. Incubate for 1
hour at room temperature.
5. Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
6. Add 100 µL of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
7. Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well. Incubate for
15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Measure the absorbance using a microplate reader at 450 nm.
C. Result Interpretation:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance of the negative control wells.
2. Subtract the mean absorbance of the negative control wells
from the absorbance of each sample and control wells to obtain
the corrected absorbance.
3. Positive results are indicated by absorbance values greater
than the established cutoff value (mean absorbance of negative
control + 0.1).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Controls: Run at least one positive control and one
negative control with each batch of samples.
• External Quality Control: Participate in inter-laboratory quality
assurance programs to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
• Record all quality control measures, including any deviations and
corrective actions taken, in the quality control logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
being transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report positive results with a comment indicating the detected
antibodies and suggest confirmation by a specialist.
• Document all critical values and notify the referring clinician
immediately according to laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the package insert of each
reagent for specific limitations. Analytical interferences can
occur from hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric samples. High
concentrations of rheumatoid factor and high titers of antibodies
to other antigens may cause false positive results.

antibodies.

publications on subepithelial autoimmune blistering diseases.
