1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized procedure
for the analytical phase of generating RASPBERRY, IGE, SERUM
results, ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely delivery of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as described in this procedure. The personnel
must ensure the integrity of the data, follow quality control protocols,
and report any discrepancies to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
RASPBERRY Allergy Immunoglobulin E (IgE), Serum: A test to
measure the immune response to raspberry allergens in the patient's
serum. Elevated levels of specific IgE indicate an allergic response to
raspberries.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: Collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Handling:
• After clotting at room temperature, centrifuge the specimen to
separate the serum from the clot.
• Store and transport serum at 2-8°C if testing is to be done within
48 hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C for longer storage. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have not been properly labeled or are not within the
acceptable timeframe for refrigeration or freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA Reader)
• Specific IgE test kits for RASPBERRY
• Calibrators and controls (positive and negative)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
2. Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Set up the immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA
Reader) and ensure it is properly calibrated.
Sample Analysis:
1. Label microtiter plate wells or cartridges appropriately.
2. Pipette specified volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into designated wells or cartridges.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for adding reagents,
incubation times, and washing steps.
4. Allow the immunoassay analyzer to perform the automated
steps, including reading and calculation of results.
5. Ensure the plate or cartridge is properly aligned in the analyzer.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Verify that the control results are within the acceptable range
before validating patient results.
3. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, re-run the controls and patient
samples as necessary.
4. RESULTS
Reporting:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Compare patient results to the reference intervals provided by
the test kit insert:
◦ Specific IgE Level (kUA/L):
▪ < 0.35: Negative (No detectable allergy)
▪ 0.35 – 0.69: Borderline/Equivocal (Low-level
sensitization)
▪ ≥ 0.70: Positive (Allergic to RASPBERRY)
3. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Ensure that the results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
6. Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
7. Ensure all equipment is maintained and calibrated according to
the laboratory’s schedules and manufacturer’s guidelines.
8. In case of equipment malfunction, notify the supervisor
immediately and document the issue.
9. If there are discrepancies in patient results, re-examine the
specimen, reagents, and procedures, and consult the
supervisor for further action.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• As provided by the test kit insert.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Samples with high biotin levels may interfere with the assay.
• The presence of heterophilic antibodies in the specimen may
cause interference.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific IgE test kit used.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)
procedures documentation.
