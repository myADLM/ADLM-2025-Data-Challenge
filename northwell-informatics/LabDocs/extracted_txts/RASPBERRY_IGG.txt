Standard Operating Procedure for RASPBERRY IGG Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP is intended to define the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating RASPBERRY IGG test results. The purpose is to
ensure consistent, accurate, and timely results for the assessment of
RASPBERRY IGG antibodies in patient samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure that all staff are trained and competent in performing this
procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types: Preferred samples include serum collected in
SST (serum separator tubes) or red top tubes.
• Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Storage:
◦ Freshly collected specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and
tested within 7 days.
◦ For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens, as well as those with inadequate volume or improper
labeling.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate Reader (set to appropriate wavelength)
◦ Washer for microplates
◦ Pipettes (single and multichannel)
◦ Incubator capable of holding 37°C
◦ Centrifuge
• Reagents:
◦ RASPBERRY IGG ELISA Kit (store as per manufacturer’s
instructions)
◦ Deionized water
◦ Calibration standards and control sera
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Controls: Control sera should be run with each
batch of tests. Two levels of QC material (low and high) should be
included.
• External Quality Assurance: Participation in proficiency testing
programs as required.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample to remove particulates if necessary.
◦ Aliquot samples into appropriate tubes and label clearly.
• Reagent Preparation:
◦ All reagents should be brought to room temperature before
use.
◦ Prepare working solutions of reagents as described in the
ELISA kit insert.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Coating the Microplate:
◦ Coat the wells of the microplate with the supplied antigen by
adding the appropriate volume of coating solution.
◦ Incubate the plate at 4°C overnight or at room temperature
for at least 2 hours.
2. Blocking:
◦ Add blocking buffer to each well.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.
3. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add appropriate volumes of samples, standards, and
controls to the wells.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate multiple times using the plate washer.
◦ Ensure complete removal of washing buffers after the final
wash.
5. Antibody Incubation:
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate again as previously described.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark for 10-30 minutes or until color
develops.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
9. Reading:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength using the microplate reader.
7. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the RASPBERRY IGG concentration for each sample
based on the standard curve generated from the absorbance
readings of the calibration standards.
• Ensure that controls fall within the expected ranges before
reporting patient results.
• Reference values and interpretation criteria should be
documented based on the kit manufacturer’s guidelines and
laboratory-defined thresholds.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data Entry and Verification:
◦ Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Verify all entered results before approval and release.
• Critical Results:
◦ Critical results, as defined by laboratory guidelines, must be
verified and reported to the requesting clinician immediately.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• All procedural steps, QC data, and maintenance activities must be
documented.
• Maintain records for equipment calibration and reagent lot
verification.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit’s package insert for any specific limitations
and interferences.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s ELISA Kit Insert for RASPBERRY IGG (current
version)
• Laboratory Quality Management System (QMS) documents
12. REVISIONS
• This SOP must be reviewed annually or when there are changes
in the procedure, equipment, or reagents.
