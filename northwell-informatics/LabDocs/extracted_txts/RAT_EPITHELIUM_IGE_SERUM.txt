Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Rat
Epithelium, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analysis of Rat
Epithelium (RE), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), in serum samples. The
purpose is to ensure accurate and precise measurement, minimizing
errors through standardized practices, and ensuring the integrity and
reproducibility of the results obtained.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in performing
the assays, from sample preparation to data analysis, in the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow these
procedures accurately and consistently. Each step must be
documented and verified, and any deviation from the protocol must
be reported to the laboratory supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected from patients
Acceptable Specimens:
• 5 mL serum through a standard blood collection method.
• Samples should be collected in red-top tubes (no anticoagulant)
and allowed to clot for 30 minutes before centrifugation.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens with inadequate volume.
• Specimens not labeled properly with collection date/time and
patient identification.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (capable of reading at 450 nm)
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• ELISA kits specific for Rat Epithelium, IgE
• Calibrators and controls for Rat Epithelium, IgE
• Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution
• Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and serviced within the
allowable time frame.
2. Verify all reagents are within their expiration dates and properly
stored.
3. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
4. Prepare wash buffer and reagents as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
6.2 Assay Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum samples if frozen, using a controlled water bath at
37°C or at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge all serum samples at 3000 RPM for 15 minutes to
remove any particulates.
3. Aliquot serum into labeled microtubes for testing.
B. ELISA Assay
1. Microplate Preparation:
◦ Coat the wells with antigen or antibody specific for Rat
Epithelium, IgE, as per the kit instructions.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour
or as specified.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using the prepared wash buffer 3-5 times to
remove unbound antigens/antibodies.
3. Addition of Specimens and Controls:
◦ Add 100 µL of each serum sample, calibrator, and control
into appropriate wells.
◦ Seal and incubate the plate as per manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-linked secondary antibody to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature according to the kit
instructions.
5. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing process to remove any unbound
antibody-enzyme reagent.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for the recommended reaction time at
room temperature, avoid exposure to direct light.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50-100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the
enzymatic reaction.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the optical density of each well using a microplate
reader set to 450 nm.
◦ Ensure blank correction is subtracted from each reading.
7. CALCULATIONS AND REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Plot the standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators. Use appropriate software for the analysis.
◦ Quantify the concentration of Rat Epithelium, IgE in serum
samples by comparing their absorbance to the standard
curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the specified ranges. If controls
are out of tolerance, invalidate the run, and identify the
cause before repeating the assay.
3. Reporting:
◦ Results should be reported in IU/mL for IgE.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before they are transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include at least two levels (low and high) of quality control
samples in each run.
2. Document all quality control data and verify that control results
are within the specified ranges before reporting patient results.
3. Perform calibration checks annually or as needed.

used for detailed guidance on handling, preparation, and
troubleshooting.
10. REVISION HISTORY
Document any changes or updates to this protocol promptly and
review the SOP annually to ensure it remains current.
