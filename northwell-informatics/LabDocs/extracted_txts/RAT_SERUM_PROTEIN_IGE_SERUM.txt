Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Rat Serum Protein and IgE Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing rat
serum protein and IgE levels, ensuring accurate and reproducible
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of rat serum samples to determine
total serum protein and serum IgE levels. This procedure is
performed by designated personnel in a CLIA-certified laboratory
setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated lab personnel to follow this
procedure to ensure the precision and accuracy of the results.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the adherence to this
SOP and addressing any issues or discrepancies.
4. SPECIMENS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum separated from 5-10 mL of whole
blood collected in a serum separator tube.
• Sample Processing: Centrifuge the sample at 1500g for 10
minutes at 4°C to separate the serum. Aliquot serum into
appropriately labeled microcentrifuge tubes for analysis.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Total Protein Assay kit (e.g., Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein
Assay Kit)
• IgE ELISA Kit
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves
• Vortex mixer
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Total Protein Assay Reagents (standards, BCA reagent)
• IgE ELISA Kit Reagents (standards, controls, substrate, and wash
solutions)
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high concentration
controls for both protein and IgE)
• Calibrators
• Deionized water
7. PROCEDURE
Total Protein Assay
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before use.
2. Prepare the working reagent from the BCA assay kit as
instructed in the kit insert.
3. Prepare protein standards according to the kit's instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette 25 µL of standards, quality control samples and serum
samples into a 96-well microplate in duplicate.
2. Add 200 µL of the working reagent to each well and mix by
pipetting.
3. Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Measure the absorbance at 562 nm using a microplate reader.
5. Generate a standard curve by plotting absorbance against
known standard concentrations.
6. Determine the total protein concentration in serum samples by
interpolating their absorbance from the standard curve.
IgE ELISA
Preparation:
1. Allow all ELISA kit reagents to equilibrate to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare the wash solution according to the kit instructions.
3. Dilute the standards and quality controls as per the ELISA kit
instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add 50 µL of standards, quality control samples, and serum
samples into the designated wells of the ELISA plate in
duplicate.
2. Add 50 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour on a plate
shaker (500 rpm).
4. Wash the wells 4 times with 300 µL of wash solution.
5. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
6. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes without shaking.
7. Add 100 µL of the stop solution to each well.
8. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
9. Generate a standard curve by plotting absorbance against
known IgE concentrations.
10. Determine the IgE concentration in serum samples by
interpolating their absorbance from the standard curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include low, medium, and high concentration controls for both the
protein and IgE assays in each run.
• For the total protein assay, the QC material should fall within
±10% of the target value.
• For the IgE assay, QC results should be within the manufacturer's
provided control range.
• Document and review quality control results before releasing
patient results. Any QC failure must be addressed following the
laboratory's quality control policy.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the concatenation of sample identification codes, assay
measured values, and QC results.
• Enter the concentrations of total protein and IgE levels in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate the results before reporting.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay and should not be used.
• Strict adherence to incubation times, temperatures, and reagent
volumes is crucial for accurate and reproducible results.
11. REFERENCES
• BCA Protein Assay Kit insert (Manufacturer instructions)
• IgE ELISA Kit insert (Manufacturer instructions)
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough records of assays performed, including
operator initials, date, and time of assay.
• Ensure all raw data, including standard curves and QC results,
are kept in accordance with the laboratory's record-keeping
policies.
13. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually by the laboratory supervisor
or when there are changes to procedures, reagents, or
instrumentation.
This completes the SOP for the Analytical Phase of Rat Serum
Protein and IgE Analysis.
