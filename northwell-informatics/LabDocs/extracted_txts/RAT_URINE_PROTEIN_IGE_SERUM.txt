Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for Rat
Urine Protein, IgE, and Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and efficient
processing and analysis of rat urine protein, IgE, and serum samples
in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure outlines the necessary
steps for handling, processing, and analyzing these specimens to
generate reliable results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to follow this procedure, ensuring the accuracy and validity of
results. All staff must report any issues or errors encountered during
the process to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Urine Protein:
• Rat urine sample, preferably collected within 6 hours and stored
at 2-8°C immediately.
IgE:
• Serum sample, stored at -20°C after collection to maintain the
stability of IgE.
Serum:
• Blood samples collected using standard venipuncture techniques,
clot-free, and centrifuged within 2 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader
• Refrigerated storage units
• ELISA kits specific for rat IgE
• Protein quantification kits
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrated measurement devices
1. PROCEDURE
A) Rat Urine Protein Analysis:
Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen urine samples at room temperature just before
analysis if applicable.
2. Vortex samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
Quantification:
1. Prepare reagents and standards as per protein assay kit
instructions.
2. Pipette appropriate volumes of standards and samples into
designated wells of a microplate.
3. Add the protein assay reagent to each well.
4. Incubate the plate according to the kit's instructions (time and
temperature specified).
Measurement:
1. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
2. Calculate protein concentration using the standard curve.
Documentation:
• Record results on the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include date, time, and initials of the performing technologist.
B) Rat IgE Analysis:
Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature before analysis,
gently vortex if needed.
2. Prepare reagents, controls, and standards according to the
ELISA kit instructions.
Quantification:
1. Add standards, controls, and serum samples to the designated
wells of the microplate.
2. Add IgE detection antibody and substrate solution as per kit
instructions.
Measurement:
1. Incubate the plate at specified conditions (time and
temperature).
2. Read optical density at the appropriate wavelength using a
microplate reader.
Calculation:
1. Calculate IgE concentration using the standard curve generated
from the provided standards.
Documentation:
• Document results in the LIS with date, time, and initials.
• Ensure control results fall within acceptable ranges for validation.
C) Serum Analysis:
Preparation:
1. Ensure serum samples are clear and free of clots.
2. Label aliquots properly if sending for further specific assays.
General Analysis:
1. Conduct routine serum assays such as glucose, electrolytes,
and other biochemistry tests as required.
2. Follow specific assay protocols and manufacturer's instructions
for each test.
Documentation:
• Record all results in the LIS.
• Initial and date all entries, including any deviations or
observations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize control materials for each assay to ensure accuracy.
• Conduct both intra- and inter-assay quality checks monthly.
• Document all quality control actions and outcomes in the quality
control log.
Corrective Actions:
• If any control fails outside of acceptable limits, troubleshoot,
repeat the assay, and consult with a supervisor if necessary.
• Document corrective measures taken in the quality control log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results are entered accurately into the LIS.
• Review and validate results by a qualified technologist/supervisor.
• Ensure critical values and discrepancies are communicated
immediately to the requesting unit.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Consult specific assay kit inserts for limitations regarding
sensitivity, specificity, and interference factors.
