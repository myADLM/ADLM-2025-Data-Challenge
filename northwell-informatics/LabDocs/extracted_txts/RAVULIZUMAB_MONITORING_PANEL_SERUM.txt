Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable analysis of Ravulizumab levels in
patient serum samples using the RAVULIZUMAB MONITORING
PANEL.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Ravulizumab testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the Ravulizumab testing procedure, maintaining
equipment, and documenting all relevant information as defined in
this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Preferred/acceptable: Serum specimen collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
b. Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
c. Specimen stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection. If testing is delayed, serum should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C for long-term storage.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment:
- Centrifuge
- Pipettes and tips
- Incubator
- Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at appropriate wavelengths
b. Reagents:
- Ravulizumab-specific calibrators
- Ravulizumab control samples (low, medium, high)
- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit or validated LC-MS/MS method reagents
- Wash buffer
- Substrate solution
- Stop solution
c. Supplies:
- ELISA microtiter plates or LC-MS/MS vials
- PBS buffer
- Disposable gloves
- Lab coats
- Biohazard disposal containers
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Label all tubes and wells/plates clearly with patient identifiers and necessary information.
2. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature. Mix gently before testing.
3. Centrifuge serum samples at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to remove any particulate matter.
4. Transfer supernatant to a clean tube, avoiding debris.
B. Assay Procedure (ELISA-based)
1. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the kit instructions.
2. Pipette calibrators, controls, and samples into designated wells of the microtiter plate.
3. Add prepared detection antibody to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
5. Wash the plate 4 times with wash buffer to remove unbound material.
6. Add the enzyme-conjugate solution and incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate again 4 times with wash buffer.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well and allow color develop in the dark at room temperature for the manufacturer's recommended time.
9. Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
10. Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using a plate reader within 30 minutes.
C. Assay Procedure (LC-MS/MS-based)
1. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the protocol.
2. Pipette calibrators, controls, and samples into designated LC-MS/MS vials.
3. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Inject samples and run the system under validated conditions.
5. Analyze the chromatogram to determine Ravulizumab concentrations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Run control samples at multiple levels (low, medium, high) with each assay batch.
b. Ensure that control results fall within pre-defined acceptable ranges.
c. Repeat the assay if control values fall outside acceptable ranges.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Document all results, including any relevant observations, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
b. Review and verify results according to laboratory protocols.
c. Ensure results are delivered to the requesting physician or health care provider in a timely manner.
9. REFERENCES
a. Manufacturer’s kit insert or protocol instructions
b. Laboratory Quality Manual
10. SAFETY
a. Wear disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles during the assay procedure to handle all biohazardous materials.
b. Follow all institutional guidelines for the disposal of sharps and biohazardous waste.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
a. If the assay fails or control results are out of range, review all steps for potential errors.
b. Check equipment calibration and maintenance records.
c. Consult the kit or equipment manufacturer’s support for further assistance when necessary.
d. Document and report persistent issues to the laboratory supervisor for further investigation.
This SOP provides a comprehensive pathway for the accurate and
efficient monitoring of Ravulizumab levels in serum samples,
ensuring high-quality results and adherence to laboratory standards.
Adjustments should be made as necessary to align with specific
laboratory workflow and equipment.
