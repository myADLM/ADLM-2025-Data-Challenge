Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ravulizumab, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish the protocol and standardize the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Ravulizumab, Serum in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures reliable and accurate test
results that meet regulatory and quality standards.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
protocols outlined in this document.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that laboratory
personnel are adequately trained and that the protocols are
followed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• 5-10 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube or a serum separator
tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens not properly labeled with the patient’s identification.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than specified.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• ELISA or protein quantification assay plate reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Ravulizumab calibrators and controls
• Primary antibody specific for Ravulizumab
• Secondary antibody conjugated with a detection enzyme (e.g.,
HRP)
• Chromogenic substrate for the detection enzyme
• Wash buffer
• Plate seals
Storage:
• Store all reagents at recommended temperature (generally 2-8°C
unless otherwise specified).
• Do not use reagents past their expiration date.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare all assay reagents, calibrators, and controls as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Equilibrate to room temperature before use.
Assay Preparation:
1. Sample Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the collected sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes
to separate serum.
◦ Transfer the serum into clearly labeled aliquots and store at
2-8°C until analysis. If stored for more than 24 hours, freeze
at -20°C or below.
2. Assay Procedure: i. Plate Setup: a. Add 100 µL of sample,
calibrator, or control to each well. b. Incubate for 60 minutes at
room temperature with gentle shaking.
ii. Washing: a. Wash the wells three times with wash buffer. b.
Tap the plate on absorbent paper to ensure complete removal
of wash buffer.
iii. Detection: a. Add 100 µL of primary antibody solution to each
well. b. Incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature with gentle
shaking. c. Wash wells three times with wash buffer as
described above. d. Add 100 µL of secondary antibody solution
to each well. e. Incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature
with gentle shaking. f. Wash wells three times with wash buffer.
iv. Chromogenic Reaction: a. Add 100 µL of chromogenic
substrate to each well. b. Incubate for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature or until the desired color intensity is achieved.
v. Stop Reaction: a. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
3. Reading and Results:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the appropriate
wavelength using the plate reader, typically at 450 nm.
◦ Generate a standard curve using the OD values of the
calibrators.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Ravulizumab in the patient
samples from the standard curve.
4. Quality Control: i. Run both positive and negative controls with
each batch of tests. ii. Confirm that quality control results are
within the specified range before accepting patient results. iii.
Document all quality control results.
Reporting Results:
• Report the results in concentration units (e.g., µg/mL).
• Review and verify results before reporting.
• Consult site-specific reporting guidelines for any critical values
and follow appropriate procedures for notifying the healthcare
provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for Ravulizumab levels may vary by institution
and should be verified by clinical validation or refer to
manufacturer’s reference values.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This assay is susceptible to high-dose hook effect or cross-
reactivity with other similar medications.
• Proper handling and storage of samples are critical to avoid any
degradation or alterations in the analyte.
1. REFERENCE
• Manufacturer’s package insert for the Ravulizumab assay.
• Updated clinical guidelines on the use of Ravulizumab.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document the revision number and date of implementation.
• Outline the changes made in this revision and authorization by
supervisory personnel.
END OF SOP
These steps will help ensure that the analytical phase for generating
results for Ravulizumab, Serum, is conducted systematically,
accurately, and under control to maintain the highest standards of
laboratory practice.
