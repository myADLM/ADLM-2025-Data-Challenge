Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Reanalysis of Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 4- or 11-Gene Panels, Additional Genes
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedures for reanalysis of
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 4- or 11-Gene Panels with the
inclusion of additional genes using Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS). This involves re-examination of the previously collected DNA
specimens to identify mutations that were not included in the initial
panels, and ensure that the reanalysis meets the required quality
standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
reanalysis of AML gene panels and to ensure that all equipment is
correctly maintained and calibrated. The laboratory personnel must
follow all outlined procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability of
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel engaged in the
reanalysis of AML 4- or 11-Gene Panels, with added genes using
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology.
3. DEFINITIONS
• AML: Acute Myeloid Leukemia
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing
• DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Preparation
• Retrieve previously collected and stored DNA specimens for
reanalysis.
• Verify specimen identity through appropriate patient and sample
identifiers.
• Perform quality control checks on DNA specimens to ensure they
meet the minimum quality and concentration requirements for
NGS.
4.2 Library Preparation
• Use the DNA extraction protocol compliant with the laboratory’s
standard.
• Prepare NGS libraries from the extracted DNA, using the
appropriate library preparation kits for the additional genes.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for fragmentation, end
repair, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification.
4.3 Sequencing Process
• Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS sequencing platform.
• Ensure the sequencing reagents and instrument parameters
comply with quality control procedures.
• Initiate the sequencing run and monitor the process to detect any
abnormalities.
4.4 Data Analysis
• Use bioinformatics tools and software validated for the analysis of
AML gene panels.
• Map the sequencing reads to the reference genome.
• Identify variants, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs),
insertions, deletions, and other relevant genetic alterations.
• Assess the variant allele frequencies and update the additional
genes in the analysis pipeline.
4.5 Data Interpretation
• Classify and interpret the identified variants according to
established guidelines (e.g., ACMG standards).
• Cross-reference the newly identified variants with existing
databases for AML-related mutations.
• Evaluate the clinical significance of the additional gene variants.
4.6 Quality Control
• Perform quality checks at every stage of the library preparation,
sequencing, and data analysis.
• Include known positive controls and negative controls in the NGS
runs to ensure assay performance.
• Document all quality control measures and corrective actions in
case of deviations from accepted ranges.
4.7 Result Verification and Reporting
• Review and validate the NGS findings by a senior laboratory
scientist or pathologist.
• Compare the reanalysis results with the initial reports to document
any newly identified or recharacterized variants.
• Generate a comprehensive clinical report that includes all
significant variants in the 4- or 11-Gene Panels as well as
additional genes.
• Ensure that the report comprehensively covers the interpretation,
clinical implications, and recommendations.
5. RECORDS & DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all experimental procedures, quality control
measures, and reanalysis results.
• Store all raw sequencing data, analysis files, and final reports
securely in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the NGS library preparation kit and
sequencing reagents.
• ACMG Guidelines for Interpretation of Sequence Variants.
• Standard bioinformatics protocols for NGS data analysis.
• Laboratory’s internal quality control and assurance policies.
7. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow the laboratory’s safety policies and procedures during all
stages of testing.
• Implement measures to protect patient confidentiality and comply
with CLIA regulations.
This SOP ensures that the reanalysis of AML gene panels with
additional genes is carried out in a standardized, accurate, and
reliable manner to enhance diagnostic capabilities and provide critical
insights into patient management.
