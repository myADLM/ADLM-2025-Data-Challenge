Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for CYB5 and CYB5 Reductase Genetic Analysis using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE: To outline the detailed procedure for the analysis of
CYB5 and CYB5 Reductase genes using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) for the diagnosis of Recessive Congenital
Methemoglobinemia. This protocol ensures consistent,
accurate, and timely analytical results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the NGS analysis of CYB5 and CYB5 Reductase
genes. It covers the preparation, execution, and documentation
of the analytical phase for genetic analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the NGS workflow according to
this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP, review data, and
validate results.
• Quality Control (QC) Personnel: Monitor QC procedures and
equipment calibration.
1. DEFINITIONS:
• CYB5: Cytochrome b5 gene.
• CYB5R: Cytochrome b5 reductase gene.
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing.
• DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or equivalent)
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• Library preparation kits (e.g., Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit)
• PCR reagents and consumables (e.g., thermal cycler)
• Bioinformatics software (e.g., SeqPilot, VarSeq)
• Laboratory-grade reagents (e.g., molecular-grade water, ethanol)
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer, centrifuge, and magnetic stand
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) and laboratory coat
1. PROCEDURE:
6.1. DNA Extraction:
1. Obtain and accession the sample as per laboratory standards.
2. Extract genomic DNA using the designated DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of the DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) or fluorometry (e.g.,
Qubit).
4. Document DNA concentration and purity in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
6.2. Library Preparation:
1. Perform DNA fragmentation if required (according to the library
preparation kit instructions).
2. Prepare the DNA library using the designated library
preparation kit following the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Amplify the library using PCR and purify the amplified product.
4. Assess library concentration and size distribution using a
bioanalyzer or equivalent instrument.
6.3. NGS Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS sequencer according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up the sequencing run, including the selection of
appropriate sequencing parameters (e.g., read length,
chemistry).
3. Monitor the sequencing run and document any deviations or
issues encountered.
4. Ensure proper documentation of sequencing run conditions and
performance.
6.4. Data Analysis:
1. Process raw sequencing reads using bioinformatics software to
align sequences to the reference genome.
2. Identify variants in CYB5 and CYB5 Reductase genes.
3. Annotate variants based on known databases (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP) and predict their potential impact.
4. Document variant calls and their interpretation in the
laboratory's LIS.
6.5. Quality Control & Validation:
1. Perform internal quality control using controls specified for
NGS, including samples with known variants.
2. Validate the sequencing run by verifying that quality metrics
(e.g., coverage, read depth, base quality) are within acceptable
limits.
3. If quality metrics are not met, troubleshoot and rerun samples if
necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Generate a comprehensive report detailing the variants
identified in CYB5 and CYB5 Reductase genes.
6. Include interpretation of the significance of the variants
concerning recessive congenital methemoglobinemia.
7. Review and validate the report by a qualified laboratory
supervisor or director.
8. Issue the final report to the requesting physician or appropriate
entity.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the DNA extraction kit.
• Manufacturer's instructions for the library preparation kit.
• Manufacturer's instructions for the NGS sequencer.
• Relevant bioinformatics software user guides.
• Clinical guidelines for the interpretation of genetic variants
associated with methemoglobinemia.
1. DOCUMENTATION: Ensure all steps from sample accessioning
to final report generation are documented in the LIS. Include
details of any interventions, deviations, and corrective actions.
