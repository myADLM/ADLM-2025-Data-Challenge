Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Recoverin-IgG
Antibody, Immunoblot, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable detection and quantification of
Recoverin-IgG Antibody in serum samples using immunoblotting
techniques.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing Recoverin-IgG Antibody
Immunoblot testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
test, analyzing the data, and reporting the results accurately
according to this procedure.
4. DEFINITION
Recoverin-IgG Antibody: Autoantibodies targeting the Recoverin
protein, associated with cancer-associated retinopathy.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen: - Serum collected in a red-top tube or SST
(Serum Separator Tube). - Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
Unacceptable specimen: - Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples -
Specimens in EDTA or other anticoagulant tubes - Specimens without
proper labeling or documentation
Storage: - Store serum specimens at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
- Immunoblot apparatus
- Recoverin-IgG Antibody Immunoblot kit (store as per manufacturer’s instructions)
- SDS-PAGE gels
- Transfer buffer
- Blocking solution
- Detection antibody (HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG)
- Substrate solution (e.g., ECL)
- Incubation trays and shakers
- Film or imaging system for result visualization
- Laboratory timer
- Calibrated pipettes
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
1. **Preparation of SDS-PAGE Gel:**
- Assemble SDS-PAGE gel apparatus according to manufacturer's instructions.
- Load serum samples onto the gel and run electrophoresis to separate proteins.
2. **Transfer to Membrane:**
- Transfer proteins from gel to PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane using a wet or semi-dry transfer method.
- Validate successful transfer with Ponceau S staining if required.
3. **Blocking:**
- Block membrane with blocking solution (e.g., 5% non-fat milk in buffer) for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking.
4. **Primary Antibody Incubation:**
- Incubate membrane with primary antibody specific for Recoverin IgG (provided in the kit) diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking.
5. **Washing:**
- Wash membrane thoroughly with washing buffer (e.g., TBS-T) for 3 times, 5 minutes each at room temperature.
6. **Secondary Antibody Incubation:**
- Incubate membrane with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature.
7. **Washing:**
- Wash membrane thoroughly with washing buffer for 4 times, 5 minutes each at room temperature.
8. **Detection:**
- Prepare substrate solution according to kit instructions.
- Incubate membrane with substrate solution and develop signal using film or imaging system.
9. **Analyzing Results:**
- Compare bands on immunoblot with positive and negative controls.
- Identify the presence of Recoverin-IgG based on the molecular weight and band intensity.
10. **Documentation:**
- Record all findings including positive and negative controls on the specified data recording sheet.
- Note any deviations or issues encountered during the procedure.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
- Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
- Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and stored appropriately.
- Calibrate equipment as per manufacturer's schedules.
- Document all QC activities in the log.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
- Record interpreted results clearly in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
- Verify each result to ensure accuracy.
- Transmit results to the physician as per the standard reporting guidelines.
10. REFERENCES
- Manufacturer’s instructions for Recoverin-IgG Antibody Immunoblot kit.
- Laboratory guidelines on immunoblotting techniques.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Low titres may not be detectable by immunoblot.
- Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may affect specificity.
- Proper specimen handling and storage are essential for reliable results.
12. SAFETY
- Follow standard laboratory safety procedures.
- Wear appropriate PPE including gloves and lab coat.
- Dispose of biohazardous waste according to facility regulations.
This SOP must be reviewed periodically to ensure compliance and
performance consistency in generating Recoverin-IgG Antibody
Immunoblot results.
