Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of Reducing
Substances in Feces
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of reducing substances in fecal samples, ensuring
consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
test following this procedure and document results accordingly. It is
also their responsibility to identify any discrepancies or issues and
report them to a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Reducing substances in feces may include sugars (e.g., glucose,
lactose, fructose) and other compounds capable of reducing certain
chemicals, indicating potential malabsorption syndromes or digestive
disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen:
• Fresh fecal sample collected in a sterile container.
• Fecal samples should be sent to the laboratory within 1 hour of
collection.
• If immediate analysis is not feasible, store the sample at 2-8°C for
no more than 24 hours.
Unacceptable samples:
• Samples in open or non-sterile containers
• Samples stored for more than 24 hours.
• Samples that are solidified or overly diluted.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge (if required)
• Water bath
• Pipettes (accurate to 0.1 mL)
• Heatblock or incubator (set to 37°C)
Reagents:
• Benedict’s reagent or Clinitest tablets
• Distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the fecal sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
2. An aliquot of 1 gram of stool is placed into a clean test tube.
3. Add 10 mL of distilled water to the test tube and mix well to
ensure the sample is fully suspended.
For Benedict’s Reagent Method:
1. Add 5 mL of Benedict’s reagent to a new, clean test tube.
2. Pipette 0.5 mL of the diluted feces suspension into the test tube
containing Benedict's reagent.
3. Place the test tube in a boiling water bath for exactly 5 minutes.
4. Remove the test tube and allow it to cool to room temperature.
5. Observe and interpret the color change according to the color
chart provided with the reagent to determine the concentration
of reducing substances.
For Clinitest Tablet Method:
1. Place 5 drops of the diluted feces suspension into a clean test
tube.
2. Add 10 drops of distilled water to the test tube.
3. Drop a Clinitest tablet into the test tube. (Perform this in a fume
hood)
4. Observe the reaction for bubbles and color change, comparing
it against the color chart provided with the Clinitest tablets to
determine the concentration of reducing substances.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform quality control using known negative and positive control
samples for reducing substances with each batch of tests. Document
the results of the controls. If controls do not fall within the expected
range, do not report patient results and investigate the cause of the
discrepancy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
following any established site-specific guidelines for result entry and
verification. Ensure the technologist’s initials and the date of testing
are included.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: No color change or remains blue.
• Positive: Green through to brick-red color development, indicating
the presence of reducing substances.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives can occur with the presence of certain
medications or other non-sugar reducing substances.
• Ensure that stool samples are fresh or properly stored to prevent
degradation which might affect the accuracy of the test.
