Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for RED
BLOOD CELL ENZYME DISORDERS GENE PANEL using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Red Blood Cell Enzyme Disorders
Gene Panel using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). This includes
processing the samples on the sequencing platform, data analysis,
and interpretation of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this protocol accurately. This includes DNA extraction, library
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender-
top) tubes
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 3 mL
• Specimen Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C and extract DNA
within 48 hours. Specimens can be stored frozen (-20°C) if delays
in processing are anticipated.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Next-Generation Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent)
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit)
• Library preparation kits for targeted gene panels
• PCR and thermal cycler equipment
• Bioinformatics analysis software (e.g., GATK, Mutect2)
• Relevant certified reference materials and controls
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the DNA extraction kit to
isolate genomic DNA from the submitted blood specimen.
2. Measure the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
using spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Record the DNA concentration and purity on the data log.
B. Library Preparation
1. Use the library preparation kit as per the manufacturer’s
protocol to prepare the DNA libraries specific for the Red Blood
Cell Enzyme Disorders gene panel.
2. Check the quality of the prepared libraries using a bioanalyzer
or equivalent.
3. Quantify the library concentration using qPCR or other
quantification methods.
4. Pool the libraries to achieve the appropriate final concentration
for sequencing.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing
1. Load the pooled libraries onto the Next-Generation Sequencer
according to the platform-specific protocols.
2. Set up the sequencer with the appropriate runs parameters,
ensuring correct loading of reagents and flow cells/chips.
3. Start the sequencing run and monitor the progress.
4. Upon completion of the sequencing run, transfer raw data to the
bioinformatics server for analysis.
D. Data Analysis
1. Perform initial quality control on raw data reads using tools like
FastQC.
2. Align the sequencing reads to the human reference genome
(e.g., hg19 or hg38) using alignment software like BWA-MEM.
3. Perform variant calling using appropriate variant calling
software (e.g., GATK, Mutect2).
4. Annotate detected variants using variant annotation software
(e.g., Annovar, VEP).
5. Cross-check variants with databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD) to
determine the clinical significance.
6. Generate a preliminary variant report.
E. Data Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review and interpret the variant report, correlating with the
patient's clinical information.
2. Consult with clinical geneticists or molecular pathologists if
necessary for complex or novel variants.
3. Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines (e.g.,
pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign, benign).
4. Prepare a comprehensive final report for the ordering physician,
including details of the variants detected, their clinical
relevance, and recommended follow-up actions.
5. Ensure the report is verified and approved by a certified
laboratory director before release.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Include appropriate controls and standards in each sequencing
run.
2. Perform periodic calibration and maintenance of sequencing
equipment as per manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Analyze Quality Control metrics for each sequencing run to
ensure data integrity.
7. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
All steps, from DNA extraction to final report generation, must be
documented in the laboratory information system (LIS). Maintain
comprehensive logs for reagent lot numbers, control results,
sequencing run metrics, and analysis pipelines used.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Sequencing artifacts or low-quality samples may affect the
accuracy of results.
• Variants of unknown significance (VUS) require cautious
interpretation, often necessitating further analysis or testing.
• The protocol may not detect all genetic variants due to coverage
limitations or specific platform/systemic biases.

9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP must be reviewed annually by the laboratory director and
updated as needed to incorporate new methods, technologies, or
regulatory changes.
