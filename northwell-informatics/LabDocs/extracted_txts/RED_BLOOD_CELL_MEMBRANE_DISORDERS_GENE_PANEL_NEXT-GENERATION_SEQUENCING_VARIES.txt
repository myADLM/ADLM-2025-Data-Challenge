Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Red Blood Cell Membrane
Disorders Gene Panel, Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the methods and responsibilities associated with the analytical
phase of generating results from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
for the Red Blood Cell Membrane Disorders Gene Panel.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
various stages of the analytical phase which includes sequencing,
bioinformatics analysis, variant interpretation, and reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technical Staff: Perform NGS run and preliminary data
analysis.
• Bioinformatics Staff: Carry out bioinformatics analysis, including
raw data processing, alignment, variant calling, and annotation.
• Clinical Scientists/Geneticists: Review and interpret variants,
prepare the final report and verify results.
• Quality Assurance (QA) Staff: Oversight of the entire analytical
process to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and
SOPs.
4. DEFINITION
Red Blood Cell Membrane Disorders Gene Panel: A gene panel
designed to detect mutations associated with hereditary conditions
affecting red blood cell membrane proteins.
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput methodology
to sequence DNA bases in gene panels, exomes, and genomes.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• NGS Platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• Library Preparation Kit
• Sequencing Reagents
• Sample Tracking System
• Bioinformatics Analysis Software (e.g., BWA, GATK, Annovar)
• Reference Genome (e.g., hg19 or hg38)
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Sequencing
1. Extract genomic DNA from the provided patient sample using a
validated DNA extraction method.
2. Quantify and qualify the extracted DNA.
3. Prepare the sequencing library using the designated library
preparation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.
4. Run quality control checks to determine the concentration and
size distribution of the prepared library using a Bioanalyzer or
similar instrument.
5. Load the library onto the NGS platform according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Initiate the sequencing run.
B. Data Generation and Primary Analysis
1. Retrieve raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) after the
sequencing run is complete.
2. Perform initial quality assessment of sequence data using
quality control software (e.g., FastQC).
3. If necessary, trim low-quality reads and adapter sequences
using appropriate software tools (e.g., Trimmomatic).
C. Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Align the quality-checked reads to the reference genome using
a suitable aligner (e.g., BWA).
2. Perform duplicate marking, local realignment, and base quality
recalibration using software such as GATK.
3. Call variants (Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and Insertions/
Deletions (indels)) using variant calling software (e.g., GATK
HaplotypeCaller).
4. Annotate the identified variants using variant annotation tools
(e.g., Annovar) and relevant databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
D. Variant Interpretation
1. Filter variants to identify potential pathogenic mutations based
on various criteria including quality score, read depth, allele
frequency, and predicted impact on protein function.
2. Interpret clinical significance of variants based on pathogenicity
from established databases, literature, and in silico predictions.
3. Cross-reference results with patient phenotype and clinical
information.
E. Reporting
1. Compile the results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Review results and interpretations by a clinical scientist or
geneticist.
3. Generate the final report which includes:
◦ Patient and sample information
◦ Methodology of the test
◦ Results and interpretations
◦ Conclusion and recommendations (if applicable).
4. Verify and sign off by the appropriate personnel.
5. Deliver and archive the report as per the laboratory protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Perform routine QC checks on sequencing instruments and
sequencing reagents to ensure quality standards.
2. Implement validation tests and control runs to verify assay
performance.
3. Review and update SOPs periodically in line with
advancements and feedback.
4. Document any deviations, malfunctions, and corrective actions
in the QC records.
8. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• All personnel must follow the laboratory's safety guidelines,
including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Maintain compliance with CLIA regulations and accreditation
requirements: ensure accurate documentation and reporting.
