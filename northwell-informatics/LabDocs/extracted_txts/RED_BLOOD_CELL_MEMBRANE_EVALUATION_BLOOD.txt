STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
RED BLOOD CELL MEMBRANE EVALUATION, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the step-by-step procedure for
the analytical phase of the Red Blood Cell (RBC) membrane
evaluation. This evaluation is used to identify abnormal
membrane proteins and assess the structural integrity of RBCs,
which can assist in diagnosing various hemolytic anemias and
related disorders.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow
this SOP accurately and ensure that all steps are documented.
• Any abnormalities or discrepancies during the procedure must be
reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION RBC membrane evaluation includes the analysis
of red blood cells' structural elements to identify abnormalities.
The key analyses involve osmotic fragility testing, flow
cytometry, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for protein analysis.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) or heparin (green
top) tubes.
• Minimum volume: 2-5 mL of whole blood.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and tested within 48 hours of
collection.
• Avoid freeze/thaw cycles and ensure specimens are not
hemolyzed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Osmotic fragility solution set
• Flow cytometer
• SDS-PAGE setup (gel, buffer, running equipment)
• Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Silver Stain (as per lab-specific
protocol)
• PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline)
• Quality control (QC) materials (e.g., known normal and abnormal
control samples)
1. QUALITY CONTROL Quality controls must be run with each
batch of patient samples. Results should fall within the
expected range for QC materials provided by the manufacturer.
2. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
• Gently mix the blood sample by inverting the tube 8-10 times.
• Aliquot appropriate volumes for each testing procedure.
B. Osmotic Fragility Test
1. Label a set of tubes with varying NaCl concentrations (0.00%,
0.45%, ..., 0.85%).
2. Add 5.0 mL of each NaCl solution to the respective tube.
3. In parallel, prepare a blank with only saline (to zero the
spectrometer).
4. Add 50 µL of the patient sample to each tube.
5. Mix gently and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 minutes.
7. Measure the absorbance at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer.
8. Plot the percentage of hemolysis against NaCl concentration.
C. Flow Cytometry
1. Prepare the erythrocyte suspension in PBS.
2. Label cells with fluorescently tagged antibodies targeting
specific RBC membrane proteins (e.g., CD55, CD59).
3. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Wash the cells twice with PBS to remove unbound antibodies.
5. Resuspend in 500 µL PBS.
6. Analyze using a flow cytometer; acquire a minimum of 10,000
events.
D. SDS-PAGE Analysis
1. Lyse red blood cells in a hypotonic buffer and collect membrane
fractions.
2. Quantify protein concentration using a standard assay (e.g.,
BCA assay).
3. Load equal amounts of protein onto SDS-PAGE gel.
4. Run the gel according to standard lab procedures.
5. Stain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Silver Stain and de-stain
as required.
6. Compare band patterns with those of the control samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) with
detailed annotations.
• Review and validate the results, ensuring conformity with QC.
• Notify the ordering physician if critical or unexpected results are
obtained.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Proper specimen handling is essential; hemolyzed samples may
give inaccurate results.
• Ensure calibrations and QC checks on technical instruments are
up to date.
• Different extraction and analysis techniques may lead to
variations in results and interpretations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for reagents and equipment.
• Current clinical and laboratory standards for RBC membrane
evaluation.
1. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
• Maintain a logbook for tracking issues and anomalies.
• Ensure documentation of all corrective actions taken during the
procedure.
By following this SOP, the diagnostic information obtained from the
Red Blood Cell Membrane Evaluation test will be accurate, reliable,
and valuable for patient care.
