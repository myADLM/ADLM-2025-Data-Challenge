SOP for Analytical Phase of Red Blood Cell (RBC) Enzyme
Evaluation, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Red Blood Cell (RBC) enzyme evaluation, ensuring high
accuracy, reliability, and replicability of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
RBC enzyme evaluations according to this SOP. All laboratory staff
must ensure proper documentation and quality control throughout the
test process.
3. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA
(lavender top) tube, kept at 2-8°C, and tested within 24 hours of
collection.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, clotted samples, or samples
stored at inappropriate temperatures.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Spectrophotometer with appropriate filters or wavelengths
• Reagents for specific enzyme assays (e.g., Glucose-6-Phosphate
Dehydrogenase (G6PD), Pyruvate Kinase (PK), etc.)
• Test tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Control materials (positive and negative controls)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Mix the whole blood sample gently by inverting the tube several
times.
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes in a
refrigerated centrifuge (4°C).
3. Carefully separate the plasma and buffy coat from the packed
red cells without disturbing the red cell layer.
4. Wash the packed red cells with cold isotonic saline three times;
centrifuge after each wash at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
5. Prepare a 50% red cell suspension in isotonic saline, and store
the suspension at 2-8°C until ready for use (preferably the
same day).
B. Enzyme Assay Procedure:
1. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Assay:
◦ Add an aliquot of washed red cell suspension to the reaction
mixture containing glucose-6-phosphate and NADP (specific
to the assay being used).
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the recommended
duration.
◦ Measure absorbance changes at 340 nm using a
spectrophotometer to monitor NADPH formation.
◦ Compare results against known standards and controls.
2. Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Assay:
◦ Add an aliquot of washed red cell suspension to the reaction
mixture containing phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP, in the
presence of NADH and lactate dehydrogenase.
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the recommended
duration.
◦ Measure absorbance changes at 340 nm, monitoring the
oxidation of NADH.
◦ Compare results against known standards and controls.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each batch of tests using known
positive and negative controls.
• Document control results and ensure they fall within the specified
acceptable range. If controls fall outside this range, troubleshoot
the assay and do not release patient results until the issue is
resolved.
• Repeat testing for validation if control results are inconsistent.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Results should be compared against established reference
ranges.
• Normal, elevated, or deficient enzyme activities must be reported
clearly in patient records.
• Any analyst reviewing results must ensure that significant
deviations from expected values are verified prior to reporting.
8. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all specimens, controls, calibration data, and
test results for future reference and auditing purposes.
• Ensure all logs, including temperature logs of storage and
analysis conditions, are accurately filled out and up-to-date.
9. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Follow standard laboratory practices for handling blood and its
components, including utilizing proper PPE.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste in accordance with laboratory
policies and local regulations.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results are out of range, reassess the integrity of
samples, reagents, and operation of the equipment.
• Ensure spectrophotometer calibration is current and accurate.
• Consult the supervisor for guidance if persistent issues are
experienced.
11. REFERENCES
• Relevant equipment manuals for spectrophotometer and
centrifuge use.
• Kit inserts and instructions for enzyme-specific assays.
• Literature references for normal and pathological ranges of RBC
enzyme activities.

This SOP must be reviewed annually or whenever significant
procedural changes are made.
