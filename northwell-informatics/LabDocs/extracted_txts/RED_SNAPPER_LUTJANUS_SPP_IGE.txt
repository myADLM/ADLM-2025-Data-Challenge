Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Red Snapper (Lutjanus
spp) IgE Testing
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to describe the
analytical phase procedures for the generation of results for
Red Snapper (Lutjanus spp) IgE testing. This protocol ensures
accuracy, consistency, and reliability in measuring serum IgE
levels specific to Red Snapper allergens.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the analysis, validate the results, and follow the
corrective actions as outlined in this SOP.
1. DEFINITION IgE testing is a laboratory procedure used to
quantify allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in
human serum, which may indicate a hypersensitivity to specific
allergens such as Red Snapper proteins.
2. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Acceptable specimens: Serum collected in a red-top or SST tube.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens with gross hemolysis,
lipemia, or contamination.
• Specimen stability: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C and tested
within 7 days of collection. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
B. Equipment and Supplies
• IgE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit specific for
Red Snapper allergens
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory timer
C. Reagents
• Calibrators and controls provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
D. Analytical Procedure:
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and samples are brought to room
temperature (20-25°C) prior to testing.
2. Label the microplate wells according to the manufacturer's
instructions, including calibrators, controls, and patient
samples.
3. Add the required volume of samples and calibrators to the
appropriate wells.
4. Pipette the detection antibody into each well and incubate the
microplate for the specified time (typically 60 minutes) at room
temperature.
5. Wash the microplate wells as per the kit protocol to remove
unbound materials.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time (typically 15-30 minutes) at room temperature in
the dark.
7. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
8. Read the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader at
the wavelength stated by the kit instructions (usually 450 nm).
E. Quality Control:
• Run internal quality controls (positive and negative) with each
batch to ensure the assay performance.
• Record control values and patient results in accordance with site-
specific guidelines.
• Ensure all controls are within the acceptable ranges as provided
by the kit manufacturer.
F. Reporting Results:
• Calculate patient IgE levels based on the standard curve
generated from the calibrators.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report values in International Units per milliliter (IU/mL) with
appropriate reference ranges.
G. Method Limitations:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, and contaminated samples may affect test
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other seafood allergens might occur;
interpretation should be done cautiously.
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations of each
reagent pad.
H. Corrective Actions:
• If any internal controls are out of range, do not report patient
results. Re-assay the controls and patient samples.
• In case of consistent unusual results, troubleshoot based on the
kit insert guidelines and notify the supervisor.

This SOP should be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary
to incorporate the latest scientific findings and equipment
advancements.
