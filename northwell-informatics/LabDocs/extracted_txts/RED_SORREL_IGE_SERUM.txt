Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing Red Sorrel,
IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Red Sorrel,
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples including required steps,
equipment, reagents, and documentation to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure accurately and ensure that the results are correctly
reported. All designated personnel must receive appropriate training
and demonstrate competency in performing this procedure.
3. SAMPLES
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of venous blood collected via routine
venipuncture.
• Container: Standard red-top or serum-separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within
2 hours of collection. Separated serum can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (such as
EDTA, heparin, etc.).
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microliter plate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C
• Timer
• Immunoassay analyzer (specific to vendor)
Reagents:
• Allergen-specific IgE test kit specific for Red Sorrel (validate kit
expiry before use)
• Microtiter plates pre-coated with anti-human IgE antibodies
• Wash buffer
• Diluent
• Conjugate solution (enzyme-labeled anti-IgE)
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Review and organize all necessary equipment and reagents.
2. Bring all refrigerated reagents and samples to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
3. Label all tubes and plates correctly to ensure traceability
throughout the procedure.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
2. Transfer serum into clean, labeled microtubes.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette 50 µL of calibrators, controls, and serum samples into
designated wells on the microtiter plate.
2. Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well and incubate the
plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash each well 5 times with 200 µL of wash buffer, ensuring
complete removal of liquid after each wash.
4. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature.
5. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
6. Read absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader within
30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
Controls and Calibration:
• Run quality control samples (both positive and negative) with
each assay batch.
• Ensure that calibration curves are prepared for each assay, using
the provided calibrators.
Result Interpretation:
• Utilize the calibration curve to determine the concentration of IgE
specific to Red Sorrel in each sample.
• Convert absorbance readings to concentration (IU/mL) using the
curve.
Result Reporting:
• Results should be reported in IU/mL.
• Document any critical results and notify the requesting physician
as per laboratory policy.
• Quality assurance review of results should be conducted before
final validation.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: <0.35 IU/mL
• Low positive: 0.35 - 0.70 IU/mL
• Moderate positive: 0.71 - 3.50 IU/mL
• High positive: >3.50 IU/mL
7. QUALITY CONTROL (QC)
• Implement QC procedures using known high and low-level
controls to ensure assay reliability.
• Record all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding to test patient samples.
• Investigate any QC failures and take corrective action.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for the IgE test
kit.
• Laboratory quality management guidelines.
• Current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete the appropriate log sheets, including the date, lot
numbers of reagents, control results, calibration data, and the
results of patient samples.
• Ensure all steps and results are traceable for review and
compliance purposes.
Designated staff must ensure all logs and records are properly
maintained and deviations are documented with corrective actions as
necessary.
