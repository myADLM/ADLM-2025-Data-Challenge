Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for RED TOP, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Red Top IgE (Immunoglobulin E) serum samples in a CLIA-
certified laboratory to ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability of
patient test results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
responsible for processing, analyzing, and generating results for Red
Top IgE serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the analysis,
documentation, and reporting of IgE results.
• All laboratory staff must adhere to this SOP to ensure consistency
and reliability.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Serum collected in a Red Top Tube.
• Collection: Follow standard phlebotomy practices to draw blood
into a Red Top Tube without any anticoagulants or preservatives.
• Handling: Allow blood to clot adequately by standing upright for at
least 30 minutes but not more than 60 minutes at room
temperature. Centrifuge the sample within 1 hour of collection at
1000-1500 x g for 10-15 minutes.
• Storage: Store the serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, serum can be aliquoted into cryovials and kept at -20°C
or lower.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents: Manufacturer-provided IgE assay reagents.
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Thermometer (for monitoring room and refrigerator/freezer
temperatures)
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader or automated
chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer)
◦ Quality control materials for IgE
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (both positive and negative control)
with each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure that quality control results are within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
• Document all quality control results in the laboratory log.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
• Thawing (if applicable): Thaw frozen specimens at room
temperature. Mix thoroughly and ensure no samples show signs
of hemolysis or contamination before analysis.
• Pipetting: Using calibrated pipettes, transfer the required volume
of serum to the designated assay wells according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• IgE Assay:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s specific instructions for the IgE
assay, including reagent preparation, incubation times,
temperature requirements, and wash steps.
2. Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
3. Start the analysis run as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Reading Results: Upon completion of the assay run, the
immunoassay analyzer will generate raw data. Ensure all quality
control parameters are met.
• Data Interpretation:
1. Analyze the generated data using the manufacturer's
software or manually as per guidelines.
2. Compare patient IgE levels to the established reference
intervals.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Follow the reference intervals provided by the IgE assay
manufacturer to interpret patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all patient results for accuracy and compliance with
quality control standards.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification by a technologist.
• Report verified results according to site-specific guidelines,
ensuring timely communication to healthcare providers.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, do not report
patient results. Investigate potential sources of error, which may
include reagent integrity, equipment malfunction, or operator error.
• Address and resolve any identified issues before re-running the
assay.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and outcomes in the
laboratory log.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance of the
immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities in the laboratory
maintenance log.
1. SAFETY
• Follow all safety guidelines related to handling biological
specimens, chemicals, and operating laboratory equipment.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab
coats, and eye protection.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to laboratory safety
protocols.

Documentation
• Ensure all steps, calibrations, quality control results, and
maintenance activities are adequately logged.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
ensure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements and
technological advancements.
