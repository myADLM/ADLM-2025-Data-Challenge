Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Relative B-Cell Subset Analysis
Percentage in Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the step-by-step procedure for
performing relative B-cell subset analysis in blood using flow
cytometry. This procedure includes preparing the specimen, staining
with specific antibodies, acquiring data on the flow cytometer, and
analyzing the data. Accurate and reliable results are essential for
clinical diagnosis and patient management.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel trained in flow
cytometry techniques who are responsible for analyzing B-cell
subsets in blood samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Personnel: Perform B-cell subset analysis according
to the SOP and document all necessary information.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensure that all personnel are trained
and proficient in performing and documenting the procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood
• Collection Tube: K2 EDTA (lavender top) or sodium heparin
(green top) vacutainer
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 3 mL
• Specimen Stability: Process within 24 hours of collection. Store
at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Flow cytometer
• Fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies:
◦ CD19-PE
◦ CD20-FITC
◦ CD5-APC
◦ CD10-PerCP
◦ Isotype controls
• Lysis buffer (1X)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS
• 12 x 75 mm polystyrene test tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Label Tubes:
◦ Label a set of 12 x 75 mm polystyrene test tubes for each
patient and control sample.
2. Aliquot Blood:
◦ Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into each labeled tube.
3. Add Antibodies:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of each fluorochrome-
conjugated antibody and isotope control to the designated
tubes:
▪ CD19-PE
▪ CD20-FITC
▪ CD5-APC
▪ CD10-PerCP
◦ Vortex gently to mix.
4. Incubate:
◦ Incubate the tube in the dark at room temperature (20-25°C)
for 15 minutes.
5. Lyse Red Blood Cells:
◦ Add 2 mL of lysis buffer to each tube.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 minutes.
6. Wash:
◦ Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Aspirate supernatant, leaving 50 µL of residual fluid.
◦ Add 2 mL of 0.5% BSA-PBS and vortex gently.
◦ Centrifuge again at 300 x g for 5 minutes and aspirate
supernatant.
7. Resuspend:
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 µL of 0.5% BSA-PBS and
vortex gently.
B. Data Acquisition
1. Set Up Flow Cytometer:
◦ Perform daily instrument calibration and compensation
adjustments using standard beads as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Create a template for B-cell panel with relevant parameters.
2. Acquire Data:
◦ Acquire at least 10,000 lymphocyte events per sample.
C. Data Analysis
1. Gate Lymphocyte Population:
◦ Use forward scatter (FSC) vs. side scatter (SSC) to gate on
lymphocytes.
2. Analyze B-cell Subsets:
◦ Identify B-cell subsets using appropriate gating strategies:
▪ CD19+ cells (total B-cells)
▪ CD19+CD5+ cells (B-1 cells)
▪ CD19+CD10+ cells (precursor B-cells)
▪ CD20+ cells (mature B-cells)
3. Calculate Percentages:
◦ Determine the percentage of each B-cell subset relative to
total lymphocytes and total B-cells.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily quality control on the flow cytometer using standard
calibration and validation beads.
• Include positive and negative control samples in each run.
• Maintain records of QC results and actions taken in case of
deviations.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify that all data are analyzed correctly and within acceptable
ranges.
• Report the relative percentages of B-cell subsets in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Document any abnormalities or comments related to sample
quality or data integrity.
