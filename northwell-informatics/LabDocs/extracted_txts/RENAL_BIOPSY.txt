Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Renal Biopsy
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the processing, staining, and
examination of renal biopsy specimens to ensure accurate and
reliable diagnostic results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
the preparation, staining, and microscopic examination of renal
biopsy specimens. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
verifying the quality of results and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Fresh renal biopsy tissue obtained via needle biopsy.
• Tissue should be placed in appropriate fixative immediately after
collection.
• Acceptable fixatives: Formalin, Glutaraldehyde, or Michel's
transport medium (for immunofluorescence).
Storage:
• Formalin-fixed tissues: Store at room temperature.
• Glutaraldehyde-fixed tissues: Store at 4°C.
• Michel's medium: Store at 4°C, transport to the laboratory as soon
as possible.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Cryostat (if immunofluorescence is required)
• Tissue processor
• Staining stations (H&E, PAS, Trichrome, Silver stain)
• Microscope (light and fluorescence)
• Cover slips
• Slides (glass)
• Appropriate fixatives and staining reagents
4. PROCEDURE
A) Fixation and Processing:
1. Fixation:
◦ Immediately place fresh renal biopsy tissue in the chosen
fixative.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s guidance for fixation duration and
concentration.
2. Tissue Processing:
◦ Formalin-fixed tissue: Processed through graded alcohols
and xylene, embedded in paraffin.
◦ Glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue: Follow specific protocols for
electron microscopy if necessary.
B) Sectioning:
1. Paraffin-embedded Tissue:
◦ Cut sections at 2-4 µm thickness using a microtome.
◦ Mount sections on glass slides.
2. Cryostat Sectioning (for immunofluorescence):
◦ Cut sections at 4-8 µm thickness.
◦ Mount on glass slides and store under conditions suitable
for immunofluorescence.
C) Staining:
1. Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) Staining:
◦ Stain sections following standardized H&E protocols.
◦ Rinse with deionized water and dehydrate through graded
alcohols.
◦ Clear in xylene and mount with cover slips.
2. Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) Staining:
◦ Treat sections with periodic acid and Schiff reagent.
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin.
◦ Dehydrate, clear, and mount as above.
3. Trichrome Staining:
◦ Stain sections with trichrome staining protocol.
◦ Dehydrate, clear, and mount.
4. Silver Staining (for basement membrane evaluation):
◦ Follow standardized protocols for silver staining.
◦ Dehydrate, clear, and mount.
5. Immunofluorescence Staining:
◦ On cryostat sections, apply specific antibodies for target
proteins (e.g., IgG, IgA, C3).
◦ Incubate with fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies.
◦ Rinse in PBS, mount with antifade medium, and cover slips.
D) Microscopic Examination:
1. Light Microscopy:
◦ Examine stained sections under a light microscope.
◦ Assess for pathology such as glomerular structure
alterations, tubulointerstitial changes, etc.
2. Immunofluorescence Microscopy:
◦ Examine immunofluorescence stained sections under
appropriate filters with a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Document presence and pattern of immune complex
deposits.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Daily QC:
◦ Check calibration of microscopes, staining reagents, and
processing equipment.
◦ Document QC checks and corrections in the logbook.
2. Control Samples:
◦ Include control slides with known pathology in each staining
run to confirm staining efficacy.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Report findings in accordance with site-specific reporting
guidelines.
◦ Include all relevant histopathology and immunofluorescence
results.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a senior
pathologist before transmission to the LIS.
3. Critical Results:
◦ Inform ordering physician immediately of any critical or
unexpected findings.
◦ Document communication thoroughly.
Reference Intervals:
• Report findings based on reference intervals and criteria for
normal/pathological kidney tissue.
Method Limitations:
Refer to specific staining protocols and manufacturer inserts for stain-
specific limitations.
References:
Include references to specific tissue processing and staining
protocols, as well as microscopy guidebooks and manufacturer
inserts for reagents.

generating diagnostic renal biopsy results, ensuring accuracy,
reliability, and compliance with laboratory standards.
