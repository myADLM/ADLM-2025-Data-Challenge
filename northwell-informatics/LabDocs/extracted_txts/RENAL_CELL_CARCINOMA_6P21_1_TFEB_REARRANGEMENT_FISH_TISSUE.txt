Title: Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, 6P21.1 (TFEB)
REARRANGEMENT, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized protocol
for the detection and analysis of the 6p21.1 (TFEB) rearrangement
via Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in tissue samples from
patients with suspected renal cell carcinoma.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained to
perform FISH analysis on tissue samples for the detection of TFEB
rearrangement. This SOP ensures accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of test results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing FISH
analysis, recording results, and adhering to this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for reviewing and verifying
the results and ensuring compliance with quality control
measures.
• Quality Assurance Personnel: Responsible for overseeing the
adherence to SOP guidelines and addressing any deviations.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Tissue samples (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded)
• TFEB FISH Probe Kit
• Fluorescence microscope
• Microtome and staining equipment
• FISH Hybridization System
• Hybridization Buffer
• Cover slips and glass slides
• Ethanol series for dehydration (70%, 85%, 100%)
• DAPI counterstain
• Laboratory logbook and reporting templates
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation of Slides:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Use a microtome to cut 4-5 µm thick sections from the
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue block.
◦ Place sections onto positively charged glass slides.
2. Deparaffinization:
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to remove paraffin.
◦ Deparaffinize in 2 changes of xylene for 10 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded ethanol series (100%, 85%,
70%) for 3 minutes each, followed by a rinse in distilled
water.
3. Pre-treatment:
◦ Immerse slides in pre-treatment solution provided by the
FISH kit for 10 minutes at 80°C.
◦ Wash slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
4. Digestion:
◦ Digest slides in protease solution (provided by the FISH kit)
for 10 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS buffer and then distilled water.
B. Hybridization:
1. Denaturation:
◦ Apply the TFEB FISH probe mix to the target area on the
slide.
◦ Cover the area with a cover slip and seal the edges with
rubber cement.
◦ Place the slides on a hybridization system and denature at
75°C for 5 minutes.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Perform hybridization at 37°C for 16 hours in a humidified
chamber.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Washing:
◦ Remove coverslips gently and immerse slides in post-
hybridization wash buffer 1 provided by the FISH kit at 72°C
for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in post-hybridization wash buffer 2 at room
temperature for 1 minute.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply DAPI counterstain to each slide.
◦ Cover with a cover slip and allow to air dry in the dark.
D. Evaluation and Interpretation:
1. Microscopy:
◦ Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filter sets.
◦ Scan the entire tissue section to identify areas suitable for
analysis.
◦ Count at least 50 nuclei to assess the FISH signals.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Assess the presence of split signals indicative of a
rearrangement or the typical colocalized signals from normal
cells.
◦ Record the results according to the laboratory's reporting
guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform FISH analysis on positive and negative control samples
with each batch.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure.
• Ensure calibration and maintenance of equipment as per
manufacturer guidelines.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document the FISH results in the laboratory logbook.
• Report the finalized results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Results should include the interpretation of TFEB rearrangement
status and any observations of note.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the TFEB FISH Probe Kit.
• Laboratory's internal quality control and reporting guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on FISH analysis for renal cell
carcinoma.
9. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document any revisions made to this SOP, including the date of
revision and the nature of changes.
This SOP is effective as of [date] and is authorized by [Laboratory
Supervisor/Authority Name]. All personnel involved in TFEB FISH
analysis must review and adhere to this protocol.
