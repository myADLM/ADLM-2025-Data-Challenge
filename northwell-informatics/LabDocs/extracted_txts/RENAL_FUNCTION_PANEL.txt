Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Renal Function Panel Testing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to perform the analytical
phase of a Renal Function Panel (RFP) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
It ensures consistent and accurate generation of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the tests as defined in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
the procedures are carried out in compliance with this SOP and to
address any deficiencies or issues.
1. DEFINITIONS
A Renal Function Panel typically includes the following analytes:
• Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
• Creatinine
• Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)
• Sodium
• Potassium
• Chloride
• Bicarbonate (Total CO2)
• Calcium
• Phosphorus
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU)
• Calibrators and Controls specific to each analyte
• Reagents specific to each analyte
• Specimen collection tubes: Serum Separator Tubes (SST) or
heparinized plasma tubes
• Pipettes and tips (if manual steps are required)
• Barcoded sample labels
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Handling and Preparation
1. Confirm that specimens have been collected, received, and
accessioned correctly.
2. Centrifuge blood samples in Serum Separator Tubes (SST) at
3000 RPM for 10 minutes to obtain serum. For plasma
samples, use heparinized tubes.
3. Aliquot the serum/plasma into appropriately labeled sample
cups (if not directly loaded onto the analyzer).
B) Loading Samples on the Analyzer
1. Load samples onto the specified racks or sample trays of the
automated analyzer.
2. Ensure that proper identification (barcode) is available for each
sample.
3. Select the Renal Function Panel (RFP) test profile on the
analyzer.
C) Running the Tests
1. Perform analyzer checks and calibrations as per manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Daily maintenance (e.g., prime lines, clean probes)
◦ Calibrate each analyte using manufacturer-specific
calibrators.
2. Load quality controls (QC) for all analytes in the renal function
panel.
◦ Run two levels of QC material (normal and abnormal) at the
beginning of each shift and whenever there is a reagent lot
change.
◦ Verify QC results acceptability before proceeding with
patient samples.
3. Initiate the analysis process according to the analyzer's user
manual.
D) Analyzing Results
1. Review and validate the QC results:
◦ Acceptable QC ranges are provided by the manufacturer
and should be documented in the Quality Control Log.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's guidelines before analyzing
any patient samples.
2. Review initial patient results for any flags or errors generated by
the analyzer:
◦ Perform reruns or dilutions as necessary, ensuring all results
fall within the reportable range.
3. Monitor and document any abnormal or critical values. Report
any critical values to the appropriate healthcare provider per
laboratory protocol.
E) Data Entry and Reporting
1. Results are automatically transmitted from the analyzer to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review results in the LIS for accuracy and completeness.
3. Amend any flagged results or discrepancies using manual data
entry protocols, if necessary.
4. Verify and release the results in the LIS for the final report to be
dispatched to the requesting provider.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Initial and Ongoing QC Measures
1. Calibrate instruments at intervals defined by the analyzer
manufacturer or laboratory policy.
2. Run daily controls - include at least two levels (low, normal,
high).
3. Document QC results and take corrective actions for any out-of-
range values.
B) Review of QC Results
1. If QC results are out of acceptable limits, perform the following:
◦ Re-run QC material.
◦ Investigate and troubleshoot any potential issues.
◦ Do not release patient results until QC issues are resolved.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Critical values must be promptly communicated to the attending
physician or clinical care team.
1. DIAGNOSTIC LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay manufacturer’s instructions for use
regarding any limitations or potential interferences in the
measurement of analytes included in the Renal Function Panel.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain detailed records of all QC data, calibrations, and
maintenance logs.
• Document specimen rejection criteria and reasons for rejection if
applicable.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the use of the automated chemistry
analyzer.
• Laboratory Quality Manual.
• Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
