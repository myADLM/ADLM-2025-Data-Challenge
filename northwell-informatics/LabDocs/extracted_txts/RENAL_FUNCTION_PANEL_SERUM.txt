Renal Function Panel, Serum - Analytical Phase Procedure
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized guidelines
for the analytical phase of generating results for the Renal Function
Panel, Serum. This ensures accurate and reliable results produced in
a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analytical steps as defined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure adherence to the protocol and to
report any discrepancies or issues to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a gel barrier tube (SST) or a red-top tube
without anticoagulant.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (EDTA,
heparin, citrate).
1. STORAGE
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48
hours. If analysis cannot be performed within this time frame,
aliquot serum and store frozen at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501)
• Reagents specific to the chemistry analyzer.
• Calibrators and controls.
• Pipettes and other laboratory supplies.
1. REAGENTS AND CALIBRATORS
• All reagents and calibrators must be within their expiration dates
and stored as per manufacturer instructions. Preparation and
handling should follow manufacturer guidelines diligently.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control (QC) materials at two levels (normal and
abnormal) at the start of each shift, after calibration, following any
major maintenance or reagent changes, or when results appear
questionable.
• QC results must be within established laboratory ranges before
reporting patient results. Investigate and resolve any QC failures
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature before
analysis if stored refrigerated or frozen.
• Mix specimens gently by inversion to ensure homogeneity before
loading onto the analyzer.
B) Analyzer Setup:
• Ensure the chemistry analyzer is calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform a daily maintenance check and ensure the instrument is
operating within specified conditions.
• Check reagent and QC statuses on the analyzer and ensure all
necessary reagents and controls are ready and within expiration
dates.
C) Sample Loading:
• Load patient serum samples, QC materials, and calibrators into
the designated positions on the analyzer.
• Ensure samples are identified and barcoded properly to match the
worklist.
D) Running the Assay:
• Select the Renal Function Panel assay on the analyzer’s
software.
• Start the run following the analyzer’s operational procedures.
• Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts during the
run.
E) Analyte Measurement:
The Renal Function Panel typically includes the following assays:
• BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
• Creatinine
• BUN/Creatinine Ratio (calculated)
• Uric Acid
• Electrolytes (optional, according to specific panel configurations)
Each assay should follow the specific method and protocol provided
by the analyzer's manufacturer.
F) Result Review and Verification:
• After the run is complete, review the results for each analyte.
• Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before reporting
patient results.
• Investigate and address any discrepancies or abnormal results as
per laboratory protocol.
• For critical values, follow the laboratory's procedure for immediate
reporting and documentation.
G) Reporting Results:
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and released by a qualified
technologist.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Reference intervals for the Renal Function Panel will vary by analyte
and should be defined according to the laboratory's established
reference ranges.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
Refer to the analyzer’s user manual and the laboratory's
troubleshooting guide for handling any technical issues, unexpected
errors, or quality control failures.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain proper documentation of all QC runs, calibrations,
maintenance logs, and patient results.
• Ensure all actions taken during the analytical phase are recorded
in accordance with the laboratory's SOPs.
1. REFERENCES:
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for each reagent used and the user
manual for the chemistry analyzer for detailed instructions and
method limitations.
By adhering to this SOP for the analytical phase of the Renal
Function Panel, Serum, we ensure standardized, accurate, and
reliable results critical for patient care and diagnosis.
