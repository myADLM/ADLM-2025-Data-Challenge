RENAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION, WET TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the handling and analytical processing
of wet tissue samples for renal pathology consultation in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow this
procedure to ensure proper handling and analysis of wet tissue
samples for renal pathology consultation. All staff must adhere to
these guidelines to maintain sample integrity and produce accurate
histopathological results.
3. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen: - Fresh renal biopsy tissue
obtained by a physician. - Tissue must be submitted in appropriate
preservative solution (e.g., formalin, glutaraldehyde, or other
designated fixative as per protocol). - Specimen must be delivered to
the laboratory immediately (or within 1 hour) following collection to
ensure sample integrity.
Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimens that are not delivered within
the stipulated time frame. - Specimens not properly labeled or lacking
essential information (i.e., patient identification, date and time of
collection, requesting physician). - Specimens showing signs of
degradation or improper preservation.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Preservative solutions (Formalin, Glutaraldehyde, etc.)
• Dissection tools (scalpel, scissors, forceps)
• Wet tissue histology cassette
• Embedding molds
• Paraffin wax
• Microtome
• Glass slides
• Staining solutions (e.g., Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), periodic
acid-Schiff (PAS), Silver stains, Immunohistochemical (IHC)
reagents)
• Microscope
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Handling and Preparation:
1. **Sample Reception**:
- Verify proper labeling and documentation.
- Examine the condition of the specimen for integrity.
- Log specimen receipt in the laboratory information system.
2. **Fixation**:
- Place the fresh tissue into the appropriate preservative solution immediately upon receipt.
- Follow fixation protocols specific to the tissue type (e.g., formalin for routine histology, glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy).
- Document the time of specimen placement in the fixative.
3. **Dissection**:
- Wearing appropriate PPE, transfer the fixed tissue to a clean work area.
- Dissect the tissue into smaller pieces if necessary, using sterile dissection tools.
- Place tissue into histology cassettes for further processing.
B. Tissue Processing and Embedding:
4. **Dehydration**:
- Subject cassettes to a series of alcohol washes (e.g., graded ethanol solutions from 70% to 100%) to dehydrate the tissue.
- Use xylene for clearing.
5. **Embedding**:
- Embed the dehydrated and cleared tissue in molten paraffin wax.
- Allow the wax to solidify within embedding molds.
6. **Microtomy**:
- Cut sections of the embedded tissue using a microtome.
- Mount sections onto glass slides.
- Ensure sections are thin and uniform (approx. 4-5 micrometers in thickness).
C. Staining and Slide Preparation:
7. **Staining Procedures**:
- Stain slides using appropriate staining protocols (e.g., H&E, PAS, Silver stain).
- Follow specific staining times and techniques as outlined in manufacturer instructions or laboratory protocols.
8. **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**:
- Perform IHC staining as required, following standard protocols for antigen retrieval, antibody application, and detection.
9. **Slide Examination**:
- Examine the stained slides under a microscope for histopathological analysis.
- Assess quality and ensure the slides meet diagnostic requirements.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material: - Internal positive and negative controls as
per site-specific guidelines.
Procedure: - Each new batch of reagents and stains must be quality
controlled. - Documenting deviations and corrective actions. -
Perform routine maintenance of equipment and calibration checks.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
10. **Analysis and Documentation**:
- Pathologists will examine the slides and provide the renal pathology consultation report.
- Results are to be documented in the laboratory information system.
- Provide detailed descriptions including findings, diagnoses, and recommendations.
8. REFERENCES
Consultations should adhere to established protocols, and references
may include pathology textbooks, peer-reviewed articles, and
manufacturers' instructions for equipment and reagents.
This protocol ensures proper specimen handling and
histopathological analysis in renal pathology consultation,
maintaining sample integrity and ensuring accurate diagnosis.
