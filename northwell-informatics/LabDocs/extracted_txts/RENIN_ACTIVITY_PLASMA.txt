Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Plasma Renin Activity (PRA)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantification of Plasma Renin
Activity (PRA) in clinical specimens, ensuring accuracy, precision,
and reliability of results following CLIA standards.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to laboratory personnel performing PRA
analysis in the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to:
• Perform PRA tests according to this SOP.
• Ensure the maintenance and calibration of equipment used.
• Document all results and quality control activities.
• Identify and report any procedural or equipment issues to a
supervisor or designated personnel.
1. PRINCIPLE
Plasma Renin Activity is measured by determining the amount of
angiotensin I generated per unit of time under controlled conditions.
An increase in angiotensin I indicates renin activity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
◦ Preferred specimen: 2-4 mL of plasma collected in EDTA
(lavender-top) tubes.
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Specimens must be kept cold during collection and
transported on ice.
◦ Centrifuge at 4°C and separate plasma within 30 minutes of
collection.
◦ Store plasma at -80°C if not analyzed immediately.
2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge (refrigerated)
◦ Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
◦ Incubator
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Freezer (-80°C)
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit for PRA
◦ Water bath (37°C)
◦ Timer
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (lab coat, gloves, safety
goggles)
3. REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS
◦ PRA enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit, including:
▪ Standards
▪ Controls
▪ Enzyme conjugate
▪ Substrate solution
▪ Stop solution
◦ Deionized water
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation
• Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use.
• Prepare and label all necessary reagents according to the EIA kit
instructions.
Enzyme Immunoassay Procedure
• Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and plasma specimens into
their respective wells.
• Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
• Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
• Wash the plate 4 times with the provided wash buffer.
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 30 minutes protected from light.
• Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
• Read the optical density at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes.
Calculation of Results
• Construct a calibration curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their corresponding concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of PRA in the samples by referring to
the calibration curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include both negative and positive quality control (QC)
samples with each run.
◦ Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range. If QC
fails, troubleshoot and repeat assay.
◦ Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify all results before releasing.
• Report any abnormal or critical results following the laboratory’s
critical results policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish and validate reference intervals for the specific patient
population.
• Generally, PRA levels are expressed in ng/mL/hr with reference
values provided by the kit manufacturer or published literature.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect results.
• Adherence to cold chain during pre-analytical and analytical
phases is critical.
1. REFERENCES
• EIA kit insert and instructions.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature and protocol references.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logbooks for specimen processing, equipment
calibration, and maintenance.
• Keep electronic or hard copies of all test and QC results, including
any deviations or issues occurring during the testing process.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow the laboratory’s safety protocols including the use of PPE.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials in accordance with proper
waste disposal protocols.
Training and Competence
• Ensure all personnel performing the assay are adequately trained
and competent.
• Participate in proficiency testing and continuing education
programs to maintain competency.
Review and Revision
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever a change in
the procedure occurs. Revisions should be documented, and all
personnel should be trained on any new modifications to the
protocol.
