STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
REPTILASE TIME, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To accurately perform and report the Reptilase Time test for
assessing the specific clotting time of plasma when Reptilase, a
snake venom enzyme, is used. To determine if there's any
dysfunction in fibrinogen conversion to fibrin and to identify potential
fibrinogen disorders.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of the Reptilase Time
test within the laboratory setting. It is intended for use by trained
laboratory personnel.
3. SPECIMEN
3.1. Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Platelet-poor plasma
◦ Collect blood in a 3.2% sodium citrate tube (light blue-top).
◦ Invert tube gently 4-6 times to mix.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 15 minutes at room
temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
◦ Transfer supernatant without plasma into a new plastic tube
while avoiding cellular material.
◦ Centrifuge again at 1500-2000 x g for an additional 15 minutes
to ensure platelet poor plasma.
3.2. Specimen Stability:
• Plasma can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature
(18-24°C).
• For longer storage, freeze plasma samples at -20°C or below.
Samples remain stable for up to 1 month if frozen.
3.3. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Samples older than 4 hours if kept at room temperature or
improper freezing specimens that experienced thawing.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1. Equipment:
• Coagulation Analyzer (e.g., STAGO, Sysmex, or similar)
• Timer
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Reagent Mixing Pipette
• Plastic test tubes (polypropylene)
4.2. Reagents:
• Reptilase reagent (freeze-dried)
◦ Reconstitute according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Store at 2-8°C and bring to room temperature before use.
◦ Use within the timeframe specified by the manufacturer after
reconstitution.
• Control Plasma (Normal and Abnormal)
◦ Store according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Bring control plasmas to room temperature before use.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1. Quality Control Material:
• Normal Control Plasma
• Abnormal Control Plasma
5.2. Procedure:
• Quality control must be performed each day of testing, or with
each new batch of reagents.
• Process controls with the same procedure as patient samples.
• Record and monitor control results per laboratory QC policy.
• Controls must be within established ranges before patient results
are reported.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation:
1. Thoroughly thaw frozen plasma samples at 37°C for 5 minutes,
mix gently.
2. Bring the Reptilase reagent to room temperature before use.
3. Calibrate pipettes and ensure accurate delivery volumes.
4. Run quality control specimens to verify instrument and reagent
performance prior to patient testing.
6.2. Test Procedure:
1. Label plastic test tubes for each patient sample and control.
2. Place 100 µL of patient plasma or control into a labeled test
tube.
3. Incubate the test tubes containing the plasma at 37°C for 1-2
minutes.
4. Rapidly add 100 µL of Reptilase reagent into the tube
containing plasma.
5. Start the timer immediately upon addition of the Reptilase
reagent.
6. Gently tilt the test tube to mix and observe for clot formation.
7. Record the clotting time in seconds as Reptilase Time.
7. RESULTS AND REPORTING
7.1. Interpretation of Results:
• Normal Range: Consult the laboratory’s established reference
intervals, typically between 15-20 seconds.
• Extended Reptilase Times may indicate dysfibrinogenemia or
hypo-fibrinogenemia.
7.2. Reporting Results:
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate results according to laboratory protocols.
• Notify the clinician if abnormal or critical results are detected.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Reptilase Time may be affected by the presence of heparin or
direct thrombin inhibitors in the sample.
• Prolonged incubation or improper plasma usage may result in
inaccurate clotting times.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Reptilase Reagent Insert for specific information
on storage, handling, and stability.
• CLSI Guidelines for Coagulation Testing.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature and laboratory-specific
protocols.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• All processes, calibrations, temperature logs, and results should
be accurately documented on the Temperature Monitoring Log
and other corresponding logs.
• Deviations from the procedure and corrective actions taken
should be recorded on the Corrective Action Log.
