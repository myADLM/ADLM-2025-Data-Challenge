Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Respiratory Panel,
PCR, Nasopharyngeal
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and responsibilities of laboratory staff in
performing Respiratory Panel PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
testing on nasopharyngeal specimens to ensure accurate, reliable,
and timely results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel performing
the Respiratory Panel PCR testing to adhere to the guidelines
defined in this procedure. All laboratory personnel are responsible for
notifying their supervisor of any issues that may interfere with
accurate test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Specimen type: Nasopharyngeal swab.
• Collection devices: Sterile viral transport media (VTM) or other
approved media as specified by the kit manufacturer.
• Transport and storage: Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C
for up to 72 hours. If delayed beyond 72 hours, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• Biosafety cabinet
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and filtered pipette tips
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tube strips or plates
• Respiratory Panel PCR kit (approved for use)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, face
shield/mask
5. REAGENTS
• Respiratory Panel PCR master mix
• Positive and negative controls
• RNA extraction buffer (if applicable)
• Nuclease-free water
6. PROCEDURE
A) PRE-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Specimen Receipt and Accessioning
◦ Verify specimen labeling and requisition form details.
◦ Record the specimen in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Store the specimen at 2-8°C until processing.
2. Specimen Preparation
◦ Thaw frozen specimens to room temperature if applicable.
◦ Vortex the specimen to mix thoroughly.
B) ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. RNA Extraction
◦ Perform RNA extraction using the designated extraction kit
or instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Follow appropriate biosafety procedures when handling
potentially infectious materials.
2. PCR Setup
◦ Thaw all reagents and master mix components on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix by combining all necessary
components as specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Add extracted RNA to the PCR master mix in designated
PCR tubes or plates.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
3. PCR Amplification
◦ Load the PCR tubes or plates onto the PCR thermocycler.
◦ Set the PCR thermocycler parameters according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for the Respiratory Panel PCR
kit.
◦ Start the PCR run and ensure that all steps are followed
according to protocol.
4. Result Detection and Data Analysis
◦ Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze the results using
the designated software.
◦ Interpret the amplification curves and outcome based on the
Respiratory Panel PCR kit guidelines.
◦ Record results in the LIS.
5. Quality Control
◦ Verify that positive and negative controls have performed
correctly.
◦ Document any discrepancies or issues encountered during
the run.
◦ Repeat testing if controls fail to meet the validation criteria.
C) POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Reporting Results
◦ Review and verify results for accuracy.
◦ Report results in accordance with laboratory policies and
regulatory requirements.
◦ Notify the relevant health care provider of any critical
findings as per established communication protocols.
2. Storage and Disposal
◦ Store positive specimens at -20°C or lower as per laboratory
storage policy.
◦ Dispose of all used materials and specimens in compliance
with biohazard waste disposal regulations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine quality control checks at designated frequencies.
• Document QC results and take corrective actions when
necessary.
• Participate in proficiency testing and external quality assessment
programs.
