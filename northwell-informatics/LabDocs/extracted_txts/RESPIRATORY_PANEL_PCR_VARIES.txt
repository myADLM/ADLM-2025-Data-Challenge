1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the processing and analysis of
respiratory panel samples using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction),
ensuring accurate and timely results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all respiratory panel samples received and
processed in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel responsible for the preparation, handling,
processing, and analysis of respiratory panel samples using PCR.
4. MATERIALS
• Respiratory panel PCR kit
• Biosafety cabinet
• PCR tubes and strips
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Thermocycler (PCR machine)
• Respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Upon receipt, ensure that all respiratory samples have been
properly labeled and are accompanied by the appropriate
requisition form.
2. Log in the samples in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and assign unique identifiers.
3. Ensure that samples are stored at 2-8°C if they are to be
processed within 24 hours, or at -70°C for longer storage.
4. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature before processing.
B. Reagent Preparation and PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Label PCR tubes or strips with corresponding sample
identifiers.
3. In a biosafety cabinet, aliquot the appropriate volume of master
mix into each PCR tube.
4. Add the extracted nucleic acid samples to the corresponding
PCR tubes. Ensure that each addition is precise to avoid cross-
contamination.
5. Include positive and negative controls in the PCR run.
C. Amplification
1. Load the PCR tubes/strips into the thermocycler.
2. Program the thermocycler according to the protocol specified
by the respiratory panel PCR kit instructions. Common settings
may include:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification cycles (e.g., 40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing and extension: 60°C for 1 minute
D. Post-PCR Analysis
1. After the amplification, remove PCR tubes from the
thermocycler.
2. Visualize the PCR products according to the kit instructions.
This may involve running the products on an agarose gel or
using a fluorescence-based detection method.
3. Document the results in the laboratory log.
E. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the band (or signal) patterns of the samples to the
positive and negative controls.
2. Record the presence or absence of specific respiratory
pathogens indicated by the panel.
3. Review the results to confirm their validity and completeness.
F. Quality Control
1. Ensure that positive and negative controls yield expected
results. If controls fail, troubleshoot the PCR run and repeat if
necessary.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the
thermocycler and other relevant equipment.
3. Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
G. Reporting Results
1. Enter validated results into the LIS.
2. Generate a report and verify accuracy before delivering results
to the physician. Ensure the report includes information about
detected respiratory pathogens. If no pathogens are detected,
report it as negative.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No respiratory pathogens detected.
• Positive: Detected respiratory pathogens as per specific kit
instructions.
7. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Always handle specimens and reagents in a biosafety cabinet.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to laboratory protocols.
