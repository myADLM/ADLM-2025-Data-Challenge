Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Respiratory
Pathogen Multiplex PCR Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of the
Respiratory Pathogen Multiplex PCR test, which identifies multiple
respiratory pathogens from a single specimen. The procedure
includes steps for assay setup, amplification, detection, and
interpretation of results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel will perform the
assay, monitor the results, take corrective actions if necessary, and
document the process according to this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Respiratory Pathogen Multiplex PCR: A Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) assay that detects multiple respiratory pathogens
simultaneously from a single specimen.
Target Pathogens: The panel includes but is not limited to Influenza
A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human
Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, and Parainfluenza
viruses.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 PREPARATION
3.1.1 Reagents and Supplies
• Respiratory Pathogen Multiplex PCR master mix
• Respiratory Pathogen Primer and Probe Mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control samples
• PCR-grade consumables (tubes, plates, pipette tips)
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3.1.2 Equipment and Instrumentation
• Real-time PCR thermocycler
• Biosafety cabinet
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
3.2 SAMPLE PREPARATION
3.2.1 Check all received specimens to ensure they are labeled
correctly with patient identification and collection dates. 3.2.2 Vortex
specimen tubes briefly to mix. 3.2.3 Aliquot an appropriate volume
(e.g., 200 µL) of the specimen into a PCR-compatible tube. 3.2.4
Extract nucleic acids from the aliquoted specimens using a validated
nucleic acid extraction method or automated system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3.3 PCR REACTION SETUP
3.3.1 Thaw all reagents and samples on ice. 3.3.2 Prepare the PCR
master mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 3.3.3 In a
clean PCR setup area, add the required volumes of nuclease-free
water, master mix, and respiratory pathogen primer/probe mix to a
PCR tube or 96-well plate. 3.3.4 Add DNA template (5 µL of extracted
nucleic acid) to each tube or well containing the PCR reaction mix.
3.3.5 Include positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
3.3.6 Seal the PCR tubes or plate with appropriate PCR caps or plate
seals. 3.3.7 Briefly centrifuge to ensure all reactants are at the
bottom of the tubes or wells.
3.4 PCR AMPLIFICATION AND DETECTION
3.4.1 Place the tubes/plate in the real-time PCR thermocycler. 3.4.2
Program the thermocycler according to the assay-specific thermal
cycling conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
• Followed by 40 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute 3.4.3 Monitor the
amplification reactions using the real-time PCR software.
3.5 INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
3.5.1 Analyze the amplification plots and determine Ct (cycle
threshold) values for each target pathogen. 3.5.2 Compare the Ct
values of samples to the positive and negative controls to determine
the presence or absence of each pathogen. 3.5.3 Interpret the results
as follows:
• Positive: Target pathogen detected (Ct value within valid range)
• Negative: Target pathogen not detected (Ct value above threshold
or not detected at all)
• Invalid: Internal control failed or inconclusive result; repeat testing
is required.
3.6 QUALITY CONTROL
3.6.1 Run positive and negative controls with each batch of PCR
reactions. 3.6.2 Document the performance of controls. Test results
are considered valid if the control reactions yield expected results.
3.6.3 Recalibrate and maintain instrumentation according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 3.6.4 Participate in an external quality
assurance program periodically.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
4.1 Review and verify the test results. 4.2 Record results in the
laboratory information system (LIS). 4.3 Notify the appropriate clinical
personnel of any critical results immediately. 4.4 Document all
observations, including any discrepancies and corrective actions, in
the laboratory records.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling respiratory specimens.
5.2 Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times. 5.3 Work in a biosafety cabinet when handling potentially
infectious materials. 5.4 Dispose of all waste materials according to
biohazard waste disposal guidelines.
