Standard Operating Procedure for RESPIRATORY PROFILE,
REGION 10, SOUTHWESTERN GRASSLANDS (OK, TX), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for Respiratory Profile in Region 10, Southwestern
Grasslands (OK, TX) using serum specimens. This protocol includes
instructions for handling, processing, and analyzing serum
specimens to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure and ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the test results.
All staff must be vigilant in identifying any issues that may affect the
test outcomes and report these issues to the supervisor immediately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in an SST (Serum Separator Tube).
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the
serum from the clot.
• Transfer the serum into a labeled secondary container for
analysis.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens should be refrigerated immediately after
separation and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, serum specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than SST.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• -20°C freezer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Analytical instruments specific to Respiratory Profile assay
Reagents:
• Commercially available assay kits specific to the analytes in the
respiratory profile
• Calibration and control materials as specified by the assay
manufacturer
Supplies:
• SST collection tubes
• Secondary serum storage tubes
• Labeling materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Calibrate and perform routine maintenance on all analytical
instruments prior to use.
• Ensure all reagents and control materials are at proper storage
conditions and within expiration dates.
4.2 Serum Sample Preparation:
• Retrieve serum samples from the refrigerator or freezer as
needed.
• Equilibrate frozen samples to room temperature and mix gently
before analysis.
• Aliquot samples if necessary to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.
4.3 Analyte Measurement:
• Respiratory Profile includes but is not limited to the following
analytes: IgE, allergen-specific IgE panels (e.g., grasses, weeds,
trees, molds, etc.).
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for each specific assay
used.
◦ Set up the assay plate or cartridges.
◦ Add calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples in
duplicate.
◦ Incubate and process plates/cartridges as directed.
◦ Read and record the results using the analytical instrument.
4.4 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient specimens.
• Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
• Document any deviation and corrective actions taken.
4.5 Result Verification and Reporting:
• Review test results for accuracy and consistency.
• Verify critical results according to laboratory policies.
• Enter results into the LIS and flag any abnormalities.
• Report results to the ordering physician or healthcare provider.
Include interpretive comments where applicable.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpretation of Results:
• IgE: < 100 IU/mL is considered within the normal range.
• Allergen-specific IgE panels: Refer to the manufacturer’s provided
reference ranges for each specific allergen.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's assay kit insert for specific limitations
related to each analyte.
• Potential interferences include hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric
specimens.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's package inserts and user manuals for the
respiratory profile assay kits.
• CLIA guidelines and laboratory best practices.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• All test procedures, calibrations, quality control results, and
patient results must be documented and retained in accordance
with laboratory policies and regulatory requirements.
9. APPENDIX
• Example forms for temperature monitoring logs, quality control
logs, and patient result worksheets.
Note: This document should be reviewed and approved by the
laboratory director or supervisory personnel before implementation.
Any updates to guidelines or procedures must be incorporated into
this SOP.
