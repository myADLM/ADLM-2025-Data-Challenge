Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Respiratory Profile
Region: Rocky Mountain (AZ [MT]; CO; ID [MT]; NM; UT [MT]; WY)
Sample Type: Serum
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the steps for the analytical phase of generating
results for Respiratory Profile tests performed on serum samples
obtained from Region 11, Rocky Mountain. This procedure ensures
the accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible
for performing Respiratory Profile tests on serum samples within the
Rocky Mountain region. It covers the handling, processing, and
analysis of these samples, as well as the documentation and
reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the tests
and documenting results.
• Supervisors: Responsible for oversight, ensuring compliance
with this SOP, and addressing any issues that arise during testing.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Respiratory Profile: A panel of tests to evaluate respiratory
function, usually including measurements such as pH, pCO2,
pO2, HCO3, and base excess (BE).
• Serum: The liquid portion of blood obtained after clotting and
centrifugation, free of cells and clotting factors.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Respiratory profile analyzers (e.g., blood gas analyzers)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Serum sample tubes (Red or SST)
• Quality Control (QC) materials
• Documentation logs (Temperature Monitoring Log, QC Log,
Patient Result Log)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Sample Reception and Identification:
◦ Verify that the serum sample is received within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Ensure that the sample container is properly labeled with
patient identification information.
2. Sample Inspection:
◦ Check for hemolysis. Hemolytic samples should not be used
for testing.
◦ Ensure that the sample volume is appropriate for the
respiratory profile test.
3. Sample Storage:
◦ If immediate analysis is not possible, store the serum
sample at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours.
B. Analyzer Preparation
1. Calibration:
◦ Ensure that the respiratory profile analyzer is calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform daily calibration checks and document results in the
Calibration Log.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC materials at the beginning of each shift and
document results. Acceptable limits are predefined by the
manufacturer.
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat until results are within range.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow refrigerated samples to come to room temperature
before analysis.
◦ Mix gently by inverting the tube several times.
2. Running the Test:
◦ Load the sample into the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Start the test sequence, ensuring that the correct patient ID
and test panel are selected.
3. Monitoring and Documentation:
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any error messages during the run.
◦ Once the test is complete, review the results for any flags or
issues.
◦ Document the results in the Patient Result Log with the
date, time, and initials of the technologist.
D. Post-Analytical Procedure
1. Result Verification:
◦ Verify results according to laboratory protocols, ensuring
that all values fall within the physiological ranges specific to
respiratory profiles.
◦ Any abnormal or critical results should be reviewed by a
supervisor and reported to the requesting healthcare
provider immediately.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Transmit the verified results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for integration into the patient’s electronic
medical record.
◦ Ensure that all manual entries match the analyzer outputs.
3. Sample Disposal:
◦ Dispose of serum samples in accordance with biohazard
waste protocols.
4. Quality Assurance:
◦ Review all logged entries for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Perform bi-weekly intralab comparisons to ensure inter-
instrument consistency.
7. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
• Ensure adherence to manufacturer’s instructions for the
respiratory profile analyzer.
• Use acceptable QC ranges specified by the manufacturer.
8. REFERENCE RANGES
• pH: 7.35–7.45
• pCO2: 35–45 mmHg
• pO2: 75–100 mmHg
• HCO3: 22–26 mmol/L
• Base Excess (BE): -2 to +2 mmol/L
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Regularly
review QC logs to ensure ongoing accuracy. Corrective actions must
be taken if discrepancies arise, with documentation of the corrective
process.
10. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE Ensure compliance with all
relevant lab safety protocols and regulatory requirements according
to CLIA guidelines.
11. RECORD KEEPING Maintain detailed records of all calibrations,
QC checks, and patient results for a minimum of 2 years, or as
required by regulatory bodies.
12. REVIEW AND UPDATES This SOP will be reviewed annually or
when there are significant changes in procedures or equipment.
Note: All technologists should be trained and competent in this SOP
before performing respiratory profile tests independently.
