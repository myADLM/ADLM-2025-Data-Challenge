Respiratory Profile Analysis
Protocol
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to ensure accurate and consistent
analytical procedures for generating results for the Respiratory Profile
on serum samples from Region 12 (Arid Southwest, specifically
Southern Arizona Desert and Southern California Desert).
Responsibility:
• All laboratory staff are responsible for following this protocol and
ensuring accurate result generation.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring adherence to the
protocol and addressing any deviations.
2. Definitions:
• Respiratory Profile: An assessment panel typically including
tests for pH, Partial Pressure of Oxygen (pO2), Partial Pressure of
Carbon Dioxide (pCO2), Bicarbonate (HCO3-), Base Excess
(BE), and Blood Oxygen Saturation (SaO2).
• Serum: The liquid component of blood obtained after clotting and
centrifugation.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer or equivalent
• Low concentration lithium heparin syringes or vacutainers
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage for samples
• Quality control material
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
4. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Collection: Serum should be obtained by venipuncture into a
serum separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot for 30
minutes, then centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
• Storage: If analysis is delayed, store serum at 2-8°C and analyze
within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis
• Specimens not properly labeled or without collection date/time
• Specimens subjected to improper storage
5. Procedure:
A. Equipment Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Daily Calibration:
◦ Ensure ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer is calibrated daily as per
manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Perform internal quality control (QC) at the beginning of
each shift using three levels of QC material provided by the
manufacturer.
◦ Document all calibration and QC results.
2. Validation of New Reagents or Lot Numbers:
◦ Perform patient sample comparisons per standard operating
procedures. Document and verify results.
B. Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify specimen labeling and integrity upon receipt.
◦ If refrigerated, bring the serum to room temperature before
analysis.
◦ Mix gently by inversion.
2. Analysis:
◦ Sample Loading: Place a serum sample into the ABL90
Blood Gas Analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Parameter Selection: Select Respiratory Profile
parameters: pH, pO2, pCO2, HCO3-, BE, SaO2.
◦ Start Analysis: Initiate the analysis as per the analyzer’s
operational manual.
◦ Monitor Results: Ensure no error codes or flags are
present during analysis. If encountered, resolve per
troubleshooting guidelines before reporting results.
C. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Should the QC results be outside acceptable limits,
troubleshoot equipment and reagents.
◦ Perform a minimum of three patient sample comparisons
with other functional analyzers if discrepancies persist.
◦ Document all QC activities and corrective actions taken.
2. Sample Integrity Issues:
◦ If hemolysis or other integrity issues are suspected,
centrifuge a small aliquot to confirm.
◦ Use the best judgment to decide on reporting the results or
requesting a new sample.
6. Reporting Results:
• Automatic Transmission: Results are automatically transmitted
to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) from the analyzer.
• Verification: Review and verify results before final release.
• Critical Values:
◦ Promptly report any critical values to the supervising
technologist or attending clinician.
◦ Document all critical value notifications as per laboratory
policy.
7. Method Limitations:
• Refer to ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer's user manual and reagent
inserts for specific limitations of each parameter.
8. References:
• ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer User Manual
• Manufacturer’s Quality Control and Calibration Guidelines
• Laboratory Safety and Standard Operating Procedures
9. Documentation:
• Maintain all logs including calibration, quality control, specimen
reception, and analytical records as specified by laboratory policy.
• Ensure compliance with CLIA and other regulatory standards for
laboratory practices.
10. Review and Updates:
• This protocol will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to ensure compliance with current best practices and regulatory
requirements.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the reliability and
accuracy of respiratory profile analyses, contributing to optimal
patient care and adherence to regulatory standards.
