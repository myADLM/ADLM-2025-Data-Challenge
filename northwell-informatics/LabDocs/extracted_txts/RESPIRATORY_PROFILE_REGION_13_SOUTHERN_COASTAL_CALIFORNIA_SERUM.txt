STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE
Title: Analytical Procedure for Generating Results for Respiratory
Profile, Region 13, Southern Coastal California, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the method for analyzing the Respiratory
Profile in serum samples from patients in Region 13, Southern
Coastal California. This document details the steps from receipt of
the specimen through the generation of results ensuring consistency,
accuracy, and reliability in laboratory practices.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of Respiratory Profile tests in serum samples at the lab.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Perform analysis according to the
established protocol and record results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Ensure all equipment is functioning
correctly and that quality control measures are adhered to.
• Supervisors: Review results and ensure compliance with SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Respiratory Profile: Tests to measure the levels of gases and
other relevant components in the blood that contribute to the
respiratory function.
• Serum: The clear liquid that can be separated from clotted blood
and is used for various diagnostic tests, including the Respiratory
Profile.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Serum must be collected in SST (Serum Separator Tube) or red-
top tubes.
• Collection tubes must be adequately filled to prevent hemolysis.
• Specimens must be labeled with patient's name, date of birth,
collection date, and time.
Specimen Stability:
• Store serum at 2-8°C if not analyzed within 2 hours.
• Serum stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in wrong tubes (non-SST or non-red-top).
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens received beyond stability time.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instruments compliant with CLIA regulations.
• Calibrators and controls as per manufacturer recommendations.
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, centrifuge, etc.).
7. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Specimen Reception:
◦ Verify patient information on the specimen with the
requisition form.
◦ Document receipt date and time in the laboratory logbook.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Allow SST or red-top tube specimens to clot for at least 30
minutes before centrifugation.
◦ Centrifuge at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Ensure that the analyzer is calibrated according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) to assure
instrument performance. Accept or reject runs based on standard
QC procedures.
2. Respiratory Profile Testing:
• Place prepared serum sample on the analyzer.
• The following components may be measured:
◦ pH
◦ pO2 (partial pressure of oxygen)
◦ pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide)
◦ HCO3 (bicarbonate)
◦ BE (base excess)
◦ Oxygen saturation (SaO2)
• Follow the manufacturer-specific instructions for the analyzer
operation.
• Document the sample ID and assay start time.
3. Reviewing Results:
• Verify the results against reference ranges:
◦ pH: 7.35 - 7.45
◦ pO2: 75 - 100 mmHg
◦ pCO2: 35 - 45 mmHg
◦ HCO3: 22 - 28 mEq/L
◦ BE: ±2 mEq/L
◦ SaO2: 95 - 100%
• Check for any flags or warnings indicated by the analyzer.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If any quality control samples fall outside acceptable limits:
◦ Recalibrate the instrument.
◦ Re-run the QC samples.
◦ Notify the supervisor if issues persist.
2. If patient results show critical values or discrepancies:
◦ Repeat the analysis on a new aliquot of the same specimen.
◦ If discrepancies persist, prepare a fresh sample and re-run.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly.
• Mark any critical or unusual findings for supervisory review before
final validation.
• Ensure that all results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified
technologist.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Maintain records of calibrations, quality control tests, and
instrument maintenance logs.
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly intra-laboratory reliability tests
using control samples.
• Validate new reagent lots by comparing patient results from old
and new lots.
11. RECORD KEEPING
• Document sample processing, analytical details, and results in
logbooks or LIS.
• Retain records for the specific retention period as per laboratory
policy.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s user manual and product inserts for analytical
instruments.
• Laboratory’s Quality Control and Assurance protocols.
