Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for Generating Results for Respiratory
Profile, Region 14, Central California, Serum Department: Clinical
Chemistry Date Effective: _______ Date Revised: _______
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedures for generating
results for the Respiratory Profile in serum samples from Region 14,
Central California. This includes processing serum samples, running
the appropriate assays, performing quality control, and reporting
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the assay, quality
control, and documentation according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and addressing any issues that may impact the quality of the test
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) and allowed to
clot at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and a
maximum of 90 minutes.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in non-serum separator tubes.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens received 8 hours after collection not properly
refrigerated.
Specimen Storage:
• Serum samples can be stored up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For extended storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Pipettes
• Reagent Kits specific to the respiratory profile assays
• Analyzers as specified by the manufacturer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Siemens Dimension)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge serum separator tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes.
2. Inspect the sample for any signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus. Reject unacceptable samples and request a new
specimen.
3. Using a pipette, transfer the serum to labeled aliquot tubes.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare the analyzer by performing routine maintenance
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load reagent kits and calibrate the instrument following the
manufacturer's protocols.
3. Load serum aliquots into the designated sample tray.
4. Process samples according to the specific assay procedures in
the respiratory profile kit.
5. Verify that the necessary quality control measures are in place
and log all relevant data.
◦ Include internal control samples at every 20 sample interval.
◦ Ensure analyzer performs automatic recalibration according
to schedule.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality control samples to evaluate assay
performance:
◦ Use manufacturer's control material at relevant levels (low,
medium, high).
2. Document all controls and ensure they are within established
control limits.
3. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer's specifications and retest if
necessary.
D) Reporting Results:
1. After processing, results will be verified for integrity and
accuracy.
2. Review results for any flags or errors generated by the
analyzer.
3. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Confirm that results are accurately reported for each patient,
including any necessary comments on sample quality (e.g.,
hemolysis, lipemia).
5. Notify the ordering clinician of any critical results in compliance
with laboratory policy.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals are dependent on assay manufacturer and
patient's demographic region. Refer to specific manufacturer's
guidelines and regional reference data for interpretation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer's assay-specific insert for detailed limitations of
individual assays. Common limitations include:
• Interference from hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Stability limits of specimens.
• Specific assay sensitivity and specificity.
