Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results - RESPIRATORY PROFILE, REGION 15,
INTERMOUNTAIN WEST (SOUTHERN ID, NV), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Respiratory Profile using serum
samples in Region 15 (Southern Idaho and Nevada), Intermountain
West. This will ensure accurate, precise, and reproducible test
results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• All laboratory personnel must adhere to the quality control and
safety guidelines prescribed in this document.
• Supervisors are responsible for the proper training of personnel
and for monitoring the adherence to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Sample: 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with significant hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled with the patient’s
identification.
◦ Specimens received without proper documentation (e.g.,
missing requisition or incomplete information).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens Dimension)
• Calibrators and Controls specific to the Respiratory Profile
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Barcoded labels
• Quality Control materials
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Verify specimen integrity and labeling upon receipt.
2. Centrifuge the serum separator tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
if required by the instrument's specifications.
3. Aliquot serum if necessary, ensuring proper labeling.
B. Analytical Steps:
1. Equipment Preparation: a. Daily Start-Up: i. Turn on the
analyzer and perform necessary system checks. ii. Ensure
calibration is up-to-date. iii. Verify availability of reagents and
supplies required for the day’s testing. b. Temperature Check: i.
Verify that the instrument operating temperature lies within the
manufacturer's specified range. ii. Log the temperature on the
appropriate Temperature Monitoring Log.
2. Assay Performance: a. Load the specimens on the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions. b. Select the
programmed protocol for the Respiratory Profile. c. Ensure that
all calibrators and controls are run before patient samples. d.
Process each serum sample, ensuring to scan barcoded labels
if applicable.
C. Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Result Verification: a. Review each result for accuracy and
consistency. b. Repeat any tests flagged by the instrument for
re-run or value verification. c. Compare results with quality
control materials to ensure they fall within the acceptable range.
2. Reporting: a. Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). b. Review and validate all results before
releasing reports. c. Notify the requesting physician of any
critical results following the laboratory's critical result policy.
3. Documentation: a. Record any deviations, corrective actions, or
instrument errors. b. Log quality control results in the QC log.
4. Cleanup and Shutdown: a. Discard all used reagent containers
and specimen materials according to biohazard disposal
guidelines. b. Perform daily maintenance and shutdown
procedures for the instrument.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal QC materials (both high and low controls) at the
beginning of each shift and after every 50 samples.
• Document and review QC results according to laboratory policy.
• Troubleshoot and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
patient testing.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals will be provided by the manufacturer or
established by the laboratory, and must be available in the LIS for
result comparison.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the instrument's and reagent's package inserts for any
limitations related to the analyzer's performance and specific reagent
reactions. This includes potential interference from hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus, as well as cross-reactivity or other analytical
interferences.

1. REVISION HISTORY
Record any changes made to this SOP, including updates to
procedures, changes in equipment, or modifications to reference
ranges.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for the Respiratory Profile in SERUM
for Region 15, Intermountain West (Southern ID, NV).
