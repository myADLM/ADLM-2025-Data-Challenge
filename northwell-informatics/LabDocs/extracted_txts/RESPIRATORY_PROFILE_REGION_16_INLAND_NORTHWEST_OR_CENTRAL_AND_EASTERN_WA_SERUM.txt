Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Respiratory Profile
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the analysis and
interpretation of Respiratory Profile tests in Region 16, Inland
Northwest (OR, Central and Eastern WA) for serum specimens in the
laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, reporting results accurately, and ensuring the quality control
measures are applied consistently to maintain the integrity of the
results. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues that
may affect the test results and report them to a supervisor.
2. DEFINITION
The Respiratory Profile comprises a series of tests designed to
assess the respiratory system's functionality and includes, but is not
limited to: arterial blood gases (ABGs), serum electrolytes, and
specific biomarkers indicative of respiratory function.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum sample collected using serum separator tube (SST) or
plain red-top tube.
• Specimen should be centrifuged and separated as soon as
possible if not using an SST.
• Adequately filled tube, avoiding hemolysis and contamination.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA,
citrate, or fluoride.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis.
• Specimens that have been subjected to improper handling,
leading to degradation.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytic equipment (e.g., gas analyzers, electrolyte analyzers)
• Reagents specific to the tests being conducted (as per
manufacturer’s guidelines)
• Quality control materials
• Protective gear and appropriate containers for specimen handling
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preliminary Steps:
1. Verify the specimen and patient information.
2. Ensure specimens meet acceptable criteria.
3. Record the sample receipt in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
B) Analyzing Respiratory Profile:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all instruments and reagents are ready for use and
properly calibrated.
◦ Execute daily quality control checks on the equipment
before conducting any patient tests. Record results in the
QC log.
2. Test Execution:
◦ For arterial blood gases (ABGs):
▪ Perform testing on an arterial blood gas analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Document results, including pH, pCO2, pO2, HCO3, BE,
and any other relevant parameters.
◦ For serum electrolytes (e.g., Na, K, Cl, Ca, Mg):
▪ Perform analysis using the designated electrolyte
analyzer following the equipment’s instructions.
◦ For other biomarkers (e.g., lactate, CRP):
▪ Run the assays using suitable methodologies such as
immunoassays and ensure to follow all specific reaction
times and conditions.
3. Data Review:
◦ Compare results to predefined reference ranges.
◦ Investigate and resolve any abnormalities noted during
patient sample analysis by reviewing instrument error logs
and taking corrective actions as needed.
C) Result Reporting:
• Enter the verified results into the LIS. Ensure results reflect
appropriate units and refer to reference intervals specific to the
geographic region (Region 16, Inland Northwest).
• For critical values, follow the critical results reporting policy
promptly and document the communication according to the
protocol.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Utilize control materials daily to ensure the precision and
accuracy of test results:
◦ Refer to specific guidelines for the control range
acceptance.
2. Implement bi-weekly and monthly QC procedures:
◦ Perform scheduled interlaboratory comparisons.
◦ Validate new lots of reagents and instrumental changes by
carrying out correlation studies.
3. Document and review all QC data:
◦ Investigate out-of-range controls before reporting patient
results.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Comprehensive reference intervals specific to the parameters
involved in the Respiratory Profile for Region 16 shall be
maintained and reviewed periodically.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Always refer to equipment-specific instructions for any limitations
of the individual tests.
• Ensure the serum samples are free from interfering substances
that might affect the test outcomes.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Adhere to all safety protocols, including the use of PPE, biosafety
measures, and disposal of biohazard waste.
• Address any laboratory safety concerns to the relevant safety
officer.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain accurate records of all procedures, QC results, and
corrective actions taken.
• Ensure all documentation is accessible for audits and reviews by
relevant regulatory bodies.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s operation manuals for analytical instruments.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Region-specific regulatory and compliance documents.
