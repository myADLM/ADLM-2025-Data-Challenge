Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Respiratory Profile, Region 17, Pacific
Northwest (Northwestern CA, Western OR, WA), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the analytical procedures for
generating results for the Respiratory Profile in the designated
Region 17, which comprises Northwestern California, Western
Oregon, and Washington. This SOP will ensure accurate and
consistent serum testing results while maintaining compliance with
regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for following this SOP and
ensuring that results are accurate, precise, and to be generated in a
timely manner. Supervisory staff are responsible for training,
monitoring, and verifying compliance with this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Respiratory Profile refers to a series of tests designed to evaluate a
patient's respiratory function by analyzing specific serum biomarkers
relevant in the Region 17 demographic.
1. SPECIMEN
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Specimen Collection: Peripheral venipuncture, typically using a
serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Stability: Serum samples must be tested within 48
hours of collection. If delay in analysis is anticipated, serum must
be refrigerated at 2-8°C, otherwise frozen at -20°C for up to one
month.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Ortho Vitros 4600 or
equivalent)
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibrated traceable thermometers
• Reagents specific for Respiratory profile assays
• Quality control materials (negative, low, normal, high)
1. PROCEDURE
A.) Specimen Preparation
1. Before analysis, ensure serum specimens are at room
temperature (18-25°C).
2. Centrifuge SST at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate serum
from clot.
3. Carefully transfer the serum supernatant into a labeled aliquot
tube if not using the SST directly in the analyzer.
B.) Equipment Preparation
1. Calibrate the Chemistry Analyzer according to the
manufacturer's guidelines before beginning the assay. Perform
any required maintenance or initial QC checks.
2. Ensure all reagents and QC materials are within their expiration
date and stored appropriately as per manufacturers’
specifications.
3. Equilibrate reagents and controls to room temperature where
indicated before use.
C.) Analytical Procedure
1. Loading the Analyzer
◦ Load the prepared serum samples and reagents into the
designated positions on the analyzer.
◦ Include appropriate calibration and control materials to be
run alongside patient serum samples.
2. Starting the Assay
◦ Select the appropriate respiratory profile application on the
analyzer's menu.
◦ Start the analytical run.
3. Monitoring the Run
◦ Continuously monitor the run for any flags or errors. If any
arise, halt the run and troubleshoot using the analyzer’s
manual and/or SOP-specific troubleshooting guide.
D.) Quality Control
• Include at least two levels of QC materials (e.g., low, high) with
each batch of patient samples analyzed.
• Compare the results of the QC materials against predefined
acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC falls outside acceptable limits, do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved and QC runs within
specifications.
• Record QC results in the laboratory’s QC log as per site-specific
guidelines.
E.) Reporting Results
1. Review the data generated by the analyzer for accuracy and
reliability.
2. Validate results by ensuring QC values fall within acceptable
limits.
3. Transmit results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Critical values must be communicated immediately to the
appropriate clinical staff following established reporting
protocols.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
These values must be established according to the guidelines
provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
and must be validated for the specific population of the Region 17.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Specimen issues: Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus
should be flagged and noted, as they can interfere with certain
assays.
• Equipment malfunctions: If analyzer malfunctions, revert to
backup equipment if available or contact the manufacturer for
support.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Always wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, face protection if
needed) when handling biological specimens.
• Dispose of biohazard waste in accordance with the lab's safety
guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs for daily temperature records for all relevant
equipment.
• Log calibration, maintenance, and quality control activities.
• Retain all records for the legally required period.
1. REFERENCES
• Instrument specific operator’s manual.
• Manufacturer’s reagent inserts.
• CLSI guidelines.
• Laboratory-specific quality assurance policies.
Ensure compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA).
