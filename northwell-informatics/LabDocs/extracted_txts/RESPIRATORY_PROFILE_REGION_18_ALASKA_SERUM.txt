Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Respiratory Profile, Region 18, Alaska, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the steps required to analyze and report results for
the Respiratory Profile using serum specimens. The procedure
ensures the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure that the
procedure is followed accurately and to report any deviations or
issues to the laboratory supervisor.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzers specific to respiratory profile tests (e.g., Blood gas
analyzers, immunoassay analyzers)
• Calibrators and quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Serum tubes (Red top/SST)
• Centrifuge
• Appropriate documentation logs
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimen:
• Serum from a 5 mL blood sample collected in a Red top or SST
tube.
• Specimen should be properly labeled with patient identification,
date, and time of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Serum collected in inappropriate tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or have insufficient
volume.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis
1. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens.
2. Verify patient information on the specimen against the
laboratory requisition form.
3. Centrifuge serum tubes at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate serum from blood cells.
4. Confirm that the serum is clear. Note any signs of hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus, and consult with the supervisor if necessary.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform daily calibration of the analyzers as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run three levels of quality control (QC) materials (low, medium,
high) prior to patient sample testing. Record results in the QC
log.
3. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's guidelines and repeat QC
testing. Do not proceed with patient sample analysis until QC
results are within acceptable ranges.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Select the appropriate respiratory profile assay on the analyzer.
2. Pipette required volume of serum (as specified in the assay
protocol) into analyzer sample cups or cartridges.
3. Load samples into the analyzer and initiate the run.
4. Monitor the analyzer for any flags or errors that may occur
during the run. Address any issues according to the analyzer's
troubleshooting guide.
D. Post-Analytical Procedure
1. Once the run is complete, review and verify results. Pay close
attention to any abnormal or critical values.
2. Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all results for accuracy and consistency.
2. Enter results into the LIS, and ensure they are assigned
correctly to the respective patient records.
3. Flag and immediately communicate any critical results to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider, following the
laboratory's critical result notification policy.
4. Print results and attach to patient records. Ensure all
documentation is complete, including date, time, and identity of
technologist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform and document daily, bi-weekly, and monthly QC checks
as outlined in the Quality Control section.
2. Review QC logs regularly to identify trends or recurrent issues.
3. Maintain calibration records and ensure all equipment is
serviced according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
4. Participate in proficiency testing programs and inter-laboratory
comparisons as required.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. In case of equipment malfunction or unexpected results, follow
the trouble shooting procedures provided by the equipment
manufacturer.
2. If errors cannot be resolved internally, consult with a supervisor
and contact technical support. Document all troubleshooting
steps and decisions.
9. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer’s instructions and manuals for analyzers used in
respiratory profile testing.
2. Internal laboratory quality control and troubleshooting
guidelines.
3. CLSI guidelines and standards for respiratory profile testing.
10. ATTACHMENTS

11. REVIEW & APPROVAL
This SOP is reviewed annually or as needed. All changes must be
documented and approved by the laboratory supervisor and the
medical director.
