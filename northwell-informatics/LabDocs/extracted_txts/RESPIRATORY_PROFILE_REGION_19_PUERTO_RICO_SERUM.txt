RESPIRATORY PROFILE ANALYSIS SOP
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Respiratory Profile from serum specimens
collected in Region 19, Puerto Rico. The goal is to ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely results for patient diagnosis and treatment.
2. DEFINITIONS
Respiratory Profile: A set of tests analyzing various biomarkers
related to respiratory function and disease states. Serum Specimen:
Blood sample from which the cellular components have been
removed, typically through centrifugation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Adhering to the procedures outlined in this SOP
• Ensuring specimen integrity
• Conducting analyses according to standard laboratory practices
• Reporting and documenting results accurately
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum (collected in SST or red stopper tube)
Specimen Volume: Minimum of 3 mL Stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C): 1 month Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than SST or red
stopper
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Analyzer for respiratory profile (e.g., Roche Cobas c 702)
• Thermometer – for temperature monitoring
• Refrigerators and freezers for specimen storage
Reagents:
• Calibration fluids and controls specific to each test
• Serum control materials with known concentrations
Supplies:
• SST or red stopper tubes
• Aliquot tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves, lab coat, and goggles
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling
1. Receiving Specimens:
◦ Check specimen containers for correct labeling (patient
details, collection date/time)
◦ Inspect for integrity and accept or reject based on visual
inspection
2. Preparation:
◦ Allow specimens to clot completely if freshly collected
◦ Centrifuge SST tubes at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate serum
◦ Transfer serum to aliquot tubes for analysis, if needed
B) Analytical Process
1. Temperature Monitoring:
◦ Ensure all equipment is within specified temperature ranges
(refer to SOP on Temperature Monitoring)
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration checks on analyzers before starting
analysis
◦ Use calibration fluids as per manufacturer instructions
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run controls at the beginning of each shift or batch analysis
◦ Refer to site-specific guidelines for acceptable control limits
4. Analyzing Specimens:
◦ Load serum specimens into the analyzer
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions for operating the analyzer
◦ Record all necessary data (e.g., patient ID, analyzer ID,
date, time)
C) Troubleshooting
1. If an analyzer error occurs:
◦ Refer to manufacturer instructions for error codes
◦ Consult supervisor for unresolved issues
◦ Document the issue and steps taken to resolve it
2. If specimen integrity issues arise:
◦ Inspect for hemolysis or contamination
◦ Centrifuge a small aliquot if necessary
◦ Use best judgment in reporting or rejecting results
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verification:
◦ Review and verify results against control ranges
◦ Note any discrepancies or abnormal values
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System)
◦ Document any critical or abnormal results
◦ Use specified reporting guidelines for our laboratory
3. Communication:
◦ Notify ordering physicians of critical values immediately,
following proper documentation protocols
◦ Use repeat critical values guidelines for documentation
8. QUALITY MANAGEMENT
1. Inter-laboratory Comparison:
◦ Monthly correlation of 3 patient samples between site
analyzers to ensure consistency
2. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Automatic QC analysis by analyzers as per schedule
◦ Follow up on failed QC and perform necessary corrections
