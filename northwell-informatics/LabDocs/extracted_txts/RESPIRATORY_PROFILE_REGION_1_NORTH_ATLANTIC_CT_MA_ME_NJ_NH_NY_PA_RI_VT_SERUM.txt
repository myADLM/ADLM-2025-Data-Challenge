STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Respiratory Profile, Region 1, North
Atlantic (CT, MA, ME, NJ, NH, NY, PA, RI, VT), Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedures for analyzing serum samples
collected for the Respiratory Profile test in the Region 1, North
Atlantic. The procedures focus on ensuring accuracy and precision in
the handling, processing, and analyzing of serum samples to
generate valid and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel who handle, process, or analyze respiratory
profile samples are required to adhere to this SOP. Supervisors must
ensure that staff are trained and comply with laboratory standards.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Quality Control (QC) materials
• Reagents specific for the Respiratory Profile tests
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume Required: A minimum of 2 mL of serum
• Stability:
◦ Serum stored at 2-8°C is stable for up to 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or below.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Check Specimen Integrity: Ensure that serum samples are
free from hemolysis, lipemia, and clots.
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the SST tubes at 2000-3000 x g for
10 minutes to separate the serum.
3. Aliquoting: Pipette the required volume of serum into clean,
appropriately labeled aliquot tubes.
B) Analyzing the Serum Sample
1. Pre-Run Instrument Setup:
◦ Check and prepare the automated chemistry analyzer as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Verify calibration by running calibration samples. Confirm if
all analytes are within acceptable ranges.
◦ Load reagents specified for the respiratory profile on the
analyzer.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Place aliquoted serum samples in the designated sample
rack.
◦ Ensure sample identifiers match the test requisition forms.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Select the Respiratory Profile test protocol from the
analyzer’s software menu.
◦ Start the run according to the manufacturer’s operational
procedures.
C) Quality Control
1. Internal QC:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift,
after any major maintenance, or reagent change.
◦ Use multi-level commercially available control materials
specific for the respiratory profile.
◦ Document QC results, ensuring they fall within the
permissible limits set by the laboratory.
2. Investigation of Quality Control Failures:
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, pause sample
analysis.
◦ Investigate the cause, which may include re-running QC
samples, recalibration, and equipment checks.
◦ Document corrective actions taken and re-run patient
samples if necessary.
D) Post-Run Procedures
1. Data Verification:
◦ Review the results printed by the analyzer for flags
indicating potential errors.
◦ Investigate flagged results and re-run the tests if necessary,
following troubleshooting and repeat testing guidelines.
2. Result Entry:
◦ Verify the integrity and accuracy of the test results before
entering them into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Cross-check the patient’s identifiers with the requisition
form.
3. Sending Results:
◦ Once verified, results are electronically transmitted to the
LIS.
◦ Ensure the results are available for clinician review within
the specified turnaround time.
E) Maintenance and Troubleshooting
1. Routine Maintenance:
◦ Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance tasks on
the analyzer as specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Record all maintenance activities in the equipment log.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for any
issues encountered during the analysis.
◦ Document all troubleshooting activities and resolutions.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure adherence to handling and storage requirements to
prevent sample degradation.
• Interference from hemolysis, lipemia or icterus must be evaluated
and documented.
• Review and document any limitations specified in the test kit
inserts.
