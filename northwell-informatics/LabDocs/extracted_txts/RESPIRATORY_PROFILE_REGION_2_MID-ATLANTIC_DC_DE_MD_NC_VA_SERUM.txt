Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Respiratory Profile in Region 2, Mid-Atlantic
(DC, DE, MD, NC, VA) Using Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the accurate
and timely analysis of serum samples for the respiratory profile,
ensuring that results are consistent, reliable, and of high quality. This
SOP covers the analysis phase, detailing the steps from the
preparation of reagents and equipment to the generation of test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
the analysis according to this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the workflow and
ensuring that all steps are followed correctly.
1. DEFINITION
Respiratory profile analysis includes, but is not limited to, the
measurement of the following analytes in the serum using specified
analytical instruments:
• pH
• pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide)
• pO2 (partial pressure of oxygen)
• HCO3 (bicarbonate)
• TCO2 (total carbon dioxide)
• SpO2 (oxygen saturation)
• Lactate
• Electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure that all reagents and supplies required for the analysis are
prepared and available.
• Check calibration and maintenance logs of analyzers to ensure
they are within acceptable limits.
• Perform daily quality control (QC) before analyzing patient
samples.
Specimen Handling:
• Receive and verify serum specimens.
• Ensure all samples are clearly labeled with patient identification,
date, and time of collection.
• Centrifuge samples if necessary to separate serum from cellular
components.
Equipment:
• Analyze serum samples using automated blood gas analyzers
calibrated for serum measurements.
• Utilize backup analyzers if the primary equipment fails.
Test Procedure:
1. Pre-Analytical:
◦ Confirm sample integrity (free from hemolysis, clots, and
adequate volume).
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C prior to analysis.
2. Analytical:
◦ Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Perform a system check to ensure the analyzer is working
correctly and record the results.
◦ Analyze quality control samples and ensure results are
within the acceptable range.
▪ If QC fails, recalibrate the analyzer and rerun QC before
analyzing patient samples.
◦ Load patient serum samples onto the analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument instructions for sample aspiration and
processing.
◦ Monitor the analyzer to ensure there are no error messages
or alarms during the analysis.
3. Post-Analytical:
◦ Review the results for each analyte.
◦ Cross-check results against established reference intervals.
◦ Document any deviations or anomalies and take appropriate
corrective actions.
◦ Ensure that all results are transferred to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) accurately.
◦ Verify and release results in the LIS following verification
procedures.
Reporting Results:
• Any critical results should be communicated immediately to the
appropriate medical personnel following laboratory protocol.
• Ensure that all results are properly documented, both
electronically and on required log sheets.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform preventive maintenance on analyzers as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Document all maintenance activities.
• Run internal quality controls with each batch of samples.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs regularly to
ensure calibration and performance accuracy.
• Calibrate analyzers at the start of each shift or batch runs
depending on usage.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure all reagents and consumables are within the expiry date.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis may give erroneous results for
certain analytes and should be flagged or rejected.
