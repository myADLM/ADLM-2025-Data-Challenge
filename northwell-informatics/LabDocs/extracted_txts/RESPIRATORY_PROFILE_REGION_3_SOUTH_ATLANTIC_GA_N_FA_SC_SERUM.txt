Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Respiratory Profile, Region 3, South Atlantic (GA, N.FA, SC),
Serum
1. Purpose
To provide an accurate, precise, and reliable procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for the respiratory profile in
serum samples from Region 3, South Atlantic (GA, N.FA, SC).
1. Specimen Collection and Handling
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Standard venipuncture collection in a serum separator tube
(SST)
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature
◦ Centrifuge the SST for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 x g to
separate serum
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens
◦ Insufficient sample volume
◦ Specimens arriving more than 72 hours post-collection without
refrigeration
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated analyzer validated for respiratory profile tests (e.g.,
blood gas system)
• Pre-calibrated pipettes and tips
• Quality control (QC) material for the corresponding respiratory
profile tests
• Universal containers with airtight caps for serum sample storage
1. Analytical Procedure
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
• Verify that the specimen meets acceptable criteria
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing will be delayed (ensure the
specimens are brought to room temperature before analysis)
• Homogenize serum samples by gentle inversion before pipetting
B. Setting Up the Analyzer
• Ensure the analyzer is properly calibrated and that the QC
materials are run and within acceptable limits
• Confirm that all reagents and supplies are within their expiration
dates and stored according to manufacturer specifications
• Perform any routine maintenance procedures on the analyzer
prior to testing
C. Test Procedure
• Open analyzer software and follow the prompt to perform a
respiratory profile, including parameters like pH, pCO2, pO2,
HCO3, Base Excess, etc.
• Pipette the required volume of the serum into the sample holder
or vial. Ensure there is no air bubble in the pipetted serum, which
may affect the results.
• Start the analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The system will automatically calibrate if needed and then
analyze the sample.
D. Recording and Handling Results
• Print or electronically capture the results from the analyzer once
the test is completed
• Review the results, ensuring that all values fall within the plausible
physiological range
• Should there be any symbols or flagged results, investigate
according to the troubleshooting guidelines provided in the
analyzer's manual
1. Quality Control and Assurance
• Run internal QC checks as per the laboratory’s QC schedules
(daily, bi-weekly, or as needed)
• Compare QC results with established ranges. Record and
address any deviations or outliers immediately.
• Participate in an external quality assurance program if available
for additional benchmarking
• Document all QC activities in the QC log
1. Result Verification and Reporting
• Verify results according to laboratory protocol
• Confirm that critical values are communicated as per the
laboratory’s critical results communication policy
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accuracy and linkage to the correct patient records
• Report findings in accordance with the standard reporting
guidelines
1. Sample Integrity and Unacceptable Specimens
• If sample integrity is doubtful (e.g., suspected hemolysis,
improper storage), re-centrifuge a small aliquot and inspect for
issues.
• Document any sample issues and notify sample origin (e.g.,
collection site). Samples that are not acceptable should be
reported with comments indicating reasons for rejection.
1. Safety and Compliance
• Ensure all staff are trained on these procedures and any relevant
updates until October 2023
• Adhere to all biosafety and laboratory safety regulations, including
the proper disposal of biological waste
