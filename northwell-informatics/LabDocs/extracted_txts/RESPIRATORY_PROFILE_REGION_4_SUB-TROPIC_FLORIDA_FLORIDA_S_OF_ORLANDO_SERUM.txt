STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
RESPIRATORY PROFILE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Respiratory Profile in Region 4,
Sub-Tropic Florida (Florida south of Orlando) from serum specimens.
This SOP ensures accurate and consistent results by providing step-
by-step instructions on the handling, processing, and analysis of
serum samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined and documenting all results and
observations.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any deviations,
anomalies, or concerns to the supervising technologist
immediately.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Respiratory Profile: A set of analytes relevant to respiratory
function and health, typically including blood gases, bicarbonate
(HCO3), base excess (BE), pH, carbon dioxide (pCO2), and
oxygen (pO2) levels.
• Internal Quality Control: Regular checks using control materials
to ensure the precision and accuracy of the analytical instruments
and procedures.
• Serum: The liquid portion of blood obtained after coagulation and
centrifugation, free of cells.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Handling
1. Specimen Collection:
◦ Serum must be collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or
a plain red-top tube.
◦ After collection, the sample should be allowed to coagulate
at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ The specimen must then be centrifuged at 1200-1500g for
10-15 minutes.
2. Specimen Stability:
◦ After centrifugation, the serum should be immediately
transferred to a clean tube if not using an SST.
◦ Serum is stable for testing up to 6 hours if kept at room
temperature (15-25°C).
◦ For extended storage, serum can be kept at 2-8°C for up to
48 hours or frozen at -20°C for longer durations.
3. Specimen Identification:
◦ Ensure all specimens are labeled with the patient’s full
name, date of birth, collection date, and time.
◦ Specimens with illegible or missing labels should be
rejected and new samples requested.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• pH/Blood Gas Analyzer (conditionally present in the lab where
applicable)
• Electrolyte Analyzer
• Quality control materials for blood gases
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
C. Analysis Procedure
1. Blood Gas Analysis:
◦ Allow serum to reach testing temperature. If previously
refrigerated, bring to room temperature.
◦ Mix the serum gently before analysis to ensure
homogeneity.
◦ Using the blood gas analyzer, perform the following tests:
▪ pH
▪ pCO2
▪ pO2
▪ HCO3 (bicarbonate)
▪ BE (base excess)
2. Instrument Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform daily calibration checks as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Run internal quality controls as follows:
▪ High, normal, and low control levels once per shift or
every 12 hours.
▪ Document results and take corrective actions if controls
fall outside acceptable ranges.
3. Result Review and Verification:
◦ Results from the blood gas analyzer are automatically
transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review all results for critical values or discrepancies.
◦ Verify and document results ensuring the patient's details
match the specimen and requisition form.
D. Reporting and Documentation
• All test results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before final reporting.
• Critical values should be flagged and communicated to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider immediately.
• Document any troubleshooting, deviations, and corrective actions
taken during the analysis in the instrument maintenance log.
E. Quality Control and Assurance
• Intralab Quality Control:
◦ Weekly, a sample from the blood gas analyzer should be split
and run on multiple instruments for comparison.
◦ Monthly, perform cross-comparison with an external quality
control program if available.
◦ Review and document control results, taking corrective actions
as needed.
• External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs periodically
to ensure laboratory performance aligns with industry
standards.
