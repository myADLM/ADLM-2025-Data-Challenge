STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
RESPIRATORY PROFILE - REGION 5, OHIO VALLEY (IN, KY, OH,
TN, WV), SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase in the generation of results
for the Respiratory Profile for Region 5 (Ohio Valley) including
Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia using
serum specimens. This includes the steps for preparation,
analysis, and reporting of results ensuring accuracy and
consistency in compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility: Laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP and ensuring that all results are
accurate and reported in a timely manner.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum specimen collected by venipuncture in a red-top tube or an
SST (serum separator tube) with clot activator.
• Serum should be separated from cells within two hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with hemolysis or clot formation.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than red-top or SST.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient information,
collection date/time, or requisition details.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (specify model and manufacturer)
• Commercial assay kits specific for the respiratory profile (specify
manufacturer and reagent lot number)
• Quality control materials (specify manufacturer and levels)
Storage Requirements:
• All reagents and control materials should be stored at 2-8°C as
recommended by the manufacturer and used before the
expiration date.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Specimen
1. Verify specimen integrity and proper labeling (ensure no
hemolysis, clot, or contamination).
2. Centrifuge sample to separate serum if not already done.
3. Aliquot serum into appropriate labeled tubes for analysis.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Calibrate the automated chemistry analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare the reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Perform daily quality control checks using low, normal, and high
control materials.
4. Load serum samples and reagents into the analyzer.
5. Run the respiratory profile assays according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
6. Monitor assay performance, flags, and alerts during the
analytical process.
C. Result Verification and Reporting
1. Review generated results ensuring no errors, discrepancies, or
flags indicating potential issues.
2. If discrepancies are found, repeat the analysis and troubleshoot
using manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Verify results against established reference intervals for the
Ohio Valley region.
4. Report results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accurate transcription and documentation.
5. For critical values, immediately notify the ordering physician or
applicable medical personnel as per laboratory policy.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run three levels of quality control material (low, normal, high)
daily and document results.
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly comparisons with other analyzers
to ensure consistency.
• Follow corrective action procedures for any failed quality control
results.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as per CLIA
requirements.
• Perform external calibration checks semi-annually using traceable
calibrated standards.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens may affect the accuracy of
certain analytes within the respiratory profile.
• Ensure all specimen handling and storage conditions are adhered
to, as deviations may affect assay performance.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for assay kits and analyzer operation
manuals.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
• Laboratory policy on critical result reporting and quality control
management.
