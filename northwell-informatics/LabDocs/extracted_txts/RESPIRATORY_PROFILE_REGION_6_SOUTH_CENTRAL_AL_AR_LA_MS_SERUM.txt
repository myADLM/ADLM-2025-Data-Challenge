Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Respiratory Profile, Region 6, South
Central (AL, AR, LA, MS), Serum
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Respiratory Profile that includes specimens
collected from Region 6, South Central (specifically: Alabama,
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi), using serum samples.
RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory technicians and qualified personnel are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure accurate and precise testing. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with
this SOP and proper documentation.
1. DEFINITION:
The Respiratory Profile includes, but is not limited to, the following
analytes:
• Total Protein
• Albumin
• A/G Ratio
• Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
• Specific respiratory pathogens serologies (if applicable)
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Handling:
1. Ensure all specimens have been properly labeled and
accessioned.
2. Verify that the serum specimens are stored at 2-8°C and tested
within 48 hours, or if stored at -20°C, they must be used within
3 months.
3. Check for any signs of hemolysis or contamination in the serum
samples. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can affect the
accuracy of results and should be flagged or rejected based on
laboratory policy.
B. Analytical Procedures:
1. Total Protein and Albumin Analysis:
◦ Principle: Total protein and albumin are typically measured
by the Biuret and bromocresol green (BCG) methods,
respectively.
◦ Instrument: Conduct analysis using an automated chemistry
analyzer.
◦ Calibration: Follow manufacturer's instructions for calibration
using standard solutions.
◦ Quality Control: Run quality control (QC) materials (high,
normal, and low) at the beginning of each batch.
◦ Procedure: Load samples onto the analyzer. Ensure the
analyzer is in full working condition and has passed all
internal checks.
2. A/G Ratio Calculation:
◦ A/G Ratio is calculated based on the measured values of
albumin and total protein.
◦ Calculation: A/G Ratio = Albumin / (Total Protein - Albumin)
◦ Ensure calculation is performed correctly and any
automated systems are properly programmed.
3. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Analysis:
◦ Principle: IgE is often measured using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a similar immunoassay
technique.
◦ Instrument: Use the designated immunoassay analyzer as
per laboratory's inventory.
◦ Calibration: Follow the instrument's manual for calibration,
ensuring the use of appropriate calibrators.
◦ Quality Control: Run QC samples with each batch of patient
samples to validate the test run.
◦ Procedure: Process the samples according to the assay’s
instructions. Ensure proper pipetting technique and timing to
avoid any errors.
4. Specific Respiratory Pathogens Serologies (if applicable):
◦ Procedure: For analytes such as viral or bacterial
antibodies, follow the specific immunoassay protocols.
◦ Instrument: Use an approved analyzer or manual method as
specified by reagent manufacturer.
◦ Quality Control: Use the assigned internal and external
controls to ensure test validity.
◦ Procedure: Follow assay-specific guidelines for sample
processing, incubation times, reading results, and
interpretational guidelines.
C. Reporting Results:
1. Review the results for any inconsistencies or flags generated by
the analytical instruments.
2. Validate all QC results; ensure that all QC measures have
passed criteria before validating patient results.
3. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for further review and distribution.
4. Critical values should be reported immediately to the treating
physician/nurse as per the laboratory’s critical value policy,
documenting the communication in the LIS.
D. Documentation:
1. Log all instrument maintenance, calibration, and QC failures
along with corrective actions taken.
2. Ensure all test results, including QC data, are archived
following laboratory policy and regulatory requirements.
3. Document any instance where specimen rejection criteria are
met, noting the reason for rejection and follow-up actions.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run appropriate control materials at the frequency outlined for
each specific test, ensuring adherence to manufacturer
recommendations and laboratory policy.
• Document all QC results and ensure that they fall within
acceptable ranges before releasing patient results.
• Investigate any QC failures immediately, determine root causes,
and implement corrective actions before continuing with patient
sample analysis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Maintain updated reference interval charts specific to the
demographic and clinical relevance to the patient population in
Region 6, South Central.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the individual assay package inserts or test methodologies
for limitations related to interfering substances, specimen handling
effects, and specific technical constraints.
1. REFERENCES:
• Specific package inserts from the assay manufacturers for
detailed procedural and technical information.
• Laboratory’s internal protocol documentation for instrument-
specific settings.
