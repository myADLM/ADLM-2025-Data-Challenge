Title: Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Respiratory Profile, Region 7, Northern
Midwest (MI, MN, WI), Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP is designed to ensure the proper analytical
procedures are followed for generating results for the Respiratory
Profile, Region 7, Northern Midwest (MI, MN, WI) using serum
specimens. This includes adherence to quality control, accurate data
recording, and other required practices to ensure reliable and valid
test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY The laboratory staff are responsible for:
• Adhering to this SOP while performing and documenting all
necessary steps.
• Ensuring all necessary equipment and reagents are prepared and
well-maintained.
• Identifying any deficiencies and notifying supervisors immediately.
• Following corrective actions when necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: 5 mL serum collected in SST (Serum Separator
Tube) and centrifuged within 2 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed serum, insufficient serum volume, and
samples that are not centrifuged within the specified time frame.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instruments: Approved analyzers (e.g., Siemens
Dimension EXL 200).
• Reagents: Respiratory profile assay kits, quality control materials,
calibrators.
• Supplies: Pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes, personal protective
equipment.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Verify that all reagents and supplies are current and have not
passed their expiration date.
• Perform a preliminary quality control check using control samples
and calibration per manufacturer instructions.
Sample Handling & Preparation:
1. Identify and verify the specimens.
2. Centrifuge SST tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully aliquot serum into labeled microcentrifuge tubes,
avoiding cell and clot fragments.
Analyte Measurement:
1. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions
for Respiratory Profile testing.
2. Load the serum samples onto the analyzer.
3. Perform the test according to the assay kit’s insert and
analyzer’s procedure.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with every batch of patient samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range:
◦ Level 1: Low
◦ Level 2: Normal
◦ Level 3: High
• Document all QC outcomes, and if any fall outside the specified
ranges, follow trouble-shooting steps and re-run the QC.
Reporting Results:
1. Verify and interpret results based on reference ranges.
2. Notify the supervisor of any critical values or results exceeding
established limits.
3. Use site-specific reporting guidelines to document and report
the test results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• pH: 7.35–7.45
• pCO2: 35–45 mmHg
• pO2: 80–100 mmHg
• HCO3: 22–26 mmol/L
• Lactate: 0.5–2.2 mmol/L
• Complete Blood Gas Reference ranges according to local clinical
requirements.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the specific respiratory profile
assay insert for limitations related to each test parameter.
8. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR OUT-OF-RANGE TEMPERATURE
OR HUMIDITY:
• Inform the supervisor immediately to contact Facilities
Management.
• Re-calibrate affected instruments and document actions taken.
• Validate temperature-sensitive equipment against a traceable
thermometer.
9. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain logs of daily instrument and environmental condition
checks.
• Document all quality control and calibration outcomes, including
any corrective actions taken.
• Keep a record of all reported results, including critical values and
any comments regarding sample integrity.
10. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s analytical instrument manual.
• Respiratory profile assay kit insert.
• Quality control material insert.
• Internal laboratory quality and operations manual.
By following this SOP, the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of
the Respiratory Profile testing process for Region 7, Northern
Midwest (MI, MN, WI) will be maintained.
