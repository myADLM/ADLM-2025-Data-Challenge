Protocol for Generating Results for Respiratory Profile, Region
8, Central Midwest (IA, IL, MO), Serum
1. Purpose: To provide a standard procedure for the analysis of
respiratory profile tests for serum samples in Region 8, Central
Midwest, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and compliance with
CLIA regulations.
2. Specimen:
◦ Type: Serum
◦ Collection Requirements: Blood collected in SST (Serum
Separator Tube) or Red top tube.
◦ Volume: Minimum 2 mL of serum.
◦ Handling: Centrifuge and separate serum from cells within
2 hours of collection. Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is not
performed immediately. Specimens are stable for up to 7
days at 2-8°C.
3. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples (Note:
Hemolysis may interfere with respiratory enzymatic
activities).
◦ Samples that are not labeled or lack proper documentation.
◦ Specimens older than 7 days post-collection.
4. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Analyzer: Siemens Dimension EXL 200
◦ Reagents: Specific reagents for respiratory profile analysis,
including but not limited to, lactate, pyruvate, bicarbonate,
etc.
◦ Calibrators and Controls:
▪ Two levels of control material: Normal and High.
▪ Calibration solutions as required by the manufacturer.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Follow site-specific quality control guidelines.
◦ Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift
and after any maintenance or calibration procedure.
◦ Document all QC results, and take corrective actions for any
QC failures before running patient samples.
6. Procedure:
◦ Preparation:
▪ Ensure analyzer is properly calibrated and quality control
results are within acceptable limits.
▪ Verify all reagents are within expiration dates and stored
properly.
◦ Sample Analysis:
▪ Aliquot the required volume of serum into labeled sample
cups.
▪ Load samples into the analyzer following instrument-
specific procedures.
▪ Start the analysis and monitor instrument operations
during the run.
◦ Troubleshooting:
▪ If any error messages or flags appear during the run,
refer to the analyzer's manual for troubleshooting steps.
Document any corrective actions taken.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results in the LIS before releasing them.
◦ Document any critical values and initiate immediate
communication with the healthcare provider as per
laboratory policy.
8. Reference Intervals:
◦ Lactate: 0.5 – 2.2 mmol/L
◦ Pyruvate: 0.03 – 0.10 mmol/L
◦ Bicarbonate: 22-29 mEq/L
◦ Additionally, consult site-specific reference intervals as
needed.
9. Critical Values:
◦ Lactate > 4.0 mmol/L
◦ Bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L or > 40 mEq/L
◦ Any critical value requires immediate notification to the
healthcare provider, following the protocol for critical results.
10. Method Limitations:
◦ Refer to the Siemens Dimension EXL 200 manual for details
on individual assay limitations.
◦ Be aware of any interference factors, such as medications
or underlying conditions, that may affect the results.
11. Records and Documentation:
◦ Maintain detailed logs of all calibrations, QC results, and
any instrument maintenance.
◦ Retain all records in compliance with CLIA regulations and
laboratory policies.
