Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Respiratory Profile
Region 9, Great Plains (KS, ND, NE, SD) - Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate and reliable
results for the respiratory profile of serum specimens in the Region 9,
Great Plains area covering KS, ND, NE, and SD.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory scientists and technicians are responsible for
the analytical processing and result generation as outlined in this
SOP. All staff must adhere to these procedures to maintain the
integrity of the test results.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Automated Chemistry Analyzer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and Tips
◦ Incubators
• Reagents:
◦ Manufacturer specified test kits and reagents for respiratory
profile
◦ Quality Control materials (Low, Normal, and High)
◦ Calibrators
• Supplies:
◦ Serum collection tubes
◦ Labels
◦ Recording logs
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 3 mL
• Transport Conditions: Maintain at 2-8°C
• Stability: Should be analyzed within 48 hours of collection if
stored at 2-8°C.
5. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical
1. Specimen Receipt:
◦ Verify specimen integrity and labeling.
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Equipment Preparation:
◦ Perform daily calibration and maintenance checks as
specified by the equipment manuals.
◦ Document maintenance activity.
Analytical
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using manufacturer-supplied
calibrators.
◦ Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each
shift (Low, Normal, High).
◦ Document QC results and take corrective action if results
are outside acceptable limits.
2. Specimen Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared samples onto the analyzer.
◦ Ensure the serum specimen is at room temperature before
analysis.
◦ Initiate the respiratory profile test program according to the
analyzer’s manual.
3. Data Verification:
◦ Review all generated data for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Verify that internal control values fall within the specified
ranges.
4. Troubleshooting:
◦ If analysis results fall outside of the acceptable range, refer
to the instrument troubleshooting guide.
◦ Repeat the test if required after troubleshooting the
equipment or reagent issues.
5. Result Documentation:
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Flag any abnormal or critical results for further review.
◦ Follow protocol for critical result notification.
Post-Analytical
1. Review and Verification:
◦ Ensure all test results have been reviewed for accuracy.
◦ Verify that all analytical steps are properly documented.
2. Reporting:
◦ Transmit verified results to the appropriate reporting system.
◦ Ensure critical results are communicated in accordance with
institutional policies.
3. Sample Storage:
◦ Store remaining serum at -20°C for potential retesting if
required.
◦ Dispose of samples after the retention period following
biohazard protocols.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC at the beginning of each analytical run and after any
maintenance.
• Review QC trend charts weekly and document any corrective
actions taken.
• Evaluate and record QC performance and take steps to resolve
any recurrent or unresolved QC issues.
7. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that all test-specific reagents and equipment are
compatible with serum samples.
• Note that hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples can affect test
results. Flag such results and consider retesting if necessary.
