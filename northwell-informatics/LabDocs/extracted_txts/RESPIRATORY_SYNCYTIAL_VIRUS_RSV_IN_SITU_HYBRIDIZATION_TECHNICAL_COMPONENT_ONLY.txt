Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV) In Situ Hybridization, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the technical component of the
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in situ hybridization (ISH) assay.
This procedure ensures the accurate and reliable detection of RSV
RNA in clinical specimens using ISH methodology.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP during the technical phase of the RSV ISH procedure. The
designated laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with this SOP and for addressing any technical issues
that arise.
1. SPECIMEN
3.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Cytological preparations fixed in 95% ethanol.
3.2. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not fixed in formalin or ethanol.
• Specimens with incomplete or incorrect labeling.
• Damaged or improperly stored specimens.

• Hybridization buffer.
• Wash buffers.
• Detection reagents (e.g., alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-
digoxigenin).
• Chromogenic substrate (e.g., nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-
chloro-3-indolyl phosphate [NBT/BCIP]).
• Counterstain (e.g., nuclear fast red).
• Mounting medium.
4.2. Supplies:
• Microscope slides.
• Coverslips.
• Water bath.
• Hybridization oven.
• Humidity chamber.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Forceps.
• Microscope.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 microns and mount on
positively charged microscope slides.
2. Allow slides to air dry overnight at room temperature or for 1
hour at 60°C.
5.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene for 2
x 10 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
80%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
5.3. Pretreatment:
1. Immerse slides in pretreatment solution (e.g., proteinase K) for
the specified time and temperature according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the digestion reaction.
5.4. Probe Hybridization:
1. Apply the RSV-specific RNA probe to the tissue sections,
ensuring complete coverage.
2. Place the slides in a humidity chamber and incubate at 37°C in
a hybridization oven for 2 hours or according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
5.5. Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Wash slides in pre-warmed wash buffer to remove unbound
probe.
2. Perform additional washes as specified by the manufacturer to
ensure complete removal of nonspecific binding.
5.6. Detection:
1. Apply the detection reagent (e.g., alkaline phosphatase-
conjugated anti-digoxigenin) to the tissue sections.
2. Incubate at room temperature for the time specified by the
manufacturer.
3. Rinse slides in wash buffer to remove unbound detection
reagent.
5.7. Chromogenic Detection:
1. Apply the chromogenic substrate (e.g., NBT/BCIP) to the tissue
sections.
2. Incubate until the desired signal intensity develops, monitoring
under a microscope.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
5.8. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain the tissue sections with nuclear fast red for 2-5
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water to remove excess counterstain.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions and clear in
xylene.
4. Apply coverslips using mounting medium and allow to dry.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1. Positive Control:
• Include known positive RSV-infected tissue sections as a positive
control to ensure assay performance.
6.2. Negative Control:
• Include a negative control section (without probe) to detect non-
specific staining.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be interpreted by a qualified pathologist and
documented in the laboratory information system (LIS).
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the RSV-specific RNA probe and
detection kits.
• Relevant scientific literature and guidelines for in situ hybridization
methods.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all steps, including reagent lot numbers, incubation times,
temperatures, and any deviations from the SOP in the laboratory
logbook.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines and consult with the
laboratory supervisor for troubleshooting any issues that arise
during the procedure.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
consistent and accurate detection of RSV RNA in clinical specimens
using in situ hybridization techniques.
