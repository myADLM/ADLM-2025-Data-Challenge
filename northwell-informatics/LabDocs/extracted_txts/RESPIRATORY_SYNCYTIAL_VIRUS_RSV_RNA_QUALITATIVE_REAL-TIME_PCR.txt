Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV) RNA, Qualitative Real-Time PCR
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the qualitative
detection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) RNA using Real-Time
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) methodology in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the qualified laboratory
technologists to perform, document, and verify this procedure,
ensuring that all steps are followed accurately to guarantee the
reliability and validity of the results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Nasopharyngeal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM)
or universal transport medium (UTM)
• Nasal aspirates
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 72 hours
of collection.
• If storage longer than 72 hours is required, specimens should be
frozen at -70°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers
• Specimens without collection date and time
• Specimens with visible contamination or improper handling
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-Time PCR machine
• RNA extraction kit
• RSV-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR-grade reagents and consumables (e.g., tubes, pipette tips)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Molecular Grade Ethanol and other cleaning agents
5. PROCEDURE
A) RNA Extraction:
1. Don appropriate PPE including gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection.
2. Vortex specimen briefly to mix contents thoroughly.
3. Aliquot 200 µL of specimen into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
4. Follow the specific protocol of the RNA extraction kit being used
(refer to manufacturer's instructions).
5. Elute RNA in 50 µL of RNase-free water.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Prepare master mix for PCR reaction according to
manufacturer guidelines, including:
◦ RSV-specific primers and probes
◦ Taq polymerase
◦ dNTPs
◦ Buffer
2. Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add 5 µL of extracted RNA to each tube or well.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
results.
5. Seal tubes or plates securely to prevent contamination.
C) Real-Time PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Load PCR tubes or plates onto the Real-Time PCR machine.
2. Set up PCR cycling protocol:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Analyze fluorescence data in real-time or at the end of cycling.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of PCR equipment
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Document all procedural steps, deviations, and corrective
actions in the laboratory log.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive Result: Detection of RSV RNA-specific fluorescence
signal above threshold in Real-Time PCR.
• Negative Result: Absence of RSV RNA-specific fluorescence
signal above threshold.
• Invalid Result: Presence of amplification in negative control or
absence in positive control, indicating potential issues with
reagents or procedure.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit results from PCR machine to Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review and confirm results before verification.
3. Report results as:
◦ "RSV RNA detected" for positive samples
◦ "RSV RNA not detected" for negative samples
◦ "Invalid - repeat test" for inconclusive runs
9. REFERENCES Refer to manufacturer's instruction manuals for the
RNA extraction kit and Real-Time PCR machine. Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for molecular
diagnostics.
10. RECORD KEEPING Maintain all records including specimen
information, batch runs, quality control data, and result logs in
accordance with CLIA regulations and laboratory policies.
This SOP is effective as of October 2023 and will be revised
periodically or as new information and technology become available.
Ensure compliance with institutional, federal, and safety guidelines at
all times.
