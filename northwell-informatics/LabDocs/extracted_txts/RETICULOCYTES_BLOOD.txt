Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Reticulocytes, Blood
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for reticulocyte counts in blood specimens. This
SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable measurement of
reticulocyte levels.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
reticulocyte analysis as defined in this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for verifying that these procedures are followed correctly
and addressing any issues that arise during the analysis.
2. DEFINITION
Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells (RBCs) that are released
from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. The reticulocyte count is
an important diagnostic tool for assessing bone marrow function and
erythropoietic activity.
3. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood
• Collection Container: EDTA anticoagulant tubes
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C.
Specimens should be analyzed within 8 hours of collection if kept
at room temperature.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes
◦ Specimens received without proper labeling (missing
collection date/time, patient identifiers)
◦ Clotted specimens or specimens with hemolysis
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated hematology analyzer with reticulocyte counting
capability (e.g., Sysmex, Beckman Coulter)
• Saponin reagent or reticulocyte staining solution
• Quality control materials with known reticulocyte levels
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Ensure the automated hematology analyzer is calibrated and
quality control (QC) results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding.
2. Validate the analyzer against a traceable reference standard.
B) Specimen Preparation
1. Gently mix the EDTA blood specimen by inversion 8-10 times.
2. Load the specimen onto the appropriate rack or carousel of the
hematology analyzer.
C) Analysis
1. Select the reticulocyte count mode on the hematology analyzer.
2. Begin the run in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions for reticulocyte analysis.
3. Ensure results are transmitted automatically to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
D) Quality Control
1. Run two levels of QC material (low and high reticulocyte
counts) at the beginning of each shift.
2. Record QC results in the equipment log.
E) Troubleshooting
1. If QC fails, recalibrate the analyzer and rerun QC material.
2. Document all corrective actions taken in the equipment log.
3. If issues persist, notify the supervisor and contact technical
support.
F) Result Verification
1. Review reticulocyte results on the LIS.
2. Verify results against established reference intervals:
◦ Adult reference interval: 0.5-2.5%
3. Flag any abnormal values for review and additional testing if
necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reported following site-specific reporting
guidelines. Abnormal values (outside reference intervals) must be
flagged for review and may require follow-up testing or consultation.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemoglobinopathies, severe leukocytosis, or heavy platelet
clumping may interfere with reticulocyte counting.
• Automated counts are accurate within the range defined by the
analyzer's operational limits. Refer to the analyzer's user manual
for specific limitations.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's user manual for the hematology analyzer
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain a log of analyzer calibration, QC results, and any
corrective actions taken.
• Ensure all documentation complies with CLIA regulations and
laboratory quality assurance protocols.
10. SAFETY
• Utilize PPE as per laboratory safety protocols (gloves, lab coat,
eye protection).
• Follow biohazard handling procedures to avoid contamination or
exposure.
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in equipment, reagents, and regulatory requirements.
Compliance with this protocol ensures accurate and reliable
reticulocyte counts to support clinical diagnosis and patient care.
