Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Reticulocyte Count,
Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for performing reticulocyte
counts in blood samples, ensuring accurate, precise, and
reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
analyzing blood reticulocyte counts in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
reticulocyte count analysis according to this SOP. Any deviation from
this procedure must be documented and reported to the supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Hematology Analyzer with Reticulocyte Counting
Capability
• Microscope (for manual reticulocyte count, if needed)
• Reticulocyte Stain (new methylene blue)
• Staining Reagent
• Pipettes and Tips
• Eppendorf Tubes or similar containers
• Hematocrit Centrifuge (if manual count is performed)
• Capillary Tubes (for manual count)
• Gloves and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Quality Control Materials
• Calibrated Calibration Reagents
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Accepted Specimens:
• EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood.
• Specimens should be tested as soon as possible, ideally within 24
hours of collection.
Rejection Criteria:
• Clotted samples
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples collected in inappropriate containers
6. PROCEDURE
A) Automated Reticulocyte Count Protocol
1. Perform instrument maintenance and daily quality control
checks according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Mix the EDTA-anticoagulated blood sample thoroughly by
gentle inversion before testing.
3. Load the sample into the automated hematology analyzer
according to the instrument's protocol.
4. Select the Reticulocyte Count mode or program.
5. Start the analysis as per the instrument’s operational manual.
6. Verify the results output by the analyzer. Review any flags or
error messages and troubleshoot as necessary.
7. Record the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and validate them following laboratory guidelines.
B) Manual Reticulocyte Count Protocol (if required)
1. Mix the EDTA-anticoagulated blood sample thoroughly by
gentle inversion.
2. Add 100 µL of blood sample to a small tube containing an equal
volume of new methylene blue stain.
3. Mix well and incubate at room temperature for 10-15 minutes.
4. Prepare a smear on a microscope slide from the stained blood
mixture and allow it to air dry.
5. Examine the slide under the microscope with oil immersion
(1000x magnification).
6. Count the number of reticulocytes in a total of 1000 red blood
cells (RBCs).
7. Calculate the reticulocyte percentage using the formula:
[ \text{Reticulocyte %} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of
Reticulocytes counted}}{\text{Number of RBCs counted}} \right)
\times 100 ]
8. If the hematocrit is abnormally low or high, use the corrected
reticulocyte count formula:
[ \text{Corrected Reticulocyte %} = \text{Reticulocyte %} \times
\left( \frac{\text{Patient's Hematocrit}}{45} \right) ]
9. Record the manual count results in the LIS and validate them
according to laboratory guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run appropriate quality control materials (low, normal, high) for
reticulocyte counts daily and document the results.
2. Ensure calibration of the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
schedule and guidelines.
3. Monitor and document instrument performance and
maintenance logs.
4. Validate manual reticulocyte count by comparing it to
automated counts periodically.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist. Report
the results according to the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reticulocyte % (newborns): 2.5-6.0%
• Reticulocyte % (adults): 0.5-2.5% (Note: Adjust specific reference
ranges to your laboratory's determined values.)
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples and improperly mixed samples may yield
inaccurate results.
• Care should be taken in identifying reticulocytes microscopically
to avoid errors due to misidentification.
