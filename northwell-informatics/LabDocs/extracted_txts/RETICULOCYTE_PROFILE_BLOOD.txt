Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Reticulocyte Profile, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of reticulocyte
profile in blood samples, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All trained medical laboratory scientists are responsible for following
this SOP to ensure consistency and quality of results. Supervisors
are responsible for oversight and addressing any issues that may
arise during the procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells (RBCs) that still contain
remnants of RNA. The reticulocyte count helps assess bone marrow
function and RBC production.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Preferred Specimen:
• 2-3 mL peripheral blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Clotted samples.
• Specimens collected in any anticoagulants other than EDTA.
Storage and Stability:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Reticulocyte count must be performed within 24 hours of
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Hematology Analyzer (e.g., Sysmex, Abbott Cell-Dyn)
• EDTA tubes
• Calibrators and Controls (Low, Normal, and High)
• Reticulocyte Stain (e.g., New Methylene Blue or equivalent)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
• Perform calibration following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Use calibrators provided by the manufacturer and document
calibration results.
1. Quality Control:
• Run Low, Normal, and High controls at the beginning of each
shift.
• Document control results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the EDTA blood sample gently by inversion to ensure it is
well-mixed before analysis.
2. Allow the sample to reach room temperature if stored at 2-8°C.
C. Staining:
For Manual Method:
1. Mix equal volumes of blood and reticulocyte stain in a test tube
(e.g., 1 drop of blood and 1 drop of stain).
2. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes, ensuring the stain
penetrates the reticulocytes.
D. Analysis:
Automated Method:
1. Load the sample onto the automated hematology analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run the Reticulocyte count program on the analyzer.
3. Record the reticulocyte count and percentage results.
Manual Method:
1. Prepare a blood smear on a glass slide using the stained
sample.
2. Allow the smear to air dry completely.
3. Examine the smear under a microscope at 1000x magnification
using oil immersion.
4. Count the reticulocytes per 1000 red blood cells (RBCs).
5. Calculate the reticulocyte percentage and absolute count using
the following formulas:
◦ Reticulocyte Percentage = (Number of reticulocytes /
Number of RBCs) x 100
◦ Absolute Reticulocyte Count = (Reticulocyte Percentage /
100) x RBC count (from CBC)
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Review and verify all results before reporting.
8. Enter the results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System)
for automatic transmission and review.
9. Report any critical results to the attending physician
immediately following established reporting guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
• Reticulocyte Percentage: 0.5% to 2.5%
• Absolute Reticulocyte Count: 25,000 to 125,000 cells/μL Note:
Reference ranges may vary depending on the laboratory
instrumentation and population.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, clots, and improper mixing can affect the accuracy of
results.
• Certain conditions (e.g., recent transfusions, hemolytic anemias)
can influence reticulocyte counts.

• Specific manufacturer’s hematology analyzer instructions.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant clinical pathology literature.
End of Protocol
This SOP includes detailed instructions for obtaining and analyzing
reticulocyte profiles, ensuring that the protocol is comprehensive and
user-friendly even for staff who may be less familiar with the
procedure. If there are more specific laboratory guidelines or
customization needed, feel free to let me know.
