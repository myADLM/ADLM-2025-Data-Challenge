Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Retinoblastoma
Protein (RB) Immunostain, Tech Only
1. PURPOSE This procedure provides guidelines for performing
the immunohistochemical staining of retinoblastoma protein
(RB) to diagnose and study cases of retinoblastoma and other
relevant conditions in tissue samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the RB immunostain as defined in this procedure and
for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of results. Supervisors are
responsible for oversight, ensuring compliance, and addressing any
discrepancies.
1. DEFINITION Retinoblastoma protein (RB) immunostaining is
performed to detect the presence and localization of RB protein
in tissue samples. This technique helps in the diagnosis and
research of retinoblastoma and other cancers where RB protein
is involved.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: The following specimens are
acceptable for RB immunostaining:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
Unacceptable specimen types:
• Specimens that have not been properly fixed or embedded.
• Samples that show significant artifacts or damage which may
obscure cellular details.
It is the responsibility of the staff to ensure that samples are
appropriately labeled and accessioned before staining.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES:
Reagents:
• Appropriate primary antibodies against RB (ready-to-use or
concentrated).
• Secondary antibody detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated
polymers).
• DAB chromogen and substrate.
• Hematoxylin counterstain.
Equipment:
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup.
• Microtome for sectioning paraffin blocks.
• Water bath.
• Incubator or oven.
• Light microscope.
Supplies:
• Positively charged glass slides.
• Coverslips.
• Xylene, ethanol, distilled water.
• Mounting medium.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Tissue Sectioning:
• Cut 3-5 μm thick sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks using a microtome.
• Place sections onto positively charged glass slides and allow the
slides to dry at 37°C overnight or at 60°C for 30-60 minutes.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene for 5 minutes
(twice).
• Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
for 3 minutes each.
• Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) by immersing the
slides in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0).
• Heat in a pressure cooker, microwave, or water bath at 95-100°C
for 20-30 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool in buffer for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS or TBS for 5
minutes.
D) Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
• Incubate slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase.
• Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS or TBS for 5
minutes.
E) Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply the primary antibody specific for RB to each section.
• Incubate the sections in a humidified chamber at room
temperature for 1 hour, or at 4°C overnight.
• Rinse slides with PBS or TBS for 5 minutes.
F) Secondary Antibody and Detection:
• Apply the appropriate secondary antibody or detection system as
per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Rinse slides with PBS or TBS for 5 minutes.
G) Chromogen Development:
• Apply DAB chromogen solution to the sections and incubate for
5-10 minutes until desired staining intensity is achieved.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
H) Counterstaining and Mounting:
• Counterstain the sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse briefly in tap water followed by distilled water.
• Dehydrate through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%).
• Clear in xylene for 5 minutes (twice).
• Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include known positive and negative control tissues with each run
to ensure staining quality and specificity.
• Document all reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and any
deviations from the SOP.
• Record daily temperatures of all relevant equipment, including
incubators, refrigerators, and freezers.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review stained slides under a light microscope.
• Record the presence and distribution of RB protein staining in the
designated reporting format.
• Forward results to the pathologist for final diagnostic
interpretation.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's guidelines and package inserts for all reagents
and antibodies.
• Relevant histology and immunohistochemistry textbooks and
articles detailing RB immunostaining techniques.
This completes the Standard Operating Procedure for the
Retinoblastoma Protein (RB) immunostaining at our laboratory.
Ensure compliance with all outlined steps and maintain consistency
in the process to produce reliable and reproducible results.
