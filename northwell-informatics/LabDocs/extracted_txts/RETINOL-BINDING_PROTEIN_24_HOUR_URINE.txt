Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Retinol-
Binding Protein (RBP) in 24-Hour Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE To describe the procedures required for the analysis
and reporting of Retinol-Binding Protein (RBP) in 24-hour urine
samples, ensuring accuracy, precision, and compliance with all
applicable regulations and standards.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the examination and reporting of RBP levels in 24-
hour urine samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis and document
results.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP, validate results,
and oversee corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS Retinol-Binding Protein (RBP): A carrier protein
that binds retinol (vitamin A1) and transports it in the blood to
various tissues. 24-Hour Urine Sample: Urine collected over a
24-hour period to investigate kidney function or detect certain
diseases.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 5.1. Specimen Collection
• Collect urine in a clean, sterile 24-hour urine container with no
preservatives.
• Record the start and end date and time of collection.
• Store the specimen at 2-8°C during and after collection.
5.2. Specimen Acceptance
• Acceptable: Complete 24-hour urine collection, properly labeled
with patient identification, start, and end times.
• Unacceptable: Incomplete collection, gross contamination,
unlabeled or mislabeled specimens, specimens not received
within 24 hours of collection completion without refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• RBP assay kit (commercially available)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the RBP assay
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• 24-hour urine collection containers
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURES 7.1. Preparation of Specimens
• Mix the 24-hour urine specimen thoroughly by inverting the
container.
• Measure the total volume of the collected urine.
• Aliquot a portion of the urine (usually 10-20 mL) into a secondary
container for analysis and store the remaining specimen at 2-8°C.
• If the urine is visibly turbid, centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes and use the clear supernatant for analysis.
7.2. Calibrators and Quality Control
• Prepare calibrators and quality controls as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Ensure that all reagents are at room temperature before use and
that no reagents are used past their expiration date.
7.3. Assay Procedure
• Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions for the RBP assay.
• In each well, add the appropriate volume of sample, calibrator, or
quality control, followed by the assay reagents as specified in the
kit insert.
• Follow the assay procedure including any washing, incubation,
and reading steps as specified.
• Ensure all incubation times and temperatures adhere strictly to
the test kit instructions.
7.4. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
• Calculate RBP concentration using the standard curve generated
from calibrators.
• Verify that all quality control results are within the acceptable
range before reporting patient results.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) as
described in the site-specific reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run quality control samples at two levels (low and high) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Document all quality control results, corrective actions, and any
deviations from the SOP.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
the manufacturer's recommendations and document all activities.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report RBP results in mg/L or appropriate units as per laboratory
guidelines.
• Interpret results in context with provided reference intervals.
• In case of any critical values or significant deviations from the
expected range, immediately notify the designated clinician as per
the critical values reporting policy.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for the RBP assay kit
• Laboratory-specific quality control and maintenance
documentation
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urine analysis
1. RECORDS
• Keep records of all specimen data, calibrator and control results,
instrument maintenance logs, and any corrective actions taken as
required by laboratory policy.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all safety guidelines, including the use of PPE, proper
waste disposal, and disinfection of work areas.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious material.
This protocol ensures the accurate and reliable determination of
Retinol-Binding Protein in 24-hour urine samples and compliance
with laboratory standards and regulatory requirements. Implementing
these procedures will provide high-quality results for clinical patient
management.
