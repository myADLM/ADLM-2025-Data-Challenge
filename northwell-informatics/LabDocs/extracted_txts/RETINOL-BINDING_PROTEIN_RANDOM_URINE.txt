Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Retinol-Binding Protein (RBP) Testing in
Random Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
Retinol-Binding Protein (RBP) results from random urine samples in
a clinical laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are to conduct the analytical procedures as
defined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure proper handling and
analysis of urine samples for accurate RBP results.
1. DEFINITION
Retinol-Binding Protein (RBP) is a low-weight plasma protein
responsible for transporting retinol (vitamin A alcohol) in the blood.
Elevated levels in urine may be indicative of renal disease or injury.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Random Urine Sample
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL of freshly voided random urine.
• Urine should be collected in a clean, sterile container.
• Specimens should be sent to the laboratory within 6 hours of
collection. If the sample is refrigerated, it should be brought to
room temperature before analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected over 6 hours prior to laboratory receipt.
• Specimens without indicated collection date/time on the container
or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens ADVIA Centaur CP
Immunoassay System).
• Reagents for RBP analysis (provided by authorized vendors
according to manufacturer’s instructions).
• Calibrators and controls.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation: 1. Allow urine specimens to come to room
temperature if previously refrigerated. 2. Ensure all reagents,
controls, and calibrators are brought to room temperature as per
manufacturer's instructions. 3. Verify the expiration date of all
reagents and controls before use.
B) Analytical Procedure: 1. Set up the immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2. Calibrate the
instrument using the provided calibrators, ensuring calibration curves
meet acceptable criteria. 3. Run quality controls at two levels (high
and low) before analyzing patient specimens to ensure accuracy and
reliability of results. 4. Document calibration and control results in the
appropriate log.
C) Sample Analysis: 1. Pour 10 mL of urine sample into a labelled
sample tube. 2. Load the sample tube onto the immunoassay
analyzer. 3. Enter patient details into the laboratory information
system (LIS) or analyzer. 4. Start the analysis. 5. After analysis,
retrieve results from the analyzer. 6. If the RBP level falls outside the
expected range, repeat the test to confirm results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples daily to ensure consistent results.
• Document the quality control results and any corrective actions
taken if the controls fail to meet expected ranges.
• Regularly maintain and service the immunoassay analyzer as per
manufacturer's recommendations to ensure optimal performance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Technologists must review and verify all results before final
reporting.
• Ensure results are accurately documented and reported in the
patient’s health record.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range for Retinol-Binding Protein (RBP) in random urine:
40-80 micrograms/L (may vary based on laboratory standards).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations of the
RBP assay.
• Factors such as specimen handling, storage conditions, and
timing may affect the accuracy of the results.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the analyzer displays error codes or unusual results, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the analyzer manual.
• Repeat analysis using a new aliquot of the patient specimen.
• Contact technical support if unable to resolve issues.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product insert for the immunoassay analyzer and
RBP kit.
• Relevant literature on RBP and its clinical significance in urine.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Keep all records of calibrations, quality control, patient results,
and maintenance logs as required by laboratory standards and
regulatory guidelines.
By adhering to this SOP, the accuracy and reliability of Retinol-
Binding Protein testing in random urine samples will be ensured,
contributing to quality patient care and clinical diagnostics.
