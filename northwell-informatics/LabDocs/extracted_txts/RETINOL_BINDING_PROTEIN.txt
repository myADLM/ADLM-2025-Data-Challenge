STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)
RETINOL BINDING PROTEIN (RBP) ASSAY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analytical procedure of measuring Retinol Binding Protein (RBP)
levels in human serum or plasma using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). This protocol ensures accurate and
consistent measurement of RBP for clinical diagnostics.
Responsibility:
All laboratory scientists and technicians are responsible for
understanding and performing the procedure as outlined. Any
deviations or issues should be promptly reported to the supervisor for
corrective actions.
1. DEFINITION
Retinol Binding Protein (RBP) is a carrier protein that binds retinol
and transports it from the liver to peripheral tissues. The
measurement of RBP levels is important in the assessment of vitamin
A status, renal function, and protein-energy malnutrition.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum: Preferably fasting, collected in a plain red-top tube or
serum separator tube.
• Plasma: Collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Store serum/plasma at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• For long-term storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens collected in citrate or fluoride tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Multichannel pipette
• Timer
Reagents:
• RBP ELISA Kit, which includes:
◦ Pre-coated microplate with anti-RBP antibodies
◦ RBP standards
◦ Detection antibody (HRP-conjugated)
◦ Substrate solution (TMB)
◦ Stop solution (2N HCl)
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents
• Bring all kit components to room temperature.
• Prepare wash buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
B. Preparation of Standards and Samples
• Dilute standards in the sample diluent provided to create a
standard curve.
• Dilute serum/plasma samples if necessary according to the assay
kit instructions.
• Include appropriate quality control samples.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of standards, samples, and controls to the
designated wells.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle
shaking.
3. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
4. Add 100 µL of HRP-conjugated detection antibody to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes with
gentle shaking.
6. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
7. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the plate at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader within 15
minutes of adding the stop solution.
11. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Plot the standard curve by plotting the average absorbance for
each standard concentration on the y-axis and the concentration
on the x-axis using linear regression.
• Calculate the sample concentrations using the equation derived
from the standard curve.
• The results should be expressed in µg/mL or another appropriate
unit based on the calibration curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include internal controls and QC samples with known RBP
concentrations.
• Analyze QC results to ensure assay performance is within
permissible limits.
• Perform necessary troubleshooting steps if QC samples fail.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before release.
• Flag and comment on any critical or clinically significant results
according to facility guidelines.

1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
results.
• Dilution errors or incorrect pipetting can affect accuracy.
• Ensure strict adherence to incubation times and temperature
controls.
1. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves and lab coat.
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines.
• Dispose of biohazard wastes according to facility protocols.
