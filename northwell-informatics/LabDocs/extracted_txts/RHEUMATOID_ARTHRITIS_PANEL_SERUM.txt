Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Rheumatoid Arthritis
Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Rheumatoid
Arthritis (RA) Panel on serum samples to ensure accurate and timely
results. The RA Panel typically includes tests such as Rheumatoid
Factor (RF), Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (Anti-CCP), C-Reactive
Protein (CRP), and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the Clinical Laboratory staff performing
serum RA Panel testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the RA Panel testing as per this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor/manager to ensure that all
personnel are adequately trained and competent to perform the test,
and that all instrumentation and equipment are properly maintained
and calibrated.
4. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Serum (collected in SST or red-top tube).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum should be separated from the clot within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For longer storage,
freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage
• Pipettes and tips
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader
• ESR analyzer
• Controls and calibrators
Reagents:
• Rheumatoid Factor reagent kit
• Anti-CCP reagent kit
• CRP reagent kit
• ESR reagent kit
• Quality control materials
• Calibrators
6. PROCEDURE
A) Serum Preparation
1. Upon receipt, verify patient information and specimen integrity.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
3. Aliquot the serum into labeled secondary tubes if not analyzed
immediately.
4. Store serum aliquots at 2-8°C until analysis.
B) Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Analysis
1. Warm the RF reagent and SAIC analyzer to room temperature.
2. Load patient serum samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
analyzer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Initiate the RF test sequence on the analyzer.
4. Review resulting data. If results fall outside expected ranges,
follow the troubleshooting guide provided by the manufacturer.
C) Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (Anti-CCP) Analysis
1. Prepare the ELISA plate or load the samples into the
automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for reagent preparation and
plate setup.
3. Incubate, wash, and add substrate as per the kit instructions.
4. Read absorbance at the specified wavelength on the ELISA
reader.
5. Interpret results based on the provided kit standard curve.
D) C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Analysis
1. Load the CRP reagent kit into the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Process patient samples, controls, and calibrators as per
manufacturer's protocol.
3. Review and document findings. For results outside the normal
range, rerun the test with a fresh aliquot if needed.
E) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) Analysis
1. Carefully mix the ESR reagent with patient serum according to
the kit’s instructions.
2. Place the mixture into the ESR analyzer tubes.
3. Initiate the test and allow it to run for the specified duration.
4. Record the sedimentation rate directly from the analyzer
display.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples for all tests in the RA panel at the
beginning of each shift and with any new test run.
2. Ensure results of control samples are within the acceptable
range before proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document all control results and take corrective action if
controls are out of range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) after each test run.
2. Technologists must review and verify each result before
releasing it.
3. Critical results should be communicated to the physician or
clinician immediately following laboratory protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Rheumatoid Factor (RF): <15 IU/mL (reference may vary by kit)
• Anti-CCP: <20 U/mL (reference may vary by kit)
• CRP: <1.0 mg/dL
• ESR:
◦ Men: 0-15 mm/hr
◦ Women: 0-20 mm/hr
10. LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to each reagent kit insert for specific limitations and potential
interferences. Common limitations may include:
• Rheumatoid Factor positivity may also be seen in other
autoimmune disorders.
• Lipemia and hemolysis can interfere with CRP assays.
• Ensure proper calibration and function of ESR analyzer for
consistent results.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s reagent and equipment manuals.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Latest scientific literature and consensus documents on
rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis.
12. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all data is documented in logbooks or electronically, including:
• Patient sample accession numbers.
• Date and time of analysis.
• Operator initials.
• Quality control results.
• Calibration logs.
