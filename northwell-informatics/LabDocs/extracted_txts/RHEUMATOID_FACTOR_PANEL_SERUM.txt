Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Rheumatoid
Factor (RF) Panel, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Rheumatoid
Factor (RF) in serum samples to ensure consistent and accurate
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel performing RF Panel
analysis in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Medical Laboratory Scientists (MLS): Responsible for
performing RF analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure that personnel are trained and comply with
the SOP. Address any issues that arise during the procedure.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor and document quality
control measures and ensure the accuracy of test results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Rheumatoid Factor (RF): An autoantibody that targets the Fc
region of IgG, often present in autoimmune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis.
• Analyzer: An instrument used to measure the concentration of
RF in serum samples.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Sample Cups or Tubes
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Timer
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ RF Calibrators
◦ RF Control Samples (Positive and Negative)
◦ Diluent
◦ RF Reagent Kits
◦ Disposable Gloves
◦ Lab Coats
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in an SST (Serum Separator Tube) or plain
red-top tube.
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to separate the serum.
• Stability:
◦ Serum is stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
◦ For long-term storage, serum can be aliquoted and frozen at
-20°C or lower.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Allow RF reagents and calibrators to reach room
temperature before use.
◦ Mix reagents gently by inversion.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run daily controls (positive and negative) before analyzing
patient samples.
◦ Document QC results. Ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges set by the manufacturer.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Labeling:
◦ Ensure each sample is properly labeled with the patient
identifier, date, and time of collection.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled sample cups.
Ensure no air bubbles are present.
C. Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Power on the clinical chemistry analyzer.
◦ Perform a calibration using RF calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load the RF reagent cartridges and sample cups into the
analyzer.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Enter sample ID and load the samples onto the analyzer.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the RF panel assay on the analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis process.
◦ Monitor the instrument for any errors or issues.
4. Result Verification:
◦ After the assay completes, review the results for each
patient sample.
◦ Verify that controls have yielded acceptable results. If
controls fail, troubleshoot and repeat the analysis.
D. Post-Analysis:
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Based on the results, the final report will be generated and
verified by the MLS.
3. Sample Storage:
◦ Store any remaining serum samples at 2-8°C for potential
repeat analysis or at -20°C for long-term storage.
E. Maintenance and Troubleshooting:
1. Analyzer Maintenance:
◦ Perform daily maintenance as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines. Document all maintenance activities.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If any errors occur during analysis, refer to the
troubleshooting guide in the analyzer's manual and address
the issue accordingly.
◦ Consult with the supervisor if the issue persists.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control samples must be run at the beginning of each
shift, with each new reagent lot, or following any maintenance that
might affect results.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions taken if QC
results fall outside the acceptable range.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Range:
◦ RF: < 14 IU/mL (This range may vary; refer to the
manufacturer’s recommendations and lab-specific reference
intervals).
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in IU/mL.
• Include a comment explaining any deviations or potential
interferences noted during analysis.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with RF
measurements. Avoid using samples showing signs of significant
interference.
• Refer to the specific RF reagent insert for additional limitations.
