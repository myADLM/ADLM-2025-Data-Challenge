1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized and reliable procedures for the quantification
of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) in plasma samples. Accurate
determination of RF levels is imperative for the diagnosis and
management of various autoimmune disorders, primarily rheumatoid
arthritis.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Plasma collected from blood drawn into EDTA or
heparinized tubes.
◦ The plasma sample should be processed within 4 hours of
collection if stored at room temperature. If stored at 2-8°C,
plasma can be analyzed within 48 hours. Long-term storage
should be at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
◦ Samples significantly hemolyzed or lipemic.
◦ Samples stored at room temperature for more than 4 hours
or refrigerated for more than 48 hours before processing.
◦ Clotted samples or samples without proper anticoagulation.
◦ Samples without proper labeling (i.e., lacking patient
identification, collection date, and time).
2. SAFETY
Ensure that all laboratory personnel:
◦ Are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment
(PPE) including gloves, lab coats, and eye protection.
◦ Follow all biohazard waste disposal procedures.
◦ Adhere to biosafety guidelines to prevent exposure to
infectious agents.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA or Immunonephelometry analyzer suitable for RF
quantification.
◦ Rheumatoid Factor assay kit including all necessary
reagents, calibrators, and controls.
◦ Micropipettes and pipette tips.
◦ Calibration and quality control materials.
◦ Plasma samples.
◦ Laboratory timer.
◦ Sample cups or tubes compatible with the analyzer.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Turn on the analyzer and allow it to perform self-checks and
calibration, if necessary.
2. Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and quality control materials
as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Thaw and bring plasma samples to room temperature, if stored
frozen.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Run a calibration curve using the calibrators provided in the RF
assay kit.
2. Ensure that the calibration curve meets the manufacturer's
specifications.
3. Run quality control materials (both positive and negative
controls) as per the assay requirements.
4. Document the results of the calibration and quality control on
the appropriate log.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Label sample cups or tubes with appropriate sample
identification.
2. Add the required amount of plasma sample to the sample cup
or tube.
3. Load the samples, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer
based on the analyzer's specific loading instructions.
4. Initiate the assay run according to the analyzer’s protocol.
5. Monitor the analysis to ensure proper functioning. Watch for
any instrument alerts or errors.
D. Result Validation
1. Upon completion of the run, review the analyzer's output
results.
2. Compare the control results to the established ranges:
◦ If the quality control results are within acceptable limits,
proceed with result reporting.
◦ If the control results are outside of the acceptable range,
troubleshoot the issue, and rerun the analysis if required.
E. Reporting Results
1. Report results in IU/mL.
2. Include appropriate reference ranges in the report:
◦ Negative: <14 IU/mL
◦ Borderline: 14- RF quantification.
3. Validate that all instruments and reagents are functioning
correctly.
Quality Control and Calibration:
• Utilize the quality control materials provided with the assay kit as
well as the three levels of internal QC material, documenting
outcomes appropriately.
• Perform a calibration check with each new lot of reagents and
every 30 days.
• Monitor continuous internal quality checks with each run to
maintain reliability and accuracy of results.
