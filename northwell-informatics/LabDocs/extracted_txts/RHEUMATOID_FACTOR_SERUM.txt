Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for the Determination of
Rheumatoid Factor (RF), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the qualitative and
quantitative determination of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) in serum
samples in the clinical laboratory setting. This protocol ensures
accurate, consistent, and reliable results are generated in line with
clinical laboratory standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel, including
technologists and supervisors, are responsible for performing the
analysis, monitoring quality control, documenting results, and
addressing any deficiencies or irregularities during the analytical
process.
1. DEFINITION
Rheumatoid Factor (RF) is an autoantibody that can be used as a
biomarker for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and other
autoimmune conditions. The RF level is typically measured using
immunoassay techniques.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge to obtain
serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum: Stable for up to 7 days at 4°C. For longer storage, freeze
at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples that may interfere with the
assay.
• Samples not properly labeled or with incomplete requisition forms.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader, chemiluminescence
analyzer)
• Commercial RF kits (e.g., ELISA, nephelometry)
• Calibrators and controls
• Mixers and pipettes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Controls
1. Prepare reagents and controls according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date.
3. Equilibrate reagents, calibrators, and controls to room
temperature prior to use.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Label and organize samples, calibrators, and controls in
appropriate test tubes or well plates.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum, calibrators, and controls
into designated wells or tubes.
3. Add the specified reagents to each well or tube according to the
kit’s protocol. Ensure thorough mixing.
4. Incubate for the duration and temperature specified in the
assay protocol.
5. Wash the wells or tubes as instructed, if applicable.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified time to
allow color development or signal generation.
7. Measure absorbance, light emission, or fluorescence using the
immunoassay analyzer.
C. Calculation and Interpretation
1. Generate the standard curve using the calibrators, plotting RF
concentration versus absorbance or signal.
2. Determine the RF concentration of the unknown samples from
the standard curve.
3. Document the results on the laboratory information system
(LIS) or manual logs.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with each
batch of patient samples.
6. Record quality control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before reporting patient results.
7. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the
immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Enter RF results into the LIS, ensuring verification by
designated personnel.
10. Flag and review any results that fall outside the reference range
or exhibit abnormal patterns.
11. Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician
as per laboratory policy.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < 20 IU/mL
• Positive: ≥ 20 IU/mL
Refer to manufacturer’s insert or recent clinical guidelines for specific
interpretation based on the patient population.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the accuracy
of the test.
3. Cross-reactivity with other immunoglobulins or interfering
substances may lead to false-positive or false-negative results.
4. RF levels should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
findings and other diagnostic tests.

• Manufacturer's kit insert for RF assay.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Peer-reviewed literature on RF measurement and clinical
relevance.

whenever there are changes in methodology, reagent specifications,
or laboratory policies.
