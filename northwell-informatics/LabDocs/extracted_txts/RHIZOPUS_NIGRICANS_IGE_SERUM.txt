STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
RHIZOPUS NIGRICANS, IgE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
measurement and reporting of IgE specific to Rhizopus nigricans in
serum samples, ensuring accuracy, precision, and compliance with
laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all personnel in the laboratory
responsible for the analysis and reporting of Rhizopus nigricans IgE
in serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible for
performing the assay as per this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol and addressing any procedural issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) and allowed to clot at room temperature before
centrifugation.
• Volume: A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required.
• Stability: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested
within 72 hours. For long-term storage, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C and -20°C)
• ELISA Reader
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Rhizopus nigricans IgE-specific ELISA kit or other validated assay
kits
• Microplate washer
• Timer
• Calibrated microplate reader (measuring at 450 nm with a 620 nm
reference filter if required)
6. REAGENTS
• ELISA reagents specific for Rhizopus nigricans IgE (coated
microplates, conjugate solution, wash buffer, substrate solution,
stop solution, standards, and controls)
• Deionized or distilled water
7. PROCEDURE Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, check specimens for proper labeling and integrity.
2. Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain serum. Transfer serum to a clean, labeled tube.
Assay Procedure:
1. All reagents and specimens must be brought to room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer and other reagents as per the kit
instructions.
3. Select the required number of wells on the microplate for
controls, standards, and samples.
4. Pipette standards, controls, and diluted samples (typically 1:10,
consult the kit insert for specific dilution) into the designated
wells.
5. Add the conjugate solution to each well as per the kit
instructions.
6. Incubate the plate as per the specified temperature and time
provided by the kit instructions (generally at room temperature
for 1 hour).
7. Wash the plate thoroughly using an automated plate washer or
manual method if specified.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate the plate
in the dark at room temperature for the time specified in the kit
(commonly 15-30 minutes).
9. Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
10. Read the optical density (OD) values at 450 nm with a
reference filter set to 620 nm using the ELISA reader within 30
minutes of stopping the reaction.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run to
ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Plot standard curves and use them to calculate IgE
concentrations in samples.
3. Repeat any assay where controls do not fall within the specified
ranges.
4. Document all QC results and take corrective action if the results
are outside acceptable limits.
9. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Calculate the mean OD value for each standard, control, and
sample.
2. Plot the standard curve using the mean OD values of the
standards.
3. Determine the concentration of Rhizopus nigricans IgE in the
samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
4. Express results in kilo units per liter (kU/L).
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the test results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results before reporting.
3. Report any critical values as specified in laboratory policies and
alert the requesting physician immediately.

12. DOCUMENTATION Maintain records of all assays performed,
including standard curves, control results, and patient results, in
compliance with laboratory documentation standards.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the reliable generation
and reporting of results for Rhizopus nigricans IgE in serum samples,
providing accurate diagnostic information to healthcare providers.
