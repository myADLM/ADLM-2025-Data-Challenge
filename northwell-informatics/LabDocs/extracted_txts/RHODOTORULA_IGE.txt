STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized method for the
analysis of RHODOTORULA Immunoglobulin E (IgE) to ensure
reliable and accurate results for patient diagnosis and monitoring.
This procedure is intended for use within a CLIA-certified laboratory
by trained personnel.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this
SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff
compliance and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
phase.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all RHODOTORULA IgE tests performed in
the laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS
RHODOTORULA IgE: Specific immunoglobulin E antibodies directed
against the yeast Rhodotorula, often associated with allergic
reactions.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader
• ELISA microplate washer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
• Heating block or incubator (37±1°C)
• Timer
• Sample storage containers
• RHODOTORULA IgE ELISA Kit:
◦ Microplate coated with RHODOTORULA antigens
◦ Calibrators
◦ IgE Antibody Conjugate
◦ Substrate Solution
◦ Stop Solution
◦ Wash Buffer
◦ Sample diluent
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Serum or plasma collected in SST, red-top, or
heparinized (dark green) tubes.
◦ Samples should be centrifuged immediately to collect the
serum or plasma and stored at 2-8°C if the analysis is
performed within 24 hours. Store at -20°C for longer storage
up to one month.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples, as well as
specimens collected in EDTA or sodium citrate.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the microplate by removing it from the protective
packaging.
3. Set up the ELISA reader and microplate washer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Prepare wash buffer from concentrate as per kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of wash buffer to all wells and incubate at room
temperature for 5 minutes.
2. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples to the
appropriate wells in duplicate.
◦ Use 1:5 dilution of patient serum or plasma in the sample
diluent.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Wash the plate 4 times with wash buffer, ensuring all wells are
thoroughly rinsed.
5. Add 100 µL of IgE Antibody Conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate 4 times with wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of Substrate Solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark.
9. Add 100 µL of Stop Solution to each well to stop the reaction.
10. Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 10 minutes using the
ELISA reader.
C. Calculation of Results
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
calibrators against their respective concentrations.
2. Determine the concentration of RHODOTORULA IgE in patient
samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (negative and positive) with each
batch of tests to ensure assay performance.
• If controls fall outside the established range, troubleshoot and
repeat the assay.
• Document all quality control activities in the Q.C. log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify and review results according to laboratory policies.
• Report abnormal or critical values immediately to the referring
clinician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for negative and positive RHODOTORULA IgE
are provided in the ELISA kit's package insert. Typically:
• Negative: < 0.35 kU/L
• Borderline: 0.35 to 0.70 kU/L
• Positive: > 0.70 kU/L
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the ELISA kit manufacturer's guidelines for detailed
troubleshooting:
• Common issues include high background, poor standard curve,
and inconsistent replicate results.
