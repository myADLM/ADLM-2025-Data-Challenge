1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps and procedures for the accurate and
efficient analysis of RHUBARB (RHEUM RHAPONTICUM) IGE levels
in blood samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff members are responsible for performing
and documenting the RHUBARB (RHEUM RHAPONTICUM) IGE
analysis according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to the protocol and addressing any issues that
may arise during the analytical phase.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Preferred specimen type.
• Plasma: Collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
proper storage.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum and plasma: Stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• ELISA Kit for RHUBARB (RHEUM RHAPONTICUM) IGE
(manufacturer's instructions should be followed)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at the required wavelengths
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Laboratory timer
• Plate washer or manual washing equipment
• Refrigerator and freezer meeting specified temperature
requirements
• Calibration and quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are brought to room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the required buffers and solutions as specified in the
ELISA kit insert.
Assay Setup:
1. Arrange the ELISA plate according to the kit instructions.
2. Pipette standards, controls, and patient samples into the
appropriate wells.
3. Add the detection antibody and substrate as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
Incubation and Washing:
1. Incubate the plate for the specified duration and conditions
(usually at room temperature or 37°C).
2. Wash the plate thoroughly according to the ELISA kit
instructions to remove unbound materials.
Detection and Analysis:
1. Add the substrate solution and incubate for the recommended
time.
2. Stop the reaction as indicated in the assay procedure.
3. Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
Results Calculation:
1. Calculate the RHUBARB (RHEUM RHAPONTICUM) IGE
concentration from the absorbance readings using the standard
curve generated from known standards.
2. Ensure results are within the acceptable range. Re-run the
assay if results are outside the expected range or if any issues
arise.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples along with patient samples to
ensure assay accuracy.
2. Document the results and check if they fall within the
acceptable limits.
3. Address any deviations as specified in the corrective action
procedure.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Verify and review the results before reporting them.
2. Enter the RHUBARB (RHEUM RHAPONTICUM) IGE levels
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines and ensure critical
values are communicated to the appropriate healthcare
provider.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for the specific reference intervals for
RHUBARB (RHEUM RHAPONTICUM) IGE.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for any limitations associated with the
assay.
