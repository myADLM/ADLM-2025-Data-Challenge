Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Quantitative Analysis of Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) in Plasma by
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
1. PURPOSE
This protocol details the method for the quantitative determination of
riboflavin (Vitamin B2) levels in plasma samples using High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The process includes
extracting riboflavin, chromatographic separation, and detection. The
subsequent results are used for evaluating riboflavin deficiency or
therapeutic monitoring.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of riboflavin in plasma samples
received in the clinical laboratory department.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
procedure accurately and document all steps, findings, and any
deviations from the protocol. Laboratory supervisors must ensure
compliance with this SOP and address any deficiencies.
4. DEFINITION
Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is an essential water-soluble vitamin involved
in various biological oxidation-reduction reactions.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
5.1 Preferred Specimen
• 5 mL of peripheral venous blood collected in a plasma separator
tube (PST) containing lithium heparin anticoagulant.
• Plasma must be separated within 30 minutes of collection.
5.2 Specimen Handling
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Carefully transfer plasma to a labeled polypropylene tube.
• Specimens are stable for 7 days when stored refrigerated (2-8°C)
and for 3 months when frozen (-20°C or colder). Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
5.3 Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens with inadequate labelling or visible contamination.
• Samples stored inaccurately beyond the stability windows
mentioned above.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
6.1 Equipment
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a fluorescence detector.
• Centrifuge (capable of 1500 x g).
• Refrigerator and -20°C freezer.
• Vortex mixer.
6.2 Reagents
• Riboflavin standard (commercially available).
• Mobile phase: 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and
methanol.
• Dilution buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
• Extraction solvent: Methanol.
6.3 Supplies
• Plasma separator tubes
• Polypropylene micro-centrifuge tubes
• HPLC grade water and methanol
• Disposable pipette tips
• Syringe filters (0.22 μm pore size)
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Sample Preparation
1. Vortex plasma sample briefly to ensure uniform mixture.
2. Transfer 200 µL of plasma to a clean micro-centrifuge tube.
3. Add 400 µL of methanol to precipitate proteins.
4. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
6. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new tube and filter using
a 0.22 μm syringe filter into an HPLC vial.
7.2 HPLC Analysis
1. Prepare standard solutions of riboflavin in methanol.
2. Program the HPLC system with the following conditions:
◦ Column: C18 reverse phase
◦ Column temperature: 25°C
◦ Mobile phase: 70% 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0)
and 30% methanol.
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Injection volume: 20 µL
◦ Detection: Fluorescence with excitation at 450 nm and
emission at 530 nm.
3. Inject standards and establish a calibration curve.
4. Inject 20 µL of each sample extract.
5. Identify and quantify riboflavin peaks by comparison to the
calibration curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
8.1 Quality Control Samples Prepare and analyze control plasma
samples spiked with known quantities of riboflavin alongside patient
samples to ensure assay accuracy and precision.
8.2 Calibration Perform calibration with riboflavin standards before
each assay run and after every 20 sample injections to monitor and
correct for potential drifts in system performance.
8.3 Maintenance and Troubleshooting Regularly review system
maintenance logs, and perform routine checks and calibrations of the
HPLC system as per manufacturer guidelines. Ensure adherence to
proper troubleshooting procedures in case of deviations.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Results will be transmitted to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and must be reviewed by the technologist prior to release. All
critical values must follow appropriate notification protocols.
10. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal plasma riboflavin range: 5 - 50 ng/mL
• Deficiency is indicated by levels below 5 ng/mL.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure careful handling and immediate processing of samples to
avoid degradation. Consider interferences from other naturally
occurring fluorescent compounds, and always validate results
through comparison to established control ranges and clinical
correlation.
