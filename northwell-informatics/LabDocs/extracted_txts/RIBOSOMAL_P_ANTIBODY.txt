Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Ribosomal P Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing and
generating results for Ribosomal P Antibody (Rib-P Ab) in serum
samples, ensuring accuracy and consistency in test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel are
properly trained and the procedure is followed correctly.
1. DEFINITION
Ribosomal P Antibody (Rib-P Ab) is an antibody associated with
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The presence of Rib-P Ab can
assist in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with SLE.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain or serum separation tube (SST).
◦ The preferred volume of serum is 1-2 mL.
◦ Centrifuge the sample to separate serum from blood cells
within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identifiers.
• Specimens not stored or transported at the recommended
temperature.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum specimens can be stored refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 48
hours.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for Ribosomal P
Antibody detection.
◦ Ensure that the kit is stored at 2-8°C and used before the
expiration date.
• Calibrators and controls provided in the ELISA kit.
• Micropipettes and disposable tips.
• ELISA plate reader capable of reading at 450 nm wavelength.
• Laboratory timer.
• Plate washer.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Setup:
• Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (18-25°C) before use.
• Label the ELISA plate with patient identifiers and position of
standards, controls, and samples.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to the
designated wells in duplicate.
2. Incubate the plate covered at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Wash the wells 4 times with the provided wash buffer using the
plate washer.
4. Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
5. Incubate the plate covered at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the wells 4 times again with the wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Measure absorbance at 450 nm within 30 minutes.
C. Quality Control:
• Run the provided positive and negative controls with each batch
of samples.
• Ensure that the absorbance values of controls fall within the
expected range before proceeding with patient sample validation.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
A. Result Calculation:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and samples.
• Use the standard curve (constructed using the absorbance values
of the standards) to determine the concentration of Ribosomal P
Antibody in patient samples.
B. Reference Range and Interpretation:
• Normal Range: <20 units/mL
• Borderline: 20-25 units/mL
• Positive: >25 units/mL
C. Result Reporting:
• Report results qualitatively (negative, borderline, positive) or
quantitatively (in units/mL) based on the laboratory’s reporting
protocol.
• Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing to the clinician.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL
A. Maintain records of equipment calibration and maintenance. B.
Follow internal and external quality control procedures to ensure
consistent performance. C. Periodically review and compare results
to identify trends or deviations.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Potential for cross-reactivity with other antibodies; results should
be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation
and other diagnostic tests.
• Improper sample handling or storage can affect test results.
