1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps and guidelines for
the analytical phase of generating results for Ribosome P Antibodies,
IgG, Serum. This ensures accurate diagnosis and monitoring of
autoimmune diseases, particularly Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
(SLE).
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assay, documenting the results, and ensuring the
reliability and accuracy of the test.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: - Serum
Collection and Handling: - Collect blood specimen using standard
venipuncture technique. - Allow blood to clot at room temperature. -
Centrifuge to separate serum. - Transfer the serum into a properly
labeled tube. - Store serum at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
Serum can be stored frozen at -20°C or lower for extended periods.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed specimens - Specimens
collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride, or EDTA tubes
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA plate reader
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Serum separator tubes
◦ Ribosome P Antibodies IgG ELISA kit (commercially
available)
◦ Incubator at 37°C
Storage: - Store ELISA kit components as per manufacturer's
instructions. - Ensure reagents are not expired before use.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation: - Bring all reagents, serum samples, and controls to
room temperature prior to use. - Set up microplate as per ELISA kit
instructions.
B. Assay Procedure: 1. Add appropriate volume of each serum
sample, calibrator, and control to the designated wells. 2. Incubate
the plate at 37°C for the specified time (as per kit instructions). 3.
Wash the plate several times to remove unbound substances. 4. Add
the enzyme conjugate to each well. 5. Incubate the plate again at
37°C for the specified time. 6. Perform the washing step again. 7.
Add substrate solution to the wells. 8. Incubate the plate at room
temperature in the dark until the color develops (time as per kit
instructions). 9. Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
C. Reading and Interpretation: - Read the optical density (OD) of
each well using a microplate reader set to the appropriate
wavelength (usually 450 nm). - Calculate the concentration of IgG
antibodies in the serum samples by comparing the OD values to the
calibration curve generated using the standards provided in the kit.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use positive and negative controls provided in the ELISA kit
to validate each run.
◦ Ensure the controls fall within the expected range.
◦ Record all quality control results in the QC log.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Log the OD readings and the calculated concentrations.
◦ Review and verify the results for accuracy.
◦ Report the results in accordance with site-specific reporting
guidelines.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal: Negative (provided by the kit insert)
◦ Positive results are indicative of the presence of Ribosome
P Antibodies IgG which may aid in the diagnosis of
autoimmune diseases like SLE.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Discuss any limitations related to the ELISA kit as per
manufacturer's insert, including potential interferences and
cross-reactions.
