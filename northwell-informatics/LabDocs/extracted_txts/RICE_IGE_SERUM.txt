SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for RICE, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for RICE (RAST ImmunoCAP Experimental), IGE
(Immunoglobulin E), and SERUM (General Serological tests).
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analytical
procedures according to this SOP and ensuring the accuracy and
quality of the test results. Supervisors are responsible for verifying
results and overseeing corrective actions if necessary.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
RICE:
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma (preferably EDTA-treated for
precision)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours; for long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
IGE:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days; for long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
SERUM:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days; for long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis.
• Specimens without proper labeling or patient information.
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer appropriate for RICE, IGE.
• General serological analyzers for SERUM tests.
• Specific reagents as per test manufacturer instructions.
• Calibration and control materials.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
4. PROCEDURE
A) Analyzer Setup and Calibration:
• Perform daily calibration checks using manufacturer-prescribed
calibration standards.
• Ensure all reagents are within expiry date.
• For new batches of reagents or calibration standards, perform lot-
to-lot validation.
B) Sample Preparation:
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled.
• Centrifuge serum samples at 1400-1500 g for 10 minutes to
remove cell debris.
• Aliquot appropriate volume of specimen into analyzer-specific
sample cups/tubes.
C) Running the Tests:
RICE:
1. Load serum/plasma samples into appropriate racks.
2. Input sample IDs and test codes into the analyzer.
3. Follow the automated protocol: incubation, washing, and
detection steps as prescribed.
4. Record results directly from analyzer output.
IGE:
1. Load serum samples into designated caps/spots.
2. Input sample IDs and test codes into the analyzer.
3. Follow the automated protocol: incubation, washing, and
detection steps as prescribed.
4. Record results directly from analyzer output.
SERUM:
1. Load serum samples as specified by the test (e.g., ELISA plate
wells, turbidimeter)
2. Perform non-automated manual steps as needed (e.g., washing
ELISA plates manually).
3. Input sample IDs and assay types into the respective analyzers.
4. Record results directly from analyzer output.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality controls: Two levels (high and low) at the
beginning and end of each run.
2. Document control results and ensure they fall within predefined
ranges.
3. Perform monthly external proficiency testing as required.
E) Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
• If results are outside predefined acceptable limits, repeat the test
using new aliquots.
• If control material fails, do not proceed with patient samples; notify
supervisor and investigate possible causes.
• Record any corrective actions in the laboratory log.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the analyzer output for any flags or errors.
• Record results in Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Calculate and enter manually any results requiring supplementary
computation.
• Review results for clinical significance in context.
• Provide results to physicians following site-specific reporting
guidelines.
6. REFERENCES
Cite applicable user manuals, package inserts, reference ranges, and
technical guidelines from assay manufacturers.
7. DOCUMENTATION
All records, including calibration logs, quality control logs, sample
accession logs, and results verification logs, will be maintained
according to CLIA requirements and laboratory policy.
8. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or upon any changes in analyzer
technology, assay protocol, or regulatory requirements. All updates
will be documented and communicated to laboratory staff.
