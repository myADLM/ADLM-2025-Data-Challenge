Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of RICE IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for RICE IgG testing in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and
reliability in the analysis and reporting of RICE IgG results.
Responsibility:
• Designated Laboratory Staff: Perform the testing according to
this procedure and document results.
• Supervisor: Oversee the testing process, ensure adherence to
protocols, review, and verify results.
1. DEFINITION
RICE IgG testing refers to the quantification of serum IgG antibodies
specific to rice antigens. This test typically involves an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a similar immunological assay
method.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection: Blood should be collected via venipuncture using a
sterile needle and syringe or vacutainer system.
• Volume: A minimum of 5 mL of blood is recommended.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored refrigerated (2-8°C) if not
tested immediately. Serum/plasma is stable for up to 7 days under
these conditions. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder,
ensuring it is free from repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA Plate: Coated with rice antigen.
• Wash Buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with Tween-20.
• Dilution Buffer: PBS or manufacturer-provided buffer.
• Conjugate: Anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
conjugate.
• Substrate: Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) or similar HRP substrate.
• Stop Solution: 0.5M sulfuric acid or similar.
• Microplate Reader: Capable of reading at 450 nm and 620-630
nm.
• Pipettes and Tips: Calibrated for accurate dispensing of
reagents.
• Temperature-controlled incubator: For maintaining assay
conditions.
C) Assay Procedure
1. Preparation: Allow all reagents, specimens, and equipment to
reach room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Dilution: Dilute patient sera as per manufacturer instructions,
typically 1:100 using dilution buffer.
3. Loading: Pipette 100 µL of diluted sera into assigned wells on
the ELISA plate.
4. Incubation: Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour
or as specified by the manufacturer.
5. Washing: Remove sera and wash the plate 3-5 times with
wash buffer, ensuring complete removal of liquid after each
wash.
6. Addition of Conjugate: Add 100 µL of conjugate to each well.
7. Incubation: Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30
minutes.
8. Washing: Wash the plate 3-5 times as previously described.
9. Substrate Reaction: Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well
and allow the reaction to proceed in the dark at room
temperature for 15-30 minutes, or until color development is
sufficient.
10. Stopping Reaction: Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to
halt the reaction.
11. Reading: Read the plate at 450 nm (primary absorbance) and
620-630 nm (reference/optional) using the microplate reader.
D) Quality Control
• Negative and Positive Controls: Run in duplicate on each plate
to ensure assay performance.
• Blank Control: Run blank wells containing only dilution buffer to
account for background absorbance.
• Standards: Use calibration standards for quantification of IgG
levels.
Document control results in the QC log. If controls are out of
acceptable range, troubleshoot per manufacturer recommendations
and do not report patient results until resolved.
E) Calculation of Results
Calculate patient results based on the standard curve generated from
the calibration standards. Report results in U/mL or similar unit as
specified by the assay kit.
F) Reporting Results
Review and verify results against quality control data. Report final
results in accordance with site-specific guidelines. Ensure critical
results are communicated promptly according to established
protocols.
G) Reference Intervals
Refer to the manufacturer’s documentation or established laboratory
reference intervals for RICE IgG levels.
H) Method Limitations
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations related to
interferents, cross-reactivity, or sensitivity/specificity.
