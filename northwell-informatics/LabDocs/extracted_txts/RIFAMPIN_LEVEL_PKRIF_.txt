Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
RIFAMPIN LEVEL (PKRIF)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to provide
standardized procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for Rifampin Level (PKRIF) to ensure accuracy,
consistency, and compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis of Rifampin levels.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that laboratory
personnel are appropriately trained and adhere to this protocol.
1. DEFINITION Rifampin (RIF) is an antibiotic used to treat
bacterial infections, including tuberculosis. Measurement of
Rifampin levels in patient samples is used to monitor
therapeutic drug levels and ensure proper dosing.
2. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Handling
• Specimen type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection tube: Red-top tube (no anticoagulant) for serum, or
lavender-top (EDTA) or green-top (heparin) tube for plasma.
• Specimen volume: Minimum of 1 mL is required.
• Collection time: Timing of specimen collection should correspond
with specified peak or trough measurements as per clinical
direction.
• Storage: Specimens should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) and
analyzed within 24 hours. If the analysis cannot be performed
within this time frame, samples should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV-Vis detector.
• Analytical column (C18, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size).
• Mobile phase: Water:acetonitrile (60:40) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid.
• Rifampin calibration standards.
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high concentration
controls).
• Sample vials and caps.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
C) Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare Rifampin calibration standards at concentrations ranging
from 0.5 to 50 µg/mL.
• Run calibration standards at the beginning of each analysis batch.
• Prepare and analyze quality control samples (low, medium, high
concentrations) at the start, middle, and end of each batch to
ensure accuracy and precision.
• Acceptable QC results should fall within ±15% of the nominal
value.
D) Sample Preparation
1. Thaw frozen samples (if applicable) and bring them to room
temperature.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum or plasma.
3. Transfer the supernatant to clean sample vials.
4. Vortex the samples briefly to ensure homogeneity.
E) HPLC Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system by following the manufacturer's
operational guidelines.
2. Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase for at least 30
minutes before running any samples.
3. Inject 20 µL of each calibration standard, quality control, and
patient sample into the HPLC system.
4. Set the detection wavelength at 254 nm.
5. Run the samples with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
6. Record the retention time and peak area for Rifampin in each
sample.
F) Data Analysis
1. Construct a calibration curve by plotting the peak area of
calibration standards against their concentrations.
2. Use the calibration curve to calculate the concentration of
Rifampin in quality control and patient samples.
3. Evaluate the quality control results to ensure they meet the
acceptance criteria.
4. Verify that the patient sample results are within the linear range
of the calibration curve.
G) Reporting Results
1. Record the calculated Rifampin levels in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Verify and validate the results according to laboratory
procedures before releasing them to the clinician.
3. Report any critical or unexpected results to the responsible
clinician immediately.
H) Quality Control and Documentation
• Document all calibration, quality control, and patient sample
analysis details in the appropriate logbooks.
• Maintain records of instrument maintenance and any
troubleshooting performed during the analytical process.
• Review and oversee documentation to ensure compliance with
CLIA regulations.
I) Method Limitations
• The described HPLC method is specific to Rifampin; other
substances may not be detected.
• Hemolyzed or significantly lipemic samples might interfere with
accurate Rifampin measurements.
J) References
• Refer to the HPLC system's user manual for detailed operational
instructions.
• Refer to the CLIA laboratory guidelines for compliance and quality
assurance standards.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
reliable measurement of Rifampin levels, allowing for appropriate
therapeutic monitoring and patient care.
