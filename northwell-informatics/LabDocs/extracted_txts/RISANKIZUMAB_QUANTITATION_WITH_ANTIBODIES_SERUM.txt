Standard Operating Procedure: RISANKIZUMAB QUANTITATION
WITH ANTIBODIES, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for the quantitation of Risankizumab and
detection of anti-Risankizumab antibodies in serum samples to
ensure accurate and consistent test results.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
Risankizumab quantitation and anti-Risankizumab antibody detection
in serum samples following the protocol outlined below. It is the
responsibility of all staff to report any deviations or equipment
malfunctions that may affect test results to the supervisor
immediately.
2. DEFINITION
Risankizumab quantitation involves measuring the concentration of
Risankizumab, a monoclonal antibody used for treating certain
inflammatory conditions, in serum samples. Detection of antibodies
against Risankizumab (anti-drug antibodies, ADA) assesses the
immunogenic response to the drug.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum 1.0 mL serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST). Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuge within
one hour of collection at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
• Storage: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis will be
performed within 48 hours. For long-term storage, serum should
be aliquoted and stored at -20°C or colder.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
*Calibrated analytical balance
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Risankizumab calibration standards
• Anti-Risankizumab antibody reference material
• ELISA kits for Risankizumab quantitation and ADA detection
• Plate reader compatible with the ELISA kits
• Buffer solutions as specified in ELISA kit instructions
• Controlled temperature incubator
5. PROCEDURE
A. RISANKIZUMAB QUANTITATION
• Reagents and Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and materials are at room temperature
before use.
◦ Prepare standard dilutions of Risankizumab as per the ELISA
kit instructions.
• Assay Procedure:
1. Label ELISA plate strips according to the number of
samples and standards to be tested.
2. Add the specified volume of prepared standards, controls,
and serum samples (diluted if necessary) to the wells.
3. Add the detection antibody solution to each well and
incubate as per the kit instructions.
4. Wash the wells with the provided wash buffer (usually 3-5
washes recommended).
5. Add the substrate solution and incubate for the specified
duration.
6. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution when the color
development is sufficient.
7. Measure the absorbance using an ELISA plate reader at the
wavelength specified in the kit instructions.
• Result Calculation:
◦ Construct a standard curve from the absorbance values of the
Risankizumab standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Risankizumab in patient
samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
B. ANTI-RISANKIZUMAB ANTIBODY DETECTION (ADA)
• Reagents and Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and materials are at room temperature
before use.
◦ Prepare positive control and negative control samples
according to ELISA kit instructions.
• Assay Procedure:
1. Label ELISA plate strips according to the number of
samples and controls to be tested.
2. Add the specified volume of serum samples, positive
control, and negative control to the wells.
3. Incubate the plate as per kit instructions to allow antibodies
to bind.
4. Wash the wells with the provided wash buffer (usually 3-5
washes recommended).
5. Add the enzyme-conjugated anti-human antibody and
incubate for the specified duration.
6. Wash the wells again and add the substrate solution.
7. Stop the reaction at the indicated time and measure the
absorbance at the specified wavelength.
• Result Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the antibody levels by comparing patient sample
absorbance values to the positive and negative control values.
◦ Report if the patient has detectable levels of anti-
Risankizumab antibodies based on the assay cut-off criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include low, medium, and high controls in each run for both
Risankizumab quantitation and ADA detection.
• Verify that control results fall within the specified ranges.
• Document all quality control data, and investigate any out-of-
range values before proceeding with patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are documented in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Verify and review patient results before reporting.
• For anomalous results, re-test the sample and/or discuss with the
supervisor before releasing final results.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples can interfere with
assay results.
• Improper sample handling or storage can affect the stability of
Risankizumab and antibodies.
• Refer to ELISA kit instructions for detailed information on reagent-
specific limitations and troubleshooting steps.

10. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps, QC data, deviations, and corrective actions should be
thoroughly documented in laboratory records and reviewed before
results are finalized.
