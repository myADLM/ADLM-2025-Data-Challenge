Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Risankizumab,
Serum
1. PURPOSE To ensure the accurate and reliable testing of
risankizumab levels in serum specimens by standardizing the
analytical phase of testing.
Responsibility: The medical laboratory scientists are responsible for
performing the procedures as outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all personnel are
adequately trained on the procedures.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to the quantification of
risankizumab in serum samples in the laboratory via High-
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or any other validated
method.
3. DEFINITION Risankizumab: A monoclonal antibody used in the
treatment of certain autoimmune conditions, measured here in serum
for therapeutic drug monitoring purposes.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in SST (Serum Separator
Tube).
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL serum.
• Specimen Stability: Serum must be separated from cells within 2
hours of collection. Samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours or at -20°C for longer storage.
4.2 Equipment and Reagents
• HPLC or equivalent validated system.
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Calibrators, Controls, and Standards for Risankizumab.
• Mobile phase and other HPLC reagents.
• LC vials and caps.
• Standard Laboratory PPE.
4.3 Calibration and Quality Control
• Calibration Curve: Prepare a calibration curve using at least five
risankizumab standards spanning the expected concentration
range.
• Quality Control: Run low, medium, and high-quality controls at
the beginning of each run. Expected targets and acceptable
ranges must be documented.
4.4 Analytical Procedure
1. Specimen Preparation: Thaw frozen specimens, if applicable,
and ensure they are at room temperature. Mix well, avoiding
any bubbles.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Pipette 500 µL of clear serum and transfer to an LC vial.
◦ Seal vial with a cap and load onto the HPLC sample tray.
3. HPLC Initialization:
◦ Start the HPLC system and ensure it is equilibrated with the
mobile phase.
◦ Prime the column with at least 10 column volumes of the
mobile phase.
4. Injection:
◦ Set up the sample sequence, calibrators, and controls on
the HPLC software.
◦ Inject 20 µL of each sample, standard, and control
consecutively.
◦ Ensure appropriate software parameters are set for
detection (e.g., wavelength, flow rate).
5. Run Analysis:
◦ Start the HPLC run.
◦ Monitor system performance through the chromatogram
outputs ensuring acceptable peak shape and retention
times.
6. Data Analysis:
◦ After run completion, review chromatograms and compare
retention times and peak areas against the calibration curve.
◦ Calculate the concentration of risankizumab in each serum
sample utilizing the generated calibration curve.
4.5 Interpretation and Reporting of Results
1. Review Results:
◦ Review the calculated results for each sample, ensuring
they fall within the validated calibration range.
◦ Repeat any out-of-range or discrepant results with fresh
aliquots.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Include control and calibration data alongside patient
results.
3. Verification:
◦ Technologist must verify and digitally sign off on results
before reporting.
◦ Flag any results outside the therapeutic range as per site-
specific guidelines.
4. Reporting:
◦ Transmit results to the appropriate healthcare provider
through the LIS.
4.6 Quality Assurance
• Adherence to the laboratory’s quality control program throughout
testing.
• Participation in external quality assurance programs specific to
therapeutic drug monitoring where applicable.
• Review and documentation of any corrective actions when control
results fall outside pre-defined limits.
5. REFERENCES
• Method-specific package inserts and technical sheets.
• Manufacturer’s instrument manuals.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and therapeutic ranges for
risankizumab.
6. REVISION TRACKING
• Document revision history, including dates and nature of changes
made.
