Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Generating RISK SCORE, IF
POSTMENOPAUSAL, SERUM Results
1. PURPOSE:
This procedure outlines the steps to analyze, generate, and
document the RISK SCORE for postmenopausal women using
serum samples. Providing accurate and consistent results is crucial
for assessing the risk score related to health conditions in
postmenopausal women.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists will perform the analysis,
document results, and ensure data integrity.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
analysis process and ensuring adherence to the SOP.
2. DEFINITION:
RISK SCORE, IF POSTMENOPAUSAL, SERUM: A calculated score
derived from the analysis of specific biomarkers in postmenopausal
women to assess their risk for certain health conditions.
3. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/Acceptable: 5 mL serum sample, obtained from a
fasting blood draw stored in a SST (Serum Separator Tube).
• Unacceptable: Specimens showing hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus; improperly labeled specimens; specimens not stored
under specified conditions; specimens with excessive sample age
(>72 hours post-collection).
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Assay specific reagents and kits
• Quality control materials
• Appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
C. Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Upon specimen receipt, verify the integrity and proper labeling
of the sample.
2. Centrifuge the SST at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
3. Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled microtubes.
4. Store the aliquots at 2-8°C until analysis, ensuring analysis
within 72 hours of collection.
D. Assay Setup and Calibration:
1. Refer to the manufacturer's insert for the specific assay kit to be
used.
2. Set up the calibration curve using the known standards
provided with the assay kit.
3. Run quality control (QC) samples at two levels (low and high) to
ensure assay performance.
4. Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding.
E. Analysis Procedure:
1. Prepare the samples by thawing them to room temperature if
stored refrigerated.
2. Follow the assay procedure as detailed in the assay kit’s
protocol. This typically involves:
◦ Pipetting specified volumes of each reagent and sample/
controls into designated wells or tubes.
◦ Incubating at specific temperatures and durations.
◦ Washing steps as necessary.
◦ Adding detection reagents and reading the signal using
appropriate detection equipment (e.g., spectrophotometer,
ELISA reader).
3. Ensure proper use of PPE and maintain a clean working
environment to prevent contamination.
F. Calculation of RISK SCORE:
1. Record the absorbance/optical density readings as required by
the assay protocol.
2. Use the calibration curve to calculate the concentration of the
biomarkers in the unknown samples.
3. Input the biomarker concentrations into the validated software
or mathematical model to calculate the RISK SCORE for
postmenopausal patients.
4. Verify that all calculations are accurate and document results.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Transcribe the calculated risk scores into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results by a senior technologist or
supervisor.
3. Report the verified results as per laboratory guidelines.
4. Document any deviations or anomalies encountered during the
analysis and take appropriate corrective actions.
H. Quality Control and Assurance:
1. Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
2. Document QC results and implement corrective actions if
results do not fall within the acceptable range.
3. Calibrate and maintain equipment as per SOP.
