Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysing RISK SCORE
IF PREMENOPAUSAL SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary to
analyze serum samples to generate a risk score for premenopausal
patients. This protocol ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency
in the analytical phase of processing serum samples.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory technologists are responsible for following
this protocol. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance
and addressing any issues that may arise during the analytical
process.
1. DEFINITION
Risk score analysis for premenopausal serum involves evaluating
specific biomarkers and clinical parameters to provide a risk
assessment related to premenopausal conditions. This procedure will
detail the steps for sample preparation, assay performance, data
analysis, and reporting.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the receipt and accessioning of serum samples have
been completed.
2. Ensure that samples have been stored at 2-8°C and handled
according to laboratory standards.
3. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the
serum from other components, if not already done.
4. Aliquot the serum into appropriate labeled tubes for analysis.
B. Assay Performance:
1. Calibrate and prepare the analyzer (e.g., immunoassay
analyzer, mass spectrometer, etc.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare all necessary reagents, controls, and standards. a.
Ensure that all materials are within their expiration dates. b.
Bring reagents to room temperature before use, if required.
3. Load the samples, reagents, standards, and controls into the
analyzer.
4. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay protocol for
the specific biomarkers being assessed (e.g., hormone levels,
protein concentrations, etc.).
5. Start the assay run and monitor for any system alerts or errors
during the process.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Once the assay run is complete, retrieve the raw data from the
analyzer.
2. Validate the control and standard results to ensure assay
performance is within acceptable limits.
3. Analyze the patient sample results using the established
calculation methods for the specific assay.
4. Calculate the risk score based on predefined algorithms and
reference ranges specific to premenopausal risk assessment.
5. Perform a quality control check to ensure the accuracy and
consistency of all generated results.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Document the following details in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS): a. Patient identification. b. Sample accession
number. c. Assay date and time. d. Assay results, including
individual biomarker levels. e. Calculated risk score.
2. Verify the results, including the risk score, against the expected
reference intervals and validate them for clinical relevance.
3. Ensure that any critical or unexpected results are flagged and
brought to the attention of the responsible clinician for
immediate action.
4. Generate a final report for review and signoff by the supervising
technologist or pathologist.
5. Release the validated results into the patient’s electronic
medical record.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Run internal quality controls at the beginning of each assay batch.
B. Follow the laboratory's standard control procedures for reagent lot
validation, analyzer calibration, and periodic performance checks. C.
Document all quality control results and interventions taken for any
out-of-control situations.

1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s manual and assay-specific documents
for limitations concerning sensitivity, specificity, and potential
interferences.
Note: Handle all specimens and materials according to the
laboratory’s safety and waste disposal protocols.
