Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Risperidone (Risperdal) and 9-Hydroxyrisperidone
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure required for the quantitative determination of
Risperidone and 9-Hydroxyrisperidone in patient samples using High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to perform
this procedure in accordance with the guidelines outlined. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel
are trained and proficient in this procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Human plasma collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma samples are stable for 24 hours at room temperature.
• Plasma samples are stable for up to 1 week when refrigerated
(2-8°C).
• Plasma samples are stable for up to 1 month when frozen (-20°C
or lower).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected without anticoagulants.
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples that have been exposed to multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC system coupled with mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Sample preparation vials
• Reagents and standards: Risperidone, 9-Hydroxyrisperidone, and
internal standard (IS)
• HPLC-grade solvents: Methanol, acetonitrile, and water
• Plasma separator tubes (EDTA)
5. REAGENT PREPARATION
Calibration Standards: Prepare calibration standards of
Risperidone and 9-Hydroxyrisperidone by diluting stock solutions in
HPLC-grade methanol. Prepare serial dilutions to cover the
concentration range of interest.
Internal Standard (IS) Solution: Prepare internal standard solution
at a known concentration in HPLC-grade methanol.
Mobile Phase: Prepare the mobile phase using a mixture of HPLC-
grade water, methanol, and acetonitrile according to the method's
requirements. Filter and degas the mobile phase before use.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the plasma samples at 2000-3000 x g for 10 minutes
to separate the plasma.
2. Pipette 200 µL of the plasma sample into a clean sample
preparation vial.
3. Add 50 µL of the internal standard solution to each vial.
4. Add 300 µL of acetonitrile to each vial to precipitate proteins.
5. Vortex the samples for 1 minute.
6. Centrifuge the samples at 12000 x g for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for injection into the LC-
MS/MS system.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare a calibration curve by injecting calibration standards
into the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations and process these in the same manner as
patient samples.
3. Run calibration standards and QC samples at the beginning of
the analytical run and after every 20 patient samples.
C. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Program the LC-MS/MS system with the appropriate method
parameters for Risperidone and 9-Hydroxyrisperidone.
2. Inject 10-20 µL of the prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS
system.
3. Monitor the chromatographic signals and ensure that retention
times are consistent with those of the calibration standards.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Analyze the data using the LC-MS/MS software and generate a
calibration curve typically by plotting the response ratio of the
analyte to the internal standard against the known
concentrations of the calibration standards.
2. Calculate the concentrations of Risperidone and 9-
Hydroxyrisperidone in the patient samples using the calibration
curve.
3. Review the data for QC samples to ensure they fall within the
acceptable ranges.
4. Report the concentrations of Risperidone and 9-
Hydroxyrisperidone in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. Flag and review any results outside established reference
ranges or those flagged as critical.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Use QC samples to ensure the accuracy and precision of the
analysis. QC samples should be included at the beginning,
middle, and end of each run.
2. Review and document the QC results. Any deviations should be
investigated, and corrective actions should be taken as
necessary.
3. Participate in proficiency testing when available to ensure
ongoing competency.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Handle all specimens using universal precautions.
2. Dispose of biohazardous and chemical waste according to
local, state, and federal regulations.
3. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses when handling
specimens and reagents.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the preparation and use of
calibration standards, internal standards, and QC samples.
• Laboratory safety guidelines and local regulations on biohazard
waste disposal.
11. DOCUMENT CONTROL
The document should be reviewed annually and updated as needed
by the Laboratory Supervisor. Any significant changes in the
procedure or instrumentation should be documented and retraining
provided to all relevant personnel.
12. APPENDICES
Include any relevant appendices, such as LC-MS/MS instrument
method parameters, troubleshooting guides, and detailed instructions
for reagent preparation.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate and precise determination of Risperidone and 9-
Hydroxyrisperidone levels in patient specimens, thereby contributing
to effective patient management.
