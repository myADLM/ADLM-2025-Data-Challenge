Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Rivaroxaban, Anti-Xa, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the accurate
and reproducible measurement of Rivaroxaban levels in plasma
using the Anti-Xa assay to ensure reliable and consistent results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the assay as outlined in this procedure and ensure data
integrity.
• Supervisors must verify the results and ensure adherence to
quality control measures.
1. DEFINITION
• Rivaroxaban: An oral anticoagulant that works by inhibiting factor
Xa, used to prevent and treat blood clots.
• Anti-Xa assay: A laboratory test used to measure the inhibition of
factor Xa activity in plasma.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated automated coagulation analyzer
• Rivaroxaban calibrators and controls (commercially available)
• Anti-Xa assay kit specific for Rivaroxaban
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Plasma-specimen tubes (citrate plasma)
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Appropriate log sheets and documentation forms
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 3.2% sodium citrate plasma, collected and
processed according to standard venipuncture technique.
• Specimens must be processed and analyzed within 4 hours of
collection or frozen at -20°C if the delay is anticipated.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted
samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
2. Prewarm all reagents and calibrators to room temperature
before use.
3. Set up the automated coagulation analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions and verify calibration is up to date.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration using Rivaroxaban calibrators according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure that the calibration curve meets the manufacturer’s
criteria for acceptance.
2. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high controls)
before patient specimens:
◦ Control results should be within the manufacturer’s
recommended ranges.
◦ If control values are outside the acceptable range, perform
troubleshooting as detailed in the manufacturer's
instructions.
C) Sample Handling and Processing
1. Centrifuge plasma tubes at 3000 RPM for 15 minutes to obtain
platelet-poor plasma.
2. Carefully transfer the plasma into a secondary labeled
container without disturbing the buffy coat layer.
3. If samples cannot be processed immediately, place in a -20°C
freezer.
D) Assay Procedure
1. Load the prepared plasma samples, calibrators, and controls
into the automated coagulation analyzer.
2. Select the Anti-Xa assay protocol specific for Rivaroxaban.
3. Follow the instrument prompts to start the analysis.
4. Ensure that the instrument performs the assay according to the
programmed method.
5. Monitor the assay process for any flagged results or error
messages.
E) Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Once the assay is complete, review the results for calibration,
quality control, and patient specimens.
2. Document the results in the appropriate laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. If results fall outside the expected range or critical values are
observed, notify the supervisor immediately.
4. Critical values must be communicated to the relevant
healthcare provider according to laboratory policy.
F) Troubleshooting
1. If calibration fails:
◦ Check the expiry date and storage conditions of the
calibrators.
◦ Rerun the calibration and ensure proper handling.
2. If control results fall outside the acceptable range:
◦ Verify the integrity of control materials.
◦ Review and, if necessary, rerun the control samples.
◦ If issues persist, run fresh controls and inform the supervisor
for further action.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Establish and maintain an internal quality control program for
continuous monitoring.
5. Document all quality control activities, including any corrective
actions, in a designated logbook.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Verify all results in the LIS before reporting.
8. Include relevant patient demographics and any comments
regarding sample integrity or assay performance.
9. Report results within the established turnaround time.
10. MAINTENANCE
11. Regularly maintain and clean the coagulation analyzer as per
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
12. Keep a log of maintenance activities and any conducted repairs
in the maintenance record book.
