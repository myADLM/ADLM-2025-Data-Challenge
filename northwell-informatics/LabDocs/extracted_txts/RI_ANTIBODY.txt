Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Rheumatoid Factor
(RF) and Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed guidelines for the analytical phase in the
measurement of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and various other
antibodies to ensure accuracy, precision, and validity of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all clinical laboratory personnel performing
RF and antibody testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory technicians/technologists and
supervisors to follow this procedure and ensure adherence to quality
and safety guidelines.
4. DEFINITIONS
• RF: Rheumatoid Factor, an autoantibody detected in the blood.
• Antibody testing: Measurement of specific antibodies in the
blood to diagnose various diseases.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
1. Specimen Type:
◦ Serum samples are preferred.
◦ Plasma samples can be accepted if collected using
appropriate anticoagulants.
2. Specimen Collection:
◦ Ensure the sample is properly labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
◦ Samples should be collected in SST (Serum Separator
Tubes) and allowed to clot for 30 minutes, followed by
centrifugation.
3. Specimen Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Unhemolyzed serum/plasma should be used.
◦ Samples should be free of lipemia and icterus as they
interfere with the assays.
◦ Adequately filled tubes to avoid dilution or concentration
errors.
◦ Unacceptable specimens include those that are hemolyzed,
clotted if using anticoagulated samples, or improperly
labeled samples.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Reagents:
◦ Use only validated and approved reagent kits.
◦ Store reagents as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date.
2. Quality Control Material:
◦ Utilize Positive and Negative controls for each assay run.
◦ Refer to QC material storage and handling guidelines.
C. Instrumentation:
1. Equipment Required:
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzers (specific model should
be indicated) or manual ELISA readers.
◦ Centrifuges for serum/plasma separation.
2. Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:
◦ Ensure the operating environment for the instruments is
within specified temperature (20-26°C) and humidity
(15-85%) limits.
◦ Monitor and log the temperature and humidity daily (refer to
Example SOP 1).
D. Testing Procedure:
1. Automated Procedures:
◦ Prepare samples and reagents according to manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Load samples, calibrators, controls, and reagents into the
analyzer.
◦ Follow instrument specific protocol to start the assay.
◦ Review the results for flags or errors post-analysis.
2. Manual Procedures (if automated systems are down):
◦ Prepare ELISA plates and reagents as per manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Perform the assay in stepwise fashion, strictly following
incubation times and temperatures.
◦ Read the plates using ELISA plate reader at specified
wavelengths.
◦ Record the results and compare with control samples.
E. Quality Control:
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run internal controls with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Acceptable ranges for control results should be predefined
and deviations should prompt retesting or troubleshooting.
2. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
validate the accuracy of results.
F. Reporting and Validation:
1. Reviewing Results:
◦ Evaluate the results against reference ranges.
◦ Use standard QC procedures to accept or reject test runs.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all findings, QC outcomes, and any corrective
actions taken in the appropriate logbooks.
◦ Maintain all records as per regulatory requirements.
3. Result Verification:
◦ Results must be reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist.
◦ Any critical or unexpected results should be communicated
to the relevant healthcare providers promptly.
G. Troubleshooting:
1. Instrument Errors:
◦ Refer to instrument manufacturer's guidelines for specific
error codes and troubleshooting steps.
◦ If recurring issues are identified, escalate to supervisor or
technical support.
2. Out-of-Control QC:
◦ Reassess sample handling and reagent preparation steps.
◦ Re-run controls and patient samples if necessary.
◦ Document root-cause analysis and corrective actions taken.
H. Safety and Waste Disposal:
1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
◦ Always wear appropriate lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
2. Waste Disposal:
◦ Dispose of biohazardous waste in designated containers.
◦ Follow institutional waste management protocols.
