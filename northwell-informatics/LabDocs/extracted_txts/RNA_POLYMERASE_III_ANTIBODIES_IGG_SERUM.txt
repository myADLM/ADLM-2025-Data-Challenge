Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for RNA Polymerase III
Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to delineate the
procedure for the accurate and reliable measurement of RNA
Polymerase III (RNAP III) antibodies, IgG, in serum samples.
This test is used for the detection of autoimmune diseases,
particularly systemic sclerosis.
Responsibility: All trained personnel in the immunology section of the
laboratory are responsible for performing this test as per this SOP.
They must ensure that results are accurately recorded and that any
deviations or issues are reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION RNAP III Antibodies, IgG: Autoantibodies directed
against RNA Polymerase III enzyme, indicative of certain
autoimmune disorders.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES A. Equipment:
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Microplate Washer
• Pipettes (single and multichannel)
• Centrifuge
B. Reagents and Supplies:
• ELISA Kit for RNA Polymerase III Antibodies, IgG
• Microwell plates
• Calibrators and Controls (Negative, Low, Medium, and High)
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
• Washing Buffer
• Serum Samples
• Disposable pipette tips
• Distilled or deionized water
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
2. Centrifuge serum sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot the serum into properly labeled microtubes.
B. ELISA Assay Procedure:
1. Reagents and samples should be brought to room temperature
before use.
2. Set up the microplate layout, including standards, controls, and
patient samples.
3. Add 100 μL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples into
appropriate wells. Perform all tests in duplicate.
4. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Wash the microplate 3 times with washing buffer using the
microplate washer.
6. Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well.
7. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
8. Wash the microplate 5 times with washing buffer.
9. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
10. Incubate the microplate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
11. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
12. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader within 30 minutes.
C. Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Calculate the average absorbance values for each standard,
control, and sample.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their concentrations.
3. Determine the concentration of RNA Polymerase III antibodies
in patient samples using the standard curve.
4. Results are expressed in Units/mL. The reference range for
RNAP III antibodies is as defined by the manufacturer.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run calibrators and controls with every batch of tests.
7. Acceptable ranges for controls must be met for the test results
to be valid.
8. Any deviation from expected control values requires
troubleshooting, repeating the assay, or notifying the supervisor.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
delivery to clinicians.
11. Any results above the reference range must be flagged and
reviewed.
12. LIMITATIONS
13. Hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination can affect results.
14. It is essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions for the
reagent kit.
