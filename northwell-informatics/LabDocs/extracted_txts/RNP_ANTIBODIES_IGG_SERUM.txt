Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for RNP
Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standard procedures for
analyzing serum samples for the presence and concentration of RNP
antibodies, IgG. This includes preparation, testing, quality control,
and result reporting to ensure reliable and accurate laboratory
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform RNP
antibodies, IgG serum testing according to this protocol. The
technologist is also responsible for maintaining documentation and
notifying the supervisor of any issues that may affect result accuracy.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Minimum of 2 mL serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Specimen should be centrifuged and separated from the clot or
cells as soon as possible after collection to prevent hemolysis.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens, grossly lipemic or icteric specimens.
• Specimens that have not been appropriately separated.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA,
chemiluminescent immunoassay)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
Reagents:
• RNP antibodies IgG-specific assay kits (manufacturer specified)
• Controls (negative, positive, and cutoff controls)
• Calibrators
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Review the specimen requirements and check for any
unacceptable conditions.
2. Ensure all reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates and stored appropriately.
Testing:
1. Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators following
the specific guidelines in the assay kit insert.
3. Prepare samples by centrifuging blood samples at 1500 x g for
10 minutes if not already done.
4. Pipette serum samples, controls, and calibrators into the
respective wells of the assay plate or analyzer container.
5. Run the assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
including all incubation steps and any washing procedures.
Quality Control:
1. Run negative, positive, and cutoff controls with each batch of
specimens to verify assay performance.
2. Ensure that control results fall within the pre-defined ranges. If
controls fail, troubleshoot and repeat the assay before testing
patient samples.
3. Document all QC results and take corrective action if
necessary.
Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Collect the quantitative or qualitative data from the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Verify that all sample results fall within the assay’s analytical
range.
3. Ensure that all results are reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
4. Record and report results according to site-specific guidelines,
including any flags for abnormal or critical values.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: < Cutoff value (defined in kit insert)
• Positive: ≥ Cutoff value (defined in kit insert)
Limitations:
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations regarding the
RNP antibodies IgG assay.
• Results should be interpreted with other clinical data for
diagnostic purposes.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
2. Maintain records of all specimen handling, test procedures,
results, QC data.
3. Ensure all logs and documentation are stored securely and are
accessible for review.
4. Any deviations from the standard protocol should be
documented along with corrective actions taken.
