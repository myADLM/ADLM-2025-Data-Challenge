1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of RO52 and RO60 antibodies, IgG, in serum samples.
This ensures consistent, reliable results for diagnostic purposes.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: 5 mL blood drawn into a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrated tubes.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated ELISA Instrument or Semi-automated ELISA Plate
Reader
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
Reagents:
• RO52 and RO60 Antibody, IgG ELISA Test Kit (Manufacturer-
specific, ensuring adherence to manufacturer's insert)
• Calibrators, controls, and samples
• Washing buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive and negative control sera provided with the ELISA kit
• Internal laboratory controls: Biorad Serodos 1, Serodos 2
Procedure:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Ensure controls are within the expected range provided in the kit
insert.
• Document all control results. If controls do not fall within
acceptable ranges, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s
instructions before processing patient samples.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
2. Transfer serum into a clean, properly labeled tube.
3. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, controls, and samples are at room
temperature.
◦ Prepare washing buffer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Carefully add required volume of diluent, calibrators,
controls, and patient serum samples to the designated wells
in the ELISA plate.
◦ Follow the kit-specific instructions for incubation times and
temperatures. Typically, incubate at 37°C for 30-60 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash each well multiple times using the washing buffer, as
per manufacturer’s instructions, to remove unbound
substances.
4. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate as
specified by the kit insert (usually 10-30 minutes, protected
from light).
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well. The stop solution color
typically changes indicating the reaction is halted.
6. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength (e.g., 450
nm) using an ELISA plate reader.
◦ Ensure the reading is taken within the timeframe specified
by the kit insert after adding the stop solution.
6. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each calibrator, control,
and sample.
◦ Plot the absorbance values versus the concentration of the
calibrators on a standard curve.
◦ Determine the concentration of RO52 and RO60 antibodies
in the patient serum from this standard curve.
2. Reference Ranges and Interpretation:
◦ Negative: Below the cut-off value specified by the kit
manufacturer.
◦ Equivocal: As defined by the manufacturer.
◦ Positive: Above the cut-off value specified by the kit
manufacturer.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include any relevant comments about sample integrity or
deviations from the standard procedure.
• Verify and release results according to laboratory protocol.
8. LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with the
assay.
• Procedural errors, such as improper washing or timing deviations,
can affect test outcomes.
• High levels of unrelated antibodies or immune complexes in
patient serum can potentially interfere with results.
