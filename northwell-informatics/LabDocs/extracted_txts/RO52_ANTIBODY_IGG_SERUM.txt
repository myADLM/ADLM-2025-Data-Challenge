Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for RO52 ANTIBODY, IGG,
SERUM Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the accurate and reliable analysis
of RO52 Antibody, IgG in serum specimens.
2. PRINCIPLE
The RO52 Antibody, IgG test is used primarily as an aid in the
diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. The procedure typically involves
a serum sample analyzed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA) or immunoblotting methods to detect the presence of
antibodies.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform RO52 Antibody, IgG, Serum testing.
4. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Lab Technologists: Responsible for performing the test according
to this SOP.
• Lab Supervisor: Ensures that the technologists perform the test
correctly and verifies the final results.
• Quality Control Officer: Monitors and maintains the quality control
records and ensures compliance with standard guidelines.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Human serum.
• Collection: Blood is drawn by venipuncture and allowed to clot.
• Processing: Serum is separated from the clot by centrifugation.
• Storage: Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Micropipettes and tips
• Tubes for sample dilution
• ELISA Microplate or immunoblot strips
• RO52 Antigen-coated microplate or strips
• Incubator or plate shaker
• Washing buffer, substrate solution, stop solution (for ELISA)
• Primary and secondary antibodies
• Microplate reader or imaging system for immunoblotting
• Positive and negative control sera
7. PROCEDURE
A. ELISA Method:
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
◦ Prepare the washing buffer and other necessary reagents
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Dilute serum samples (1:100) in sample diluent or buffer as
specified by the kit instructions.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted samples, standards, and controls into
the appropriate wells of the RO52-coated microplate.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C or as specified by the
manufacturer with gentle shaking.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 3-4 times with washing buffer to remove
unbound antibodies.
5. Adding Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-linked secondary antibody to each
well.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking.
6. Final Wash:
◦ Wash the wells 3-4 times with washing buffer.
7. Developing the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate
for 10-15 minutes, or as specified.
◦ Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
8. Reading Results:
◦ Measure absorbance at the appropriate wavelength
(typically 450 nm) using a microplate reader.
B. Immunoblotting Method:
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Add 10 µL of serum sample to the RO52 antigen-coated
strip in the incubation tray.
◦ Add positive and negative control sera in indicated wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the strip for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle
shaking.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash strips thoroughly to remove unbound antibodies.
5. Adding Conjugate:
◦ Add secondary antibody conjugated with an enzyme or
fluorescent marker.
◦ Incubate for the specified time, generally 30 minutes to 1
hour.
6. Final Wash:
◦ Wash the strips thoroughly again.
7. Developing:
◦ Add substrate solution if using enzyme-linked anti-IgG and
incubate until color develops. For fluorescent markers, read
immediately using an imaging system.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with every batch of tests that includes
positive and negative controls.
• Document and review all quality control measures.
• Results from quality controls must be within acceptable ranges
before patient samples can be reported.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate results based on optical density (OD) for ELISA or band
intensity for immunoblotting.
• Interpret results as follows:
◦ Positive: Presence of RO52 antibody, confirming test
significance levels.
◦ Negative: Absence of RO52 antibody.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify accuracy and completeness before releasing.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High lipemia, hemolysis, or icterus may interfere with test results.
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for detailed limitations.
