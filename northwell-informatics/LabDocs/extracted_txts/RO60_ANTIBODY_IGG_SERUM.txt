Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase: RO60 Antibody, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for RO60 Antibody, IgG, Serum, ensuring accuracy and
reliability of the results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis as described in this SOP. The supervisor is responsible for
ensuring all personnel are trained on and adhere to this SOP.
3. DEFINITION
RO60 Antibody, IgG (also known as SSA/Ro60 antibody) is an
autoantibody primarily associated with Sjögren's syndrome and
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected via venipuncture into a
serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Handling:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the SST tube to separate the serum from the clotted
blood.
• Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately. For
long-term storage, keep at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis.
• Specimens that have been stored at inappropriate temperatures.
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 nm with a
reference at 620-630 nm
Reagents and Supplies:
• RO60 Antibody, IgG ELISA kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Laboratory glassware (pipettes, tips, etc.)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient sera into
their respective wells in duplicate.
2. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Aspirate and wash each well 3 times with 300 µL of wash
buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
5. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Aspirate and wash each well 5 times with 300 µL of wash
buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15 minutes.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
10. Read the optical density (OD) using a microplate reader at 450
nm with a reference at 620-630 nm.
7. CALCULATIONS
1. Calculate the mean OD readings for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient specimens.
2. Plot a standard curve by graphing the mean OD of each
standard against its concentration. Determine the antibody
concentrations of the controls and patient samples from the
standard curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run internal control samples with each batch of tests.
• Ensure controls fall within the established range before validating
patient results.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs, if available.
Troubleshooting:
• If controls are out of range, do not validate the results.
• Check reagent expiration dates, proper storage conditions, and
instrument calibration.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. Include quantitative results
along with established reference ranges.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: <20 U/mL
• Positive: ≥20 U/mL
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Negative results indicate the absence or low level of RO60
Antibody, IgG.
• Positive results suggest the presence of RO60 Antibody, IgG,
which may be indicative of Sjögren’s syndrome or Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (SLE).
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples can interfere with assay
performance.
• Strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions for all reagents and
protocols to ensure the accuracy of results.
12. PROCEDURE REVIEW
This procedure should be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in protocols or reagents.
