Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating ROMA Score (Ovarian Malignancy Risk Algorithm),
Serum
1. Purpose To describe the procedure for analyzing serum
specimens to generate the ROMA score, an algorithm for
assessing the risk of ovarian malignancy.
2. Scope This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
authorized and trained to perform the ROMA score analysis.
3. Responsibilities
• The designated staff shall carry out the analysis, ensure quality
control measures are in place, and document the results
accurately.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any maintenance and
analytical discrepancies that may impact the ROMA score and
report them to a supervisor.
1. Definitions
• ROMA Score: Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm, calculated
using serum levels of HE4 (Human Epididymis Protein 4) and
CA125 (Cancer Antigen 125), along with menopausal status.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 3-5 mL serum collected in a SST (Serum Separator Tube).
◦ Specimens should be processed and either refrigerated or
frozen promptly after collection if they cannot be analyzed
immediately.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens received in EDTA, citrate, or other non-serum
collection tubes.
◦ Specimens arriving without proper identification, collection
date/time, or exceeding stability limits.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Immunoassay analyzers capable of quantifying HE4 and CA125
levels.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• SSTs for serum collection.
1. Procedure A. Specimen Preparation:
2. Upon serum specimen receipt, verify patient identification and
collection details.
3. Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate the serum.
4. Aliquot 0.5 mL of the serum into properly labeled
microcentrifuge tubes.
B. Assay Preparation:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and quality control checks
have been performed as per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Warm reagents to room temperature if required by the assay
protocol.
C. Analyte Measurement:
1. Load serum specimens into the immunoassay analyzer
following the protocol for HE4 and CA125 assays.
2. Initiate the assay run and monitor the analyzer for any error
messages or alerts.
3. Record concentrations of HE4 and CA125.
D. Calculation of ROMA Score:
1. Using the concentrations of HE4 and CA125, along with the
patient's menopausal status, calculate the ROMA score as
follows:
• Premenopausal: ROMA Score = -12.0 + 2.38 × ln(HE4) + 0.0626
× ln(CA-125)
• Postmenopausal: ROMA Score = -12.0 + 1.33 × ln(HE4) + 0.0626
× ln(CA-125)
1. The result is expressed as a percentage (risk of malignancy).
E. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of assays.
• Document and address any deviations observed during the
analysis.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Review the calculated ROMA score for each patient.
2. Verify data integrity and check for any flagged results indicating
errors.
3. Enter results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
4. Communicate any critical or urgent findings directly to the
requesting physician.
5. Reference Intervals and Interpretation
• ROMA Score thresholds based on menopausal status:
◦ Premenopausal:
▪ Low risk: ROMA Score < 7.4%
▪ High risk: ROMA Score >= 7.4%
◦ Postmenopausal:
▪ Low risk: ROMA Score < 25.3%
▪ High risk: ROMA Score >= 25.3%
1. Method Limitations
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may result in inaccurate
readings.
• Ensure specimen handling and storage conditions are adhered to
prevent degradation or contamination.
1. Quality Assurance
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of the immunoassay
analyzer as per manufacturer instructions.
• Review quality control data following each assay run to ensure
accuracy and reliability of results.
1. References
• Manufacturer's instructions for HE4 and CA125 immunoassay
kits.
• Clinical guidelines for ROMA score interpretation.
