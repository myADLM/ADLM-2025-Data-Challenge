Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for ROPIVACAINE, SERUM/PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for ROPIVACAINE levels in serum or
plasma specimens. This includes specimen preparation, equipment
use, and result documentation. Accurate measurement of
ROPIVACAINE concentration is crucial for therapeutic drug
monitoring and ensuring patient safety.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP to ensure the reliable and accurate
measurement of ROPIVACAINE levels in serum/plasma specimens.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance and
addressing any issues that arise during the analytical phase.
3. DEFINITION
ROPIVACAINE: A local anesthetic often used for pain management.
Measurement of its levels in serum/plasma informs clinical decisions
relating to patient treatment.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma collected using a red stopper (serum) or
heparinized vacutainer (plasma)
• Collect at least 2 mL and ensure the specimen is adequately
mixed.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum/plasma specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours of collection.
• Specimens may be frozen at -20°C for longer storage up to 1
month. Ensure frozen specimens are thoroughly thawed and
mixed before analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in EDTA or sodium citrate tubes
• Specimens demonstrating hemolysis, lipemia, or significant
clotting
• Specimens received beyond 48 hours of collection if refrigerated,
or 1 month if frozen
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or equivalent
analytical instrument capable of quantifying ROPIVACAINE.
• Centrifuges: For plasma isolation and serum separation.
• Pipettes and calibration standards.
Reagents:
• Standard ROPIVACAINE solution for calibration.
• Appropriate mobile phase components as defined in the
instrument manual.
• Internal standard for HPLC analysis.
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 1500g for 10 minutes to separate
serum/plasma.
2. Aliquot the serum/plasma into clean, labeled tubes for analysis.
Equipment and Analysis Setup:
1. Prepare the HPLC system according to manufacturer
instructions, ensuring the column, mobile phase, and detector
settings are appropriate for ROPIVACAINE analysis.
2. Run system calibration using standard ROPIVACAINE solution.
3. Perform quality control checks with known positive and
negative controls.
Analyte Measurement:
1. Inject 20 µL of the prepared specimen into the HPLC system.
2. Record chromatograms and measure the ROPIVACAINE peak
against the calibration curve.
3. Calculate the concentration using the integrated software,
ensuring units are reported in µg/mL.
Documentation:
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring patient identifiers and test specifics are included.
• Verify the results according to site-specific guidelines before
releasing for clinical review.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Run known concentration controls at two levels (high and low)
with each batch of patients' specimens.
• Document and review control results; ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
External QC:
• Participate in external proficiency testing as available for
ROPIVACAINE measurement.
• Maintain records of proficiency testing results and corrective
actions taken when necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Standard therapeutic range for ROPIVACAINE (to be determined
based on clinical guidelines).
Critical Results:
• Report any results exceeding predefined toxic levels to medical
staff immediately, ensuring documentation of critical value
notification.

• Manufacturer's HPLC instrument manual
• Relevant clinical guidelines and pharmacopeia references for
ROPIVACAINE
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Provide detailed limitations and troubleshooting steps, referring to the
HPLC instrument manual for specific reagent and equipment
concerns.
This SOP ensures that accurate and reliable ROPIVACAINE levels
are generated for patient care while adhering to regulatory and
clinical standards. All laboratory personnel must be proficient with this
SOP and the operation of the HPLC system and associated
procedures.
