Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Results for Rotavirus Antigen, Feces
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate
and reliable testing for the presence of Rotavirus antigen in
fecal samples using an enzymatic immunoassay (EIA)/rapid
test method. This procedure outlines the steps for processing,
analyzing, and reporting results of rotavirus antigen tests.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that analysis is
conducted accurately and results are reviewed and verified prior
to reporting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected stool samples in clean, dry, sterile containers.
• Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL (solid stool) or 0.5-1 mL (liquid
stool).
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as soon as
possible and stored at 2-8⁰C if not processed immediately.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens that have been diluted.
• Specimens after more than 72 hours of collection without
refrigeration.
• Specimens without a collection date/time indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Enzymatic Immunoassay (EIA)/rapid test kits for Rotavirus
antigen detection.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Sterile specimen containers.
• Vortex mixer (if applicable).
• Biohazard waste disposal containers.
• Timer.
• Calibrated refrigerator (2-8⁰C) for storing specimens.
1. PROCEDURE Preparation:
• Ensure the test kit and reagents are stored and handled
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Label all specimens and test wells appropriately.
Testing Procedure:
1. Allow specimens and test reagents to come to room
temperature if they have been refrigerated.
2. Mix the stool sample thoroughly using a sterile applicator or
vortex mixer.
3. Pipette a specified volume of stool sample (as per
manufacturer’s instruction) into the sample well of the test kit.
4. Add the appropriate volume of diluent or buffer provided in the
test kit to the sample well (if applicable).
5. Start the timer and incubate the sample as per kit instructions
(typically 10-20 minutes).
6. After incubation, read the test results according to the kit's
instructions:
◦ Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method
typically involves reading optical density (OD) at specific
wavelengths using a microplate reader.
◦ Rapid tests may involve visual interpretation of color
changes.
Interpretation of Results:
• Positive Result: Detection of visual color change or OD exceeding
the threshold indicating the presence of rotavirus antigen in the
sample.
• Negative Result: No color change or OD below the threshold
indicating the absence of rotavirus antigen in the sample.
• Invalid Result: If the control line or control well does not show the
expected result, the test should be considered invalid and a
repeat test should be performed.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls provided in the test kit with
each batch of specimens tested.
• Record and validate control results before interpreting patient
results.
• If control results are invalid, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer's instructions and repeat the test.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) as
positive, negative, or invalid.
• Verify the results and review them before final reporting.
• Ensure all patient identifiers and sample information are
accurately documented.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Presence of rotavirus antigen detected.
• Negative: Absence of rotavirus antigen.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
symptoms and history.
• False positives/negatives can occur due to improper sample
handling or cross-reactivity.
1. SAFETY AND BIOSAFETY
• Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to laboratory protocols.
