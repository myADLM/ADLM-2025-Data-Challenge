Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Rotavirus
Antigen Detection in Stool Specimens
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the detection
of rotavirus antigen in stool samples using immunoassay techniques.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff
to perform the analysis, record the results, and ensure the timely
communication of results following this SOP.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to the analytical phase of rotavirus
antigen testing in stool specimens received in the laboratory.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Fresh stool samples collected in a clean, leak-proof, and sterile
container.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Stool samples mixed with urine.
• Stool samples in transport media designed for bacterial culture.
• Specimens that are watery, excessively dry, or heavily
contaminated.
• Specimens without clear labeling of patient information.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Incubator (set to appropriate temperature according to test kit
instructions).
• Plate reader (if using an ELISA-based method).
Reagents:
• Commercially available rotavirus antigen detection kit (e.g., ELISA
kit, lateral flow immunochromatographic assay).
Supplies:
• Disposable gloves.
• Absorbent bench paper.
• Biohazard waste container.
• Timer.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE),
including gloves, lab coat, and face shield if risk of splash
exists.
2. Mark the specimen containers with unique identifiers if not
already labeled.
Assay Method:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Mix stool sample well using a disposable applicator stick.
◦ Prepare a 10-20% stool suspension in the dilution buffer
provided in the test kit.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instruction insert meticulously to
perform the antigen detection assay. Generally, this
involves:
▪ Adding a specific volume of stool suspension to the test
wells or cassette.
▪ Incubating for the recommended time at the specified
temperature.
▪ Washing steps (if applicable for ELISA methods).
▪ Adding detection antibodies/enzyme substrates.
▪ Final incubation.
▪ Stopping the reaction (for ELISA) and reading the results
within the specified time frame using a plate reader or by
visual inspection.
6. RESULT READING AND INTERPRETATION
Interpreting Results:
• For ELISA:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
plate reader.
◦ Compare the sample readings to control wells and standards
provided in the kit to determine positive or negative results.
• For rapid lateral flow tests:
◦ Read the test line and control line as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ A visible test line indicates a positive result, whereas the
absence of a test line indicates a negative result.
Quality Control:
• Ensure that positive and negative controls provided within the kit
are run with each batch of tests.
• The test is valid only if the controls yield expected results. If
controls fail, repeat the test with fresh kit components.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation:
• Record all test results, including sample identification, control
results, and reading times, in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a senior technologist
before releasing.
Critical Results:
• Any critical or unexpected results should be communicated to the
requesting clinician immediately following the laboratory's protocol
for critical value reporting.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Conduct routine quality control checks and participate in
proficiency testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
quality control data.
9. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials, including used stool
samples, test cassettes, tips, and assay plates, in appropriately
labeled biohazard containers.
• Follow the lab’s biosafety and waste disposal protocols.

reflect changes in methodology, equipment, or regulatory
guidelines.
