Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for performing ROTEM
Thromboelastometry to monitor hemostasis and guide transfusion
therapy. The procedures ensure standardized operation, quality
control, and accurate generation of results.
2. SCOPE
The SOP covers the analytical phase of ROTEM
Thromboelastometry including sample preparation, test execution,
data analysis, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory staff are responsible for performing the tests
and ensuring adherence to the procedures.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for oversight, reviewing
test results, and addressing any issues that arise during the
testing process.
4. REQUIRED EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ROTEM Thromboelastometry analyzer
• ROTEM reagents (e.g., EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM, HEPTEM,
APTEM)
• Calcium chloride solution
• Pipettes and tips
• Standard quality control materials
• Syringes and sample collection bags
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Turn on the ROTEM analyzer and allow it to warm up as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure that all necessary reagents are prepared and brought to
room temperature.
3. Perform a daily quality control check using standard quality
control materials. Document the results in the quality control
log.
B. Sample Collection and Preparation
1. Collect blood into a citrated vacutainer tube.
2. Ensure the blood sample is mixed gently and thoroughly to
prevent clotting.
3. Process the sample within 30 minutes of collection to prevent
any pre-analytical variability.
4. Label the sample with patient identification information.
C. Test Execution
1. Select the appropriate assay on the ROTEM analyzer, e.g.,
EXTEM for extrinsic pathway evaluation.
2. Add the reagent to the cuvette according to the instructions for
the specific assay being performed.
◦ EXTEM/INTEM: Typically involves adding calcium chloride
solution to re-calcify the plasma.
◦ FIBTEM: Addition of a fibrinogen-specific reagent alongside
the calcium chloride.
◦ HEPTEM/APTEM: Follow specific reagent addition
sequence as outlined by the manufacturer.
3. Carefully place the cuvette into the heating block, ensuring
proper alignment.
4. Use a pipette to add the patient plasma sample into the cuvette
while avoiding any air bubbles.
5. Start the measurement on the ROTEM analyzer and monitor
the process for any error messages.
6. The test will run for approximately 30-60 minutes depending on
the specific assay.
D. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration is to be performed using manufacturer protocols
during initial setup and anytime calibration verification is
needed.
2. Perform internal quality control (IQC) for each batch of tests.
Record and evaluate the IQC results before proceeding with the
analysis.
3. If quality control results are outside acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer recommendations
and document all actions.
E. Data Analysis
1. Upon completion of the test, the ROTEM analyzer will generate
a graphical trace indicating clotting dynamics.
2. Analyze the plots using ROTEM-specific parameters, including
clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot
firmness (MCF), and additional derived parameters.
3. Compare results to reference ranges and historical patient data
(if available).
F. Result Reporting
1. Review the graphical and numerical results on the ROTEM
analyzer screen or printout.
2. Document the results in the patient's laboratory record in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Any critical results must be communicated immediately to the
appropriate clinical staff following laboratory policy for critical
result notification.
4. Add interpretive comments where necessary, particularly in
relation to clinical management or any identified issues during
the test.
6. MAINTENANCE
1. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for daily, weekly, and
monthly maintenance.
2. Log all maintenance and any repairs performed.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) as per laboratory
safety protocols.
2. Dispose of biological waste and sharps in appropriate
biohazard containers.
3. Follow all infection control protocols and ensure equipment is
cleaned as recommended.
