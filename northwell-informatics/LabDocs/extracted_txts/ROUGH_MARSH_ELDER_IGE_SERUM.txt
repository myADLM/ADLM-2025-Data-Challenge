Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Rough
Marsh Elder IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantification of serum IgE
specific to Rough Marsh Elder (commonly known as Iva annua)
in patient samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are
responsible for analyzing patient serum samples for Rough
Marsh Elder specific IgE.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedure as outlined and ensure accurate
documentation.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ Serum specimens
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Rough Marsh Elder IgE ELISA kit
◦ Micropipettes and sterile tips
◦ Reagent reservoirs
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Absorbent paper towel
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
◦ Sample stability: Stable for up to 24 hours at room
temperature (15-25°C) and up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-
term storage, samples may be kept at -20°C for up to 6
months.
◦ Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens; specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Allow serum specimens and reagents to equilibrate to
room temperature before use.
2. Label the ELISA microplate with appropriate sample,
standard, and control identifiers.
3. Dilute samples and controls as specified in the ELISA kit
instructions.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted patient
samples to appropriate wells.
2. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
3. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer,
ensuring complete removal of liquid between washes.
4. Add 100 μL of conjugate reagent to each well.
5. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
6. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer.
7. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
9. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Ensure that all quality control samples and calibrators are
within the acceptable range as provided in the kit
instructions.
◦ Perform internal quality control assays periodically.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Calculate the IgE concentration of Rough Marsh Elder in
each serum sample using the standard curve generated by
the provided standards.
◦ Report results: Concentrations less than 0.35 kU/L are
considered negative; concentrations 0.35 kU/L and above
indicate a positive result for Rough Marsh Elder specific IgE.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter data into the laboratory information system and print
an appropriate lab report.
◦ Notify the attending physician of any critical values
according to lab policy.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens can interfere with the
interpretation of results.
• The assay should not be used for diagnosis without considering
the patient’s clinical history and other diagnostic results.
