Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Rough Pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) IgE Testing in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides the instructions for performing Rough
Pigweed-specific IgE testing in serum samples to determine the
presence and concentration of allergen-specific IgE antibodies.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the laboratory personnel trained to perform
allergen-specific IgE testing using the appropriate immunoassay
system.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the testing accurately and document the results according to the
protocol outlined below.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Preferred collection: Serum should be collected in a red stopper
tube or SST (serum separator tube).
• Specimen volume: Minimum of 1.0 mL of serum is required.
• Specimen stability: The serum sample should be stored and
handled as follows:
◦ At room temperature (15-25°C) for up to 8 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder) for long-term storage, up to several
months.
5. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
• Rough Pigweed-specific IgE test kit (commercially available
enzyme immunoassays or fluoroenzymeimmunoassays)
• Calibrators and controls (provided by the manufacturer)
• Plate reader or automated immunoanalyzer compatible with the
test kit
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (if required by the assay procedure)
• Personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves, goggles)
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative quality control samples with each batch
of tests.
• Ensure calibrators and reagents are within their expiration dates
and stored as recommended.
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for the control limits. If a control
fails, do not proceed with testing the patient samples until the
issue is resolved.
• Record all quality control results and corrective actions.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
• Verify that specimen meets requirements. Document any
specimens that are unacceptable (e.g., hemolyzed, lipemic).
• Bring refrigerated specimens to room temperature before testing.
2. Calibration:
• Calibrate the immunoanalyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions using the provided calibrators.
3. Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare all reagents (standards, buffers, enzyme conjugates,
substrates) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Sample Processing:
• Obtain serum sample and label appropriately.
• Vortex the sample to ensure homogeneity.
5. Loading the Sample:
• Pipette the required volume of serum into the designated wells of
the test plate (or tubes, depending on the analyzer) as specified in
the test kit instructions.
• Follow the sequence provided in the assay protocol to avoid
cross-contamination.
6. Incubation:
• Incubate the samples, calibrators, and controls as specified in the
protocol, ensuring that the temperature and time conditions are
met precisely.
7. Detection:
• Add detection reagents (enzyme conjugates, substrates) as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Incubate the plate or tubes again as required.
8. Reading the Results:
• After the final incubation, read the absorbance or fluorescence
values using an appropriate plate reader or immunoanalyzer.
• Calculate the concentration of Rough Pigweed-specific IgE in
patient serum based on the standard curve generated from
calibrators.
9. Verification:
• Review all the results ensuring that controls are within acceptable
limits.
• Verify and document results in accordance with laboratory
protocols.
8. RESULT REPORTING
• Report Rough Pigweed-specific IgE results quantitatively (e.g.,
kU/L).
• Reference interval interpretation:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Low: 0.35-0.70 kU/L
◦ Moderate: 0.70-3.50 kU/L
◦ High: >3.50 kU/L
• Flag any critical values as specified by laboratory guidelines.
• Transmit results to the LIS and notify the designated healthcare
provider if values indicate a need for immediate clinical attention.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Possible interference with hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Cross-reactivity with other similar plant allergens should be
considered.
• Ensure compliance with manufacturer specifications on the assay
limitations.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for Rough Pigweed-specific IgE test
kit.
11. RECORD KEEPING
• Document every aspect of the test procedure, calibrations, quality
control results, and any deviations in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Maintain records for review and accreditation purposes.
