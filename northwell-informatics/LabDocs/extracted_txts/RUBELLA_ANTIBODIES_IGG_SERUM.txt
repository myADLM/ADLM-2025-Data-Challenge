Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Procedure for Rubella Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
◦ To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of Rubella IgG antibodies in serum using
automated immunoassay techniques.
◦ To ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test
results.
2. SCOPE
◦ This procedure applies to all staff performing Rubella IgG
antibody testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to
perform Rubella IgG antibody testing according to this
procedure.
◦ Supervisors must ensure personnel are adequately trained
and adhere to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum
◦ Specimen Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum.
◦ Specimen Collection:
▪ Collect blood using a serum separator tube (SST).
▪ Centrifuge the tube within 2 hours of collection to
separate the serum.
▪ If not analyzed immediately, store serum at 2-8°C for up
to 7 days or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Rubella IgG Reagent Kit
◦ Calibrators, Controls (Positive and Negative)
◦ Pipettes, Tips, and Microcentrifuge Tubes
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform routine maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Run quality controls with each batch of tests, including at
the beginning of each shift, and document results.
◦ Calibrators should be run according to manufacturer
specifications and at the start of new reagent lot numbers.
7. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation - Ensure the serum
sample is at room temperature. - Vortex the sample gently
before analysis.
B) Reagent Preparation - Prepare reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions. - Allow all reagents to come to
room temperature and mix gently before use.
C) Analyzer Setup - Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and
perform daily start-up procedures. - Load the reagents,
calibrators, controls, and patient samples onto the analyzer.
D) Programming - Select the Rubella IgG test protocol from
the analyzer menu. - Enter the sample identification numbers
corresponding to the test samples.
E) Processing the Samples - Start the test run following
standard instructions for the immunoassay analyzer. - Ensure
the analyzer is performing correctly by monitoring for system
messages or errors.
F) Result Verification - Upon completion of the run, review the
obtained data. - Ensure that quality control results are within
acceptance criteria. - Retest any out-of-range controls and
proceed with troubleshooting if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report results in arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) or as
specified by the reagent kit.
◦ Reference Range:
▪ Non-immune: <10 IU/mL
▪ Equivocal: 10-15 IU/mL
▪ Immune: >15 IU/mL
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify before release.
9. INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
◦ Non-immune results suggest susceptibility to Rubella
infection.
◦ Equivocal results may require follow-up testing or repeat
sampling.
◦ Immune results indicate a history of Rubella infection or
successful immunization.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If the instrument signals an error or results fall outside
expected ranges:
▪ Verify the sample and reagent integrity.
▪ Check for proper calibration.
▪ Re-run the quality controls and samples if necessary.
▪ Document all troubleshooting actions taken.
