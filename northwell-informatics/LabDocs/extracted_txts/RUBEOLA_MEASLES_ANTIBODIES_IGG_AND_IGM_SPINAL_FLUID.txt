Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Rubeola (Measles) Antibodies, IgG and
IgM, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of Rubeola (Measles)
antibodies, including IgG and IgM, in spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid
or CSF) to ensure accurate and reliable laboratory results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the Rubeola antibody tests on spinal fluid in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
these procedures and ensuring that all steps are followed
carefully.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP and for addressing any deviations from the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Specimen Type
• Spinal fluid (CSF)
4.2 Specimen Collection and Handling
• CSF must be collected by a qualified healthcare professional
using aseptic technique.
• The collected CSF should be placed into sterile, leak-proof
containers.
• The specimen should be transported to the laboratory as soon as
possible, preferably within 2 hours of collection. If immediate
transport is not possible, the CSF should be refrigerated at 2-8°C
and transported within 24 hours.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Rubeola IgG and IgM antibody test kits
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Laboratory-grade water
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Review the test kit insert for specific assay details.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
3. Allow reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
4. Label microcentrifuge tubes for each patient specimen,
calibrator, and control.
6.2 Assay Protocol for Rubeola IgG and IgM Antibody Testing
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Mix the CSF specimen gently but thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot the necessary volume of CSF as specified in the test
kit insert into the labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
2. Reagent Preparation
◦ Prepare the reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions
in the kit insert.
3. Assay Setup
◦ Pipette the specified volume of calibrators, controls, and
CSF into the appropriate wells of the assay plate.
◦ Follow by adding the provided assay diluent and any other
reagents as specified by the kit protocol.
4. Incubation
◦ Incubate the plates for the required time at the specified
temperature.
◦ Ensure that incubation times and temperatures are
consistent with the instructions in the test kit insert.
5. Washing
◦ Wash the wells as instructed in the assay procedure to
remove any unbound substances.
6. Detection
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate, substrate, and stop solution as
directed in the test kit insert.
◦ Measure the absorbance or other specified readings using
the appropriate wavelength on the microplate reader.
7. Calculation of Results
◦ Calculate the concentrations of Rubeola IgG and IgM
antibodies in the CSF based on the readings from the
calibrators.
◦ Ensure that the readings for controls fall within the
acceptable ranges as specified by the kit insert.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
9. Prepare and run both positive and negative controls with each
batch of patient samples to ensure assay accuracy.
10. Verify that control results fall within the defined ranges. If
controls do not meet acceptance criteria, do not report patient
results, and troubleshoot the assay according to manufacturer
guidelines and laboratory policy.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure they are reviewed and verified by a trained technologist.
• Report results as per the laboratory’s protocol for Rubeola
antibodies in CSF, specifying IgG and IgM concentrations.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be based on the manufacturer’s
guidelines provided in the kit insert and adapted to the
laboratory’s standard reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• As specified in the kit insert, certain conditions, patient factors, or
sample handling errors can impact the accuracy of the test
results.
