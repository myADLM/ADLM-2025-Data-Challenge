Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Rubeola (Measles) IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized approach for the qualitative and
quantitative detection of Rubeola (Measles) IgG antibodies in
human serum.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel
involved in the testing of serum samples for the presence of
Rubeola (Measles) IgG antibodies.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory Staff: Responsible for performing the assay
according to the SOP and documenting results accurately.
◦ Quality Control Personnel: Responsible for ensuring the
calibration and maintenance of equipment and
troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
◦ Supervisors: Responsible for reviewing and verifying the
results and ensuring compliance with the SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Microplate Reader (ELISA reader)
◦ Washer for Microplates (Automated or Manual)
◦ Calibrated Pipettes and Tips
◦ Vortex Mixer
◦ Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C
◦ Timer
◦ Absorbent Wipes
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. REAGENTS
◦ Rubeola (Measles) IgG ELISA Kit (commercially available)
▪ Includes: Microplate coated with Measles antigens, IgG
Conjugate, Substrate Solution, Stop Solution, Wash
Buffer, and Control Sera (positive and negative)
◦ Distilled or deionized water
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Human serum
◦ Collection: Collect blood specimens by venipuncture into a
red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST). Allow blood to
clot at room temperature and then centrifuge to separate
serum.
◦ Storage: Serum specimens should be kept at 2-8°C for up
to 5 days. For long-term storage, specimens can be stored
at -20°C or below. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and serum specimens to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
▪ Label the microplate with patient identification and
control positions.
▪ Add 100 µL of each control serum into designated
wells (Negative Control, Positive Control).
▪ Add 100 µL of each patient serum sample into the
appropriate wells.
2. Incubation:
▪ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Washing Steps:
▪ Aspirate the contents of each well.
▪ Wash the wells with 300 µL of prepared wash buffer 5
times.
▪ Blot the plate dry on absorbent wipes.
4. Add Conjugate:
▪ Add 100 µL of IgG conjugate to each well.
▪ Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Washing Steps:
▪ Repeat the washing steps as outlined above.
6. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 10
minutes.
7. Stop Reaction:
▪ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzyme reaction.
8. Reading Results:
▪ Read the microplate at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Ensure that positive and negative controls fall within
specified ranges stated by the manufacturer. If controls are
out of range, the run is invalid and must be repeated.
◦ Document all QC results and maintain records for
compliance.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance of the negative control
wells.
◦ Determine the cut-off value as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Results interpretation:
▪ Positive: Absorbance value higher than the cut-off.
▪ Negative: Absorbance value lower than the cut-off.
◦ Record the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
10. REFERENCE RANGES
◦ Positive: Presence of Rubeola (Measles) IgG antibodies
◦ Negative: Absence of Rubeola (Measles) IgG antibodies
11. LIMITATIONS
◦ This assay does not differentiate between an active or past
infection.
◦ Performance limitations and interferences are outlined in the
product insert by the manufacturer.
12. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
◦ Wear appropriate PPE throughout the procedure.
◦ Handle all samples and reagents as if they are capable of
transmitting infectious agents.
◦ Dispose of waste according to the laboratory's biohazard
waste disposal policies.
