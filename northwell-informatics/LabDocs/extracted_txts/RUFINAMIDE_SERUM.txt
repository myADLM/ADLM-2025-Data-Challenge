Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Rufinamide, Serum
1. PURPOSE To ensure the accurate and precise analysis of
Rufinamide levels in serum samples, using validated
methodologies and standardized laboratory procedures to
support effective patient management and therapeutic
monitoring.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel should perform the
assay following the procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all personnel to ensure adherence to the protocol
and report any deviations or issues to the supervising laboratory
manager.
1. DEFINITION Rufinamide is an anti-epileptic medication used
for controlling seizures. Appropriate serum levels are necessary
for ensuring therapeutic efficacy and avoiding toxicity.
2. PROCEDURE
3.1. Specimen Requirements:
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required.
• Collection Tube: Serum should be collected in a plain red-top tube
or serum separator tube (SST).
• Handling: Allow the serum to clot at room temperature, then
centrifuge the sample within 1 hour of collection. Transfer the
clear serum into a clean polypropylene or glass vial.
• Storage: Refrigerate the serum sample at 2-8°C if the analysis is
not performed immediately. Samples can be stored at -20°C for
long-term storage.
3.2. Reagents and Supplies:
• Calibrators and Controls: Use commercially available Rufinamide
calibrators and controls.
• Mobile Phase: Prepare the mobile phase strictly following the
analytical instrument manual (typically containing acetonitrile,
methanol, aqueous buffer).
• Extraction Solvent: Use appropriate solvents such as acetonitrile,
methanol, or a specified mixture from the method validation.
• Analytical Column: Use a C18 or equivalent reverse-phase
column.
• Internal Standard (if applicable): Select an appropriate internal
standard as established during method validation.
3.3. Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) system.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex Mixer.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Glassware (vials, tubes, pipettes, etc.).
• Analytical balance.
3.4. Methodology:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Thaw frozen serum samples at room
temperature. Mix thoroughly before analysis. b. Vortex the
specimen for approximately 30 seconds. c. Add an aliquot of
serum sample (e.g., 100 µL) to a clean polypropylene or glass
tube. d. Add internal standard (if applicable). e. Add extraction
solvent (e.g., 200 µL of acetonitrile). Vortex for 1 minute. f.
Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
precipitated proteins. g. Transfer the clear supernatant into an
HPLC/LC-MS vial.
2. Instrument Setup: a. Equilibrate the HPLC/LC-MS system
according to the manufacturer's instructions. b. Set up the
column with the mobile phase in the appropriate gradient
method. c. Calibrate the instrument using known concentrations
of Rufinamide standards. d. Run quality control samples before
patient specimens to ensure system suitability.
3. Analysis: a. Inject the prepared serum sample into the HPLC/
LC-MS system. b. Program the analytical run as per
established method parameters: flow rate, column temperature,
sample injection volume, and detection wavelength/mass
spectrometric settings. c. Record the peak areas and retention
times of Rufinamide and any internal standard.
4. Data Analysis: a. Analyze chromatograms and obtain peak
areas for the Rufinamide. b. Calculate serum Rufinamide
concentration using the calibration curve. c. Ensure that the
controls fall within the acceptable range. If controls are out of
limits, repeat the analysis and investigate the cause.
3.5. Quality Control:
• Include quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each analytical run.
• Acceptable QC ranges should be as per standard operating
protocols and method validation data.
• Document all QC results in the appropriate log or software for
traceability.
3.6. Reporting Results:
• Review the chromatograms and result data for accuracy and
consistency.
• Verify results against predetermined criteria before reporting.
• Input the validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure all critical results are promptly communicated to the
ordering physician, following laboratory policy for notification.
3.7. Sample Integrity:
• If there is a reason to suspect compromised sample integrity (e.g.,
hemolysis, lipemia, icterus), the technologist should document
and take appropriate steps, including potential re-sampling and
verification with clinical staff.
