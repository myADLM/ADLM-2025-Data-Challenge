RUNX1-RUNX1T1 TRANSLOCATION (8;21), MINIMAL RESIDUAL
DISEASE MONITORING, QUANTITATIVE, VARIES STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to detail
the analytical phase protocol for generating results for RUNX1-
RUNX1T1 Translocation (8;21), Minimal Residual Disease
Monitoring, Quantitative testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to perform the analysis
according to this SOP and ensure the accuracy and reliability of
results reported. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing the results
and ensuring all protocols are followed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate.
• Specimen should be collected in EDTA or heparin tubes and
promptly transported to the laboratory.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or clotting.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection without
proper storage or refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument
• DNA extraction kit
• RUNX1-RUNX1T1 specific probes and primers
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR master mix
• Positive and negative controls
• Consumables (microcentrifuge tubes, pipette tips, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for extraction of DNA from
peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry or other suitable methods. Store extracted
DNA at -20°C until use.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice. Vortex and centrifuge
briefly.
2. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, including appropriate concentrations of primers,
probes, nucleotides, and enzyme.
3. Pipette the master mix along with the extracted DNA and
controls into PCR reaction wells.
C) Real-time PCR Amplification:
1. Load the reaction plate into the real-time PCR instrument and
set up the run parameters (denaturation, annealing, extension,
and cycling conditions) as per the kit instructions.
2. Start the PCR run and monitor progress if necessary.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze amplification plots
and determine the threshold cycle (Ct) values for samples and
controls.
2. Calculate the quantity of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts in
the test samples based on standard curve or comparative Ct
method.
3. Assess minimal residual disease status by comparing the
quantitative data with established reference intervals and
thresholds.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) once verified.
• Results should include the quantitative measurement of RUNX1-
RUNX1T1 transcripts and an interpretation of the minimal residual
disease status.
• Document any deviations from protocol or troubleshooting
performed.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of samples.
• Perform weekly calibration checks on the real-time PCR
instrument.
• Record all quality control results and corrective actions in the
appropriate log.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the product insert for limitations specific to RUNX1-
RUNX1T1 assay performance.
• Hemolyzed or clotted specimens may yield inaccurate results.
• Ensure proper storage and handling of specimens and reagents
to minimize degradation.

This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on
technological advancements, changes in protocol, and laboratory
requirements.
