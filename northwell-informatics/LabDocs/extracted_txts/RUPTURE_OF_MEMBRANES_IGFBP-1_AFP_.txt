Analytical Phase Protocol for Rupture of Membranes
(IGFBP-1/AFP) Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of rupture of
fetal membranes through the measurement of Insulin-like Growth
Factor Binding Protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) in
vaginal secretions.
2. OVERVIEW
The testing for rupture of membranes involves detecting the
presence of IGFBP-1 and AFP in a patient's vaginal secretions using
a given rapid diagnostic device. This protocol outlines the procedure
for the analytical phase of the test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff responsible for performing the IGFBP-1/AFP test
must adhere strictly to the guidelines outlined in this protocol. It is
their duty to ensure accurate, timely, and correct reporting of results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• IGFBP-1/AFP Rapid Test Kit
• Timer
• Disposable gloves
• Sterile swabs
• Buffer solution
• Sample collection devices (e.g., sterile collection containers or
swabs)
• Biohazard disposal containers
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analysis Preparation:
1. Verify the integrity of the test kit before use (e.g., check expiry
date and physical condition).
2. Ensure the necessary PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is
worn at all times.
3. Collect the patient's specimen as per the standard specimen
collection protocol.
B. Sample Processing:
1. Identify the patient specimen accurately and document it in the
laboratory information system if it has not already been done.
2. Bring the sample to room temperature if it was stored
refrigerated.
3. Insert the sterile swab into the patient's vaginal secretion and
ensure an adequate sample is collected, avoiding contact with
other surfaces to prevent contamination.
4. Immerse the swab in the buffer solution provided with the test
kit and mix thoroughly.
C. Test Procedure:
1. Remove the rapid test device from the sealed pouch and place
it on a flat, clean surface.
2. Using a provided dropper, collect the mixed sample from the
buffer solution and place the recommended number of drops
(as specified in the manufacturer's instructions) into the sample
well of the test device.
3. Start the timer for the recommended read time (usually
between 5-20 minutes as per the manufacturer’s guidelines).
4. Interpret the results within the optimal time period specified in
the kit insert. Avoid reading results after the recommended
interval to prevent false readings.
D. Interpretation of Results:
• Positive Result: Both the control line and the test line appear,
indicating the presence of IGFBP-1/AFP.
• Negative Result: Only the control line appears, indicating the
absence of IGFBP-1/AFP.
• Invalid Result: The control line does not appear. An invalid result
requires retesting with a new test device.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run external controls (positive and negative) with each new lot
of test kits and at regular intervals as stated in the laboratory’s
QC policy.
2. Document all control results in the quality control log, ensuring
they fall within the established acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Enter the validated results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Include comments on the result report if any peculiar
observations or difficulties were noted during the analysis.
3. Notify the clinician or appropriate healthcare provider
immediately in case of positive findings indicative of membrane
rupture or any abnormal/interfering results.
G. Troubleshooting:
1. If controls fail, check expiration dates and storage conditions of
reagents and repeat tests with new controls or test kits.
2. Refer any persistent issues to a supervisor or technical
specialist for further investigation.
H. Documentation:
1. Maintain records of all tests performed, including patient
identification, test results, quality control data, and any issues
encountered during the process, in compliance with regulatory
guidelines.
