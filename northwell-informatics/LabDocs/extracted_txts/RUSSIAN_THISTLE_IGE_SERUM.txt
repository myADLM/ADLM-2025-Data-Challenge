Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Russian Thistle IgE (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to outline
the procedures for the analysis and generation of results for Russian
Thistle IgE levels in serum samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the assay,
documenting the process, and ensuring compliance with the SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process,
addressing any procedural issues, and ensuring corrective
actions are taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum required
• Collection and Handling: Serum should be separated from the clot
within 2 hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately. For long-term storage, samples should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples
• Incorrectly labeled specimens
• Insufficient volume
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• ELISA kits for Russian Thistle IgE (from a validated supplier)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate washer
• Calibrated incubator (37°C)
• Vortex mixer
• Deionized water
• Waste disposal containers
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing the Workspace
1. Ensure that the workspace is clean and free of contaminants.
2. Ensure all equipment has been calibrated and validated.
B. Initial Sample Preparation
1. Verify that each serum sample is properly labeled with patient
information.
2. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix well by
gentle inversion.
3. Centrifuge any samples if particulate matter is present.
C. ELISA Assay Procedure
1. Preparation of Reagents
◦ Prepare wash buffer, blocking buffer, and enzyme
conjugates as per the kit instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents to come to room temperature before use.
2. Sample and Standards Addition
◦ Add standards, controls, and samples to appropriate wells in
duplicate.
◦ Ensure no air bubbles are present in the wells.
3. Incubation
◦ Incubate the plate according to kit instructions (usually 30
minutes to 1 hour at 37°C).
4. Washing
◦ Wash the plate according to kit instructions. Use the plate
washer for consistency.
5. Enzyme Conjugate Addition
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate as
specified by the kit instructions.
6. Substrate Addition
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate
according to the kit instructions. Avoid exposure to light.
7. Stop Reaction
◦ Add the stop solution to each well. Mix gently by tapping the
plate.
8. Reading the Plate
◦ Read the plate at 450 nm within 10 minutes of adding the
stop solution.
D. Calculations and Quality Control
1. Data Analysis
◦ Generate a standard curve from the standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Russian Thistle IgE in each
sample using the standard curve.
2. Quality Control
◦ Include quality control samples with known IgE levels.
◦ Ensure all control results fall within the specified range.
◦ If any control falls outside the acceptable range, repeat the
analysis for that batch.
E. Result Reporting
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Validate and review results for accuracy.
3. Flag any abnormal results and notify the clinician as per
laboratory protocol.
F. Documentation
1. Document all steps in a laboratory logbook or electronic record.
2. Include the dates, times, personnel involved, and any
deviations from the SOP.
G. Waste Disposal
1. Dispose of all biohazardous waste in accordance with
laboratory safety protocols.
2. Decontaminate work surfaces after analysis.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference intervals for Russian Thistle IgE should be
established based on manufacturer guidelines or internal
laboratory validation studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations and potential
interferences. Note that high levels of hemolysis, lipemia, or
contamination can interfere with results.
