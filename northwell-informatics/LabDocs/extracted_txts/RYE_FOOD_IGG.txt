Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for RYE
FOOD IGG
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
necessary for the accurate and consistent measurement of IgG
antibodies against rye food in patient serum samples using ELISA
(Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). The reliable generation of
test results will assist clinicians in diagnosing potential food
sensitivities or allergies.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all certified laboratory personnel
responsible for performing and analyzing IgG-specific ELISA tests for
rye food.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure precisely. Supervisors must ensure
all staff are adequately trained and adhere to the protocol.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA plate reader
• Micropipettes and tips (20-200 µL and 200-1000 µL)
• Reagent reservoirs
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Wash bottle or automated plate washer
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibrated laboratory balance
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Rye Food-specific IgG ELISA kit consisting of:
◦ Microtiter plates with pre-coated rye antigen
◦ Diluent buffer
◦ Washing solution (20X concentrate)
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Substrate solution (TMB)
◦ Stop solution (H2SO4)
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Calibrators
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Check all reagents for expiration dates and prepare according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Bring all reagents, samples, and calibration materials to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
5.2 Sample Processing
1. Centrifuge patient serum samples at 2000 x g for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully transfer serum aliquots to clean microtubes, avoiding
any precipitates or particulate matter.
3. Store processed samples at 2-8°C if same-day testing is not
possible. For longer storage, keep at -20°C.
5.3 ELISA Setup
1. Prepare wash solution by diluting 20X concentrate with distilled
water (e.g., 50 mL concentrate in 950 mL water).
2. Arrange the microtiter plates and designate wells for standards,
controls, and samples. Assign duplicate wells for each.
3. Pipette 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and samples into
designated wells.
4. Add 100 µL of diluent buffer to the blank wells.
5.4 Incubation and Washing
1. Cover the microtiter plate with a plate sealer and incubate at
37°C for a stipulated period (usually 1 hour).
2. After incubation, aspirate the contents of all wells and wash the
plates 4 times with 300 µL of wash solution. Ensure complete
removal of liquid after each wash.
5.5 Detection
1. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Wash the plate as described above.
5.6 Substrate Reaction
1. Add 100 µL of substrate solution (TMB) to each well.
2. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10
minutes.
5.7 Stop Reaction
1. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well in the same sequence
and timing as the TMB.
2. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
5.8 Measurement
1. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA plate reader.
If dual wavelength is available, use 620 nm as reference.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
2. Verify control values are within the acceptable range before
processing patient samples.
3. If controls fail, investigate potential sources of error, repeat the
test, or consult with a supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Use the standard curve generated by the calibration series to
interpolate IgG levels for rye antigen in patient samples.
2. Review and verify all results according to laboratory standards.
3. Report results in the designated Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
8. REFERENCE VALUES Interpret results based on established
cutoff value specific for the IgG rye test. Refer to the kit insert for
respective health implications of high or low IgG levels.
9. LIMITATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Ensure all samples and reagents are at room temperature
before use.
2. Avoid cross-contamination by changing pipette tips between
samples.
3. Follow all safety guidelines for handling biological specimens
and potentially hazardous chemicals.
4. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and refer to the package
insert for additional details on limitations.
