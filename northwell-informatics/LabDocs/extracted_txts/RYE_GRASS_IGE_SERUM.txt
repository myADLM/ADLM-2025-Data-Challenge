Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for RYE GRASS, IgE,
SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for analyzing serum samples for
Rye Grass-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. The purpose
is to measure patient-specific IgE levels in response to rye grass
allergens, aiding in the diagnosis and management of allergic
conditions.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis, documenting results, and reporting according to the
SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and ensuring that all
steps are performed correctly and addressing any issues that
arise during the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection:
• Collect the blood specimen using standard venipuncture
technique.
Volume:
• A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for analysis.
Handling and Storage:
• Allow the blood sample to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, properly labeled plastic vial.
• Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 7
days. For longer storage, the serum should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ImmunoCAP 250)
• Rye Grass Allergen Reagents and Calibrators (e.g., ImmunoCAP
Allergen-specific IgE Reagents, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
• Quality Control Materials
◦ Low and High IgE Control Sera
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes (adjustable)
• Appropriate PPE (laboratory coat, gloves, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Calibrate and perform maintenance checks on the
Immunoassay Analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare reagents, standards, and controls as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
prior to testing.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
the assigned positions in the analyzer rack.
2. Reagent Loading:
◦ Ensure all necessary reagents, including rye grass allergen-
specific IgE reagents and buffers, are adequately loaded
into the analyzer.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Follow the steps on the Immunoassay Analyzer’s software.
Choose the appropriate assay from the menu (e.g., Rye
Grass-specific IgE).
◦ The analyzer will automatically perform the assay by mixing
samples with allergen-coated beads, incubating, washing,
adding enzyme conjugates, and measuring the
chemiluminescence or fluorescence.
4. Analysis:
◦ The analyzer will measure the emitted signal, which is
directly proportional to the amount of Rye Grass-specific IgE
in the patient serum.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control (QC) samples (low and high control
sera) alongside patient samples at the beginning of each
run to ensure assay validity.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they fall within the
established ranges. If controls do not fall within the
acceptable range, re-calibrate the instrument and repeat the
assay.
C. Reporting Results:
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ The analyzer will produce numeric values for Rye Grass-
specific IgE concentration in kU/L.
◦ Result interpretation depends on established reference
ranges. Common categories are usually:
▪ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative
▪ 0.35 – 0.70 kU/L: Low Positive
▪ 0.70 – 3.50 kU/L: Moderate Positive
▪ 3.50 – 17.5 kU/L: High Positive
▪ 17.5 kU/L: Very High Positive
2. Verification:
◦ Verify results, checking for any issues such as high
background or nonspecific binding.
◦ Repeat the assay on any samples with ambiguous results.
3. Result Documentation:
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Annotate patient records with results ensuring that both
quantitative and qualitative interpretations are included.
◦ Notify clinicians of any critical values, following established
communication protocols.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Conduct routine QC at the start and end of each day, and with
each assay batch.
• Document all QC activities. If QC fails, consult the supervisor and
troubleshoot as necessary.
External Quality Assessment:
• Participate in proficiency testing or external quality assessment
schemes at intervals recommended by regulatory bodies to
ensure continuous assay reliability and accuracy.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in the sample may affect the
accuracy of results.
• Cross-reactivity may occur with other similar allergens.
• All IgE assays are to be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
findings and other diagnostic tests.
