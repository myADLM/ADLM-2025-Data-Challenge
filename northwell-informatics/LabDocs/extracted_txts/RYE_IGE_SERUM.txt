Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
RYE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized methodology for the analytical phase of
generating results for RYE, IGE, and SERUM samples, ensuring
accuracy, precision, and reproducibility.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel conducting RYE, IGE, and SERUM analysis
must adhere to the procedures outlined within this SOP.
The designated lab supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
compliance with this SOP, including training new personnel and
addressing any procedural issues or deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum (Preferred)
Volume:
• Minimum 2 mL of serum
Specimen Handling:
• Blood should be collected into a SST (Serum Separator Tube) or
a red top tube without anticoagulant.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (approximately 30
minutes).
• Centrifuge the specimen at 3000rpm for 10 minutes to separate
the serum from the clot.
• Transfer the serum to a secondary tube if necessary, avoiding
cellular contamination.
• Label all tubes with patient identification, collection date, and time.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if they will be tested within 48 hours or
freeze at –20°C for longer storage durations.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• Calibrators and Controls specific to RYE, IGE, and SERUM
assays.
• Immunoassay Analyzer or ELISA Reader.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Dilution buffers and assay-specific reagents.
• Calibration and control material.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
before analysis.
• Verify the calibration status of the assay analyzer.
• Prepare calibrators, controls, and samples as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
B. Calibration
• Perform calibration of the instrument with appropriate calibrators
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Record all calibration data and ensure the calibration is within
acceptable limits prior to running patient samples.
C. Quality Control
• Run quality control material at multiple levels (e.g., high, medium,
and low concentrations) before analyzing patient specimens.
• Document all QC results and verify they are within the accepted
ranges. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and resolve
the issue before proceeding.
D. Specimen Analysis
• Load specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer.
• Follow the sequence: run calibrators first, followed by controls,
and then patient samples.
• For ELISA-based assays, follow the specific protocol for
incubation, washing, and reading the absorbance.
• Record all results from the analyzer.
E. Data Review and Result Reporting
• Cross-check the generated results with QC and calibrator data to
ensure validity.
• In the case of anomalous results, re-run the sample or check for
any pre-analytical errors.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Mark and report critical values according to site-specific
guidelines.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If an instrument error occurs, refer to the user manual for
troubleshooting steps.
• Recalibrate the instrument if control results are out of range.
• Re-run patient samples if the results are inconsistent or
unexpected.
• In case of persistent issues, contact technical support or the
designated supervisor.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Ensure all instruments are maintained according to the
maintenance schedule.
• Perform regular internal and external proficiency testing.
• Review and update SOP annually or as needed, incorporating
feedback from QA assessments.

instrumentation.

Note: This SOP provides a framework and must be tailored to the
specific instruments and assays used in the laboratory. Always follow
manufacturer’s recommendations and institutional protocols.
