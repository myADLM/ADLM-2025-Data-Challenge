SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for S-100B Protein,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of S-100B
protein in serum samples to ensure accuracy, reliability, and
consistency in the results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP for the analysis of S-100B protein in
serum samples.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum-separator tube.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate).
• Specimens without proper labeling or lacking collection date/time.
Specimen stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours.
• Refrigerated at 2-8°C: 72 hours.
• Frozen at -20°C or lower: 1 month.
Specimens must be transported to the laboratory promptly and stored
appropriately based on the aforementioned stability guidelines.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader or chemiluminescence analyzer.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Timer.
• S-100B protein assay kit (e.g., ELISA kit), containing:
◦ Standards
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Microplate or other related consumables
Reagent storage:
• Assay kit reagents should be stored according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, typically at 2-8°C.
• Do not use reagents past their expiry date.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples, standards, and reagents to come to
room temperature before analysis.
2. Prepare the wash buffer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Analysis:
1. Set up the microplate according to the assay kit instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and patient
samples into the designated wells.
3. Add the appropriate reagents (e.g., antibody conjugates) as
instructed by the assay kit protocol.
4. Incubate the plate for the specified time and temperature as per
the kit instructions.
5. Wash the plate thoroughly using the wash buffer and an
appropriate washing device.
6. Add the substrate solution and incubate for an exact duration
specified by the kit manufacturer.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
8. Read the plate using an ELISA reader or chemiluminescence
analyzer within the specified wavelength range or mode
according to the protocol.
Calculation:
1. Generate the standard curve using the known concentrations of
standards.
2. Calculate the unknown concentrations of S-100B protein in
serum samples based on the standard curve using appropriate
software or manual calculations.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials:
• Utilize commercial quality control sera with known concentrations
of S-100B protein.
• Include at least two levels of controls (high and low) in each batch
of assays.
Quality control procedure:
1. Run controls in parallel with patient samples.
2. Verify that control values fall within the established acceptable
range.
3. If control results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot the
assay process, including reagent preparation, sample handling,
and instrument calibration.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results including controls and standards prior to
reporting.
• Results should be reported in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).
• Document any unusual findings or troubleshooting steps
undertaken.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for further detail.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to specific laboratory reference intervals for S-100B protein, as
these may vary based on demographics or specific populations.
• Normal reference range: [insert lab-specific reference range]
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the S-100B protein assay kit insert for specific limitations
pertaining to the assay.
