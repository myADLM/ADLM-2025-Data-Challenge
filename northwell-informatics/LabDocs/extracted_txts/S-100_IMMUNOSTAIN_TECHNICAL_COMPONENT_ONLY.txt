Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for S-100 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the technical execution of
S-100 immunostaining in tissue specimens. This protocol ensures the
reliability, accuracy, and consistency of staining results, facilitating
diagnostic accuracy.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques to perform the
immunostaining of tissue sections using the S-100 antibody
according to this SOP. All staff should ensure proper documentation
throughout the process.
3. DEFINITION
S-100 immunostaining is utilized to detect the presence of S-100
protein in tissue samples. The S-100 protein is a marker often used in
the identification of neural, melanocytic, and certain glandular cells.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Receipt and Verification of Specimen:
◦ Verify that the specimen has been appropriately
accessioned and prepared for immunohistochemical
staining.
◦ Ensure that tissue blocks are properly labeled with unique
identifiers.
2. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 3-4 µm thick sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks using a microtome.
◦ Place the sections on positively charged microscope slides
to ensure adherence.
◦ Allow slides to air dry, followed by heating at 60°C for at
least 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion and
deparaffinization.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize sections by immersing slides in a series of xylene
baths (xylene I followed by xylene II) for 5 minutes each.
• Rehydrate through graded alcohol series (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%
ethanol) for 2 minutes each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform antigen retrieval using the preferred method (e.g., Heat-
Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) in citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
• Heat slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath per
manufacturer's protocol.
• Cool slides to room temperature before proceeding.
D. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
• Immerse slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes
to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
• Rinse slides in distilled water and then wash in PBS or TBS buffer
for 5 minutes.
E. Immunostaining:
1. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply the S-100 primary antibody to tissue sections. Follow
manufacturer’s recommended dilution and incubation time
(typically 1 hour at room temperature).
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes.
2. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply a suitable biotinylated secondary antibody if using an
indirect detection system or a labeled secondary antibody if
using a direct system.
◦ Incubate as per manufacturer's instructions (typically 30
minutes at room temperature).
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes.
3. Streptavidin-HRP (if applicable):
◦ Apply streptavidin-HRP conjugate and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes.
F. Chromogen Development:
• Prepare the DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate solution as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Apply DAB solution to covers the tissue section and incubate for
the time recommended (typically 2-10 minutes), monitoring the
staining development microscopically.
• Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
G. Counterstaining:
• Counterstain sections with Harris hematoxylin or similar, for 1-2
minutes.
• Rinse slides in running tap water and perform a bluing step in
ammonia water or Scotts' tap water substitute.
H. Dehydration and Clearing:
• Dehydrate sections through graded alcohol series (70%, 80%,
95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each.
• Clear sections in xylene baths (xylene I followed by xylene II) for 5
minutes each.
I. Mounting:
• Mount sections with a suitable permanent mounting medium (e.g.,
DPX or Permount) and cover with glass coverslips.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION
A. Quality Control:
• Include a positive control slide known to express S-100 protein
and a negative control slide (primary antibody omitted) with each
batch of slides processed.
• Document the results of controls to verify the staining procedure.
B. Documentation:
• Record all details of the staining process including date,
technologist’s initials, reagent lot numbers, and incubation times
in the IHC logbook or laboratory information system (LIS).
• Troubleshoot and document any deviations or issues encountered
during the process.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Stained slides along with adequate controls should be reviewed
microscopically by a pathologist who will interpret and report the
S-100 immunostain findings.
7. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific reagents and
antibodies.
• Include reference literature on S-100 protein and
immunohistochemistry techniques.
Note: Always adhere to safety guidelines and wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the staining
procedure. Dispose of waste materials according to laboratory
protocols and local regulations.
