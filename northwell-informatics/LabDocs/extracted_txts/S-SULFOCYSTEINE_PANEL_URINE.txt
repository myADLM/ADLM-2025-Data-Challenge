STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR S-
SULFOCYSTEINE PANEL, URINE
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis of Sulfocysteine
Panel in urine specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all personnel performing the S-
Sulfocysteine Panel, Urine in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this test
as per this SOP. The laboratory supervisors are responsible for
providing adequate training and ensuring adherence to the
procedure.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Urine collection containers
• Reagent grade water
• Quality control materials specific for Sulfocysteine Panel testing
• Specimen transport containers and racks
• Data management system (LIS)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of a random urine sample collected
in a sterile container.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens should be processed within 24
hours of collection. If delayed, store the urine sample at 2-8°C
and analyze within 72 hours.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are grossly
hemolyzed or contaminated.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Prepare and run quality control materials with each batch of
patient specimens.
• Quality control results should fall within the manufacturer’s
specified range.
• Document and review all quality control results before patient
sample analysis.
7. PROCEDURE: 7.1. Pre-analytical Phase:
a. Verify each specimen is appropriately labeled and meets the
acceptance criteria.
b. Record specimen information in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
7.2. Analytical Phase:
a. Preparation:
• Equilibrate urine samples and quality control materials to room
temperature before testing.
• Vortex urine samples thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
• Centrifuge urine samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
b. Sample Processing:
• Pipette a specified volume (e.g., 200 µL) of the cleared urine
supernatant into a clean, labeled tube.
• If dilution is necessary, dilute the sample with reagent grade water
as per protocol.
c. System Setup:
• Prepare the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Ensure the system is calibrated and quality controls have been
run and accepted.
d. Analysis:
• Load samples and controls onto the LC-MS/MS system.
• Input the necessary sequence into the data acquisition software.
• Start the run and monitor the system for any issues.
e. Post-analysis:
• Review the raw data and ensure peak identification and
integration are correct.
• Transfer data to the LIS for reporting.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Compare the patient’s results to established reference intervals
specific for S-Sulfocysteine.
9. REPORTING OF RESULTS:
• Enter results into the LIS.
• Verify and release results according to laboratory protocols.
• Notify the requesting clinician of any critical values as per the
laboratory’s critical value policy.
10. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for routine maintenance of the
LC-MS/MS system.
• Document all maintenance and troubleshooting activities.
• If the system malfunctions or quality control is out of range, do not
report patient results and notify the supervisor.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Handle specimens and reagents according to universal
precautions.
• Dispose of waste materials in compliance with the laboratory’s
waste disposal policy.
12. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the LC-MS/MS system.
• Laboratory’s quality control and calibration procedures.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for S-Sulfocysteine testing.
