Standard Operating Procedure S-(2-SUCCINYL)-CYSTEINE (2SC)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standardized methodology for performing
the immunohistochemical staining for S-(2-succinyl)-cysteine (2SC)
on clinical specimens. The protocol includes preparation, staining,
and documentation steps to ensure consistent and accurate results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
staining procedure, documenting results, and ensuring adherence to
protocol. It is the responsibility of staff to identify any technical issues
and report them to the laboratory supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical specimens submitted for the
immunohistochemical staining for 2SC including but not limited to
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunostainer
• Positive control slide
• Negative control slide
• FFPE tissue sections
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) solution
• Blocking buffer (e.g., 1% BSA in PBS)
• Primary antibody specific for 2SC
• Secondary antibody (biotin-labeled or enzyme-labeled)
• DAB substrate kit
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparation
4.1.1. Sections
• Cut 4-5µm thick sections from FFPE blocks and mount on
charged slides.
• Air dry the slides overnight at room temperature or incubate at
60°C for 1 hour.
4.1.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize the slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
• Rehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (100% x 2, 95%, and
70%) for 3 minutes each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
4.1.3. Antigen Retrieval
• Perform HIER using a proprietary retrieval solution or citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker at 95-99°C for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water and then PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
4.2. Immunostaining
4.2.1. Blocking
• Encircle sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
• Apply blocking buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature in a
humidified chamber to prevent non-specific binding.
4.2.2. Primary Antibody Incubation
• Dilute primary anti-2SC antibody according to manufacturer's
recommendations.
• Apply the diluted primary antibody to each section and incubate
for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
4.2.3. Washing
• Wash the slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes to remove unbound
primary antibody.
4.2.4. Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply appropriate secondary antibody and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
• Wash the slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
4.2.5. Detection
• Apply DAB substrate solution according to manufacturer’s
instructions and incubate until desired staining intensity develops
(usually 5-10 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
4.2.6. Counterstaining
• Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes to achieve blueing.
4.2.7. Dehydration and Mounting
• Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, 100% x
2) for 2 minutes each.
• Clear in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
• Mount coverslips using permanent mounting medium.
4.3. Quality Control
4.3.1. Controls
• Include a known positive control and a negative control (no
primary antibody) to validate the staining run.
• Document control results each run.
4.4 Documentation and Reporting
4.4.1. Documentation
• Record patient identifiers, block numbers, reagents lot numbers,
staining run date, and technologist initials in the
immunohistochemistry logbook.
• Note any deviations or technical difficulties encountered during
the procedure.
4.4.2. Reporting
• Evaluate stained slides under a microscope.
• Document staining quality and any artifacts.
• Review of positive and negative control results to ensure assay
validity.
• Submit technical staining results and documentation to the
pathologist for interpretation.
