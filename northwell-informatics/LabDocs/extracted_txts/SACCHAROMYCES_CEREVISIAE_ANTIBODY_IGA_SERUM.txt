SOP for SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE ANTIBODY,
IGA, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The aim of this SOP is to describe the standardized procedure for the
detection and quantitation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Antibody, IgA
(ASCA IgA) in serum. This test is used for aiding in the diagnosis of
inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all qualified personnel performing the
analytical phase of generating results for Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Antibody, IgA, Serum.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to ensure
that the procedure is followed accurately. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for oversight and ensuring quality control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Container: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Specimen Volume Required: 1-2 mL of serum
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 14 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): Stable for up to 30 days.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Lipemic samples
◦ Samples with gross microbial contamination
◦ Serum samples received in tubes other than SST
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Automated ELISA reader
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Single and multichannel pipettes
• Reagents:
◦ ASCA IgA ELISA kit
◦ Diluent
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Supplies:
◦ Microtiter plates
◦ Pipette tips
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Protective eyewear
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Allow all kit components and specimens to reach room
temperature before use.
Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Label and arrange the ELISA plate according to the assay
layout.
◦ Assign wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Serum Sample Preparation:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 in the provided sample
diluent.
3. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and any other
required reagents as per the kit instructions.
4. Assay Execution:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, diluted controls, and patient
samples to the assigned wells in duplicate.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with wash buffer using an
automated plate washer.
◦ Add 100 µL of the conjugate to each well and incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times again with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate
for 10-15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 15 minutes of stopping the reaction.
Calculation of Results:
1. Construct a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards against their concentration.
2. Determine the concentration of ASCA IgA in patient samples by
interpolating the absorbance from the standard curve.
3. Report results in units/mL.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure assay
validity.
• Compare the results of quality control samples against
established ranges.
• Any run failing to meet quality control criteria must be repeated.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results before reporting.
• Document the results accurately in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Notify the appropriate clinical personnel in the event of critical
values or anomalies.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <20 units/mL
• Indeterminate: 20-25 units/mL
• Positive: >25 units/mL
10. LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE
• This test is not intended to be a stand-alone diagnostic tool and
should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and
other laboratory results.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples may interfere with
the test results.
