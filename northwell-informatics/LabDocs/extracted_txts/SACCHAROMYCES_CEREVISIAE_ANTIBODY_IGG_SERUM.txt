Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Protocol for Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Antibody,
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for the analysis of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae Antibody (IgG) in serum specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory technicians are responsible for performing the
test and ensuring accurate and reliable results using the following
procedures. Supervisors are responsible for verifying the results and
ensuring compliance with quality control standards.
1. DEFINITION:
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Antibody (IgG): An immunoglobulin G
(IgG) specific to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly used in the
diagnosis of certain gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's
disease.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Specimen: Serum (collected, received, and accessioned)
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Antibody (IgG)
• Microplate reader (ELISA reader)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Wash buffer
• Sample diluent
• Conjugate solution
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution (sulfuric acid)
• Calibrators and controls (negative and positive)
• Absorbent paper
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Timer
1. REAGENT STORAGE:
• ELISA kit components: Store at 2-8°C as per manufacturer's
instructions.
• Stop solution: Store at room temperature.
• All reagents should be brought to room temperature before use.
1. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Ensure all samples, reagents, and controls are properly
identified and documented.
2. Allow reagents and serum samples to reach room temperature
before beginning the assay.
3. Prepare the wash buffer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Dilute serum samples using the sample diluent as per the kit
instructions, typically 1:100.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and diluted patient
sample to the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well
after the incubation.
◦ Tap the plate on absorbent paper to remove residual liquid.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
◦ Tap the plate on absorbent paper to remove excess wash
buffer.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
9. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader
within 30 minutes after adding the stop solution.
11. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run both positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• Verify that the absorbance values of the controls fall within the
acceptable range provided by the kit manufacturer.
• If controls fall outside the anticipated range, investigate potential
causes, and repeat the assay if necessary.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Determine the presence or absence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
IgG antibodies based on the absorbance readings and compare
them to the calibrators.
• Results are given in either positive or negative based on the cutoff
values as specified in the kit’s instructions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review all results for consistency and verify before release.
• Critical or unexpected findings must be reported to the requesting
physician promptly.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Any hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples may affect the
results.
• The test should be interpreted in the context of the patient's
clinical condition and other diagnostic tests.
1. REFERENCES:
• Kit manufacturer's instructions.
• Clinical laboratory standards and guidelines.
By adhering to this comprehensive protocol, the accuracy and
reliability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Antibody (IgG) analysis will
be ensured, thereby supporting the diagnostic process for
gastrointestinal disorders.
