Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
SAFFLOWER (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS) IgE Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for performing and documenting
IgE testing for Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) allergen in serum or
plasma specimens. This test is designed to identify specific IgE
antibodies in patients suspected of having an allergy to Safflower.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff within the immunology laboratory will perform
and document IgE testing.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
testing process which may affect test results and bring them to the
attention of laboratory supervisors.
• Staff and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the testing
is performed and documented according to these procedures,
including any corrective actions that may be required.
1. DEFINITION
IgE testing for Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) is a specific assay to
detect IgE antibodies against the Safflower allergen in serum or
plasma, used in diagnosing allergic sensitizations.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Specimen types: Serum or plasma
• Preferred collection: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or PST
(Plasma Separator Tube)
• Stability: Serum or plasma specimens are stable for up to 7 days
when stored at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, specimens should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• Automated IgE analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia)
• Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) specific IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tubes, gloves, etc.)
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure specimens are properly labelled with patient
identifiers and collection date/time.
◦ Centrifuge SST or PST tubes to separate serum/plasma.
◦ Aliquot serum/plasma into appropriately labelled secondary
tubes.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Perform initial calibration of the analyzer with manufacturer-
provided calibrators.
◦ Run internal quality controls (negative and positive) with
each batch to ensure assay accuracy.
◦ Record QC results and verify the analyzer's readiness for
sample testing.
3. Testing:
◦ Load prepared serum/plasma specimens, reagents, and
controls into the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Initiate the IgE testing protocol specific for Safflower
allergen.
◦ Upon completion, retrieve and document the results from
the analyzer.
4. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot according to manufacturer’s
protocol and repeat QC.
◦ If calibrators are out of range, recalibrate the analyzer
before proceeding.
5. Analyzing Results:
◦ Verify results against QC standards.
◦ If results are flagged by the system or show values outside
expected ranges, rerun the sample or contact the supervisor
for further action.
Reporting Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the designated technologist.
• Document and report IgE levels for Safflower according to site-
specific reporting guidelines.
• Indicate critical values or significant findings as per established
laboratory policies.
Sample Integrity:
• If sample integrity is in question (e.g., hemolysis), the technologist
may use best judgment to report results after reviewing visual
inspection or centrifugation integrity.
• Note any comments regarding sample quality in the LIS.
Critical Results:
• Critical results should be reviewed immediately and
communicated to the physician or care provider following the
protocol for critical values.
• Document all communications regarding critical results in the
patient's record.

• Laboratory standard QC procedures for IgE testing.
• Laboratory Information System guidelines for result verification
and reporting.
This SOP ensures that all steps in the analytical phase of Safflower
(Carthamus tinctorius) IgE testing are performed consistently and
according to established guidelines to provide reliable and accurate
diagnostic information.
