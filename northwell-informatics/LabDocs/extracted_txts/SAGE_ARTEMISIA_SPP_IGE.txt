Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SAGE (ARTEMISIA SPP.) IGE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of SAGE (ARTEMISIA SPP.)
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in patient samples to ensure accurate
and reliable test results. This procedure includes preparation,
analysis, quality control, and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as per this SOP, ensure all quality control
measures are met, and report results accurately.
1. PROCEDURAL DETAILS
MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit specific for
SAGE IgE (manufacturer-specified)
• Microplate reader (ELISA reader) with appropriate software
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibration standards and controls
• Sample diluent
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Timer
• Laboratory notebook or computerized laboratory information
system (LIS)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Accept patient serum or plasma samples that are appropriately
labeled with patient identification, collection date, and time.
2. Centrifuge samples to remove any particulates or cellular
debris.
3. Aliquot appropriate volume of the sample into labeled
microtubes if required.
B. Reagents and Calibration:
1. Prepare reagents, standards, and controls as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure calibration standards cover the full range of expected
IgE levels for accurate quantification.
3. Reconstitute lyophilized reagents and bring them to room
temperature before starting the assay.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Add the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and patient
samples to the designated wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Add the enzyme-conjugated anti-IgE reagent to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Wash the plate using the wash buffer to remove unbound
substances.
5. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time to allow color development.
6. Add stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
7. Read the absorbance of each well at the specified wavelength
using the microplate reader.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch to
ensure assay validity.
2. Ensure that the controls fall within the manufacturer-specified
ranges.
3. Document any deviations and repeat the assay if necessary.
E. Calibration and Verification:
1. Use the calibration curve generated from the standards to
quantify the IgE levels in patient samples.
2. Verify results by comparing them with control values to ensure
accuracy.
3. Troubleshoot any anomalies as per the manufacturer's
guidelines and repeat assays if required.
4. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
5. Calculate the concentration of IgE in each sample using the
ELISA reader's software and the generated calibration curve.
6. Record the results in the laboratory notebook or enter them into
the LIS.
7. Review and verify all data entries for accuracy.
8. Report results in the prescribed format and communicate
critical values to the appropriate clinician.
Reference Intervals:
• SAGE IgE levels: Refer to the manufacturer's packet insert for
interpretive reference ranges specific to the assay used.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Follow all quality assurance protocols to ensure the accuracy and
reproducibility of results. • Maintain all records of assay performance,
calibration, and quality control results. • Perform regular maintenance
and calibration of equipment as specified by the manufacturer.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer's instruction manual for the specific ELISA
kit used for SAGE (ARTEMISIA SPP.) IgE analysis for detailed
procedures and guidance.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP should be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor or director. All updates and revisions must be
documented, and laboratory personnel must be trained on any
changes to the protocol.
