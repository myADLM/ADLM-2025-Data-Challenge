SALICYLATE Quantification Protocol
1. PURPOSE To establish standardized procedures for the
quantification of salicylates in patient samples, ensuring accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility of test results in adherence to CLIA
guidelines.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff
to follow this protocol to prepare, analyze, and report salicylate
levels. The staff must ensure that any anomalies or discrepancies are
addressed and documented promptly in consultation with the
supervising laboratory personnel.
2. DEFINITION Salicylate: A type of chemical compound commonly
found in medications like aspirin. Elevated salicylate levels can
indicate overdose and require prompt clinical intervention.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or Plasma
• Collection Container: Red top or Green top (heparinized)
Vacutainer
• Stability: 8 hours at room temperature, 48 hours refrigerated (2-8
°C), frozen samples are stable up to 1 month at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed samples, samples collected
in EDTA or citrate tubes, samples with significant air
contamination.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Spectrophotometer or HPLC system
• Calibrated pipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Salicylate reagent kit (ensuring within expiration dates)
• Control sera (low, medium, high concentrations)
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibration: Perform calibration using salicylate standards
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Document calibration
results.
• Quality Control: Run internal QC material at low, medium, and
high concentrations daily before performing patient tests.
Document results and ensure they are within acceptable limits
before proceeding to sample analysis.
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge blood sample to obtain serum or plasma, ensure
samples are clear and free from hemolysis or clots.
◦ Aliquot required volume for analysis.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Prepare reagents and standards as per kit instructions.
◦ Pipette the sample aliquots and standards into designated
wells.
◦ Mix reagents thoroughly using vortex mixer.
◦ Incubate samples and reagents as required per procedural
guidelines.
◦ Read absorbance using spectrophotometer or HPLC
system.
3. Analyzing Results:
◦ Compare sample readings against calibration curve.
◦ Calculate salicylate concentration in patient samples.
4. Troubleshooting:
◦ If results fall outside expected ranges, check for procedural
errors, recalibrate if necessary, and repeat the analysis.
◦ Document any discrepancies and corrective actions taken.
Sample Integrity:
• Check samples before analysis for hemolysis, clotting, or
contamination.
• Record sample condition and any compromises in integrity.
Reporting Results:
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Communicate critical results immediately to the designated
clinician.
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic Range: 10-30 mg/dL
• Toxic Range: >30 mg/dL
Critical Values:
• Call critical results >30 mg/dL to the responsible clinician as per
established guidelines.
• Document the call and communication on the patient's record.
Method Limitations:
• Measured salicylate levels may be affected by hemolysis.
• Ensure all blood collection and preparation methods avoid
hemolysis for accurate analysis.
References: Refer to the Salicylate reagent kit insert for detailed
procedural and material information.
Maintenance and Monitoring:
Calibration and Maintenance:
• Spectrophotometer/HPLC system should be calibrated weekly
and after any maintenance.
• Use manufacturer's guidelines for routine instrument
maintenance.
Staff Training:
• All personnel must be trained and competent in salicylate testing
protocols and instrumentation functionality.
Documentation:
• Properly log all quality control, calibration, and patient results.
• Maintain records for audits and inspections per CLIA regulations.
This protocol will enable consistent and reliable salicylate
quantification, crucial for patient diagnosis and management.
Compliance with this SOP ensures adherence to laboratory
standards and regulatory requirements.
