Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Salicylate, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions on the analytical phase of generating
results for salicylate concentration in serum, ensuring accurate and
reliable results for clinical diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all qualified laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis of serum samples for salicylate
concentration at the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
personnel are trained and that the analysis is carried out correctly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum from blood collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples;
samples collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
sodium citrate).
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents: Salicylate reagent kit (refer to the manufacturer's
package insert for lot-specific information)
• Equipment: Chemistry analyzer compatible with the salicylate
reagent kit
• Supplies: Pipettes, test tubes, calibration standards, control
materials
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibrate the chemistry analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions using provided calibration standards.
• Run quality control (QC) materials, including both negative and
positive controls, at the beginning of each assay run and after
every 20 samples. Ensure QC results fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with sample analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at appropriate
temperature.
2. Verify that the analyzer is calibrated and QC checks are within
acceptable limits.
7.2 Sample Handling
1. Centrifuge serum samples (if not using SST) to separate the
serum and avoid any hemolysis.
2. Transfer the clear serum into appropriately labeled test tubes.
7.3 Analysis
1. Load the salicylate reagent kit into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Select the appropriate test method for salicylate on the
analyzer.
3. Place the serum samples on the analyzer sample carousel or
sample input area.
4. Initiate the analysis run following the analyzer's operating
procedure.
7.4 Result Generation
1. The analyzer will automatically process the serum samples and
generate salicylate concentrations.
2. Review the generated results for any error codes or flags.
Repeat analysis if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the salicylate concentrations in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Verify the results for accuracy and release them for clinical review.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 10-30 mg/dL
• Toxic range: >30 mg/dL
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the salicylate reagent kit package insert for specific
limitations of the method, such as potential interference from other
substances in the serum.
