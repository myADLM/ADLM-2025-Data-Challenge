SALL4 Immunostaining Protocol (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to provide a clear and detailed guideline for the
analytical phase of generating immunohistochemical results
using SALL4 antibodies. The procedures herein must be
adhered to ensure accurate detection of SALL4 protein
expression in tissue specimens.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
following the procedures outlined in this protocol to generate
accurate immunostaining results. The Quality Control Officer is
responsible for ensuring the procedures are followed and for
addressing any discrepancies.
1. DEFINITION: SALL4 is a zinc finger transcription factor, critical
for maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells,
and is often used as a diagnostic marker for various cancers.
2. SPECIMEN PREPARATION: Specimen Type: • Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Specimen Collection and Handling: • Ensure tissue specimens are
properly fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 6-24 hours prior to
embedding in paraffin. • Embed specimens in paraffin blocks and cut
sections into 4-5 micrometer thick slices. • Affix tissue sections onto
positively charged microscope slides.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS: Primary Antibody: • Anti-SALL4
antibody.
Secondary Antibody: • Biotinylated secondary antibody or HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody.
Detection System: • HRP/DAB detection system or alternative
chromogenic detection systems.
Ancillary Reagents: • Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH
6.0 or EDTA buffer, pH 8.0). • Blocking solution (e.g., 3% BSA or
normal serum). • Washing buffer (e.g., PBS or TBS).
Equipment: • Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup. •
Microscope for evaluating results.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in a slide holder and immerse them in xylene for
two changes, 5 minutes each to deparaffinize.
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 85%, and 70%) for 2-3 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water.
B) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Preheat the antigen retrieval solution to approximately
95-100°C using a water bath or microwave.
2. Immerse slides in the preheated solution and incubate for 15-20
minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS or TBS wash
buffer.
C) Blocking:
1. Incubate tissue sections with blocking solution for 20 minutes to
block non-specific binding.
2. Drain off the blocking solution without rinsing.
D) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Dilute the primary antibody according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Apply the primary antibody to the tissue sections and incubate
overnight at 4°C or for 1 hour at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides three times in PBS or TBS buffer, 5 minutes each
rinse.
E) Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply biotinylated or HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to
the tissue sections.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides three times in PBS or TBS buffer, 5 minutes each
rinse.
F) Detection:
1. Apply the chromogenic substrate (DAB or alternative) and
incubate until the desired staining intensity is achieved (typically
2-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water and counterstain with hematoxylin
if required.
G) Mounting:
1. Dehydrate tissue sections through graded ethanol and clear in
xylene.
2. Apply a coverslip with a suitable mounting medium.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
Internal Quality Control: • Include positive and negative control slides
in each batch of staining to ensure the accuracy and specificity of the
immunostaining process. • Document all observations and
discrepancies in the QC log and report to the supervisor.
External Quality Control: • Participate in inter-laboratory comparison
programs and proficiency testing to ensure the consistency of results
across different laboratories.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
2. Use a microscope to evaluate the presence and intensity of
immunostaining.
3. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring accuracy and completeness.
4. Any discrepancies or unusual staining patterns must be
reevaluated, documented, and reviewed with the supervisor.
5. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions and datasheets for SALL4 antibody. •
Protocols and guidelines from relevant scientific publications and
professional bodies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
2. Optimal incubation times and conditions may vary depending
on tissue type and fixation quality.
3. Ensure thorough validation of antibody and detection system
before routine use.
4. Troubleshoot and optimize procedures based on observed
variations in staining quality.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
6. If non-specific staining or weak signal is observed, re-evaluate
the antibody dilution and blocking conditions.
7. In case of complete absence of staining, verify the functionality
and storage conditions of the antibodies and reagents.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
generation of accurate and reproducible SALL4 immunostaining
results.
