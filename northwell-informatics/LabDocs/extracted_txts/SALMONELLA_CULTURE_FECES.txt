Salmonella Culture, Feces SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the isolation, identification,
and confirmation of Salmonella species in fecal specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Salmonella culture procedures according to this SOP. The supervisor
must ensure that all staff are adequately trained and that quality
control is maintained.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Freshly collected fecal specimen (at least 5 grams) in a clean,
sterile container.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens that are dried out or contaminated.
• Specimens without proper labeling or collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile culture containers
• Applicator sticks
• Buffered peptone water
• Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth
• Selenite broth
• Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate (XLD) agar
• Hektoen enteric (HE) agar
• Salmonella-Shigella (SS) agar
• Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) agar slants
• Urease test
• Motility Indole Ornithine (MIO) medium
• Automated identification system if available (e.g., VITEK® MS,
MALDI-TOF)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Enrichment and Selective Enrichment:
1. Weigh approximately 1 gram of feces and inoculate into 9 mL of
buffered peptone water.
2. Incubate at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
3. Transfer 1 mL of the pre-enriched sample into 10 mL of selenite
and 10 mL of RV broth.
4. Incubate selenite broth at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours and RV
broth at 42-43°C for 18-24 hours.
B. Plating on Selective Agar:
1. Using a sterile loop, streak samples from selenite and RV
broths onto selective agar plates (XLD, HE, and SS agar).
2. Incubate at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
C. Identification:
1. Examine plates for typical Salmonella colonies.
◦ XLD: Red colonies with black centers.
◦ HE: Green, blue-green colonies with black centers.
◦ SS: Colorless colonies with black centers.
2. Perform preliminary biochemical tests on presumptive colonies:
◦ TSI agar slants: Inoculate and incubate at 35-37°C for 18-24
hours.
◦ Urease test.
◦ MIO medium.
3. Use an automated identification system for confirmation if
available.
D. Confirmation:
1. Confirm by serological testing using specific Salmonella
antisera if available.
2. Use molecular methods (PCR) for confirmation if required.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure proper functioning and calibration of equipment.
• Use known Salmonella control strains for quality control.
• Perform regular environmental monitoring to avoid contamination.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Record all findings.
• Report preliminary positive results to clinicians as soon as
possible.
• Confirmed positive results should be reported following site-
specific guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION:
Interpretation:
• Positive: Isolation and identification of Salmonella species.
• Negative: No Salmonella species isolated.
Method Limitations:
• Ensure proper specimen collection; delayed processing and
improper storage can affect recovery.
• Background flora may interfere with isolation.
1. REFERENCES:
• Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,
23rd Edition.
• Manufacturer's instructions for biochemical test kits and
automated identification systems.
• Relevant clinical microbiology guidelines and publications.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to local regulations.
Document Review: This SOP should be reviewed annually or
whenever new methodologies are introduced.
