Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Salmonella Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Salmonella-specific IgE in serum
samples, ensuring consistent and accurate results in compliance with
regulatory standards.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated laboratory personnel responsible
for performing Salmonella IgE testing on serum samples in the
clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP, ensuring proper handling and processing of samples,
performing the testing accurately, and adhering to quality control
protocols.
1. DEFINITION
Salmonella-specific IgE: An immunoglobulin E antibody produced in
response to Salmonella infection, measurable in patient serum.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader and
washer
• Microplate incubator
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Salmonella-specific IgE ELISA kit
• Serum samples
• Quality control samples (positive and negative controls)
• Deionized water
• Laboratory timer
5.2. Pre-Analytical Phase
• Ensure samples are appropriately labeled and accompanied by a
complete requisition form.
• Verify that serum samples are free of hemolysis, lipemia, and are
clearly identified.
• Centrifuge whole blood samples at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
• Transfer serum to appropriately labeled aliquots for testing.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours or freeze
at -20°C for longer storage.
5.3. Analytical Phase
5.3.1. Reagent Preparation
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
use.
• Prepare wash buffer and other reagents according to the ELISA
kit instructions.
• Follow kit instructions for the preparation of standard and control
solutions.
5.3.2. Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Control Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and sample to the
designated wells of the microplate.
◦ Use duplicates or triplicates for standards, controls, and
samples to ensure accuracy.
2. Incubation
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive film and incubate at 37°C for
60 minutes.
◦ Ensure even temperature distribution and avoid light
exposure.
3. Washing
◦ Wash the plate 4 times with the prepared wash buffer using
an automatic washer or manual wash method.
◦ Ensure complete removal of liquid during each wash step.
4. Enzyme Conjugate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Substrate Reaction
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
6. Stopping Reaction
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ The color should change from blue to yellow.
7. Measurement
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
5.3.3. Data Analysis
• Generate a standard curve using the OD values of the standards.
• Calculate the concentration of Salmonella-specific IgE in the
samples based on the standard curve.
• Ensure quality control samples fall within acceptable ranges for
the assay to be valid.
5.4. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to validate the
test results.
• Record the control values and compare against established
ranges.
• Document any deviations and take corrective actions as
necessary.
5.5. Reporting Results
• Verify and document all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Ensure critical results are reviewed by a senior technologist or
supervisor before release.
• Report results to the requesting physician in accordance with
laboratory reporting guidelines.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in external quality assurance programs.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Maintain proficiency by periodic retraining and competency
assessments of personnel.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological specimens using universal precautions.
• Dispose of all contaminated materials in biohazard containers.
