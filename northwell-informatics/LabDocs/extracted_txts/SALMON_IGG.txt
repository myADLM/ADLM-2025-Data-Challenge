Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Determination of
Salmonella IgG Levels
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the determination of Salmonella IgG antibody levels in
patient specimens using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) method. This protocol ensures the consistent
and accurate generation of results for the detection of
Salmonella infection.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform the ELISA assay for Salmonella IgG
detection in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
(CLIA)-certified laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform this procedure and document all test results,
observations, and any deviations from the SOP. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring the staff is appropriately trained
and the procedures are followed.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ ELISA kit for Salmonella IgG detection
◦ Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
◦ Adjustable micropipettes and sterile tips
◦ Plate washer (manual or automated)
◦ Distilled or deionized water
◦ Calibrated incubator (37°C)
◦ Laboratory timer
◦ Disposable gloves and lab coat
5. REAGENTS
◦ ELISA microplate containing wells with Salmonella antigen
◦ IgG standards and controls
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Enzyme conjugate (anti-human IgG labeled with
horseradish peroxidase)
◦ Substrate solution (TMB)
◦ Stop solution (1N sulfuric acid)
◦ Specimen: Serum or plasma sample from patient
6. SAMPLE PREPARATION
◦ Serum or plasma samples should be collected, processed,
and stored according to standard operating procedures.
◦ Allow frozen samples to thaw at room temperature and mix
thoroughly before testing.
◦ If the sample is hemolyzed, it should not be used for the
assay. Request a new sample.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-assay Preparation
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
◦ Set up the microplate reader and calibrate it as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Preparation:
▪ Add 100 µL of diluted serum/plasma sample,
standards, and controls to designated wells in
duplicate.
▪ Cover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate for 1
hour at 37°C.
2. Washing:
▪ After incubation, carefully remove and discard the
plate sealer.
▪ Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL wash buffer per
well, ensuring complete removal of liquid after each
wash by patting the plate on absorbent paper towels.
3. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
▪ Cover the plate with a new plate sealer and incubate
for 30 minutes at 37°C.
4. Second Washing:
▪ Wash the plate as described in step 2.
5. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
6. Stopping Reaction:
▪ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The color
should change from blue to yellow.
▪ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
8. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean
absorbance values for each standard concentration on the
y-axis against the corresponding concentration on the x-
axis.
◦ Determine the IgG concentration of patient samples by
interpolating their absorbance values from the standard
curve.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include quality control samples in each assay run.
◦ Ensure all QC results are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS) as
defined by site-specific guidelines.
◦ Critical values should be immediately communicated to the
healthcare provider as per the laboratory's critical value
policy.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for Salmonella IgG levels should be
established and verified periodically.
◦ Common reference intervals could range depending on the
population and methodology, often provided by the assay
manufacturer.
12. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with
the assay results.
◦ Ensure the correct handling and processing of specimens to
avoid any pre-analytical variables that may affect results.
13. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's kit insert for Salmonella IgG ELISA.
◦ Laboratory standard operating procedures and guidelines.
14. REVISION HISTORY
◦ Document the history of SOP revisions, including dates and
nature of changes.
This protocol serves as a comprehensive guide for the accurate and
consistent determination of Salmonella IgG antibody levels in a
clinical laboratory setting. Regular review and adherence to this SOP
will ensure reliable test results that contribute to effective patient
care.
