STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Detection of Variants in
HEXB Gene for Sandhoff Disease
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of genetic
testing for Sandhoff Disease through full gene analysis of the HEXB
gene.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the molecular diagnostic testing for Sandhoff
Disease within our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
HEXB gene analysis according to this SOP. All staff are responsible
for the accurate documentation and quality control throughout the
testing process. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
verifying the results.
4. SAMPLE REQUIREMENT
• DNA sample extracted from peripheral blood, saliva, or buccal
swab.
• Minimum DNA concentration: 10 ng/µL.
• Total volume: at least 30 µL.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR Thermal Cycler.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform.
• Standard PCR reagents including buffers, dNTPs, HEXB-specific
primers, and Taq polymerase.
• NGS library preparation kit.
• Quality control reagents for DNA quantification (e.g., Qubit dsDNA
HS Assay Kit).
• Bioinformatics pipeline tools (e.g., BWA, GATK, ANNOVAR).
6. PROCEDURE
Step 1: PCR Amplification of HEXB Gene
A) PCR Reaction Setup:
• Prepare the PCR master mix as follows:
◦ 10 µL of DNA sample.
◦ 2.5 µL of 10X PCR buffer.
◦ 2.0 µL of MgCl2 (25 mM).
◦ 0.5 µL of dNTPs (10 mM each).
◦ 0.5 µL of HEXB-specific forward primer (10 µM).
◦ 0.5 µL of HEXB-specific reverse primer (10 µM).
◦ 0.25 µL of Taq polymerase.
◦ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 µL.
B) PCR Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
• 35 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
• Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes.
• Hold: 4°C.
Step 2: Gel Electrophoresis
• Run 5 µL of the PCR product on a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium
bromide. Verify amplification specificity and the size of the PCR
products.
Step 3: NGS Library Preparation
• Follow the NGS library preparation kit protocol to ligate adapters
to the PCR products.
• Purify the prepared libraries using magnetic beads.
• Quantify and assess quality of the libraries using Qubit and
TapeStation.
Step 4: Sequencing
• Load the libraries onto the NGS platform according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Sequence the HEXB gene with a sufficient read depth to ensure
≥100X coverage across the gene.
Step 5: Bioinformatics Analysis
A) Sequence Alignment:
• Use BWA MEM to align the sequencing reads to the reference
genome (hg19 or hg38).
B) Variant Calling:
• Use GATK HaplotypeCaller to identify variants in the HEXB gene.
C) Annotation:
• Annotate the variants using ANNOVAR.
Step 6: Interpretation of Results
• Analyze the identified variants for their potential pathogenicity
using databases such as ClinVar, HGMD, and population
databases like gnomAD.
• Correlate the identified variants with clinical information and
known phenotypes of Sandhoff disease.
Step 7: Reporting Results
• Document the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
supervisor before final reporting.
• Provide an interpretive report that includes details of the variants
found, their clinical significance, and possible consequences for
the patient.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of all equipment.
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure accuracy.
• Include internal quality control data with each sequencing run and
review results for consistency.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for genetic
testing.
8. REFERENCES
• Use primary literature and updated HEXB-specific guidelines for
the interpretation of variants.
• Utilize manufacturer's manuals for all equipment and reagents.
• Refer to the latest curated databases for variant annotation and
pathogenicity assessment.
9. DOCUMENTATION and RECORDS MANAGEMENT
• Keep accurate records of all steps of the procedure, including
sample identification, results from each quality check, and any
deviations from the protocol.
• Maintain all records for a minimum of 10 years as required by
CLIA.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the generation of
accurate and reliable results for the detection of variants in the HEXB
gene, aiding in the diagnosis of Sandhoff Disease.
