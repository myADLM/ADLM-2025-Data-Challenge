Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
SARCOMA TARGETED GENE FUSION/REARRANGEMENT
PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
performing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) targeted gene fusion/
rearrangement panel for sarcoma tumors. This ensures accurate and
reliable detection of clinically relevant gene fusions and
rearrangements, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoma
patients.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting each step of this procedure. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP and for addressing
any deviations or issues that arise.
2. DEFINITION
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput sequencing
method that allows the simultaneous sequencing of multiple DNA or
RNA fragments to identify genetic variations.
Gene Fusion/Rearrangement: A genetic alteration where one gene
fuses with another or undergoes rearrangement, which can result in
abnormal cell function and is often associated with cancer.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks or slides from sarcoma tumor samples.
2. Extraction: Extract DNA and/or RNA using validated extraction
kits and protocols. Ensure the quality and quantity of nucleic
acids by measuring concentration and assessing purity.
3. Quality Control: Determine the integrity of extracted nucleic
acids using agarose gel electrophoresis or a bioanalyzer.
Document all quality control results.
B. Library Preparation
1. Input Requirements: Ensure DNA/RNA input meets the
required quantity and quality thresholds as specified by the
library preparation kit manufacturer.
2. Reverse Transcription (if RNA): Convert RNA into
complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase.
3. Target Enrichment: Use a targeted enrichment kit specific to
sarcoma gene fusions/rearrangements to capture regions of
interest.
4. Library Construction: Complete the library preparation
process by adding adapters and unique molecular identifiers
(UMIs) for sequencing.
5. Amplification: Amplify the enriched library using PCR. Ensure
that the number of cycles does not exceed the recommended
limit to avoid over-amplification.
6. Quality Control: Assess the quality and size distribution of the
prepared libraries using a bioanalyzer. Document all quality
control results.
C. Sequencing
1. Platform: Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencer (e.g.,
Illumina, Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Sequencing Run: Initiate the sequencing run and monitor its
progress. Ensure that all quality metrics meet the acceptable
thresholds for a successful run (e.g., Q30 scores, cluster
density).
D. Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing: Use bioinformatics pipelines to process
raw sequencing data. Steps include demultiplexing, adapter
trimming, and alignment to the reference genome.
2. Variant Calling: Identify gene fusions and rearrangements
using specialized software tools. Ensure high confidence in
variant calls by applying appropriate filters and thresholds.
3. Interpretation: Annotate identified gene fusions/
rearrangements with relevant clinical information and
classification. Use databases and literature to aid in
interpretation.
4. Quality Control: Perform quality checks at each analysis step
to ensure data integrity. Document any deviations from
expected results and take corrective actions if necessary.
E. Reporting
1. Result Verification: Verify the final results by an experienced
molecular pathologist or designated personnel.
2. Report Generation: Create a comprehensive report
summarizing the identified gene fusions/rearrangements, their
clinical significance, and any recommended follow-up actions.
3. Result Communication: Ensure timely communication of
results to the requesting physician or clinical team. Document
the communication of critical results following laboratory policy.
F. Quality Control and Assurance
1. External Controls and Standards: Run positive and negative
controls alongside patient samples to ensure assay accuracy
and specificity.
2. Proficiency Testing: Participate in external proficiency testing
programs to validate the accuracy and reliability of the assay.
3. Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation of all steps,
controls, and results. Store data in compliance with regulatory
requirements.

5. TRAINING AND COMPETENCY
All laboratory personnel performing sarcoma targeted gene fusion/
rearrangement panel NGS testing must undergo initial training and
yearly competency assessments. Training records should be
maintained and reviewed regularly.
