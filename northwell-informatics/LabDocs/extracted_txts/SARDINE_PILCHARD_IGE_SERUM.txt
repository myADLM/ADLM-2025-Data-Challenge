Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating SARDINE (PILCHARD), IGE, SERUM Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
IGE (Immunoglobulin E) results specific to SARDINE (PILCHARD)
from serum specimens. This procedure ensures the accuracy and
reliability of the test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
assay, validate the results, and ensure compliance with this SOP.
1. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
To determine the concentration of SARDINE (PILCHARD)-specific
IgE in patient serum samples using an immunoassay technique,
typically an automated immunoassay analyzer.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Collection: Specimen must be collected in an SST (Serum
Separator Tube) and allowed to clot for 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required.
• Stability:
◦ At Room Temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or below): 1 month
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, UniCAP, or
equivalent)
• Reagent kit specific for SARDINE (PILCHARD) IgE
• Calibrators and control materials
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposable pipette tips
• Sample cups
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow the serum samples and reagents to reach room
temperature before testing.
2. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and ensure it has
completed all self-checks and calibrations.
B. Loading Samples:
1. Label the sample cups with patient identifiers.
2. Pipette 50 µL of each serum sample into the corresponding
sample cup.
3. Load the sample cups onto the sample tray of the
immunoassay analyzer.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Follow the specific instructions provided by the analyzer
manufacturer for operating the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Enter the necessary information into the analyzer, including
patient identifiers and test codes.
3. Load the SARDINE (PILCHARD) IgE reagent kit, calibrators,
and controls onto the analyzer.
4. Start the assay process as directed by the analyzer’s software.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run the quality control materials included in the reagent kit to
verify the assay performance.
2. Ensure that the quality control results fall within the acceptable
ranges specified by the manufacturer. If the controls fail,
investigate the cause, troubleshoot, and repeat the quality
control process before testing patient samples.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review the results generated by the immunoassay analyzer.
5. Verify that the calibration and control results are within
acceptable limits.
6. If the result for SARDINE (PILCHARD) IgE is within the
reportable range, review the numerical value and report it in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. If any errors or flags are indicated by the analyzer, repeat the
test or consult with a supervisor for further action.
8. Comply with site-specific reporting guidelines for documenting
and communicating the results.
Reference Intervals:
• The reference interval for SARDINE (PILCHARD)-specific IgE
should be provided by the assay manufacturer and verified by the
laboratory.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Three levels of quality control material are analyzed as per the
manufacturer's instructions using the same methodology as
patient samples.
2. Document and review the results of the quality control materials
with each assay run: negative, low-positive, and high-positive
controls.
B. External Proficiency Testing:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs for
SARDINE (PILCHARD) IgE, if available, to validate assay
performance.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit insert for detailed information on any
limitations associated with the assay, including potential
interferences, limitations of detecting low or high concentrations, and
specificity concerns.
