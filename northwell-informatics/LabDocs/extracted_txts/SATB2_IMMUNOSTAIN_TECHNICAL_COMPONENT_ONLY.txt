Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SATB2 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To ensure consistent and accurate protocols for analyzing SATB2
immunostains in the laboratory, focusing on the technical component
to generate precise results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for executing,
monitoring, and documenting the procedures as defined in this SOP.
Supervisors shall oversee the overall adherence to the SOP and
address any deviations or issues arising during the analytical phase.
2. DEFINITION
SATB2 is an immunohistochemical marker commonly used to identify
colorectal carcinomas, osteosarcomas, and other specific
malignancies. The technical component involves the preparation,
staining, and initial validation of the results prior to pathologist review.
3. PROCEDURE
Materials Needed:
• SATB2 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody and detection system (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Buffer solutions (PBS)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Slide labeling tools
• Immunostaining equipment (e.g., autostainer)
• Deparaffinization and rehydration reagents (e.g., xylene, ethanol,
and water)
Preparation:
1. Retrieve archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections.
2. Cut 4μm sections using a microtome and place on charged
slides.
3. Label slides appropriately with the specimen identification
number, date, and the SATB2 stain indication.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes (2 changes).
2. Rehydrate slides with descending concentrations of ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70% each for 5 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Preheat antigen retrieval solution (e.g., sodium citrate buffer pH
6.0) to 95-100°C.
2. Immerse slides into the retrieval solution and maintain the
temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
Blocking Endogenous Activity:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides with PBS (3x5 minutes).
Primary Antibody Application:
1. Apply SATB2 primary antibody dilution to slides.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 1 hour.
3. Rinse slides with PBS (3x5 minutes).
Secondary Antibody and Detection System:
1. Apply secondary antibody linked to a detection system (e.g.,
biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody).
2. Incubate slides in a humidity chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes.
3. Wash with PBS (3x5 minutes).
4. Apply the substrate (e.g., DAB) to slides, incubate for 5
minutes.
5. Rinse slides with tap water to stop the reaction.
Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain tissue sections with hematoxylin for 2 minutes.
2. Rinse and blue hematoxylin using running tap water.
Dehydration, Clearing, and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides with ascending concentrations of ethanol
(70%, 95%, 100% each for 5 minutes).
2. Clear slides in xylene (2 changes, 10 minutes each).
3. Mount coverslip using permanent mounting medium and allow
to dry.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control tissue sections with each
run.
2. Examine controls under the microscope to confirm proper
staining. Positive control should demonstrate expected nuclear
positivity, and negative control should show no staining.
3. If controls do not produce expected results, repeat the staining
procedure or troubleshoot according to established guidelines.
Documentation and Review:
1. Record all reagent lot numbers and expiration dates, incubation
times, and any deviations.
2. Validate the staining procedure by ensuring proper quality
control results.
3. Prepare case documentation for pathologist review.
Result Verification: Technologists must review all slides to ensure
technical quality before submitting them to the pathologist. Any
discrepancies or unclear staining should be noted and addressed.
