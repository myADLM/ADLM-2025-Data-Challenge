Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
SC5B-9 Level Terminal Complement Complex, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for SC5B-9 Level Terminal Complement
Complex in plasma specimens.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform SC5B-9 Level Terminal Complement Complex
testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to ensure that
testing is performed accurately and efficiently and that results are
recorded and reported in accordance with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in an EDTA tube.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in an EDTA anticoagulant tube.
• Invert the tube gently 8-10 times to mix anticoagulant with blood
and prevent clotting.
Transport and Storage:
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory on ice* as soon
as possible and processed within 2 hours of collection.
• Centrifuge the blood at 1500x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate
plasma.
• Aliquot plasma into a labeled polypropylene tube without
disturbing the cell layer.
• Store plasma aliquots at -80°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens that have been thawed more than once.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• -80°C Freezer.
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm and
540 nm (reference).
Reagents:
• SC5B-9 ELISA kit.
◦ Capture antibody.
◦ Detection antibody.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Wash buffer.
◦ Standards and controls.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma specimens on ice and mix well before use.
2. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided in the SC5B-9 ELISA kit.
Assay Protocol:
1. Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and plasma samples into
appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
material.
4. Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
6. Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 10-15
minutes.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
10. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with 540 nm as a reference
using a plate reader.
Calculation of Results:
1. Create a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
each standard against its corresponding concentration.
2. Determine the concentration of SC5B-9 in the plasma samples
by comparing the sample absorbance to the standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control samples provided with the kit in each run.
• Verify that the results for the controls are within the acceptable
range before reporting results.
• If control results are out of range, troubleshoot the assay and
repeat the test.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing the report.
• Report results in ng/mL with reference interval provided in the
assay kit insert.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard biosafety guidelines for handling human
specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste according to laboratory protocols.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps and observations during the assay run in the
laboratory logbook.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
• Document corrective actions taken for any deviations from the
protocol.
