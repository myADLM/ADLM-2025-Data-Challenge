Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for SCALE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reliable generation of
laboratory results for SCALE (Specific IgE levels), IGE (Total
Immunoglobulin E), and SERUM (Serum proteins and other
specific biochemical markers) tests.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting SCALE, IGE, and SERUM analyses, adhering strictly to
the following procedures to maintain accuracy and precision. All
laboratory staff must ensure proper documentation of results and any
corrective actions taken.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Plate Reader
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and Tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator
• Wash Buffer (PBS-Tween)
• Reagent Kits (for SCALE, IGE, and SERUM analyses)
• Standard Calibration Curves
• Control Samples (Positive and Negative Controls)
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents, standards, and controls as per the
manufacturer's instructions provided in the reagent kit
inserts.
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
2. Calibration and Controls:
◦ Prepare standard calibration curves for quantitative assays.
◦ Run positive and negative controls alongside every batch of
patient samples to ensure assay validity.
B) Sample Processing:
1. Handling and Preparation:
◦ Upon receipt, inspect serum samples to ensure they were
stored and transported under proper conditions.
◦ Centrifuge the serum samples at 2000-3000rpm for 10
minutes to separate any particulates and aliquot the
supernatant into clean tubes.
◦ Maintain sample integrity by minimizing freeze-thaw cycles
and use appropriate labeling for traceability.
2. Assay Procedure for SCALE and IGE (ELISA Method):
◦ Dilute serum samples as necessary following the specific
instructions provided in the kit.
◦ Load diluted samples, standards, and controls into
designated wells of the coated microtiter plate.
◦ Incubate plates at the recommended temperature and time
settings specified by the reagent manufacturer.
◦ Perform required wash steps using the provided wash buffer
to remove unbound material.
◦ Add enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate
as specified.
◦ Clear excess reagents by washing and then add the
substrate solution. Allow color development as per
manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Stop the reaction using stop solution and measure
absorbance at the recommended wavelength using the
ELISA plate reader.
3. Assay Procedure for SERUM (various biochemical
analyses):
◦ Follow the specific assay instructions for each biochemical
marker in the serum analysis panel.
◦ Load samples, standards, and controls following the
detailed protocol for each marker.
◦ Incubate, wash, and read results as directed using
appropriate analytical equipment (e.g., spectrophotometer,
specific analyzers).
◦ Documentation of equipment settings and specific assay
parameters to ensure replication and traceability of results.
C) Interpretation of Results:
• Compare absorbance values of the samples against the standard
calibration curve to determine the concentration of SCALE and
IGE in the samples.
• Analyze the results of SERUM tests against reference ranges
provided in the analytical guidelines to identify any abnormal
findings.
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
along with the necessary quality control data.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Validation:
◦ Results obtained must be validated by cross-checking
against quality control standards. Review any deviations
that fall outside the established control limits and take
corrective actions if necessary.
◦ Re-run quality control samples if needed to confirm assay
validity.
2. Documentation:
◦ Ensure that all results, along with date, time, and technician
initials, are accurately recorded in the LIS.
◦ Save instrument readouts and standard curve data for audit
purposes and future reference.
3. Communication:
◦ Report verified results to the requesting physician or
relevant department following established communication
protocols.
◦ Promptly report any critical or significantly abnormal results
directly as per critical value reporting guidelines.
Quality Control:
• Follow quality control procedures for each assay, including daily,
weekly, and monthly checks on instrumentation performance.
• Document and review quality control results periodically and
participate in proficiency testing programs.

Review and Updates: This SOP should be reviewed annually or as
necessary to accommodate new equipment, reagents, and
procedures.
By following this SOP, we ensure the integrity, accuracy, and
reliability of SCALE, IGE, and SERUM analyses in the laboratory,
supporting high standards of patient care and diagnostic accuracy.
