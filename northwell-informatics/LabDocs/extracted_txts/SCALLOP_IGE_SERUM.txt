Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
SCALLOP, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a comprehensive guideline for
processing, analyzing, and generating results for SCALLOP (Scallop
IgG or IgA), IGE (Immunoglobulin E), and SERUM samples. This
procedure ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the
analytical phase of SCALLOP, IGE, and SERUM testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory personnel responsible for the analysis are required to
follow this SOP precisely to ensure the validity and accuracy of test
results. It is the responsibility of each staff member to report any
deviations or abnormalities observed during the analytical process to
the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum volume required is 1 mL of serum
• Collection: Serum samples should be collected following standard
venipuncture procedures.
• Stability: Samples should be processed within 2 hours of
collection. If processing is delayed, store samples at 2-8°C for up
to 48 hours.
• Transport: Transport serum samples in a leak-proof container,
maintaining a temperature of 2-8°C to the laboratory.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• SCALLOP, IGE, and SERUM assay kits (manufacturer-specific)
• Calibration materials
• Quality control materials
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Incubator (37°C if specified in the assay procedure)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Allow the serum sample to reach room temperature if
previously refrigerated.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to ensure
separation of the serum from any residual cells.
3. Use a clean pipette to carefully transfer the serum without
disturbing the cell layer.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the equipment according to manufacturer instructions
before performing any assays.
2. Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning of each shift
and when opening a new reagent lot or kit.
3. Ensure QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples. Document all QC results.
C. Analytical Procedure
SCALLOP Analysis:
1. Follow the specific SCALLOP assay kit instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of the serum sample into the
appropriate wells or tubes.
3. Add reagents as specified by the SCALLOP assay protocol.
4. Incubate the samples as indicated (e.g., 37°C for a specific
time).
5. Measure absorbance or fluorescence using the reader specified
in the assay method.
6. Record the results in the LIS.
IGE Analysis:
1. Follow the specific IGE assay kit instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of the serum sample into the
appropriate wells or tubes.
3. Add reagents as specified by the IGE assay protocol.
4. Incubate the samples as indicated (e.g., 37°C for a specific
time).
5. Measure absorbance or fluorescence using the reader specified
in the assay method.
6. Record the results in the LIS.
SERUM Analysis:
1. Follow the specific serum assay kit instructions for any
particular analyte (e.g., total protein, albumin).
2. Pipette the required volume of the serum sample into the
appropriate wells or tubes.
3. Add reagents as specified by the serum assay protocol.
4. Incubate the samples as indicated by the method.
5. Measure the result using the appropriate instrumentation.
6. Record the results in the LIS.
D. Interpretation and Verification
1. Compare the sample results to the reference range provided by
the manufacturer or established by the laboratory.
2. Verify the results by ensuring the QC passed and reviewing
duplicate or repeat analysis consistency.
3. If any results fall outside the expected range, repeat the
analysis or perform troubleshooting as specified by the assay
protocol.
E. Reporting Results
1. Ensure all results are directly entered and verified in the LIS
before releasing.
2. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for critical values and
unexpected results.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration and QC runs according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
• Document all QC activities and corrective actions if QC results are
out of the acceptable range.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs when
applicable.
1. PRECAUTIONS AND SAFETY
• Always wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle all specimens and reagents according to biosafety
guidelines.
• Follow proper disposal procedures for biohazardous materials.

1. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or as needed.
• Any deviations from this procedure must be documented and
approved by the laboratory supervisor.
