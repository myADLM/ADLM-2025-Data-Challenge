Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Schistosoma Exam,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable detection and reporting of
Schistosoma eggs in random urine specimens. This protocol
standardizes the analytical phase steps in processing and examining
urine samples for Schistosoma detection.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and interpreting the Schistosoma exam.
• All staff must follow this SOP and report any deviations or issues
to the supervisor immediately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Fresh random urine specimen collected in a clean, dry
container.
• Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of urine is required.
• Transportation: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory as soon as possible after collection.
• Storage: If immediate transportation to the lab is not feasible, the
sample should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24
hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with evidence of contamination, such as fecal matter.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
• Urine samples that are over 24 hours old.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Centrifuge tubes
• Pipettes
• Light microscope
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• 10% formalin (optional for preserving)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Transfer 10 mL of the urine specimen into a centrifuge tube.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 500-1000 x g for 5 minutes to
concentrate the sediment.
3. Carefully decant the supernatant, leaving approximately 0.5 mL
of urine with the sediment at the bottom of the tube.
4. Gently resuspend the sediment by pipetting up and down.
B. Microscopic Examination:
1. Place a drop of the resuspended sediment onto a clean glass
slide.
2. Gently place a coverslip over the drop to avoid air bubbles.
3. Examine the slide under a low power (10x) objective to locate
Schistosoma eggs and then under high power (40x) objective to
confirm identification.
4. Identify the presence and species of Schistosoma eggs based
on morphological characteristics (e.g., size, shape, presence of
a terminal/spine).
Note: Use appropriate biosafety measures when handling and
disposing of urine samples.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze a known positive control sample alongside patient
samples to ensure the reliability of the procedure.
• Record the results of control samples in the quality control log
before evaluating patient samples.
• If the control sample does not produce expected results,
troubleshoot, and repeat the assay with a new control sample.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive: The presence of Schistosoma eggs is indicated by their
morphology.
• Negative: No Schistosoma eggs seen in the examined fields.
Note: If no Schistosoma eggs are detected but clinical suspicion
remains high, a repeat examination with additional specimens is
suggested
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record results on the laboratory report form, securely file, and
document in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Report final results as:
◦ "Schistosoma eggs detected" – specify species if possible.
◦ "No Schistosoma eggs detected."
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Not applicable; report as positive or negative.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Accuracy depends on the adequate concentration of urine
sediment.
• False negatives may occur in low burden infections or improper
sample preparation.

11. REVISION AND REVIEW
• This protocol will be reviewed annually or as needed when new
guidelines or reagents are implemented.
• Document all reviews, updates, and version numbers in SOP
documentation records.
