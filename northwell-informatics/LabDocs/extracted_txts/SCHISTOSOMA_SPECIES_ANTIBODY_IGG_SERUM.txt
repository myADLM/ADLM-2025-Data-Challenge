Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
SCHISTOSOMA SPECIES ANTIBODY, IGG,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for testing, analyzing, and reporting the
presence of Schistosoma species antibodies, IgG, in serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis according to this SOP, ensure the accuracy of results, and
document all necessary information. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process, addressing any discrepancies, and ensuring
compliance with the procedure.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Schistosoma Species Antibody, IgG: Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
antibodies that target Schistosoma species antigens, indicating
exposure to the parasite.
• Serum Sample: A component of blood obtained after
centrifugation, free of clotting factors.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kit for
Schistosoma Species IgG Antibodies
• Microplate reader with a 450nm filter
• Incubator (37°C)
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Deionized water
• Disposable gloves
• Biohazard waste containers
• Timer
• Laboratory notebook and pen
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Volume: 2 to 4 mL
Collection and Transport
• Specimens should be collected into a red-top or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes but
no longer than 1 hour.
• Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Transfer serum to a clean screw-cap vial.
• Label the vial with patient identification, date, and time of
collection.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours.
• For storage longer than 48 hours, freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have not been properly labeled.
• Inappropriately stored or transported samples.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Read and understand the kit instructions before starting the
assay.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C)
before use.
3. Prepare all necessary reagents as per the kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
Each sample should ideally be run in duplicate.
2. Sample and Reagent Loading
◦ Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and patient samples to
respective wells.
◦ Add 100 μL of assay buffer to all wells containing samples.
3. Incubation
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing
◦ Wash the plate 4 times with the provided wash buffer to
remove unbound substances. Use 300 μL per well and
discard the contents. After the final wash, invert the plate
and tap it gently on absorbent paper to remove residual
liquid.
5. Secondary Antibody Addition
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugate reagent into each well.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Washing
◦ Repeat the wash steps 4 times as before.
7. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 10-15
minutes.
8. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well. Ensure thorough
mixing by gently tapping the side of the plate.
9. Reading the Plate
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 10 minutes.
7. CALCULATION AND RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Calculation of Results:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Create a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of IgG antibodies in patient
samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
• Interpretation of Results:
◦ Positive: Indication of exposure to Schistosoma species.
◦ Negative: No detectable antibodies against Schistosoma
species.
◦ Borderline/Equivocal: Suggest retesting of the sample or
further clinical correlation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range provided
by the manufacturer.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by qualified personnel
before reporting.
• Provide results along with interpretative comments if applicable.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This test is a qualitative assay; borderline results may require
confirmatory testing.
• Cross-reactivity with other parasitic infections may result in false
positives.
• Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for detailed limitations and
troubleshooting.
