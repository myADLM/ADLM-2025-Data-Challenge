Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Schistosomiasis, Serum
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Schistosoma antibodies in
serum to aid in the diagnosis of Schistosomiasis. The procedures
detailed herein ensure the generation of accurate, reliable, and timely
results for patient management and treatment decisions.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
assays, interpret the results, and ensure proper documentation. All
personnel must follow the steps exactly as described in this SOP to
maintain consistency and quality in test results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Schistosomiasis: A parasitic disease caused by the Schistosoma
species, which are blood flukes that infect humans.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Collection Tube: Red-top or serum
separator tube (SST) Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum Storage
Conditions: Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days. For longer storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Schistosomiasis ELISA Kit (commercially available and validated for
diagnostic use) Eppendorf tubes Pipettes and pipette tips Microplate
reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm Distilled water
Calibration and control sera
1. EQUIPMENT
Centrifuge Refrigerator/Freezer Water Bath (for samples that need
thawing) Incubator set at 37°C Microplate Washer Automatic
Microplate Reader
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Samples
1. Thaw serum samples, controls, and calibration standards at
room temperature.
2. Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before
use.
3. Prepare the wash buffer and any other components as
specified in the ELISA kit's instructions.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Label the ELISA strips accordingly for each control, standard,
and sample.
2. Add 100 µL of each diluted sample, control, and standard to the
designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Wash the wells four times with the prepared wash buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at 37°C for another 30 minutes.
7. Repeat the wash step to remove unbound enzyme conjugate.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 15-20
minutes until color development is sufficient.
10. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
11. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C) Calculating and Interpreting Results
1. Construct a standard curve from the optical density (OD) values
of the calibrators.
2. Determine the sample concentrations using the standard curve.
3. Results should be calculated in Units per liter (U/L) or as
specified by the kit manufacturer.
4. Positive: Indicates Schistosoma antibodies present. Further
clinical correlation is needed.
5. Negative: No detectable Schistosoma antibodies.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Run quality control sera (positive and negative) with every
batch of tests.
8. The assay should be repeated if control values are outside the
expected ranges.
9. Record all QC results in the appropriate logbook.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and reviewed by the reporting laboratory
technologist.
12. Positive results should be flagged for review and follow-up.
13. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
14. Follow all biohazard precautions when handling serum
samples.
15. Utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, lab coat,
safety glasses).
16. Dispose of all biohazard waste appropriately.
17. Reference Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for specific
reagent hazards.
