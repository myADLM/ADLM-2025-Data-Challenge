Antibody (IgG)
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for analyzing,
reporting, and reviewing results of SCL-70 Antibody (IgG) testing.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel who perform the
SCL-70 Antibody (IgG) test in this CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to correctly
perform the assay, document results, and perform quality control
measures as outlined in this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
Reagents:
• SCL-70 Antibody (IgG) ELISA Kit
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Calibrators/Standards
• Positive and Negative control sera
Materials:
• Microplates
• Test tubes
• Laboratory Timer
• Absorbent paper
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer according to kit instructions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw and mix samples gently before use.
◦ If necessary, dilute samples as per kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Adding Standards, Controls, and Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to
the appropriate wells.
◦ Ensure all samples are processed in duplicate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate with adhesive cover and incubate at
37°C for the time specified in the kit instructions (typically
30-60 minutes).
3. Washing:
◦ After incubation, wash the plate multiple times (typically 3-5)
with wash buffer using a microplate washer.
◦ Make sure to remove any residual buffer thoroughly after the
final wash by blotting the plate on absorbent paper.
4. Adding Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for the time specified
in the kit instructions (typically 30-60 minutes).
5. Second Wash:
◦ Repeat the washing step as detailed above.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate at
room temperature in the dark for a duration specified in the
kit instructions (typically 10-30 minutes).
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The color should
change to yellow.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Result Calculation
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Generate a calibration curve by plotting the known
concentrations of standards versus their respective OD
readings.
2. Sample Concentration:
◦ Using the calibration curve, determine the concentration of
SCL-70 Antibody (IgG) in patient samples from their OD
readings.
D. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Check that control results fall within established ranges
before proceeding with patient sample results.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
assay process.
E. Reporting Results
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Report results in [Units specified by the kit, e.g., U/mL].
◦ Provide interpretation according to reference ranges
provided by the kit.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Immediately notify the designated clinical personnel if any
results fall into the critical range.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < [Specify U/mL]
• Equivocal: [Specify U/mL] to [Specify U/mL]
• Positive: > [Specify U/mL]
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure patient samples and controls are free from contaminants.
• Strict adherence to the incubation times is critical for accurate
results.
• The presence of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples may
affect results.
