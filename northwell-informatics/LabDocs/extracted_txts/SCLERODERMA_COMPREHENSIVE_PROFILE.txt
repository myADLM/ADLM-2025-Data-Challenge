Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Scleroderma Comprehensive Profile
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the accurate and timely analysis of
specimens for the Scleroderma Comprehensive Profile, ensuring
high-quality laboratory test results and compliance with CLIA
regulations.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory scientists and technologists
involved in the analytical phase of testing for the Scleroderma
Comprehensive Profile.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated staff are responsible for adhering to this SOP, ensuring
all procedures are followed meticulously. Quality control monitoring
and corrective action steps will also be executed as per protocol.
4. DEFINITIONS
Scleroderma Comprehensive Profile includes tests for detecting
autoantibodies and other biomarkers associated with Scleroderma,
such as ANA (Antinuclear Antibody), Anti-Scl-70, Anti-Centromere,
and extracted nuclear antigens (ENAs).
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay analyzers (ELISA, Chemiluminescence, etc.)
• Autoantibody test kits (ANA, Anti-Scl-70, Anti-Centromere, ENA
panels)
• Control and calibration materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader
• Sample diluents, wash buffers, substrate solutions, stop solutions
• Deionized water
• Laboratory timer
• Standard laboratory glassware
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
• Specimens must be serum or plasma, preferably collected in red-
top or green-top tubes.
• Ensure proper identification and labeling of all specimens.
• Allow the serum specimens to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes and centrifuge at 1000-1300g for 10 minutes to obtain
clear serum. Plasma samples should be centrifuged immediately.
• Aliquot and store the specimens at -20°C if testing is not
performed immediately.
B. Reagent Preparation:
• All reagents, controls, and kits must be stored as advised by the
manufacturer.
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
• Ensure proper mixing of reagents without introducing bubbles.
C. Quality Control:
• Run quality controls (QC) with each batch of tests to verify
reliability and accuracy.
• Utilize both positive and negative controls. QC material should
come with acceptable ranges provided by the manufacturer.
• Record all QC results in the QC log. If QC results fall outside
acceptable ranges, do not proceed until the issue is resolved.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Follow the specific assay manufacturer's instructions for each
test (ANA, Anti-Scl-70, Anti-Centromere, ENA panels). General
steps include:
◦ Plate setup: Add standard, control, and patient samples to
assigned wells.
◦ Incubation: Allow proper binding/incubation times as
specified in the assay protocol.
◦ Washing steps: Consistently follow the number of washes
and volumes per the assay protocol, ensuring thorough
removal of any unbound reagents.
◦ Addition of conjugate: Dispense the enzyme-linked antibody
to each well and incubate.
◦ Substrate reaction: Add substrate solution and allow color
development.
◦ Stop reaction: Add stop solution at the appropriate time to
terminate the enzymatic reaction.
2. Measure and Record Absorbance:
◦ Use a microplate reader set to the appropriate wavelength
as recommended by the assay manufacturer.
◦ Record the absorbance (OD) values and ensure they
correlate with standard curve.
E. Calculations and Interpretation:
• Use software or standard calibrations to determine the
concentration of autoantibodies.
• Compare the test results to reference ranges to identify positive or
negative results.
◦ ANA is typically reported in titers (e.g., 1:40, 1:80, etc.)
◦ Anti-Scl-70, Anti-Centromere, ENA panels are usually reported
in U/mL or as per assay specifics.
F. Reporting Results:
• Verify results against internal quality controls and standard
curves.
• Record and review results in the appropriate laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Ensure any abnormal or critical results are promptly
communicated to the relevant healthcare provider following
laboratory protocols.
• Provide interpretative comments based on clinical relevance
where necessary.
G. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
• If QC fails or results fall outside expected ranges, re-evaluate
following troubleshooting steps as per assay manual.
• Document all corrective actions taken in the corrective action log.
7. MAINTENANCE
• Regular maintenance of all equipment and analysts in accordance
with manufacturer guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities in the equipment log
including daily, weekly, and monthly logs.
8. REFERENCES
• Refer to specific assay manufacturer’s instructions for use (IFU).
• CLIA guidelines and laboratory's internal quality control and
assurance policies.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) documentation
for specific detailed procedures.
9. DOCUMENT CHANGES
• Any changes to this SOP must be documented and approved by
the laboratory’s quality assurance officer and laboratory director.
