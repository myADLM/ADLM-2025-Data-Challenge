Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SCL 70 Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the detection and quantification of SCL 70
antibodies (also known as anti-topoisomerase I antibodies), which
are primarily used in the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis
(scleroderma).
Responsibility: Laboratory personnel responsible for performing this
test have the required training and competency to conduct the test as
prescribed in this procedure.
1. DEFINITION
SCL 70 antibodies are autoantibodies directed against
topoisomerase I, an enzyme involved in the unwinding and winding of
DNA during replication and transcription.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the quantitative determination of SCL 70
Antibodies, IgG, in human serum using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence assay (IFA).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment
• ELISA reader
• Microplate washer
• Incubator
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Calibrated analytical balance
• Centrifuge
4.2 Reagents
• SCL 70 Antibody ELISA kit or IFA kit
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution (TMB or equivalent)
• Stop solution (1M H2SO4 or equivalent)
• Calibrators and controls
4.3 Supplies
• Micropipette tips
• Microtiter plates
• Laboratory markers
• Disposable gloves
• Timer
• Paper towels or absorbent pads
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen requirements
• Acceptable specimens: Fresh or frozen human serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C or
can be frozen at -20°C or colder for longer storage. Avoid
repeated freezing and thawing.
5.2 Assay Procedure Note: Refer to the kit manufacturer’s
instructions for detailed steps.
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, controls, calibrators, and samples to reach
room temperature before starting the assay.
2. Prepare wash buffer and any other necessary reagents
according to the kit instructions.
B. Sample and Reagent Preparation
1. Label the microtiter plate appropriately.
2. Pipette the necessary volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into the wells, following the specific order from
the kit protocol.
C. Incubation
1. Add the appropriate volume of enzyme conjugate (as per the kit
instruction) to each well.
2. Incubate the plate at the prescribed temperature and duration
(usually at room temperature for 30-60 minutes).
D. Washing
1. Wash the plate as per the kit's instructions, using the microplate
washer (typically 3-5 wash cycles with the wash buffer).
E. Substrate Reaction
1. Add the substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate for the prescribed time (typically 10-20
minutes).
3. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
F. Reading and Interpretation
1. Read the optical density (OD) at the recommended wavelength
(typically 450 nm with a reference filter of 620-650 nm) using
the ELISA reader.
2. Calculate the concentration of SCL 70 Antibodies using the
calibration curve generated from the OD values of the
calibrators.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal Quality Control
1. Include negative and positive controls in each assay run.
2. The assay is considered valid if the controls fall within the
acceptable range specified by the kit manufacturer.
3. If controls are out of range, the run must be invalidated, and
troubleshooting should be conducted to identify the issue
before retesting samples.
6.2 External Quality Control
1. Participate in proficiency testing programs, if available, to
ensure assay accuracy and reliability.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the concentration of SCL 70 Antibodies in units specified
by the kit manufacturer (e.g., U/mL).
• Reference interval: <20 U/mL (negative), 20-40 U/mL (borderline),
>40 U/mL (positive). Note: Reference ranges may vary depending
on the kit used and population studied. Use the reference
intervals provided by the kit manufacturer or laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolytic, icteric, or lipemic sera might interfere with the test and
should be avoided.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other laboratory data.
