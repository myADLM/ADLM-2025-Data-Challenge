Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SCN4A Myotonia DNA
Sequencing Test
1. Purpose: To provide clear instructions for the analysis of the
SCN4A gene in patients suspected of having myotonia using
DNA sequencing methods.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of SCN4A gene sequencing.
3. Responsibility:
◦ Laboratory technologists perform DNA sequencing and
initial data analysis.
◦ Supervisors ensure the quality of the sequencing process
and verify the results.
4. Definitions:
◦ SCN4A gene: A gene that codes for a protein (Nav1.4)
involved in sodium-ion channel function, mutations of which
can cause myotonia.
◦ Myotonia: A condition characterized by delayed relaxation
of muscles following contraction.
5. Specimen Requirements:
◦ DNA extracted from peripheral blood collected in EDTA
tubes.
◦ Acceptable DNA concentration: 50-100 ng/μL.
◦ DNA quality assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis or a
spectrophotometer (A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.0).
6. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Thermocycler.
◦ Sequencing-grade PCR primers specific to the exons of
SCN4A.
◦ PCR reagents including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, and PCR
buffers.
◦ DNA sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, ABI 3500 Genetic
Analyzer).
◦ DNA sequencing kits (e.g., BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit).
◦ Software for sequence data analysis (e.g., Sequencer,
VariantStudio).
7. Procedure:
DNA Amplification by PCR: 7.1. Prepare the PCR master mix
as per the kit instructions. 7.2. Add 25 ng of genomic DNA to
each reaction. 7.3. Perform PCR under the following cycling
conditions: - Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes. -
Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds. - Annealing: 56-60°C
(depending on primer specifics) for 30 seconds. - Extension:
72°C for 1 minute. - Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes. -
Number of cycles: 30-35.
PCR Product Purification: 7.4. Purify the PCR products using
a commercial purification kit (e.g., QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit) as per manufacturer instructions.
DNA Sequencing: 7.5. Prepare sequencing reactions using
Sequencing Kit following the manufacturer’s specifications. 7.6.
Load purified PCR products onto the DNA sequencer.
Data Analysis: 7.7. Use the sequencer's software to generate
sequence reads. 7.8. Align the sequence reads against the
reference SCN4A sequence using data analysis software. 7.9.
Analyze for the presence of mutations, such as missense,
nonsense, and splice-site variants.
8. Quality Control:
◦ Include negative controls (no DNA template) and positive
controls (known SCN4A mutation-positive and wild-type
DNA) in each run.
◦ Verify the quality of sequencing reads (e.g., read length,
Phred score).
◦ Re-run samples with low-quality data.
9. Reporting Results:
◦ Interpret the mutations detected and report as pathogenic,
likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain significance (VUS), or
likely benign based on current guidelines (e.g., ACMG
standards).
◦ Document findings and include detailed sequence data,
interpretation, and implications for patient management.
◦ Ensure results are verified by a qualified supervisor before
releasing to the clinician.
10. Limitations:
• The sequencing test is designed to detect single nucleotide
variations and small insertions/deletions but may not identify large
genomic rearrangements or mutations in regulatory regions.
• Results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other
laboratory data.

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Manufacturer's instructions for sequencing instruments and
reagents.
• ACMG Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of
Sequence Variants.
1. Review and Approval:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed if there are
significant changes in procedure or new relevant scientific data.
• The SOP is approved and dated by the Laboratory Director.
