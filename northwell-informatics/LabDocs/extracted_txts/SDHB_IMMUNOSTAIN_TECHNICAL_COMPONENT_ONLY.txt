Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for performing SDHB
Immunostaining, technical component only, in the clinical laboratory.
This includes detailed steps for tissue preparation, staining
procedures, and quality control measures to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
SDHB immunostain as described in this SOP. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring
compliance.
1. DEFINITIONS
Immunostaining: A laboratory technique used for the visualization of
proteins in cells of a tissue section by utilizing antigen-antibody
interactions.
SDHB: Succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, a protein that plays a
role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and can be used as a
marker in diagnostic pathology.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Types:
• Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (ideally 4-5 µm thick sections)
• Fresh frozen tissue sections (if applicable)
Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure tissue specimens are properly fixed in 10% neutral-
buffered formalin.
• Dehydrate specimens in graded alcohols, clear in xylene, and
embed in paraffin.
• Cut sections to 4-5 µm thickness and place on charged
microscope slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly fixed or processed.
• Sections thicker than 5 µm may compromise staining quality.
• Tissue blocks or slides without proper labeling.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
Reagents:
• SDHB primary antibody (validated concentration as per
manufacturer's instructions)
• Secondary antibody (if required)
• Detection system (enzyme-conjugated or fluorophore-conjugated
secondary reagent)
• Blocking reagent
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
Materials:
• Charged microscope slides
• Microtome with disposable blades
• Coplin jars
• Humidity chamber
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Staining Procedure:
1. Prepare the workspace and ensure all required reagents and
materials are available.
2. Deparaffinize tissue sections by sequential immersion in xylene
(3 changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Rehydrate sections by immersion in graded alcohols (100%,
95%, 70%, 50%) for 3-5 minutes each, followed by distilled
water.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate method based
on antibody requirements (e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval
(HIER) in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a microwave or steamer for
20 minutes).
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature and
rinse in PBS or Tris-buffered saline (TBS).
C. Blocking:
1. Apply blocking reagent to sections and incubate for 30 minutes
to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Rinse slides with PBS/TBS.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the SDHB primary antibody to the tissue sections.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber for the recommended duration
(e.g., 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C).
3. Wash sections in PBS/TBS for 3 changes of 5 minutes each.
E. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply secondary antibody (if required) and incubate as per
manufacturer instructions.
2. Wash sections in PBS/TBS for 3 changes of 5 minutes each.
3. Apply the appropriate detection reagent and incubate for the
recommended time.
F. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water until water runs clear.
3. Dehydrate sections in graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and
clear in xylene.
4. Apply coverslip using mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Include a known positive control slide and a negative control
slide (no primary antibody) with each batch of staining.
7. All slides, including controls, should be evaluated by a
pathologist for staining quality.
8. Document any deviations, problems, or issues encountered
during staining and the corrective actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Technical Component:
• Document the staining process, including reagent lot numbers,
incubation times, and any observations of staining quality.
• Forward the stained slides along with control slides to the
pathologist for interpretation.

Include any relevant references such as antibody data sheets,
reagent protocols, or pertinent literature guiding the methodology
used in the SOP.
