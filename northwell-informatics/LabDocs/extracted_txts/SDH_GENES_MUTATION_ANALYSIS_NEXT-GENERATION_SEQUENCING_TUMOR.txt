The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analysis of SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase) genes mutation in
tumor samples using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology.
This procedure outlines the necessary steps to ensure accurate and
reliable generation of sequencing results, including the library
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and result validation.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of tumor samples for SDH gene mutations using NGS
technology.

conformity to set quality standards and document any deviations
or corrective actions taken.
4. DEFINITIONS
• SDH Genes: Genes encoding the subunits of the succinate
dehydrogenase enzyme complex, including SDHA, SDHB, SDHC,
SDHD.
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a high-throughput method
used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA.
• Library: A collection of DNA fragments that have been prepared
for high-throughput sequencing.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• DNA extraction kit
• NanoDrop spectrophotometer
• Qubit fluorometer
• PCR thermocycler
• NGS library preparation kit
• Magnetic beads (for purification)
• Microcentrifuge and pipettes
• Next-generation sequencer (e.g., Illumina platform)
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction and Quality Check
1. Isolate DNA from the tumor tissue sample using the DNA
extraction kit as per manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Measure DNA concentration using NanoDrop
spectrophotometer and verify quality using Qubit fluorometer.
3. Check the DNA integrity by running an aliquot on an agarose
gel or using a Fragment Analyzer.
6.2. Library Preparation
1. Shear the genomic DNA to the desired fragment size (150-200
bp).
2. Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation steps as per
the library preparation kit instructions.
3. Amplify the adapter-ligated DNA with specific primers for
SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD.
4. Purify the PCR products with magnetic beads.
6.3. Library Quantification and Normalization
1. Quantify the library using Qubit fluorometer and validate
fragment size distribution on a Bioanalyzer or similar.
2. Normalize the library for equimolar pooling.
6.4. Sequencing
1. Load the pooled library onto an appropriate flow cell or
sequencing chip.
2. Set up sequencing run parameters on the sequencer according
to manufacturer’s instructions for paired-end sequencing (e.g.,
2x150 bp reads).
3. Start the sequencing run and monitor performance through run
metrics.
6.5. Data Analysis
1. Download the raw sequencing data post-sequencing.
2. Perform quality control using quality assessment tools (e.g.,
FASTQC).
3. Align reads to the reference human genome (GRCh38) using a
suitable aligner (e.g., BWA, Bowtie2).
4. Identify variants using a variant caller (e.g., GATK, VarScan).
5. Annotate variants with functional effects using appropriate tools
(e.g., ANNOVAR, snpEff).
6.6. Interpretation of Results
1. Review and interpret variants in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and
SDHD genes.
2. Classify variants based on established clinical guidelines (e.g.,
ACMG criteria).
3. Validate significant findings using Sanger sequencing, if
necessary.
6.7. Reporting of Results
1. Compile results including raw data, read alignment, variant call
reports, and annotated variants.
2. Document variant interpretation, including clinical relevance
and potential therapeutic implications.
3. Prepare a detailed report and review with supervisory or QC
personnel.
4. Communicate results to the requesting clinician or appropriate
medical personnel.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
reliability.
• Follow calibration and maintenance protocols for all equipment.
• Regular proficiency testing participation as part of external QA
programs.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow universal laboratory safety guidelines.
• Adhere to proper laboratory waste disposal protocols.
• Handle reagents and samples according to the material safety
data sheets (MSDS).
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a record of all steps and observations during the
procedure in the laboratory’s information management system
(LIMS).
• Archive all versions of software and databases used for analysis.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all reagents and equipment.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature and clinical guidelines for SDH
gene variants.
