Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) SEAFOOD ALLERGEN
PROFILE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable determination of specific IgE
antibodies against common seafood allergens in patient serum
samples using immunoassay techniques. This procedure is intended
to aid in the diagnosis of seafood allergies.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedure according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure staff competency and adherence to
the protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Seafood allergens include proteins from various seafood sources
such as shellfish (e.g., shrimp, crab, lobster) and fish (e.g., cod,
salmon).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5 mL of venous blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
After collection, allow the tube to coagulate at room temperature
for 30 minutes, then centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum for analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Samples received in inappropriate tubes or with insufficient
volume
• Samples contaminated with anticoagulants such as EDTA or
heparin
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated at
2-8°C and for up to 3 months when frozen at -20°C or lower.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP platform or other validated immunoassay analyzer
• Seafood allergen-specific reagent kits
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Quality control materials
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Daily Equipment Setup:
• Turn on the analyzer and ensure it is functioning properly.
• Check calibration and quality control results to verify system
readiness.
Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Serum Collection:
◦ Ensure samples are correctly labeled with patient ID and
collection date/time.
◦ Verify sample integrity before proceeding. Reject
unacceptable specimens.
2. Sample Aliquoting:
◦ Pipette 50 µL of serum into designated wells of the assay
plate or sample cups depending on the system used.
Assay Procedure:
1. Load the assay plate or sample cups into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Select the appropriate assay method for seafood allergen
profile testing.
3. Initiate the assay run and ensure continuous monitoring for any
errors or alerts.
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples to
ensure assay validity and accuracy.
• Document results of QC materials and take corrective actions if
controls fall outside acceptable limits.
Result Interpretation:
• Results are automatically calculated and transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Analyze and review results according to the calibration curves
established for the specific allergens.
• Ensure that results are within reportable ranges; perform repeat
analysis for any anomalies.
Reporting Results:
• Validate results in LIS and ensure proper documentation.
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for issuing patient reports.
• Any critical or unexpected results should be communicated to the
requesting physician immediately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the assay kit's package insert or literature for specific
reference intervals for each seafood allergen.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the immunoassay product insert for limitations regarding
interference factors, cross-reactivity with non-seafood allergens, and
IgE sensitivity thresholds.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls with each assay batch according to manufacturer
protocols.
• Bi-monthly proficiency testing by comparing results from multiple
runs for consistency.
1. REFERENCES
• Product insert from immunoassay kit manufacturers for seafood
allergen profiles
• Laboratory-specific method validation documents
Document Control:
• Ensure this SOP is reviewed annually and revised as needed
based on technological updates or procedural changes.
• Maintain version history and dates of revisions.
