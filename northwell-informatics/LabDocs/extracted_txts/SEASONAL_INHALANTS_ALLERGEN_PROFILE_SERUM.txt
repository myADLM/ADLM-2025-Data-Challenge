Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Seasonal Inhalants
Allergen Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process for the analytical phase of generating results
for the Seasonal Inhalants Allergen Profile in serum specimens to
ensure accurate, timely, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
analysis and documentation as defined in this procedure, ensuring
high standards of accuracy and reliability.
1. DEFINITION
The Seasonal Inhalants Allergen Profile refers to a series of tests to
detect the presence of IgE antibodies to common seasonal inhalant
allergens in serum. The test is commonly used for diagnosing and
managing allergic rhinitis, asthma, and other allergic responses.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Collection Tube: SST (Serum Separator Tube)
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
◦ Stability:
▪ Room Temperature: 24 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 30 days
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or
contaminated specimens; specimens submitted in incorrect
tubes.
2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunoassay analyzer calibrated for allergen-specific IgE
testing
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to the Seasonal Inhalants
Allergen Profile
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Microtiter plates (if applicable)
◦ Reagent kits specific to each allergen
3. REAGENTS AND CALIBRATORS
◦ Allergen-specific IgE reagent kits
◦ Calibrators provided by the reagent manufacturer
◦ Control samples at both normal and abnormal levels
4. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
◦ Verify specimen integrity and identification.
◦ Centrifuge SSTs to separate serum from cells.
◦ Transfer serum into appropriately labeled secondary tubes if
necessary.
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if testing within 7 days, or freeze at
-20°C for longer storage.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
▪ Allow reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature.
▪ Set up and calibrate the immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Programming the Analyzer:
▪ Input test parameters specific to the Seasonal
Inhalants Allergen Profile.
▪ Load the necessary reagent kits into the analyzer,
ensuring proper alignment and security.
3. Sample Loading:
▪ Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and
controls into the appropriate slots on the analyzer.
▪ Ensure samples are free from bubbles and other
contaminants.
4. Running the Assay:
▪ Initiate the run sequence on the analyzer.
▪ Monitor the assay progression, ensuring there are no
errors or alerts that require troubleshooting.
5. Post-Run Procedures:
▪ After the run is complete, verify assay completion and
review preliminary results.
▪ Ensure the analyzer has properly interpreted the
results and no flags have been raised by the system.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run control samples at the beginning of each run and after
every major troubleshooting or maintenance.
◦ Compare control results to the expected ranges provided by
the manufacturer’s insert.
◦ Investigate and rectify any control results that fall outside of
the acceptable range before releasing patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Verify all patient results against control values and historical
data if available.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
immediately after verification.
A. Reference Intervals:
◦ Each allergen-specific IgE level should be interpreted based
on the reference intervals provided by the testing kit and
clinical guidelines.
B. Interpretation:
◦ Categorize results as negative, borderline, or positive based
on the reference intervals.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's product insert for any limitation
of the specific reagent kit, including potential interferences.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Consult the analyzer’s user manual and reagent kit insert for
troubleshooting common errors.
• Perform routine maintenance and recalibration as needed.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all maintenance, calibrations, and troubleshooting
activities.
• Document control and patient results as per laboratory protocol.

This SOP aims to ensure uniformity and accuracy in the testing
process for Seasonal Inhalants Allergen Profile, from the moment the
specimen is prepared for analysis to the generation and verification
of results.
