Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Secobarbital, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for accurately
and efficiently generating results for Secobarbital, Serum in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This SOP ensures the reliability, accuracy, and
timeliness of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis of Secobarbital, Serum following the procedures outlined.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
the procedure and addressing any issues or deviations.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS)
• Analytical balance
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Secobarbital standards
• Serum controls
• Solvents (e.g., methanol)
• Extraction solvents (e.g., dichloromethane)
4. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in an appropriate evacuated tube (e.g., red-top
tube without additives)
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples
• Samples in expired collection tubes
• Samples not properly labeled with collection date/time
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Collection:
◦ Ensure sample is collected in an appropriate red-top tube
without additives.
◦ Verify specimen label includes patient identification and
collection date/time.
2. Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the blood specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer serum to a clean, labeled container using
a pipette.
B. Extraction
1. Extraction Protocol:
◦ Add 0.5 mL of serum to a 4 mL glass vial.
◦ Add 2 mL of dichloromethane to the vial.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the
phases.
◦ Carefully transfer the organic phase to a new vial.
C. Analysis
1. Preparation of Standards and Controls:
◦ Prepare Secobarbital standards in methanol at known
concentrations.
◦ Include positive and negative serum controls.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Load extracted samples, standards, and controls into the
GC-MS.
3. GC-MS Conditions:
◦ Set appropriate GC-MS parameters, including temperature
program and detector settings, following manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Inject a volume of the sample extract (e.g., 1 µL).
4. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire chromatographic data and MS data for each
sample.
◦ Ensure correct retention times and mass-to-charge ratios for
Secobarbital.
D. Data Analysis and Results Generation
1. Chromatogram Review:
◦ Review chromatograms for the presence of Secobarbital
peaks at the expected retention time.
◦ Verify the identity of Secobarbital through mass
spectrometry data.
2. Quantification:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Secobarbital in the serum by
comparing peak areas of the sample to the standards.
◦ Ensure results fall within acceptable ranges based on the
calibration curve.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that positive and negative controls are within
acceptable limits.
◦ Re-run any samples that fall outside control limits or show
signs of extraction/analysis issues.
E. Reporting Results
1. Verification:
◦ Review all calculated results for accuracy.
◦ Document any observations or modifications.
2. Transmittal:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified before final
reporting.
3. Critical Results Notification:
◦ Follow the laboratory’s protocol for notifying clinicians of
critical results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use Secobarbital standards for calibration.
• Include serum controls in each batch of analysis.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of GC-MS
equipment.
• Document all quality control checks and any corrective actions
taken.
7. REFERENCES
• GC-MS manufacturer’s manual
• Secobarbital Standard Operating Protocol (specific to the
laboratory)
• Relevant clinical guidelines and pharmacology references
8. NOTES
Adhere strictly to safety protocols concerning handling hazardous
materials and biological specimens. Follow the laboratory’s waste
disposal guidelines for solvents and biological waste.
9. AMENDMENTS
Any changes or updates to this SOP should be documented and
disseminated to all relevant laboratory personnel.
This SOP template is intended for generating Secobarbital serum
results and assumes access to advanced analytical equipment like
GC-MS. Adjustments may be needed based on specific laboratory
settings, equipment, and procedural variations.
