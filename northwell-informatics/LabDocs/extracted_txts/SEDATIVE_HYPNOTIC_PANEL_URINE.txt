Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Sedative Hypnotic
Panel, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis and reporting of
sedative hypnotic drugs in urine using appropriate instrumentation
and techniques. The objective is to ensure reliable and accurate
results that meet clinical and regulatory requirements.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedures as defined in this SOP.
• All staff members are responsible for identifying any procedural
deficiencies that may affect test results and notify the supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedures and addressing any issues.
1. DEFINITION
Sedative hypnotic drugs are substances that exert a calming effect or
induce sleep. This panel typically includes drugs such as
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other hypnotics.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Handling:
• Preferred/Acceptable: 10 mL of freshly voided urine. Samples
should be stored promptly at 4-8°C and stable for up to 24 hours
at refrigerator temperatures before initial analysis.
• Unacceptable: Samples that are visibly contaminated or
improperly labeled.
B. Reagents and Supplies:
• Calibrators and controls specific to the sedative hypnotic panel.
• Appropriate analytical instrumentation (e.g., Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)).
• Urine drug test strips specific to targeted drugs within the panel.
• Deionized water, pipettes, centrifuge, and other general laboratory
supplies.
C. Equipment Setup and Calibration:
• Ensure that the instrumentation has been maintained and
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. This
includes the daily calibration for LC-MS/GC-MS.
• Validate any new batch of reagents or test strips according to the
Quality Control (QC) procedure below.
D. Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Mix the urine sample thoroughly
before aliquoting. b. If necessary, perform a pre-treatment step
to remove any interfering substances (e.g., derivatization for
GC-MS).
2. Testing Protocol: a. Run a negative control (blank), positive
controls, and calibrators through the instrument per the initial
calibration. b. Aliquot 1 mL of urine into a properly labeled vial
for analysis. c. Load the prepared samples into the analytical
instrument following the manufacturer’s specific instructions.
3. Data Acquisition and Processing: a. Start the analytical run
and monitor the instrument’s performance. b. Once the run is
completed, analyze the acquired data using the appropriate
software.
4. Interpretation of Results: a. Compare the sample results with
the calibration standards and quality controls. b. Identify and
quantify drug components based on their retention time and
mass spectra compared to known standards.
E. Quality Control:
• Perform QC for every batch of tests, which must include at least
one blank, two levels of controls (e.g., low and high), and all
calibrators.
• For each run, ensure that QC results fall within acceptable limits
before validating patient results. If QC results are out of range,
troubleshoot before re-running affected specimens.
F. Troubleshooting:
• If technical issues arise (e.g., instrument error, system leak),
follow the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
• Review the instrument logs for any faults and recalibrate if
necessary.
• Consult a supervisor if problems persist.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the integrity and accuracy of the data before reporting.
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific guidelines.
• Ensure any critical results are promptly communicated to the
appropriate clinical personnel according to established
procedures.
Critical Values:
• Ensure that critical values for sedative drugs (e.g., high levels of
benzodiazepines) are communicated immediately following site-
specific emergency protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to established reference intervals and report results
accordingly. Commonly used cutoffs need to be adhered to for the
different drugs included within the panel.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records for all performed analyses, including
sample logs, QC results, troubleshooting steps taken, and
reported results.
• Retain records as required by regulatory standards.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Be aware of the method's limitations, including potential
interference from other substances and detection limits of the
instrumentation. Consult package inserts and scientific literature
for these details.
