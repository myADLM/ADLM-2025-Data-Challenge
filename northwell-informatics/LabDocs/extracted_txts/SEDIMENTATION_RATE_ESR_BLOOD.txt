Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Sedimentation Rate (ESR)
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for performing and documenting
the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) testing in blood samples
to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting ESR testing.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol and for addressing any issues that arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Whole Blood Container: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
Acid (EDTA) tube (Lavender top) Volume: 1-2 mL Specimen Stability:
• Testing should be performed within 4 hours of sample collection if
kept at room temperature (18-25°C).
• If delayed, samples can be refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 24 hours
before testing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted samples
• Hemolyzed samples
• Insufficient volume
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ESR analyzer (e.g., Modified Westergren method or automated
ESR analyzer)
• EDTA tubes containing blood samples
• Mixing device (e.g., roller mixer)
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Verify sample identity and labeling. Ensure that the sample
meets the acceptance criteria.
2. Gently mix the EDTA tube by inverting it 8-10 times. Do not
shake.
3. Allow the sample to equilibrate to room temperature if it has
been refrigerated.
B) Performing ESR test:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions specific to the ESR
analyzer in use.
2. For the Modified Westergren method: a. Fill a Westergren tube
to the 200 mm mark with the well-mixed blood sample. b. Place
the filled tube vertically in the ESR rack. c. Start the timer for 60
minutes.
3. For Automated ESR Analyzer: a. Load the sample into the
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. b. Initiate
the test as prompted by the analyzer.
C) Reading and Recording Results:
1. For the Manual Method: a. After 60 minutes, read the level of
the clear plasma above the red cells in mm (millimeters). b.
Record the result.
2. For Automated Analyzers: a. Review the results displayed by
the analyzer. b. Verify and record the result as per instrument
output.
D) Documentation:
1. Document the result, date, time, and the initials of the
technologist performing the test in the ESR logbook or
laboratory information system.
2. Ensure any deviations or issues encountered during testing are
noted and reported to the supervisor.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Run quality control samples (normal and abnormal) at least
once per day of testing to ensure accuracy and precision of the
results.
5. Document and review all QC results. If any QC results fall
outside the acceptable range (as specified by the QC material
manufacturer), do not report patient results and troubleshoot
according to the instrument's guidelines.
6. Keep a log of all QC results and maintain compliance with
instrument maintenance schedules.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Enter the ESR results into the laboratory information system or
the appropriate reporting system.
9. Ensure results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist before final verification and release.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
11. Ensure that all procedural steps are followed precisely to avoid
pre-analytical and analytical errors.
12. High levels of lipemia or paraproteinemia may affect the
accuracy of the ESR test result.
