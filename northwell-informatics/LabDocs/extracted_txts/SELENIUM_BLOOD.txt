SELENIUM, BLOOD ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. PURPOSE
To describe the clinical laboratory procedure for the accurate and
precise measurement of selenium in blood.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
correctly by following this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that staff are appropriately trained and that quality control
procedures are in place and followed.
1. DEFINITION
Selenium is a trace element that is essential for certain enzymatic
functions in the human body. The determination of selenium levels in
blood samples is important for diagnosing selenium deficiency,
assessing exposure to selenium, and monitoring therapy.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Whole blood Container: Royal blue-top (K2 EDTA)
tube Volume: Minimum 3 mL of blood
Note:
• Collected specimens should be transported to the laboratory as
soon as possible.
• Delay in transportation should be minimized, and collected
specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if there are any unavoidable
delays.
• Ensure the specimen is labeled with the correct patient
information including date and time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Calibration standards for selenium
• Internal standard (e.g., Germanium)
• Quality control material (bioanalytical grade)
• High-purity water
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
Supplies:
• Sample cups or tubes for ICP-MS
• Royal blue-top (K2 EDTA) collection tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Disinfectants/wipes
1. PROCEDURE
Step-by-Step Process: A. Sample Preparation:
1. Vortex each patient specimen sample thoroughly for
approximately 30 seconds.
2. Transfer 500 μL of blood from the collection tube to a clean,
labeled centrifuge tube.
3. Add 1 mL of nitric acid (trace metal grade) to the sample tube.
4. Vortex the sample again for 30 seconds and then allow it to
stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.
5. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean sample cup or tube for
ICP-MS analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards by serial dilution using high-purity
water and trace metal grade nitric acid.
2. Prepare internal standard solution as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Ensure that at least two levels of quality control materials (one
low and one high) are included in each run.
4. Perform a calibration curve with blank and multiple calibration
standards to establish the linearity of the method.
5. Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each batch.
C. Instrument Setup and Analysis:
1. Ensure the ICP-MS instrument is properly calibrated and tuned
according to the manufacturer's specifications.
2. Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, quality
control materials, and internal standard into the autosampler.
3. Enter the sample identification information into the data system.
4. Initiate the run according to the instrument’s protocol for
selenium analysis.
5. Monitor the run for any instrument alerts or errors and address
them immediately.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Review the generated data for all samples, including calibration
and quality control samples.
2. Ensure that the calibration curve’s linear regression coefficient
(R2) meets the criteria (e.g., R2 > 0.995).
3. Compare patient sample results with quality control samples to
ensure accuracy.
4. If quality control is out of acceptable limits, re-run the affected
batch and identify any potential issues that could have caused
the deviation.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Calibration standards should be freshly prepared daily or per
the run.
7. Quality control samples should be analyzed with each batch
and meet the defined acceptance criteria.
8. Results are only reported if the quality control samples pass the
predefined criteria.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Enter the raw data and observations into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
11. Review the data for consistency and compliance with the
laboratory's acceptance criteria.
12. Include flags for any critical results outside the normal
reference ranges.
13. Verify that all results have been reviewed and authorized by the
supervising technologist.
14. Transmit the validated results to the ordering physician through
the LIS.
15. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to site-specific reference intervals that have been established
for selenium in blood. Refer to the latest guidelines or literature for
reference values updates.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
While this method provides accurate measurement of selenium,
certain interferences such as spectral interferences, matrix effects,
contamination, and instrument fluctuations may affect results.
Regular maintenance and calibration of the ICP-MS are required.
