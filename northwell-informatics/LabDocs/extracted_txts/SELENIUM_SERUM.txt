SELENIUM, SERUM - ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed procedure for the accurate
and reliable determination of Selenium levels in serum
samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY it is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to perform this procedure accurately and report any
issues to the supervising authority.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Collection Container: Royal blue-top (trace element) tube
containing no anticoagulant or a tube with clot activator.
◦ Volume Required: Minimum of 2 mL of serum.
◦ Stability and Storage:
▪ Room Temperature: 7 days
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 14 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C or below): 6 months
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
◦ Automated Pipettes and Tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex Mixer
◦ Serum Separator Tubes
◦ Calibrators and Controls for Selenium
◦ Reagent Blank
◦ Deionized Water
5. QUALITY CONTROL MATERIALS
◦ Two levels of Selenium controls (e.g., Level 1 and Level 2)
◦ Calibrators traceable to NIST standards
6. PROCEDURE Pre-Analytical Steps:
◦ Verify patient and specimen information.
◦ Confirm serum sample has been properly handled and
stored prior to the assay.
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
Analytical Steps:
1. Sample Preparation:
▪ Allow serum specimens and quality controls to reach
room temperature.
▪ Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate serum.
▪ Transfer the required volume of serum to a clean trace
element-free container.
2. Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
▪ Prepare calibration standards according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Prepare and vortex quality control materials and
residual sample aliquots.
3. Instrument Calibration:
▪ Calibrate the ICP-MS with the prepared calibration
standards.
▪ Document the calibration curve to ensure standards
are within acceptable limits.
4. Analyte Measurement:
▪ Load the serum samples, standards, and controls onto
the ICP-MS autosampler.
▪ Analyze each serum sample according to the
designated protocol of the ICP-MS.
▪ Always run a reagent blank between sets of samples
to check for contamination.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run both Low and High-Level quality controls with each
batch of samples.
◦ Ensure quality control results fall within the pre-established
acceptable range before proceeding.
◦ If QC fails, assess potential issues, recalibrate if needed, or
rerun samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify all sample results in the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
◦ Compare results to established reference intervals:
▪ Reference Range for Selenium, Serum: 70-150 ng/mL
◦ Clearly note any anomalies or critical values that require
immediate reporting.
9. CRITICAL VALUES AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Flag critical values and ensure rapid communication with a
clinical practitioner as per lab policy.
◦ Values lower than 40 ng/mL or higher than 200 ng/mL are
typically flagged as potentially critical and demanding urgent
attention.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In case of instrument failure or unexpected results, refer to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
• Inspect reagent expiry dates and storage conditions regularly.
• Document any deviations or issues in the laboratory records, and
notify a supervisor.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or heavily lipemic samples may interfere with accurate
selenium analysis.
• Ensure the elimination of external contaminants due to trace
element sensitivity.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to the equipment and reagent package inserts for detailed
information on use, safety precautions, and limitations.
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for ICP-MS operation and
maintenance.
• CLSI Guidelines for trace element analysis in serum.
This protocol ensures the accurate and reliable determination of
Selenium levels in serum, adhering to proper safety, quality control,
and reporting standards.
