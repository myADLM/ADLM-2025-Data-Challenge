SEMAPHORIN 3B (SEMA3B) Immunostain Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for conducting SEMAPHORIN 3B
(SEMA3B) immunostain in order to ensure consistent, accurate,
and reproducible staining of SEMAPHORIN 3B in tissue
sections.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel who have received training in
immunohistochemical staining techniques and laboratory safety.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable specimens:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections mounted
on positively charged slides.
◦ Unstained sections should be 4-5 µm thick.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ SEMA3B primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (Horseradish
Peroxidase)
◦ DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate kit
◦ Hematoxylin counterstain
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (varied concentrations)
◦ Distilled water
◦ Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or PBS (Phosphate-buffered
saline) solution
◦ Blocking solution (e.g., serum or non-fat dry milk solution)
◦ Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Coverslips
5. EQUIPMENT
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Incubator/oven
◦ Coplin jars or staining dishes
◦ Heat source (e.g., microwave or pressure cooker for antigen
retrieval)
◦ Humidity chamber
◦ Light microscope
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Staining Preparation
1. Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene for 10
minutes. Repeat once.
2. Rehydrate tissue sections through graded ethanol series:
100%, 95%, and 70%, 5 minutes each. Rinse in distilled
water.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate
buffer) within a microwave-safe container.
2. Heat for 10 minutes in a microwave, monitor temperature
as per antigen retrieval recommendations.
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Wash slides in TBS or PBS.
C. Blocking
1. Incubate slides in blocking solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature inside a humidity chamber to prevent non-
specific binding.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply SEMA3B primary antibody to each slide and
incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature or overnight
at 4°C in a humidity chamber.
2. Wash slides three times in TBS or PBS, 5 minutes each.
E. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply secondary antibody conjugated with HRP to each
slide and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Wash slides three times in TBS or PBS, 5 minutes each.
F. Chromogenic Detection
1. Apply DAB substrate solution as per manufacturer's
instructions. Incubate slides for 5-10 minutes, monitoring
the development of staining under the microscope.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
G. Counterstain
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes. Place slides in
70% ethanol, then 95% ethanol, followed by 100%
ethanol for 5 minutes each.
3. Clear in xylene for 5 minutes. Repeat once.
H. Mounting
1. Add a drop of mounting medium to each slide and
coverslip gently to avoid trapping air bubbles.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include a positive control tissue known to express SEMA3B,
and a negative control where the primary antibody is
omitted.
◦ Inspect staining under the microscope. Ensure positive
controls exhibit staining and negative controls show no
staining.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ The technical component (staining quality) should be
evaluated by a board-certified pathologist.
◦ Document and log all observations, including the
appearance of controls, tissue morphology, and the
presence and intensity of antigen expression.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's datasheet for SEMA3B primary antibody.
◦ Laboratory’s internal immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols
and guidelines.
10. SAFETY AND TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Follow all laboratory safety guidelines and wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Refer to SDS (Safety Data Sheets) for all reagents.
◦ If staining is non-specific or inadequate, troubleshoot step
by step, verifying each reagent and procedure, considering
possibility of insufficient antigen retrieval, antibody
concentration, and incubation times. Document any
corrective actions taken.
NOTE: This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated according
to new scientific findings, laboratory techniques, or equipment
updates.
