Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SEMEN ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing semen analysis in the
laboratory to assess male fertility and reproductive health. This SOP
provides instructions for analyzing semen samples for various
parameters including concentration, motility, morphology, and other
relevant aspects of semen quality.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
semen analysis accurately according to this procedure and report the
results in a timely manner. All laboratory staff must adhere to this
SOP and maintain the integrity and quality of the test results.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected semen sample in a sterile, non-toxic, wide-
mouthed container.
• Specimen collected via masturbation after a period of sexual
abstinence (usually 2-5 days).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected via intercourse or in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens received more than 1 hour after collection without
proper storage conditions.
• Specimens with any leakage or improper labeling (missing
collection time/date, patient's name).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope with phase contrast capability
• Hemocytometer
• Graduated pipettes
• Cover slips
• Pre-calibrated centrifuge
• Glass slides
• Stains for morphology assessment (e.g., Papanicolaou stain)
• Protective gear (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
• Timer
• Disposable pipettes
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Confirm patient identification and match details on specimen
container with the request form.
2. Record the sample collection time/date and ensure it falls within
acceptable limits.
3. Allow the semen sample to liquefy at room temperature for
30-60 minutes.
Analysis:
**A) ** Macroscopic Examination:
1. Record the volume of the semen sample using a graduated
pipette.
2. Note the color, appearance, and viscosity of the sample.
**B) ** Microscopic Examination:
1. Motility Assessment:
◦ Place a drop of liquefied semen sample on a glass slide and
cover with a coverslip.
◦ Observe under the microscope using phase contrast at
200-400x magnification.
◦ Assess motility by examining a minimum of 200 sperm cells
and categorize them into: a. Rapid progressive (Grade A) b.
Slow progressive (Grade B) c. Non-progressive (Grade C)
d. Immotile (Grade D)
◦ Calculate the percentage of each category.
2. Concentration (Sperm Count):
◦ Dilute the semen sample (usually 1:20) with an appropriate
dilution fluid (e.g., saline).
◦ Charge a hemocytometer with the diluted specimen.
◦ Count the number of sperm cells in the designated squares
under phase contrast microscopy.
◦ Calculate sperm concentration as per standard formula
(sperm/mL).
3. Morphology Assessment:
◦ Prepare a stained smear using specified staining methods
(e.g., Papanicolaou).
◦ Observe sperm morphology under oil immersion at 1000x
magnification.
◦ Classify morphology based on head, midpiece, and tail
abnormalities.
◦ Determine the percentage of sperm with normal
morphology.
C) Additional Assessments:
1. Viability Test (Optional):
◦ Perform vital staining (e.g., eosin-nigrosin) and assess live
versus dead sperm cells.
◦ Count at least 100 sperm cells and calculate percentage
viability.
D Reporting and Documentation:
1. Ensure all raw data is documented, including concentration,
motility percentages, and morphology profiles.
2. Review the results for accuracy.
3. Record findings in laboratory information system (LIS) following
site-specific reporting guidelines.
4. Communicate critical results to healthcare providers as per
protocol.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Commercially prepared semen analysis control specimens.
Procedure:
1. Run controls with each batch of patient samples.
2. Compare control results to established reference values.
3. Document control results and take corrective action if results
fall outside acceptable limits.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Technical quality and accuracy are influenced by timing,
specimen integrity, equipment calibration, and operator
proficiency.
2. Variations in sample collection, transport, and handling may
affect results.
