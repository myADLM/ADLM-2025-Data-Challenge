Standard Operating Procedure: SEMEN ANALYSIS WITH STRICT
MORPHOLOGY
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the standardized procedure for performing
semen analysis, including strict morphology, in the laboratory setting.
This process ensures the quality and accuracy of results for
diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing semen
analysis, including strict morphology, following this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory staff to identify any issues that may
affect the accuracy and reliability of semen analysis and report them
to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Semen Analysis: A comprehensive assessment of semen
characteristics, including volume, concentration, motility, and
morphology, to evaluate male fertility. Strict Morphology (Kruger
Criteria): A detailed evaluation of sperm morphology using strict
criteria to determine the percentage of normal forms.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected semen sample provided through masturbation
after 2-7 days of sexual abstinence.
• Samples should be collected in a clean, sterile, and wide-mouth
container without any additives or lubricants.
Unacceptable:
• Samples not provided in a sterile container.
• Samples collected with the use of lubricants or other chemicals.
• Samples collected after less than 2 days or more than 7 days of
sexual abstinence.
• Samples that have been exposed to extreme temperatures (too
cold or too warm).
• Samples that have not been delivered to the laboratory within one
hour of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile specimen containers
• Laboratory coat, gloves, and protective eyewear
• Centrifuge
• Microscope with a x10 and x100 objectives (oil immersion)
• Makler chamber or improved Neubauer chamber
• Leucocytometer (for assessing leukocyte concentration)
• Giemsa stain or Diff-Quik stain for morphology assessment
• Distilled water
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
• Pipettes and micropipettes
• Counting slides
• Timer
• Microscopic slides and cover slips
• Immersion oil
1. PROCEDURE
A. Receipt of the Specimen:
• Confirm that the sample is in a sterile container, labeled
appropriately with the patient's name and the date/time of
collection.
• Document the arrival time and conditions of the sample.
• Store the sample at room temperature until analysis.
B. Physical and Macroscopic Examination:
• Measure and record the viscosity, appearance, and color of the
sample using a sterile pipette.
• Allow the sample to liquefy completely if not already done
(generally within 30-60 minutes).
• Measure the volume of the sample using a graduated cylinder
and record.
C. Microscopic Analysis:
i. Concentration:
• Mix the sample well by gentle inversion.
• Load 10 µL of the semen sample into a Makler chamber or
improved Neubauer chamber.
• Count the spermatozoa in the specified grid area under x10
magnification.
• Calculate the concentration (number of sperm/mL).
ii. Motility:
• Place 10 µL of the well-mixed semen sample onto a microscopic
slide and cover with a cover slip.
• Examine under x10 or x20 magnification.
• Assess motility by classifying sperm as progressive, non-
progressive, or immotile.
• Count at least 200 sperm cells to calculate the percentage of
each category.
iii. Vitality (Eosin-Nigrosin Staining):
• Mix one part semen sample with one part eosin-nigrosin stain.
• Prepare a smear on a slide, air dry, and observe under the
microscope.
• Count 100 sperm cells to determine the percentage of live
(unstained) and dead (stained) sperm.
iv. Morphology:
• Prepare a smear of the semen sample on a clean microscopic
slide and allow to air dry.
• Stain the smear using Giemsa stain or Diff-Quik stain following
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Examine the stained smear under x100 oil-immersion objective.
• Evaluate at least 200 sperm and classify them as normal or
abnormal based on head, midpiece, and tail morphology (strict
Kruger criteria).
• Calculate the percentage of normal forms.
v. Leukocytes:
• Load semen sample in a leukocyte counting chamber, and count
leukocytes under the microscope.
• Calculate the concentration of leukocytes per mL.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform semen analysis on control samples periodically to verify
the accuracy and reproducibility of the results.
• Compare results with established reference ranges and verify
against known standards.
• Document out-of-range quality control results and undertake
appropriate corrective actions.
• Maintain and calibrate all equipment periodically according to the
laboratory’s maintenance schedule and manufacturer’s
instructions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review results for consistency with internal controls and
reference ranges.
• Issue reports to authorized healthcare professionals following the
laboratory procedure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS (WHO 2010 guidelines):
• Semen volume: 1.5 - 5.0 mL
• Sperm concentration: ≥ 15 million sperm/mL
• Total sperm count: ≥ 39 million sperm/ejaculate
• Motility: ≥ 40% (progressive and non-progressive)
• Vitality: ≥ 58% live sperm
• Morphology (strict criteria): ≥ 4% normal forms
• Leukocytes: ≤ 1 million/mL
1. METHODS LIMITATION
• Ensure strict adherence to the abstinence period (2-7 days) for
accurate assessment.
• Avoid interferences or specimen contamination from lubricants or
non-sterile containers.
• Semen analysis is subject to variability and may require repeated
testing for comprehensive evaluation.
