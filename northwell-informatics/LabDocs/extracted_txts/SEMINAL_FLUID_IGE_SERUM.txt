Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Seminal Fluid, IgE, and Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the procedure for accurately analyzing and
generating results for seminal fluid, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and
serum samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory. It ensures proper
handling, accurate measurement, and timely reporting of test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Seminal Fluid:
• Preferred/acceptable: Freshly ejaculated seminal fluid collected in
a sterile container. The specimen should be kept at room
temperature and analyzed within 1 hour of collection.
• Unacceptable: Specimen showing signs of hemolysis,
contamination, or improper labeling without collection date/time.
IgE (Serum):
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Hemolysed, lipemic, or improperly labeled
specimens.
Serum:
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in a red-top or SST tube.
Specimens should be allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature and then centrifuged.
• Unacceptable: Specimen showing signs of hemolysis, lipemia,
contamination, or improper labeling.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Seminal Fluid:
• Microscope
• Neubauer hemocytometer
• Staining reagents for sperm morphology
• Centrifuge
• Sterile pipettes and containers
IgE and Serum:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA or
chemiluminescence immunoassay)
• Calibrators and controls for specific analytes
• Centrifuge
• Sterile pipettes and containers
4. PROCEDURE
A) Seminal Fluid Analysis:
1. Macroscopic Examination:
◦ Assess appearance, volume, pH, and liquefaction time.
Document findings.
2. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Use a Neubauer hemocytometer to determine sperm
concentration.
◦ Evaluate sperm motility under a light microscope.
◦ Perform stain for assessing sperm morphology.
◦ Document findings including sperm count, motility, and
morphology.
B) IgE (Serum) Analysis:
1. Centrifuge serum samples to separate serum from clotted
blood.
2. Ensure the automated immunoassay analyzer is calibrated.
3. Load serum samples into the analyzer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Perform the IgE test using the appropriate assay kit.
5. Document and report IgE concentration levels.
C) Serum Analysis:
1. Centrifuge serum samples to separate serum from clotted
blood.
2. Calibrate and perform maintenance on the automated analyzer
per manufacturer instructions.
3. Load serum samples and reagents into the analyzer.
4. Run tests for specific analytes requested:
◦ Glucose
◦ Electrolytes
◦ Proteins
5. Document and report test results for requested analytes.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Seminal Fluid Analysis:
1. Perform quality control testing using standard control samples.
2. Include internal QC checks for each batch.
3. Document control results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges.
IgE and Serum Analysis:
1. Perform QC checks with each test batch using low, medium,
and high concentration controls.
2. Verify the analyzer's calibration and accuracy by comparing
results with known standards.
3. Document control values, ensuring all QC results fall within
acceptable ranges.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Seminal Fluid:
1. Enter results in LIS (Laboratory Information System) promptly.
2. Verify accuracy of data entry.
3. Report findings to Physician.
IgE and Serum:
1. Review IgE and serum test results generated by the automated
analyzer.
2. Verify and approve results through technologist review.
3. Transmit validated results to LIS.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Seminal Fluid:
• Sperm Concentration: ≥ 15 million sperm/mL
• Motility: ≥ 40% motile sperm
• Morphology: ≥ 4% normal forms
IgE:
• Serum levels: <100 IU/mL (May differ based on age and clinical
presentation)
Serum:
• As defined by each specific serum test:
◦ Glucose: 70–99 mg/dL (fasting)
◦ Sodium: 135–145 mmol/L
◦ Protein: 6.0-8.3 g/dL
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay kits’ inserts for limitations concerning
interference factors, cross-reactivity, and specimen stability.
