Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Sensory Neuropathy Panel
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for accurately
generating results from the Sensory Neuropathy Panel, from
preparation to analysis. Accurate generation of results is critical for
ensuring reliable diagnostic data for clinical assessments of sensory
neuropathy.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
perform the analytical phase procedures with accuracy and to ensure
that proper documentation is maintained for all steps involved in
generating results.
1. DEFINITION
The Sensory Neuropathy Panel includes specific tests designed to
measure sub-components associated with sensory neuropathy.
These typically include measurements of specific proteins,
antibodies, and other markers indicative of neuropathy.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements: - Preferred/acceptable: Serum or plasma
collected in EDTA or SST tubes. - Volume: A minimum of 2 mL is
recommended for analysis. - Handling: Specimens should be stored
at 2-8°C and processed within 48 hours of collection. - Transport:
Specimens must be securely packaged and transported to minimize
contamination and degradation.
Unacceptable: - Hemolyzed specimens - Specimens with significant
contamination or not properly labeled - Serum or plasma samples
older than 48 hours if not properly refrigerated
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Sensory Neuropathy Panel Reagents kits
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to the Neuropathy Panel
◦ Micro-centrifuge and vortex units
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer
◦ Disposable pipette tips and micro-pipettes
◦ Reagent grade water (Type II)
◦ Appropriate laboratory consumables (gloves, lab coats, etc.)
◦ Temperature controlled storage units (refrigerators/freezers)
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation: - Verify the integrity and label of the specimen. - Use a
centrifuge for sample processing, ensure the specimen is free of clots
and hemolysis. - Prepare necessary reagents and calibrators
following manufacturer instructions.
Calibration: - Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using dedicated
calibrators from the Sensory Neuropathy Panel kit. - Run internal
quality controls (low, medium, high) to verify calibration. Acceptable
ranges are specified by the manufacturer.
Assay Execution: - Load the processed specimen into the automated
immunoassay analyzer. - Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to
run the assay. - Record the assay details: sample ID, reagent lot
numbers, and the operator’s initials.
Troubleshooting: - If the results fall outside the expected ranges,
perform necessary troubleshooting: check reagent preparation,
equipment maintenance, recalibrate if needed. - Capture any
aberrations in the Temperature Monitoring Log.
Documentation: - Complete the Sensory Neuropathy Panel Analysis
Log including sample ID, date of analysis, outcome of QC checks,
and operator initials. - Record any corrective actions taken during the
analysis phase.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material: Refer to Sensory Neuropathy Panel kit documentation for
detailed material and quality control protocols.
Storage: Maintain all QC materials refrigerated between 2-8°C.
Follow storage expiration guidelines and discard expired material.
Procedure: - Run QC samples (low, medium, high) concurrently with
patient specimens. - Document all QC results in the QC log. - If QC
fails, cease patient specimen analysis, troubleshoot the issue and
rerun QC until acceptable results are achieved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Verification: - Once analysis is complete, review results for
consistency and accuracy. - Transmit results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and cross-verify entered data. - Attach
necessary comments or flags where results fall outside normal
reference intervals.
Reference Intervals: Refer to specific laboratory guidelines for
acceptable reference intervals for each marker in the Sensory
Neuropathy Panel.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure that all staff involved in running sensory neuropathy panels
are familiar with specific limitations outlined in the Panel kit
documentation, and package inserts. Report any anomalies or
unusual results to the supervisor for further investigation.

Consult Sensory Neuropathy Panel Kit Instructions and relevant
medical literature for detailed handling and data interpretation
guidelines.
By adhering to the above SOP, laboratory staff will ensure that the
sensory neuropathy panel results are accurate, reliable, and
generated in accordance with CLIA-certified guidelines.
