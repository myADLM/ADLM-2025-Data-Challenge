SEPTIN-5 ANTIBODY, CELL-BINDING
ASSAY, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the SEPTIN-5 Antibody, Cell-
Binding Assay on spinal fluid specimens in order to ensure accurate
and timely results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
test according to the protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that all personnel are trained and proficient in
the procedure, and to ensure that the equipment and reagents are
maintained and used appropriately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Spinal fluid
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL
• Storage Conditions: If testing is not performed immediately, the
spinal fluid should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For
longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents:
◦ SEPTIN-5 Antibody
◦ Immunofluorescence staining reagents
◦ Cell culture medium and supplements
◦ Wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20)
• Equipment:
◦ Culture dishes or plates suitable for cell-binding assays
◦ Incubator set to 37°C with 5% CO2
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Fluorescence microscope or flow cytometer
• Other Supplies:
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
◦ Assay-specific control materials
◦ Lab markers and labels for proper specimen identification
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Steps
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure the spinal fluid sample is properly labeled with
patient information.
◦ If frozen, thaw the sample at room temperature.
◦ Mix the sample gently but thoroughly.
2. Cell Preparation:
◦ Prepare the target cells for the binding assay according to
your laboratory's standard cell culture protocol.
◦ Count and adjust the cell concentration to the required
density as per the assay protocol.
B. Analytical Steps
1. Incubation of Specimen:
◦ Add an appropriate volume of spinal fluid to a well
containing the prepared target cells.
◦ Incubate the cells and spinal fluid at 37°C for 1-2 hours,
allowing sufficient time for binding.
2. Washing:
◦ Aspirate the incubation mixture carefully without disturbing
the cells.
◦ Wash the cells three times with wash buffer to remove
unbound components.
3. Staining:
◦ Add SEPTIN-5 antibody to the cells and incubate for 30-60
minutes at room temperature or as specified in the antibody
reagent guidelines.
◦ Wash the cells three times with wash buffer to remove
unbound antibodies.
4. Fluorescent Staining (if applicable):
◦ Stain the cells with appropriate secondary fluorescent
antibody if the SEPTIN-5 antibody is not directly labeled.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes in the dark if specific staining
conditions apply.
◦ Wash the cells three times with wash buffer.
C. Detection and Analysis
1. Microscopy/Flow Cytometry:
◦ Examine the cells under a fluorescence microscope or
analyze them using a flow cytometer.
◦ Identify and quantify the binding of SEPTIN-5 antibody using
the appropriate fluorescence filters and detection settings.
2. Data Recording:
◦ Record the fluorescence intensity and any qualitative
observations.
◦ Ensure all data is entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS) accurately.
D. Quality Control
• Quality Control Procedures:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of assays
to ensure the assay performance.
◦ Document control results and investigate any deviations from
expected values.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Range:
◦ Report the presence or absence of SEPTIN-5 antibodies.
Ensure that qualitative results align with the laboratory’s
reference values or interpretive guidelines.
• Internal Review:
◦ All results must be reviewed by a qualified technologist before
release.
• Documentation:
◦ Document all findings and procedures followed in the patient's
report.
• Critical Results:
◦ Any critical or unexpected findings should be verified and
confirmed before reporting to the clinician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Limitations:
◦ Refer to the SEPTIN-5 antibody reagent package insert for
specific limitations.
◦ Assay sensitivity may be affected by sample handling and
storage conditions.
