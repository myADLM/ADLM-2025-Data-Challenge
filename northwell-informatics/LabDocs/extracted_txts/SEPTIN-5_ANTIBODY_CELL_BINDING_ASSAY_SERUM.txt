Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
SEPTIN-5 ANTIBODY, CELL BINDING ASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for conducting the SEPTIN-5
Antibody Cell Binding Assay on serum samples in order to ensure
accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel conducting the SEPTIN-5 Antibody Cell
Binding Assay must be trained in this procedure and are responsible
for ensuring that the protocol is followed accurately and completely.
2. DEFINITIONS
• SEPTIN-5 Antibody: An antibody that targets SEPTIN-5 protein.
• Cell Binding Assay: A laboratory method used to detect antibody
binding to specific antigens presented on the surface of cells.
• Serum: The liquid part of blood that remains after clotting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Collection: Collect blood using standard venipuncture
techniques. Allow the blood to clot at room temperature and then
centrifuge to separate the serum.
• Storage: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C. If testing is delayed,
serum may be frozen at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline)
• Wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20)
• Blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS)
• Cell culture plates
• SEPTIN-5 expressing cells
• Anti-Human IgG-FITC conjugated secondary antibody
• Flow cytometer or fluorescence microscope
• Control serum (negative and positive controls)
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation: a. Thaw serum samples, control serum, and
reagents at room temperature. b. Prepare the cell suspension
by detaching SEPTIN-5 expressing cells using trypsin, followed
by washing with PBS and resuspending in fresh complete
media.
2. Blocking: a. Aliquot 100 µL of the cell suspension (adjust to
approximately 1 x 10^6 cells/mL) into each well of a cell culture
plate. b. Add 100 µL blocking solution to each well and incubate
for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Incubation with Serum: a. After blocking, remove the
supernatant and wash the cells twice with wash buffer. b. Add
100 µL of the serum sample or control serum to respective
wells (diluted 1:100 in PBS) and incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
4. Washing: a. After incubation, remove the serum and wash the
cells three times with wash buffer to remove unbound
antibodies.
5. Secondary Antibody Staining: a. Add 100 µL of the anti-
Human IgG-FITC conjugated secondary antibody (diluted
according to manufacturer’s instructions) to each well and
incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C in the dark.
6. Final Washes: a. Remove the secondary antibody and wash
the cells three times with wash buffer.
7. Detection: a. Resuspend the cells in PBS and transfer to
appropriate tubes for flow cytometry or slides for fluorescence
microscopy. b. Analyze the samples using a flow cytometer or a
fluorescence microscope. Ensure that the instrument settings
are optimized for FITC detection.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run negative and positive control serum samples with each batch
of tests to ensure the assay is performing correctly.
• If controls do not perform as expected, the assay results should
not be reported and troubleshooting should be initiated.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the presence of SEPTIN-5 antibodies if fluorescence
intensity exceeds the threshold established by the laboratory
(based on the positive control).
• Negative results are indicated when the fluorescence intensity is
similar to that of the negative control.
8. REFERENCES
• Refer to the specific cell binding assay kit insert for any additional
information and reagent-specific instructions.
• Review any updated guidelines and protocols provided by
reputable diagnostic organizations.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure serum samples are properly stored and handled to
prevent degradation.
• Interference from other antibodies or serum components should
be considered when interpreting the results.
This protocol must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to incorporate the latest technological advancements and regulatory
requirements.
