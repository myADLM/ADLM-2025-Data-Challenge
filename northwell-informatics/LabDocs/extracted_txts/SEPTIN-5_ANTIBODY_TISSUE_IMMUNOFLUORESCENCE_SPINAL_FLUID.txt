Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
SEPTIN-5 Antibody, Tissue Immunofluorescence, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the analysis of
SEPTIN-5 antibody in spinal fluid using tissue immunofluorescence.
The protocol ensures accurate and reliable results and includes
guidelines on specimen handling, equipment use, quality control, and
reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the SEPTIN-5 antibody assay using tissue
immunofluorescence.
• Ensuring compliance with the outlined procedures.
• Documenting all steps and findings accurately.
• Taking corrective actions as needed.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Spinal fluid collected using standard procedures ensuring minimal
contamination. The specimen should be collected in a sterile
container.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that have leaked, are contaminated, or have been
improperly labeled.
• Specimens arriving beyond the acceptable time limit or kept under
improper conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters.
• Tissue slides prepared from spinal fluid sample.
• SEPTIN-5 antibody specific for tissue immunofluorescence.
• Secondary antibody conjugated with fluorophore.
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) for washing steps.
• Mounting medium with anti-fade properties.
• Positive and negative control slides.
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation of Tissue Slides:
◦ Ensure tissue is evenly spread on the slide and fixed
appropriately. Follow fixation protocols suitable for the
detection of SEPTIN-5 antibodies.
2. Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate the slides with the primary SEPTIN-5 antibody for
the recommended duration at the appropriate temperature
(refer to manufacturer's Insert for antibody specifics).
◦ Wash the slides with PBS to remove unbound antibodies.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate the slides with the secondary antibody conjugated
with fluorophore for an appropriate time period as per
vendor recommendations.
◦ Wash the slides with PBS to remove unbound secondary
antibodies.
4. Mounting:
◦ Apply a drop of mounting medium to each slide. Cover with
a coverslip ensuring no air bubbles are trapped.
5. Microscopy:
◦ Use the fluorescence microscope to visualize the slides.
Ensure proper calibration of the microscope for accurate
detection.
◦ Compare fluorescence signal intensity between positive
control, negative control, and patient samples.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls alongside the patient samples
to validate the assay.
• Record fluorescence signal intensity and any deviations in
controls.
• Perform routine calibration and maintenance of the fluorescence
microscope.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all observations and intensities of fluorescence signals for
each sample.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for documentation and
transmission of results.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
reporting.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive control should exhibit strong fluorescence.
• Negative control should exhibit no fluorescence.
• Reference intervals for patient samples should be established
based on validated data.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper handling and storage of the antibodies following
manufacturer guidelines to avoid degradation.
• Refer to the antibody insert for any specific limitations in
sensitivity or specificity.

Ensure adherence to the procedures to maintain high standards of
laboratory performance and accuracy in results. Regular training and
updates on protocols are mandated to keep up with advancements in
immunofluorescence detection methods.
