Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): SEPTIN-5 ANTIBODY,
Tissue Immunofluorescence Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To standardize the process for analyzing and generating results for
SEPTIN-5 antibody through tissue immunofluorescence titer on
serum samples. This ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency in
test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the duty of the designated laboratory technologists to perform the
analysis according to the outlined procedure and to document all
findings properly. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
adherence to this procedure and for addressing any issues that arise.
3. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum specimen collected via venipuncture.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum is recommended.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C and
tested within 7 days. If long-term storage is necessary, the
specimen should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Miscategorized or mislabeled specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Fluorescence microscope
• Immunofluorescence slides coated with appropriate tissue
• SEPTIN-5 antibody reagent
• Fluorescent secondary antibody (anti-IgG FITC)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Mounting medium with anti-fade agent
• Coverslips
• Serum diluent (normal saline or PBS)
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature. Ensure all
reagents are at the required temperature.
2. Label all immunofluorescence slides and create a log for
tracking specimens.
B) Immunofluorescence Assay:
1. Dilution of Serum: a. Prepare serial dilutions of the patient
serum: 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320 using the
chosen diluent.
2. Slide Preparation: a. Add 50 µL of each serum dilution onto
designated sections of the coated slides. b. Incubate slides at
room temperature for 30 minutes in a humid chamber.
3. Washing: a. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, repeating this
step three times to ensure removal of unbound antibodies.
4. Secondary Antibody Application: a. Apply 50 µL of
fluorescent secondary antibody (anti-IgG FITC) to each section.
b. Incubate slides at room temperature for 30 minutes in a dark
and humid chamber.
5. Washing: a. Rinse slides again in PBS for 5 minutes, repeating
the step three times.
6. Mounting: a. Add a small drop of mounting medium with anti-
fade agent to each slide and cover with a coverslip. Allow to dry
for 5-10 minutes.
C) Microscopy:
1. Using a fluorescence microscope, examine the slides under
appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths for FITC.
2. Observe for specific immunofluorescence indicating the
presence of SEPTIN-5 antibodies.
6. GENERATING RESULTS:
1. Titer Determination: a. The endpoint titer is the highest dilution
of serum that shows specific immunofluorescence.
2. Documentation: a. Record the fluorescence intensity and
dilution titer for each specimen. b. Use a standard reporting
template to ensure consistency.
3. Interpretation: a. Compare results against established control
values and with typical positive and negative controls run
concurrently.
4. Quality Control: a. Include known positive and negative
control samples in each run. b. Document control results and
ensure they are within expected ranges to validate assay
performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
Results are to be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and verification by a qualified technologist. Ensure
results are verified for accuracy and completeness.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the SEPTIN-5 antibody reagent.
• Published literature detailing immunofluorescence protocols and
SEPTIN-5 clinical significance.
This standard operating procedure must be strictly followed to ensure
the reliability and consistency of SEPTIN-5 antibody tests conducted
in the laboratory.
Version Control: This SOP is effective as of [Date]. It must be
reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to accommodate
new guidelines or technological advancements.
