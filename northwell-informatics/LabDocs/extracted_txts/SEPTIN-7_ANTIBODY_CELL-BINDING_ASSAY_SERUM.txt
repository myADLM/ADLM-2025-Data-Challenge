Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SEPTIN-7 ANTIBODY,
CELL-BINDING ASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for
detecting and quantifying SEPTIN-7 antibodies in serum using a cell-
binding assay. This assay is performed to aid in the diagnosis and
monitoring of diseases where SEPTIN-7 antibodies are implicated.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay
as defined in this procedure. Supervisors ensure that the procedures
are adhered to, and corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. DEFINITION
SEPTIN-7 antibodies are detected and quantified using a cell-binding
assay with defined protocol steps.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Reagents, Supplies, and Equipment
• Human or murine cells expressing SEPTIN-7 antigen
• Serum samples
• Negative and positive control sera
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA)
• Bovine serum albumin (BSA)
• Tween-20
• Anti-human IgG conjugated to a detectable marker (e.g.,
horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent dye)
• Cell culture plates or slides (as appropriate)
• Incubator set to 37°C with 5% CO2
• Fluorescence microscope or plate reader
• PPE and general laboratory supplies
3.2 Sample Preparation
• Allow serum samples to thaw completely if stored frozen.
• Mix samples thoroughly by gentle inversion or vortexing.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove debris
and clarify the serum.
• Aliquot a new tube and label it appropriately.
3.3 Cell Preparation
• Harvest cells expressing SEPTIN-7 antigen.
• Wash cells twice with PBS.
• Fix cells with 4% PFA for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT).
• Wash cells three times with PBS to remove excess PFA.
3.4 Blocking
• Block cells with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 for 1
hour at RT.
3.5 Incubation with Serum Samples
• Dilute serum samples and control sera (positive and negative)
1:50 in PBS with 1% BSA.
• Incubate cells with 100 µL of diluted serum at 37°C for 1 hour.
• Wash cells three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 to
remove unbound antibodies.
3.6 Incubation with Secondary Antibody
• Incubate cells with anti-human IgG conjugated to a detectable
marker diluted in PBS with 1% BSA as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Incubate for 1 hour at RT protected from light if using a
fluorescent marker.
• Wash cells three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 to
remove unbound secondary antibody.
3.7 Detection and Reading
• If using a fluorescent marker, use a fluorescence microscope to
detect fluorescence intensity.
• If using an enzyme-linked conjugate, add the appropriate
substrate and measure the signal using a plate reader.
• Record observations or read absorbance at the specified
wavelength according to the secondary antibody’s conjugate.
3.8 Data Analysis
• Compare the signal from test samples with that of positive and
negative controls.
• Quantify the results based on the standard curve if applicable.
3.9 Quality Control
• Perform all assays in duplicate.
• Include positive and negative controls with each run.
• Document all steps, reagents, and observations meticulously.
• Deviations must be recorded and reported to the supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Normalize patient sample results to control values.
• The final results should be approved by the technologist before
transmission to the LIS.
• Once approved, results should be transmitted to the LIS.
• Critical results that fall outside the established reference range
should be repeated and verified, and any discrepancies resolved
before reporting final results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals will be established based on the population
study and should be reviewed periodically:
• Negative: No detectable SEPTIN-7 antibodies
• Positive: Detectable SEPTIN-7 antibodies (with defined cut-off
values for low, moderate, and high levels)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences from other immunoglobulins or serum components
can lead to false positives or negatives.
• The specificity of the secondary antibody and thorough washing
steps is crucial to avoid non-specific binding.
• Ensure cells are not over-fixed or under-fixed as this affects
antigen accessibility.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer Protocols for Secondary Antibodies.
• Relevant published literature on SEPTIN-7 antibody assays and
their clinical significance.
This SOP is effective immediately and will be reviewed annually or as
needed to reflect any updates in technology or methodology.
