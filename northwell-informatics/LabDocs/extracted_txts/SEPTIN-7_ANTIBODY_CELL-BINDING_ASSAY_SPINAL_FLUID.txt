STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for SEPTIN-7 ANTIBODY, CELL-BINDING
ASSAY, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the accurate measurement
and reporting of SEPTIN-7 antibody levels in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) using a cell-binding assay.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
SEPTIN-7 antibody, cell-binding assay in CSF samples in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay, ensuring quality control, documenting results, and notifying
the supervisor of inconsistencies or issues.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Flow cytometer or fluorescence microscope
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Biosafety cabinet
• Incubator
Reagents:
• Fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody specific to human
antibodies
• SEPTIN-7 expressing cell line or cell lysates coated on assay
plates
• Blocking buffer (e.g., BSA solution)
• Wash buffer (e.g., PBS with 0.1% Tween-20)
• Fixative (e.g., formaldehyde solution)
• Sample diluent (e.g., PBS)
• Negative and positive control CSF samples
Supplies:
• 96-well plates
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Plate seals or lids
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Acceptable:
• Freshly collected CSF sample (1-2 mL) in sterile screw-cap
container or transport tube.
• Stored and transported at 2-8°C; must arrive at the lab within 24
hours of collection.
• If delayed beyond 24 hours, samples must be frozen at -20°C or
below.
Unacceptable:
• CSF samples containing visible blood contamination.
• Samples that are clotted, hemolyzed, or not properly labeled.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Check that the needed reagents and materials are at room
temperature and record reagent lot numbers.
2. Verify that the flow cytometer/fluorescence microscope and all
necessary equipment are properly calibrated and functioning.
Sample Preparation: 3. Centrifuge CSF samples at 3,000 RPM for
10 minutes to remove any cells or debris. 4. Aliquot the supernatant
into sterile tubes for assay use.
Assay Procedure: 5. Coat the 96-well plates with SEPTIN-7
expressing cells or cell lysates and incubate overnight at 4°C. 6.
Wash the plates three times with wash buffer. 7. Block non-specific
binding sites with blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. 8.
Add 100 µL of sample or controls to appropriate wells and incubate
for 2 hours at room temperature. 9. Wash plates three times with
wash buffer. 10. Add 100 µL of the fluorescently-labeled secondary
antibody to each well and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature in
the dark. 11. Wash plates three times with wash buffer. 12. Fix the
cells with fixative solution for 20 minutes at room temperature. 13.
Perform a final wash step and resuspend cells in wash buffer.
Measurement: 14. Read the fluorescence intensity using a flow
cytometer or fluorescence microscope. 15. Record the median
fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each well.
Quality Control: 16. Include negative (known antibody-negative) and
positive (known antibody-positive) controls in each assay batch. 17.
Results from controls must be within established acceptance ranges
prior to reporting patient results.
Data Analysis: 18. Calculate the SEPTIN-7 antibody levels based on
the MFI values relative to the controls. 19. Compare the patient
sample results to the established reference range for SEPTIN-7
antibody levels.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
High-Sensitivity Reporting:
• Ensure the final results are validated and reviewed by a
laboratory supervisor.
• Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
ensure they meet the laboratory’s quality management criteria.
Documentation:
• Record all assay-related entries, including sample numbers,
control readings, reagent lot numbers, equipment calibration data,
and final results in a lab notebook or digital log system.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Potential limitations of the SEPTIN-7 antibody cell-binding assay:
• The accuracy of the assay can be affected by improper sample
handling or storage.
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may result in false positives.
• Assay sensitivity may be compromised if the fluorescently-labeled
secondary antibody is expired or not properly stored.
