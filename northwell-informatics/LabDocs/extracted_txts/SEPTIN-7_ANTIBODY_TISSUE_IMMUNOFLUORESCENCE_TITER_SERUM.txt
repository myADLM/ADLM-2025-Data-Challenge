Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analyzing SEPTIN-7 Antibody, Tissue Immunofluorescence
Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the quantitative determination of
SEPTIN-7 antibody levels in human serum using fluorescent
immunoassay techniques. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure
accurate and reproducible analytical results for better diagnostic and
research outcomes.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately and to ensure that deviations from the protocol are
documented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
Preferred/acceptable:
- 5 mL serum, drawn from a patient’s venous blood collection using
standard phlebotomy techniques. The serum should be separated
and transferred into an appropriate serum collection tube within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
- Specimens that have not been properly aliquoted into serum collection tubes.
- Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic or contaminated.
- Specimens stored greater than 48 hours without freezing or not appropriately labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
- Fluorescent microscope - Centrifuge (for serum separation) -
Pipettes (adjustable and fixed-volume) - Vortex mixer - Incubator
Reagents:
- Anti-SEPTIN-7 primary antibody - Fluorescent-conjugated
secondary antibody - Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - Blocking
buffer (e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA), appropriate concentration)
- Mounting medium
Supplies:
- Serum separation tubes - Fluorescent microscope slides - Cover
slips - Disposable gloves and lab coats - Recordkeeping logbooks
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Specimens:
1. Collect venous blood in a plain collection tube without
anticoagulants.
2. Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Centrifuge the collection tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
4. Transfer the serum into labeled serum collection tubes and
store at -20°C if not analyzed immediately.
Immunofluorescence Assay:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Collect the tissue specimen and prepare cryosections,
placing them on fluorescent microscope slides.
◦ Fix the tissue sections with appropriate fixatives and block
with blocking buffer to prevent nonspecific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute the SEPTIN-7 primary antibody as recommended by
the manufacturer.
◦ Apply the diluted antibody onto the tissue sections and
incubate at room temperature for 1-2 hours in a humid
chamber.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Wash the slides thrice with PBS to remove unbound primary
antibody.
◦ Dilute the fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody and
apply to the slides.
◦ Incubate the slides in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
4. Washing and Mounting:
◦ Wash the slides thrice with PBS to remove unbound
secondary antibody.
◦ Mount the tissue sections using a mounting medium and
cover with cover slips.
Fluorescence Microscopy:
1. Carefully place the slides under the fluorescent microscope and
observe using the appropriate filter settings for the fluorophore
used.
2. Capture images of fluorescent signals for analysis and titration
determination.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Materials:
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of samples
analyzed.
Procedure:
• Analyze control samples alongside patient specimens.
• Document control results in the logbook.
• If control results fall outside of acceptable limits, do not report
patient results until the issue is resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and interpret fluorescent images using designated
software if available.
◦ Report antibody titers quantitatively, noting dilution factors
and fluorescence intensity.
◦ Ensure results are documented accurately and included in
patient reports following site-specific guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for SEPTIN-7 antibody titers should be
determined based on laboratory validation and historical data.
1. LIMITATIONS
◦ Sample quality impacts results significantly.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other antibodies must be considered.
◦ Fluorescence intensity may vary based on tissue
preservation and slide preparation protocol.
1. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s protocol for SEPTIN-7 antibody.
◦ Relevant publications and guidelines for immunofluorescent
assays and antibody testing within clinical and research
settings.
All reviews and updates to the SOP must be documented clearly with
dates and responsible personnel signatures.
