Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
SEPTIN-7 ANTIBODY, TISSUE IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TITER,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results when
performing tissue immunofluorescence assays for the detection and
titration of SEPTIN-7 antibody in spinal fluid specimens.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to the established protocol and ensuring the
quality and reliability of the results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of SEPTIN-7 Antibody using
tissue immunofluorescence titer in spinal fluid samples.
3. PROCEDURE
SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ 1-2 mL of spinal fluid collected in a sterile, tightly-capped tube
(without any additives).
◦ Specimens must be processed within 1 hour of collection or
stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with visible contamination or hemolysis.
◦ Specimens not provided in the appropriate collection device.
◦ Specimens received with a collection date/time exceeding 24
hours before analysis.
EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters
• Glass slides, cover slips
• Freeze-dried rat cerebellar sections
• SEPTIN-7 antibody conjugated with fluorochrome (e.g., FITC)
• Mounting medium with DAPI
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Humidified incubation chamber
• Positive and negative control specimens
• Timer
• Calibration and control logs
PROCEDURE:
1. PRE-ANALYTICAL PHASE:
a. Verify specimen integrity against acceptance criteria.
b. Label slides with appropriate patient identifiers.
c. Include a positive and negative control with each batch of
samples.
2. ANALYTICAL PHASE:
a. To prepare tissue sections:
- Thaw and rinse freeze-dried rat cerebellar sections in PBS for 5 minutes.
- Adhere sections onto labeled glass slides.
b. Add patient and control samples:
- Place 50 µL of spinal fluid from each specimen on separate sections of the slide.
- Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 30 minutes.
c. Washing:
- Carefully aspirate the fluid, ensuring not to touch the tissue.
- Wash the slides in PBS for 3 cycles of 5 minutes each.
d. Incubation with conjugate:
- Add 50 µL of SEPTIN-7 FITC-conjugated antibody to each section.
- Ensure even coverage of the specimen.
- Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room temperature.
e. Secondary washing:
- Aspirate the antibody solution.
- Wash the slides in PBS for 3 cycles of 5 minutes each.
f. Mounting:
- Apply a small drop of mounting medium with DAPI to each section.
- Carefully place a cover slip over the slide, avoiding air bubbles.
3. READING RESULTS:
a. Viewing and documenting samples:
- Using a fluorescence microscope, view each slide under the appropriate filters.
- Capture images of each section indicating SEPTIN-7 antibody binding.
- Titrate the intensity of the observed fluorescence using the digital imaging software.
b. Interpretation:
- Positive staining: Bright, distinct fluorescent signal in the sample.
- Negative staining: No distinct fluorescent signal.
- **Titer calculation:**
- Perform serial dilutions of positive samples.
- The titer is defined as the highest dilution at which a distinct fluorescent signal can still be observed.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
a. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
b. Report result as the highest titer of SEPTIN-7 antibody for
positive samples or as negative if no specific fluorescence is
observed across all dilutions.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
a. Positive and Negative Controls:
- Positive control: Must show a defined fluorescent staining pattern for assay validation.
- Negative control: Must show no specific fluorescence.
b. Equipment Calibration:
- Ensure microscope and digital imaging software are calibrated monthly.
- Logs and records should be maintained in calibration/control documentation.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Negative: No detectable antibody
• Positive: Detectable antibody with specific staining pattern
• Positive results will further be quantified based on titer.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure tissue sections are uniformly coated and devoid of debris
for accurate reading.
• Specimens with contamination or hemolysis may yield invalid
results.
• Always consult rat cerebellar sections for specific antibody
distribution.

Review and Revisions:
• This protocol should be reviewed and revised annually or as
necessary to keep pace with advancements in diagnostic
technology and best practices.
