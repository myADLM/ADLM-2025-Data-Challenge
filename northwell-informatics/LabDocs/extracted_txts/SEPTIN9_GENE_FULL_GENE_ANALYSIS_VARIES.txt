6. PROCEDURE
6A. DNA Extraction
1. Blood Samples:
◦ Extract genomic DNA using the DNA Extraction Kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
2. Saliva or Buccal Swab Samples:
◦ Extract DNA following the specific collection kit instructions.
◦ Measure the concentration and purity of DNA as indicated
above.
6B. PCR Amplification
1. Design primers to cover the entire SEPTIN9 gene.
2. Prepare the PCR mix including:
◦ DNA template
◦ Primers
◦ dNTPs
◦ Buffer
◦ DNA polymerase
3. Program the thermal cycler with the appropriate conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Run PCR products on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualize under
UV light.
6C. DNA Sequencing
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Quantify purified products and prepare sequencing reactions
according to the DNA sequencer’s specifications.
3. Load sequencing reactions onto the DNA sequencer and
perform sequencing run.
6D. Data Analysis
1. Use bioinformatics software to align sequences against the
reference SEPTIN9 gene.
2. Analyze the sequences for variants, insertions, deletions, and
any other relevant mutations.
3. Confirm any pathogenic or potentially pathogenic variants by
additional bioinformatic tools and literature review.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing run to ensure the accuracy of the procedure.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as
per manufacturer guidelines.
3. Document all steps and log any deviations or abnormalities
observed during the procedure.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Interpret results based on established guidelines and criteria.
2. Prepare and review the final report with detailed findings,
including any identified variants and their clinical significance.
3. Ensure that the final report is reviewed and signed off by a
certified pathologist or a molecular geneticist.
4. Communicate results to the requesting physician or medical
team following laboratory protocols and regulations.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING
1. Record all information related to specimen handling,
processing, and analysis in appropriate logs.
2. Store raw data and final reports in the laboratory information
system (LIS) for future reference and compliance.
