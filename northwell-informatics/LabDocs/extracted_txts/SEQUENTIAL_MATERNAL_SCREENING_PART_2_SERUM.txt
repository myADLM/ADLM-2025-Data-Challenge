Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Sequential Maternal
Screening, Part 2, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for processing and
analyzing Sequential Maternal Screening, Part 2, Serum. This test is
used in the second trimester of pregnancy to evaluate the risk of
certain genetic conditions such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and
Trisomy 18 (Edward’s syndrome).
Responsibility: The designated laboratory staff will perform and
document the processing, analysis, and result generation of
Sequential Maternal Screening, Part 2, according to this procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Sequential Maternal Screening, Part 2, involves the quantitative
analysis of specific biomarkers in maternal serum. These biomarkers
include:
• Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
• Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
• Unconjugated estriol (uE3)
• Inhibin-A (INH-A)
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements and Handling: - Acceptable Specimen: -
Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST). - A minimum of 2
mL of serum is required for testing. - Unacceptable Specimen: -
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples. - Specimens collected in
tubes other than SST.
3.2 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies: - Centrifuge - Automated
immunoassay analyzer - Calibrators and controls - Pipettes and
pipette tips - Sample tubes - Timer
3.3 Calibration and Quality Control: - Perform calibration using the
manufacturer’s recommended calibrators. - Run quality control (QC)
materials at the beginning of each shift and with each batch of patient
samples. Use QC materials of both high and low concentration
levels. - Document all QC results. If QC results are not within
acceptable ranges, troubleshoot according to manufacturer's
guidelines before proceeding with patient testing.
3.4 Analysis: - Centrifuge SST tube at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum. - Transfer the serum to a clean sample tube,
avoiding transfer of cellular components. - Set up the automated
immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. -
Load patient samples, calibrators, and QC materials into the
analyzer. - Follow the specific assay protocol for AFP, hCG, uE3, and
INH-A analysis. - Start the assay run, ensuring documentation of run
date, time, and initials of the technologist.
3.5 Result Generation and Verification: - Upon completion of the
analysis, review the results from the analyzer. - Verify that QC results
are within acceptable ranges. If not, re-run the QC and patient
samples. - Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). - Review and verify results in the LIS. Address any flags or
error codes by troubleshooting according to the instrument's manual.
- Release validated results to the patient chart.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical information,
gestational age, and prior screening results. They may be used to
calculate risk assessment for the respective genetic conditions: -
Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) - Trisomy 18 (Edward’s syndrome)
Further confirmatory testing (e.g., amniocentesis) may be
recommended based on these screening results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Testing may be subject to interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or
bilirubin. Ensure samples are free from these interferences before
processing. Follow the specific assay insert for additional limitations
related to each biomarker.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reported in the appropriate units as defined by the
assay. Reference intervals should be verified and entered correctly in
the LIS.
6.1 Critical Values: - Notify the requesting provider immediately for
any results that indicate a significantly increased risk. - Document the
notification, including the date, time, and the person notified.
