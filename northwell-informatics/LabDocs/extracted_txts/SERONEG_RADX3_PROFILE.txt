Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): SERO-NEG RADX3 PROFILE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for analyzing seronegative
rheumatoid arthritis using the RADX3 panel. This protocol ensures
the consistent and accurate generation of results for clinical
diagnostics.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing
tests as per the listed procedure, validating results, and
maintaining quality control.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff trained in seronegative rheumatoid
arthritis diagnosis within the analytical phase of the laboratory.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (set at 37°C)
• Micropipette and tips
• ELISA reader
• RadX3 ELISA kits (stored at 2-8°C)
• Reagents: Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution
• Positive and negative controls (available within the ELISA kit)
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Specimen:
• Acceptable: Serum collected in SST (serum separator tubes) or
red-top tubes. Serum should be separated and stored at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours or frozen at -20°C for long-term storage.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum samples to clot for 30 minutes prior to centrifugation.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500xg for 10 minutes to separate serum.
B. ELISA Plate Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, including microplate strips, to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
• Dilute wash buffer per the manufacturer's instructions.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 μL of each control (positive and negative), standards,
and specimens to the wells in duplicate.
2. Cover plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash the plate 5 times with diluted wash buffer, ensuring
thorough removal of liquid after each wash.
4. Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugated reagent to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 30
minutes.
6. Wash the plate 5 times with diluted wash buffer.
7. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
8. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
D. Reading and Calculation:
• Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader.
• Subtract the OD value of the blank well from all other wells to
obtain corrected absorbance values.
• Generate a standard curve and use it to determine the
concentrations in samples.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of specimens.
• Acceptable controls' values must fall within the manufacturer's
range. If controls are out of range, results are invalid, and assay
should be repeated.
• Document all control values, sample results, and any deviations
from the SOP.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for entering and verifying results
in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Calculate the mean of duplicate values and report the final
concentration of serologic markers as specified by the standard
curve.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Reference specific ranges for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis
markers based on laboratory standards.
• Alert the designated supervisor or on-call clinical pathologist for
any critical values.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that reagent lots are validated, as per the outlined
procedure, prior to use.
• Refer to the RADX3 Profiling kit leaflet for specific reagent
limitations and cross-reactivity.
• Samples should be devoid of fibrin, red blood cells, and other
particulate matter to avoid erroneous results.
