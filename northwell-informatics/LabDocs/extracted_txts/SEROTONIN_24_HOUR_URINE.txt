Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for Serotonin, 24-Hour Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for accurately measuring serotonin
levels in a 24-hour urine sample. The aim is to ensure consistent,
precise, and timely generation and reporting of results, ensuring
adherence to regulatory guidelines and maintaining the integrity of
laboratory operations.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of serotonin in 24-hour urine specimens collected and processed by
the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
compliance with this SOP and address any deviations or issues that
may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 24-hour urine collection in a container with 25 mL of 6N HCl
preservative.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimen should be stored at 2–8°C during collection and until
analysis.
• Specimen is stable for up to 7 days at 2–8°C or for up to 3 months
if frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no preservative.
• Incomplete 24-hour collections or those with significant spillage.
• Specimens without accurate collection start and end times.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
electrochemical detection.
• Centrifuge.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• pH meter.
Reagents:
• Serotonin assay standards.
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water).
• Internal standard solution.
• Extraction reagents (e.g., sulfatase, acid buffer).
Supplies:
• Syringes and filters.
• Vials.
• Disposable gloves and lab coats.
6. PROCEDURE
a) Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen thoroughly.
2. Measure the total volume of the urine collection and record it.
3. Transfer an aliquot (typically 10-15 mL) of the specimen to a
clean container.
4. Adjust the pH of the aliquot to 2–3 using 6N HCl if necessary.
5. Store aliquot at 2–8°C if analysis is not immediately performed.
b) Extraction Procedure:
1. Add the internal standard solution to the urine aliquot.
2. Add extraction reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Mix and incubate the mixture at the recommended temperature
and duration.
4. Centrifuge the mixture to remove any precipitate.
5. Transfer the supernatant into a clean vial for analysis.
c) HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system with the appropriate column and
mobile phase.
2. Inject a known volume of the prepared sample into the HPLC
system.
3. Run the HPLC program according to the established method.
4. Record chromatograms and analyze the retention time and
peak area of serotonin and internal standard.
d) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards of serotonin in the same matrix
as the samples.
2. Perform a calibration curve with each analytical run.
3. Include quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations in each batch.
4. Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the concentration of serotonin in the urine sample
using the calibration curve.
2. Adjust the concentration for the total volume of the 24-hour
urine collection.
3. Express the final result as micrograms (µg) of serotonin per 24
hours.
4. Review and verify the results for accuracy and completeness
before reporting.
5. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review by the designated pathologist.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Perform routine maintenance of the HPLC system as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
2. Document all maintenance activities in the HPLC maintenance
log.
3. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
assay accuracy.
4. Review quality control data regularly to identify trends or issues.
