Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Serotonin in Blood
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides instructions for the analysis of serotonin in
human blood specimens. The goal is to ensure accurate and reliable
measurement of serotonin levels using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection (ECD) or
other appropriate techniques.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to follow this procedure
accurately and ensure the quality and integrity of the results.
Supervisors are responsible for monitoring adherence to the protocol
and implementing any necessary corrective actions.
2. SPECIMENS
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in a lavender-top (EDTA) tube.
Specimen Collection:
• Blood should be collected following standard phlebotomy
techniques.
• Gently invert the tube 8-10 times immediately after collection to
ensure proper mixing of the blood with the anticoagulant.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Samples should be placed on ice immediately after collection.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 2,000-2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at
4°C within 2 hours of collection.
• Plasma should be separated and stored at -20°C or -80°C if not
analyzed immediately.
• All samples must be properly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Samples not received within the specified timeframe or improperly
stored.
• Samples with insufficient volume for analysis.
• Specimens lacking proper labeling or documentation.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV/electrochemical detection
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Freezer (-20°C or -80°C)
Reagents:
• Mobile phase: e.g., phosphate buffer, acetonitrile
• Internal standard: e.g., 5-Hydroxy-N,N-di-alpha-methyltryptamine
standard solution
• Calibrators and controls: Serotonin calibration standards and
quality control samples
• Extraction reagents: e.g., organic solvents such as methanol
Supplies:
• Sample vials for HPLC
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Syringes and filters (for sample preparation)
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare mobile phase according to the HPLC manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Prepare internal standard solution and serotonin calibration
standards as per laboratory inventory control guidelines.
• Prepare extraction reagents.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Pipette an aliquot of plasma (typically 200 µL) into a
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add an equal volume of internal standard solution to the
sample.
4. Vortex mix for 1 minute.
5. Add extraction reagent (e.g., 500 µL of methanol) to the
sample.
6. Vortex mix for 2 minutes to ensure thorough mixing.
7. Centrifuge the mixture at 13,000 RPM for 10 minutes.
8. Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
9. Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen or vacuum
concentrator.
10. Reconstitute the residue in an appropriate volume of mobile
phase (100 µL recommended).
11. Vortex mix and filter the sample through a 0.22 µm filter before
loading onto the HPLC system.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Load the calibration standards, quality control samples, and
prepared plasma samples into the HPLC.
3. Run the HPLC sequence according to laboratory method
parameters.
4. Analyze data and identify serotonin peaks using the appropriate
detection method (e.g., electrochemical detection).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Include quality control samples at low, medium, and high
serotonin concentrations in each analytical batch.
• Ensure results fall within predetermined control ranges before
releasing patient results.
System Suitability and Calibration:
• Verify system suitability by injecting a serotonin calibration
standard five times. The coefficient of variation (%CV) should be
≤2%.
• Perform calibration verification at the beginning and end of each
analytical run.
• Perform routine maintenance on HPLC equipment according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Reporting Results:
• Review all chromatograms for peak integrity and appropriate
retention times.
• Quantify serotonin levels in patient samples using the calibration
curve generated with the standards.
• Report results in ng/mL or the relevant unit according to site-
specific guidelines.
• Ensure all QC samples fall within the expected ranges before
reporting patient results.
6. REFERENCE RANGES
Normal Reference Interval:
• Typically, serotonin levels in plasma: 50-200 ng/mL.
• Reference ranges may vary based on demographic and clinical
factors. Consult laboratory-specific reference intervals.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results.
• Timely and correct sample handling is critical to avoid
degradation.
• Cross-reactivity with other substances may influence results.
Refer to the manufacturer’s guide for detailed limitations.
