1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide clear and detailed instructions
for the analytical phase of generating results for the Serotonin
Release Assay (SRA), Unfractionated Heparin (UFH), using mass
spectrometry, ensuring accurate and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
analyzing serum samples for SRA, UFH using mass spectrometry.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for maintaining and
documenting the necessary quality control measures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any issues that arise.
4. DEFINITIONS
Serotonin Release Assay (SRA): A diagnostic test used to
determine the presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
by measuring serotonin release from platelets.
Unfractionated Heparin (UFH): A blood anticoagulant used to treat
and prevent blood clots.
Mass Spectrometry: An analytical technique used to measure the
mass-to-charge ratio of ions, used in this context for detecting and
quantifying serotonin in serum.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Mass Spectrometer
• Centrifuges
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Reagent containers and standards for serotonin
• Calibrated reagent kit for UFH
• Quality control material
• Serum samples (patient specimens)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Sample Handling and Preparation: a) Serum samples must
be thoroughly mixed and allowed to reach room temperature. b)
Aliquot 1 mL of each patient serum sample into a labeled
microcentrifuge tube. c) Prepare quality control samples and
standards as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Equipment Calibration: a) Calibrate the mass spectrometer
using serotonin standards. b) Ensure the mass spectrometer is
clean and operational as per the instrument's SOP.
B. Analytical Process
1. Serotonin Release Assay Detection: a) Using the mass
spectrometer, inject 10 µL of the serum sample into the system.
b) The mass spectrometer should be set to detect serotonin at
m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) transition for serotonin-specific ions.
c) Record the peak area and retention time for serotonin.
2. Unfractionated Heparin Analysis: a) Use the designated
serotonin standard curve to quantify serotonin released in the
presence of serum. b) Compare results to the established cut-
off values to determine the presence of unfractionated heparin.
3. Quality Control: a) Analyze at least one quality control sample
with every run of patient samples. b) Record results for quality
control and ensure they fall within the acceptable range. c)
Recalibrate the instrument if QC results do not meet criteria.
C. Post-Analytical Activities
1. Data Analysis: a) Utilize the software associated with the mass
spectrometer to quantify results. b) Ensure all data is correctly
logged and saved on both instrument and LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
2. Result Interpretation and Reporting: a) Results must be
interpreted according to laboratory standards and reference
intervals. b) Results must be reviewed and verified by a
designated technologist before releasing to the LIS.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Follow the internal quality control procedures at the beginning
and end of each analytical batch.
2. Perform routine maintenance on the mass spectrometer as
outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Document all performed maintenance and any encountered
issues in the maintenance log.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Instrument Error: Refer to the instrument's troubleshooting
guide. If unresolved, contact the instrument's technical support.
• Sample Error: If sample volume is insufficient or quality is
compromised, request a new sample.
9. SAFETY
• Follow all safety protocols and wear appropriate PPE during
sample analysis.
• Dispose of biological waste and sharps according to the
laboratory’s safety guidelines.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the mass spectrometer.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for SRA and UFH analysis.
Ensure that all laboratory staff receives training on this SOP and
acknowledge understanding and adherence. This protocol is subject
to regular review and updates to comply with the latest regulations
and technological advancements.
