Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Serotonin, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures
for generating accurate and precise results of serotonin in
serum samples. This procedure ensures all testing is carried
out in a consistent manner, achieving reliable and dependable
outcomes.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the serotonin analysis as per this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure compliance with
this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood into a plain red-top tube. No additives should be
used.
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge for
10-15 minutes at 1500xg to separate the serum.
• Aliquot at least 1 mL of serum into a clean, appropriately labeled
plastic vial.
Specimen Stability:
• Samples should be kept at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed
within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Samples collected in tubes containing gel or clot activators.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) system with
fluorescence detection or LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry) system.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents:
• Serotonin standards.
• Mobile phase reagents.
• Internal standard for calibration.
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high).
Supplies:
• Autosampler vials.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Serological pipettes.
• Centrifuge tubes.
1. PROCEDURE:
Serum Preparation:
• Thaw the serum samples if previously frozen and mix thoroughly
by gentle inversion.
• Vortex the sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
• Centrifuge the serum at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
Preparation of Standards and Controls:
• Prepare a series of calibration standards at concentrations that
encompass the expected range of serotonin in patient samples.
• Include quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations of serotonin.
HPLC/LC-MS/MS Operation:
1. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system using the
serotonin standards according to the manufacturer's
instructions for quantitative analysis.
◦ Ensure that the calibration curve has an acceptable
correlation coefficient (r² ≥ 0.990).
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Inject the prepared serum samples, serotonin standards,
and quality control substances into the HPLC/LC-MS/MS
system.
◦ Run the samples under the predetermined chromatographic
conditions.
◦ Monitor the system for consistent retention times and peak
shapes.
Data Evaluation:
• Compare the peak area/height of the unknown samples against
the calibration curve to determine the serotonin concentration.
• Ensure that all quality controls are within predetermined
acceptable ranges before validating the patient results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Analyze quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each batch.
• Evaluate the quality control results to confirm that they fall within
acceptable ranges.
• If quality control results are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and resolve issues before continuing with patient
sample analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Ensure that specific comments are added for any samples with
potential integrity issues or deviations.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals for serotonin in serum should be determined
by the laboratory based on the method validation or as per
established clinical guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Check the manufacturer's insert or guidelines for specific
limitations regarding the matrix effect, interference, cross-
reactivity, and the linearity range for serotonin quantification.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including appropriate
PPE (personal protective equipment) and biosafety practices.
• Handle all biohazardous materials in a Class II biosafety cabinet.
• Dispose of all waste materials in compliance with local and
federal regulations.

• Manufacturer's guidelines and insert for HPLC/LC-MS/MS
systems.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
method validation and quality control in clinical chemistry.
This SOP must be reviewed annually or when changes to the method
or instruments are made. All laboratory personnel must be trained on
this SOP before performing serotonin, serum analysis.
