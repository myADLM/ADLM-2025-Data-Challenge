Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
SERPINA1 GENE, FULL GENE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed procedures for
performing SERPINA1 full gene analysis, including preparation,
execution, and result generation. This ensures accurate and
consistent detection of variants in the SERPINA1 gene.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for carrying out the SERPINA1
full gene analysis as outlined in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to follow protocols and bring any
deviations or issues to the attention of the supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring proper execution of the
protocol and addressing any issues that may compromise the
quality of the analysis.
2. SAMPLE SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types:
• Preferred: Peripheral blood in EDTA tubes.
• Alternate: Buccal swabs or saliva samples.
Stability:
• Peripheral blood: Stable for up to 5 days at 4°C.
• Buccal swabs or saliva: Stable for up to 7 days at room
temperature.
Acceptance Criteria:
• Specimens should be properly labeled with patient identifiers.
• Specimens should arrive at the laboratory within the specified
stability period and be free from contamination or hemolysis.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Required Equipment:
• Thermocycler for PCR amplification.
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus.
• Standard centrifuge.
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer for DNA quantification.
• Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion
Torrent).
Required Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit (validated for the specimen type).
• PCR master mix.
• SERPINA1 gene-specific primers.
• Agarose gel and electrophoresis reagents.
• Library preparation kit for NGS.
• Sequencing reagents (e.g., nucleotides, buffers).
• Quality control reagents.
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from the specimen using the DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
3. Store DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR amplification.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix containing DNA template, primers for
each exon of SERPINA1, nucleotides, and polymerase.
2. Load the reaction mix into the thermocycler and run the PCR
program as specified:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes.
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Annealing: 55-65°C (depending on primer specificity) for
30 seconds.
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
3. Verify PCR amplification by running an aliquot on agarose gel
electrophoresis.
C. NGS Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Prepare DNA libraries using the library preparation kit according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify and normalize the libraries to the required
concentration.
3. Load the libraries onto the NGS platform and run the
sequencing according to standard protocols.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Transfer sequencing data to bioinformatics software for
analysis.
2. Align sequenced reads to the SERPINA1 reference genome.
3. Identify and annotate variants using the bioinformatics pipeline.
4. Review the variant calls and assess their clinical significance
according to established databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
E. Result Generation and Reporting:
1. Compile and review the annotated variants.
2. Interpret the clinical significance of identified variants.
3. Generate a detailed report including:
◦ Patient information.
◦ Methodology.
◦ Variants detected.
◦ Clinical interpretation.
◦ Recommendations for patient management based on
results.
4. Review and verify the report by the designated technologist.
5. Submit the report to the referring physician.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control tests on each batch of DNA extraction,
PCR amplification, and sequencing.
• Use positive and negative controls to validate each step.
• Document and review quality control results regularly.
• Address any deviations in quality control promptly.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that specimen collection, storage, and transport conditions
are strictly adhered to for accurate results.
• Acknowledge potential limitations in detecting certain variants due
to technical constraints and inform the referring physician
accordingly.
