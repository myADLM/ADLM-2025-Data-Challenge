Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Sertraline (Zoloft) and Desmethylsertraline
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the quantification of Sertraline
(Zoloft) and its primary metabolite Desmethylsertraline in human
serum or plasma by analytical instrumentation. This procedure aims
to ensure precise, accurate, and reproducible results for clinical
assessment.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to trained laboratory personnel responsible for
the analysis of Sertraline (Zoloft) and Desmethylsertraline in human
serum or plasma samples within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Proper execution of this SOP.
• Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the test results.
• Reporting any non-conformities to the laboratory supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for:
• Ensuring laboratory personnel are trained and compliant with this
SOP.
• Addressing any issues or non-conformities that may arise during
the procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
Sertraline (Zoloft):
• A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for the
treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental
health conditions.
Desmethylsertraline:
• The primary metabolite of Sertraline, possessing similar
pharmacological activity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Type:
• Human serum or plasma.
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood samples in vacutainer tubes containing EDTA or
heparin.
• Serum or plasma should be separated from the cells within 2
hours of collection.
Storage:
• Store serum or plasma samples at -20°C or lower if analysis is not
performed immediately.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents:
• HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol, water).
• Analytical standards of Sertraline and Desmethylsertraline.
• Internal standard (e.g., Deuterated Sertraline, D3-Sertraline).
• Mobile phase components as per the method development.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use commercially available quality control (QC) materials at
multiple concentration levels.
• Prepare calibration standards and QC samples in the same matrix
as patient samples.
• Analyze QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each
analytical run.
• Results must fall within acceptable predefined criteria. Investigate
and reanalyze any QC failures.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control Samples:
1. Prepare a series of calibration standards ranging from the lower
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) to the upper limit of quantitation
(ULOQ) using stock solutions of Sertraline and
Desmethylsertraline.
2. Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations.
3. Add internal standard to each calibration standard, QC sample,
and patient sample.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw the sample at room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample for 30 seconds.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 2500 x g for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer a specified volume (e.g., 200 µL) of serum or plasma
to a labeled clean tube.
5. Add organic solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) containing the internal
standard to precipitate proteins.
6. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for
10 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to an HPLC or LC-MS/MS sample vial.
C. Instrument Setup and Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform system suitability tests as stipulated in the method
validation protocol, ensuring the system is operating within
acceptable performance criteria.
3. Load the calibration standards, QC samples, and patient
samples into the auto-sampler.
4. Set the instrument to run the predefined method for Sertraline
and Desmethylsertraline analysis.
5. Ensure the correct mobile phase gradient and flow rates are
being used.
6. Start the sample run.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the data using the validated method. Ensure
integration parameters are appropriately set.
2. Quantify the concentrations of Sertraline and
Desmethylsertraline using the calibration curve.
3. Review the QC results to ensure method performance criteria
are met.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify and cross-check calculated concentrations of Sertraline
and Desmethylsertraline.
6. Document any comments or discrepancies noted during
analysis.
7. Report results in accordance with the laboratory reporting
guidelines and ensure critical values are communicated
promptly to the requesting healthcare provider.
