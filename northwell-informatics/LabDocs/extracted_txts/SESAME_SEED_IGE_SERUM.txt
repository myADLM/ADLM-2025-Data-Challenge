PROTOCOL FOR GENERATING RESULTS FOR SESAME SEED,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the identification and
quantification of IgE antibodies specific to sesame seed in a serum
sample. Ensuring accuracy and consistency in results for clinical
diagnostics.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum collected by venipuncture.
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimen must be refrigerated if testing is not performed
immediately.
• Specimen should be tested within 7 days if stored at 2-8°C or can
be stored frozen at -20°C or below for up to 30 days.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens may produce erroneous
results.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate,
EDTA, or heparin tubes.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit specific for
sesame seed IgE
• Automated ELISA processor (if applicable)
• Microplate reader with 450 nm filter and reference wavelength of
620-650 nm
• Disposable pipette tips
• Calibrated micropipettes (10 µL, 100 µL, 1000 µL)
• Reagent reservoir
• Wash buffer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Deionized water
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative control sera included in the ELISA kit.
• Run controls with each batch of patient tests.
• Acceptable control ranges must be established from kit insert or
internal validation data.
• Lot-to-lot validations for consistency using established quality
control measures.
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation
◦ Ensure all reagents and samples are equilibrated to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
◦ Label the microplate wells as per the number of samples
and controls.
2. Serum Dilution
◦ Dilute serum samples at a 1:10 ratio with sample diluent
(e.g., add 10 µL serum to 90 µL sample diluent).
3. Assay Setup
◦ Pipette 100 µL of diluted serum sample, controls, and
calibrators into respective designated wells.
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Washing
◦ Aspirate and discard the contents of the wells.
◦ Wash each well 3 times with 300 µL wash buffer.
◦ Completely remove residual liquid by tapping the plate on
absorbent paper after the last wash.
5. Conjugate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Second Wash
◦ Label all wells of the microplate as per the number of
samples and controls.
7. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate for 15-20 minutes at room
temperature in the dark.
8. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ Mix by gently tapping the plate.
9. Reading
◦ Read the optical density at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620-650 nm within 30 minutes of stopping the
reaction.
6. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the average absorbance values for duplicate controls
and patient samples.
• Create a standard curve by plotting the average absorbance of
the calibrators against their respective sesame seed IgE
concentrations.
• Use the standard curve to determine the sesame seed IgE
concentration in patient samples.
• Results expressed in kU/L (kilounits per liter).
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results to the nearest decimal place.
• Flag results that are above or below the detection limit of the
assay.
• Include interpretive comments based on clinical relevance where
applicable.
8. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform routine maintenance as specified by the ELISA kit
manufacturer.
• Recalibrate equipment regularly and monitor for drift.
• Document all maintenance activities and corrective actions taken.
