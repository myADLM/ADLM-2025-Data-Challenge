Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase procedures
for the generation of results for the SESAME SEED, IGE, WITH
REFLEX TO SESAME SEED COMPONENT, IGE, SERUM test. This
procedure ensures accurate measurement of IgE specific to sesame
seeds and reflexes to sesame seed component testing if required.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel including medical laboratory
scientists and technicians are responsible for performing and
documenting the analytical procedures outlined in this SOP.
All laboratory personnel must ensure adherence to this procedure
and bring any deficiencies or deviations to the attention of a
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
SESAME SEED, IGE: Measurement of immunoglobulin E antibodies
specific to sesame seeds present in the serum.
SESAME SEED COMPONENT, IGE: Further analysis of specific
sesame seed components (e.g., Ses i 1, Ses i 2) if initial IgE test is
positive.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
1. Equipment:
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerators and freezers for storage of reagents and
samples
2. Reagents:
◦ Sesame seed-specific IgE assay kit
◦ Sesame seed component-specific IgE assay kit
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Traceable thermometer for equipment temperature
monitoring
3. Supplies:
◦ Serum tubes (red or yellow top)
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Temperature monitoring log sheet
◦ Data recording software/Laboratory Information System
(LIS)
B. Preliminary Steps:
1. Verify the specimen:
◦ Confirm specimen number and patient's details against
provided requisition form.
◦ Check for the presence of serum in the tube; minimum
required volume is 0.5 mL.
◦ Ensure specimen integrity (no hemolysis, no clotting).
2. Storage:
◦ Store serum at 2 - 8°C until ready for analysis.
◦ Ensure samples are stored in accordance with regulatory
guidelines and manufacturer’s instructions.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Preparing the Analyzer:
◦ Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure calibration of the equipment is up-to-date.
◦ Perform daily and routine maintenance checks.
2. Testing SESAME SEED, IGE:
◦ Load the serum sample onto the analyzer.
◦ Select the SESAME SEED, IGE test from the assay menu.
◦ Add necessary reagents according to the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Start the assay and allow the analyzer to complete the
testing.
◦ Verify the analyzer’s result and ensure it falls within the
standard reference intervals.
3. Reflex Testing for SESAME SEED COMPONENTS, IGE:
◦ If SESAME SEED, IGE result is positive, proceed with reflex
testing.
◦ Ensure the serum volume is adequate for component
testing.
◦ Load the sample and select SESAME SEED
COMPONENTS, IGE test from the assay menu.
◦ Follow the kit's specific instructions for each component.
◦ Verify results for each component tested.
D. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control testing using both positive and negative
controls at the beginning of each batch run.
2. Document the QC results and compare against established
limits.
3. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and rerun the
controls before testing patient samples.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Review results generated by the analyzer and check data
integrity.
2. Validate results in the LIS and ensure reflex testing results are
linked properly.
3. Critical results must be communicated to the physician
immediately according to laboratory protocol.
4. Enter final results into the patient’s electronic medical record
system for physician review.
F. Documentation and Record Keeping:
1. Maintain equipment temperature logs as outlined in the
Temperature Monitoring SOP.
2. Record all analytical and QC results in the appropriate logs.
3. Ensure all assay kit lot numbers and expiration dates are
documented.
4. REFERENCES
Refer to assay kit instructions and manufacturer guidelines for
SESAME SEED, IGE and SESAME SEED COMPONENT, IGE
testing procedures.
1. NOTES
• Critical results pertaining to patient health must be handled as per
laboratory protocol on critical values.
• Ensure all steps are performed following CLIA regulations and
local laboratory policies.
This SOP is reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
incorporate new guidelines or equipment updates.
