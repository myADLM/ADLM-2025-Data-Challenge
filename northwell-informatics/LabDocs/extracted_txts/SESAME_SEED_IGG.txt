Standard Operating Procedure for SESAME SEED IGG Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the measurement and
reporting of Sesame Seed IgG in patient serum specimens.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to carry
out Sesame Seed IgG analysis according to the following SOP and to
ensure accurate and reliable results are generated and documented
accordingly.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all personnel responsible for the testing and
analysis of Sesame Seed IgG levels in serum specimens within the
laboratory.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
3.1 Equipment
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Micropipettes (10 μL, 100 μL, 1000 μL)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
3.2 Reagents
• Sesame Seed IgG ELISA kit (ensure to check expiry date before
use)
• Calibrated standards and controls provided with the ELISA kit
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Deionized or distilled water
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Specimen types and collection
• Preferable specimen: Serum
• Collect a minimum of 5 mL of blood in a red-top serum tube.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the clotted blood at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Aliquot serum into a labeled tube.
4.2 Specimen storage and stability
• Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, serum specimens should be frozen at
-20°C.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation of reagents and specimens
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
• Prepare wash buffer according to ELISA kit instructions.
• Label microplate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples.
• Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 with sample diluent (follow kit
instructions).
5.2 Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 μL of each standard, control, and diluted patient
sample to the designated wells.
2. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash the microplate 4 times with 300 μL of wash buffer per
well.
4. Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the microplate 4 times with 300 μL of wash buffer per
well.
7. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the microplate at room temperature for 15 minutes in
the dark.
9. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
10. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader.
6. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Create a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of the
standards against their concentrations.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of Sesame
Seed IgG in the patient samples by finding the corresponding
absorbance values.
• Report the Sesame Seed IgG values in IU/mL.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls provided with the ELISA kit
in each run.
• The controls must fall within the acceptable range provided by the
kit instructions.
• If the controls are out of range, suspect a procedure error or
reagent issue and investigate before processing patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before releasing them.
• Notify the attending physician immediately of any critical results
according to the laboratory’s critical value policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for Sesame Seed IgG will be provided in the
ELISA kit insert and should be confirmed periodically based on
clinical practice and evidence.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, gross lipemia, or microbial contamination may affect
the results.
• Specimens that are not properly stored may yield inaccurate
results.
• For detailed assay limitations, refer to the ELISA kit insert.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for Sesame Seed IgG ELISA
kit.
• Laboratory guidelines and accreditation standards.
12. REVIEW
• This protocol is to be reviewed annually or as needed based on
equipment, reagent updates, or procedural changes.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and accurate
results for Sesame Seed IgG analysis, upholding the quality and
reliability of its testing processes.
