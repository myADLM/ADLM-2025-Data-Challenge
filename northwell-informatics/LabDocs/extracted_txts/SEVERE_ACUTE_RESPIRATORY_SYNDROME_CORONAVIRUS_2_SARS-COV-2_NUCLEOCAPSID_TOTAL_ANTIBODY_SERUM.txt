1. PURPOSE
To provide consistent and accurate results for testing the presence of
total antibodies to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid protein in serum
samples. This protocol outlines the analytical phase of generating
results and ensures adherence to quality control measures.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
the tests, quality control, and documentation as specified in this
procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and for addressing any issues that arise during testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader or chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)
analyzer
• Serum samples
• Controls: Positive and negative quality control materials
• Calibrators
• Sample diluent
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution (if applicable)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Specimen collection and handling:
◦ Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-top tube.
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum from
cellular components.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled storage tube.
◦ Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
long-term storage, keep samples at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures beyond the
recommended stability period.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Bring all specimens, controls, calibrators, and reagents to
room temperature before use.
◦ Ensure that all instruments and equipment are properly
calibrated and maintained.
3. Loading the samples:
◦ Load the required number of standards, controls, and
patient serum samples into the designated wells or positions
on the analyzer.
◦ Add the appropriate amount of sample diluent to each well,
as specified in the reagent manufacturer's instructions.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plates or tubes for a specified period at room
temperature (20-25°C) or as required by the assay protocol.
◦ Follow the specific incubation time recommended by the
assay kit instructions.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells or tubes with the designated wash buffer to
remove unbound substances.
◦ Perform washing steps as per the manufacturer's
instructions to ensure thorough cleaning.
6. Detection:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well or tube and incubate
for the specified duration.
◦ If using a microplate reader, measure the absorbance at the
specified wavelength.
◦ If using a CLIA analyzer, follow the instrument protocol to
detect and read the chemiluminescence signal.
7. Stopping the reaction (if applicable):
◦ Add the stop solution to each well or tube to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
◦ Measure the absorbance or luminescence as required by
the assay protocol.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure assay performance.
• Calibrators should be included in each run to generate a standard
curve for quantification.
• Document all quality control results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
• Investigate and resolve any quality control failures before
proceeding with the analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the data generated by the assay for each patient sample.
• Use the standard curve or instrument software to determine the
concentration or presence of SARS-CoV-2 total antibody in each
sample.
• Verify the results by comparing them to the quality control data.
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) or
manually document them on the appropriate reporting forms.
• Follow laboratory-specific guidelines for reporting critical values
and unusual results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals may vary based on the assay kit and
population studied. Refer to assay-specific instructions for
interpretation guidelines.
• In general, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies indicates
exposure to the virus or vaccination, while a negative result
suggests no detectable antibodies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific assay
limitations, including potential cross-reactivity and interferences.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical
presentation and other diagnostic tests.

antibody testing.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Documentation of any changes to the SOP, including the date of
revision and a description of updates made.
By following this comprehensive SOP, the laboratory ensures
accurate and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies in
serum samples, contributing to the effective monitoring and
management of the COVID-19 pandemic.
