Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): SARS-CoV-2 RNA
Detection via Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) in Tissue Specimens
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tissue specimens using Droplet Digital
PCR (ddPCR). This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and timely
laboratory results that are critical for diagnosing severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel engaged in performing
ddPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tissue specimens within a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel must adhere to the procedures
outlined in this protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure staff are adequately trained and comply with
these procedures.
4. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
samples.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or without collection date/
time.
• Specimens that show signs of significant decomposition or
contamination.
• FFPE blocks that have not been properly fixed and embedded.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Droplet Digital PCR system (ddPCR)
• Tissue homogenizer or microdissection tools
• RNA extraction kits compatible with ddPCR
• Reverse Transcription reagents (if RNA extraction does not
include this step)
• SARS-CoV-2 specific primers and probes for ddPCR
• PCR consumables (e.g., plates, tubes, caps)
• Nuclease-free water
• Calibration and control samples
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
1. Homogenization:
◦ Fresh/Frozen Tissue: Homogenize using appropriate tools
(e.g., tissue homogenizer) to break down the tissue.
◦ FFPE Tissue: Carefully microdissect sections from the
tissue block, ensuring accurate representation of the
specimen.
2. RNA Extraction:
◦ Extract RNA from homogenized tissue using an established
RNA extraction protocol suitable for ddPCR.
6.2. Reverse Transcription (if necessary)
• Convert extracted RNA to cDNA using species-specific reverse
transcription reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, if RNA extraction does not already include this step.
6.3. ddPCR Assay Setup
1. Prepare the ddPCR reaction mixture, including:
◦ cDNA template
◦ SARS-CoV-2 specific primers and probes
◦ ddPCR Master Mix
◦ Nuclease-free water to reach the final reaction volume
2. Load the reaction mixture into the appropriate ddPCR
consumables (e.g., wells or cartridge).
6.4. Droplet Generation and PCR Cycling
1. Use a droplet generator to partition the reaction mix into
nanoliter-volume droplets.
2. Transfer the droplets into a ddPCR plate/tube and seal
securely.
3. Perform PCR cycling according to SARS-CoV-2 specific ddPCR
protocol.
6.5. Droplet Reading
1. Place the PCR plate/tube into the ddPCR reader and initiate
droplet reading.
2. Collect and analyze ddPCR results using dedicated software.
6.6. Quality Control
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run. A positive
control contains SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and a negative control
includes all reagents except the RNA template.
• Analyze control results to validate the run.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
For issues like no signal, low signal, or unexpected signal:
1. Verify specimen integrity and RNA quality.
2. Check reagent volumes and concentrations.
3. Confirm instrument settings and calibration.
4. Repeat the assay with fresh reagents if necessary.
5. Contact a supervisor for persistent problems.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and verify all results before reporting:
1. Document results according to site-specific guidelines.
2. Report critical results immediately to the ordering physician.
3. For inconclusive results, recommend repeat testing or
alternative methods.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Primary outcome is qualitative detection (Positive/Negative) for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in analyzed tissue.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific limitations in ddPCR kit inserts regarding sensitivity,
specificity, and potential interferences.
