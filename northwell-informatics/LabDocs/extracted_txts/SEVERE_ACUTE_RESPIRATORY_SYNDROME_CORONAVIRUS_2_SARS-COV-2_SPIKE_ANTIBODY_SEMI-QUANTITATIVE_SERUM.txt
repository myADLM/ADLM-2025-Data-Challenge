1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the semi-quantitative detection of spike
protein antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in serum samples, to assess immune
response post-infection or post-vaccination.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedures outlined in this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: 1-2 mL of serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C): 30 days
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
• Specimens with non-serum additives (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibody test kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to the test kit
• Automated immunoassay analyzer suitable for the assay (e.g.,
Roche Cobas, Abbott Architect)
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other PPE
• Documentation logs
1. PROCEDURE
A. Reagent Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare reagent reservoirs as per manufacturer's instructions.
3. Load reagents into the analyzer according to the analyzer-
specific protocol.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure specimens are properly identified and match the test
requisitions.
2. Centrifuge SST tubes at 1300-2000 RCF for 10-15 minutes.
3. Aliquot the clear serum into appropriately labeled secondary
tubes if necessary.
C. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration using the kit-provided calibrators as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Document calibration results in the calibration log.
3. Ensure calibration passes all acceptance criteria before
proceeding.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run negative and positive controls provided in the test kit.
2. Document QC results in the QC log.
3. Proceed with sample testing only if QC results are within
acceptable ranges.
E. Sample Testing:
1. Place serum samples in the sample rack or carousel of the
analyzer.
2. Load the test method for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibody
on the analyzer.
3. Start the run and monitor the analyzer for any errors or flags.
4. Ensure all samples are tested within the stability timeframe.
5. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
A. Data Analysis:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Compare the results to the reference intervals and acceptable
ranges provided by the test kit.
3. Utilize standard QC procedures to determine the validity of
results.
B. Result Reporting:
1. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a technologist.
3. Report any critical or ambiguous results to the supervising
clinician as per standard laboratory policy.
C. Documentation:
1. Document all calibration, control, and test results in accordance
with laboratory SOPs.
2. Maintain clear and complete records for traceability and
compliance.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
A. If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range,:
1. Verify the accuracy of reagent preparation and assay setup.
2. Repeat calibration and re-run control assays.
3. If the issue persists, consult the analyzer or reagent
manufacturer’s technical support.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Interpretation of results should be consistent with the reference
ranges provided by the test kit’s manufacturer.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) or package insert for the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibody test kit.
• Instrument manual for the automated immunoassay analyzer in
use.
1. REVISION AND REVIEW
• This SOP must be reviewed annually or when significant changes
to the methodology occur.
• Document any changes and maintain a version log.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results for the semi-quantitative detection of SARS-
CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibodies in serum. All personnel must adhere
strictly to the guidelines and procedures detailed to maintain the
integrity and quality of the testing process.
