Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and
Influenza Virus Type A and Type B RNA, Molecular Detection,
PCR
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the molecular detection of
SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Virus Type A and Type B RNA using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This procedure ensures accurate
and timely generation of results for clinical diagnosis and
management.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel trained in
molecular diagnostics and responsible for performing PCR assays in
the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Staff: Perform PCR testing as per this SOP, ensuring
adherence to all steps to maintain result accuracy and reliability.
• Supervisors: Oversee PCR testing, address any issues that
arise, and ensure compliance with SOP and regulatory guidelines.
4. DEFINITIONS
• PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A molecular technique used
to amplify and detect specific RNA sequences.
• SARS-CoV-2: The virus causing COVID-19.
• Influenza Virus Type A and B: Viruses causing seasonal flu.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimens:
◦ Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in viral transport
media.
◦ Nasal swabs or nasal washes/aspirates in viral transport
media.
◦ Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspirates in sterile
containers.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens not collected in appropriate transport media.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume.
◦ Specimens that are leaking or improperly labeled.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ PCR Thermocycler
◦ Biosafety cabinet (BSC)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and filtered tips
• Reagents:
◦ Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit)
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ Target-specific primers and probes
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive and negative control materials
7. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE and work in a BSC to prepare
samples.
◦ Label extraction tubes and prepare all necessary reagents.
2. Extraction:
◦ Add sample to the extraction buffer, following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Vortex and centrifuge tubes as needed.
◦ Perform RNA extraction using the kit’s protocol, ensuring no
cross-contamination.
B. PCR Setup
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the assay
protocol.
◦ Add target-specific primers and probes to the master mix.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into labeled PCR tubes/plates.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add extracted RNA to each PCR tube/plate, ensuring proper
mixing.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
3. Amplification:
◦ Load PCR tubes/plates into the thermocycler.
◦ Run the PCR program as specified in the assay protocol.
C. Detection and Interpretation
1. Post-Amplification:
◦ Monitor the thermocycler for completion of the PCR run.
◦ Examine amplification plots and cycle threshold (Ct) values.
2. Result Analysis:
◦ Interpret results based on Ct values and the presence/
absence of fluorescence signals:
▪ Positive Result: Ct value below the threshold for the
target virus.
▪ Negative Result: No amplification signal within the
specified number of cycles.
▪ Invalid Result: Inconsistent signals or failure of internal
controls.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that positive and negative controls performed as
expected.
◦ Repeat any test with invalid or ambiguous results.
D. Reporting Results
1. Documentation and Verification:
◦ Record all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Report any critical results (e.g., positive for SARS-CoV-2 or
Influenza) immediately to the clinical team according to
laboratory policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing as required by regulatory
agencies.
• Ensure proper maintenance and calibration of all equipment used
in the testing process.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on
updates in guidelines, technology, or regulatory requirements.
• Any revisions will be documented, and staff will be trained on
changes before implementation.
