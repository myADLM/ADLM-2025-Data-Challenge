Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2,
Influenza Virus Type A and Type B RNA, and Respiratory Syncytial
Virus (RSV) Using PCR
1. PURPOSE To establish and document the procedure for the
analytical phase of molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2,
Influenza Virus Type A and Type B RNA, and Respiratory
Syncytial Virus (RSV) using PCR for the purpose of accurate
diagnosis and timely reporting of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay and documenting the results.
• Supervisors ensure adherence to the protocol and address any
analytical issues.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory staff who are
trained and authorized to perform molecular diagnostic testing
for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza Virus Type A and B, and RSV using
PCR methods.
2. DEFINITIONS
• SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
• Influenza Virus Type A and B: Influenza virus strains responsible
for seasonal flu epidemics
• RSV: Respiratory Syncytial Virus
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
and detect specific genetic material
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR workstation
• Real-Time PCR Instrument (e.g., Thermo Fisher QuantStudio,
BioRad CFX96)
• PCR reagents and Master Mix kits specific for SARS-CoV-2,
Influenza A/B, and RSV
• Nuclease-free water
• Micropipettes and pipette tips (aerosol-resistant)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, goggles
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
1. REAGENTS AND CONSUMABLES
• Viral RNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit)
• PCR Master Mix
• Specific primers and probes for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B, and
RSV
• Positive and negative controls
• PCR-grade nuclease-free water
• 96-well PCR Plates or PCR tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A) RNA EXTRACTION
1. Perform RNA extraction from received clinical samples using a
designated viral RNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Elute RNA in nuclease-free water, aliquot, and store at -80°C if
not immediately used.
B) PCR REACTION SETUP
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice before use.
2. Prepare the PCR Master Mix as per the kit instructions.
3. In a biosafety cabinet, aliquot the Master Mix into the PCR
reaction plate or tubes.
4. Add extracted RNA samples (5-10 µL) to the corresponding
wells or tubes.
5. Include positive controls (known positive RNA) and negative
controls (nuclease-free water) in each PCR run.
6. Seal the PCR plate/tubes and briefly centrifuge to remove air
bubbles.
C) PCR AMPLIFICATION AND DETECTION
1. Place the PCR reaction plate/tubes into the Real-Time PCR
Instrument.
2. Program the instrument with the appropriate cycling conditions
specific to each virus, as per the manufacturer’s instructions
(e.g., initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds and annealing/
extension at 60°C for 1 minute).
3. Start the run and monitor for any instrument alerts or errors.
D) INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Upon completion, analyze the amplification plots for the
presence of target RNA in clinical samples.
2. Use the provided software to interpret the results based on the
Ct (threshold cycle) values.
3. Positive Result: A sample is considered positive if the target
RNA is amplified above the threshold within the specified cycle
number (Ct ≤ 38).
4. Negative Result: A sample is considered negative if no
amplification curve is detected or if the Ct value is greater than
38.
5. Ensure that positive and negative controls produced the
expected results (positive control should amplify, negative
control should not amplify).
E) REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Negative results should be verified twice before being reported.
3. Critical Results: Alert the supervisor immediately if positive
results for SARS-CoV-2 or any specific requirements are
indicated by the physician (e.g., for high-risk patients).
4. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for results
documentation and communication.
5. QUALITY CONTROL A. Ensure that appropriate controls are
included in each PCR run:
◦ Positive control: Verifies the master mix and primer/probe
performance.
◦ Negative control: Checks for contamination. B. Perform
monthly intra-lab quality checks and biennial inter-lab
comparisons. C. Document all quality control processes and
any deviations from expected results in the lab’s QA/QC log.
