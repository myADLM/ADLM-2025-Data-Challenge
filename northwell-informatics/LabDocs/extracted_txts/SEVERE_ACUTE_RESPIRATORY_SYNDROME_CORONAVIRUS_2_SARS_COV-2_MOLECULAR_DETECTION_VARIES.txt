Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Molecular Detection
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the molecular detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in collected specimens using PCR-based methodology.
The aim is to ensure accurate and reliable results for the diagnosis of
COVID-19.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing in the
designated laboratory area.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory staff are responsible for following this protocol
accurately and documenting all steps appropriately.
• Supervisors are tasked with ensuring that all staff members are
trained and competent in the procedure and with addressing any
deviations or issues that arise.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• RNA extraction kits
• SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kits
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control
• Negative control
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, face
shield/mask
• PCR tubes/plates
• Specimen transport medium
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Nasopharyngeal swab collected in viral
transport medium (VTM).
• Acceptable Alternative Specimens: Oropharyngeal swab, nasal
swab, saliva, and sputum.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are not properly
labeled, leaked during transport, or not stored under required
conditions prior to testing.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Verify that all necessary equipment and consumables are
available and functioning properly.
2. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens and
reagents.
3. Ensure that all instruments and work surfaces are cleaned and
decontaminated.
4. Review the specimens' accompanying documentation.
B. RNA Extraction
1. Sample Verification:
◦ Confirm that the specimen is acceptable for testing based
on the criteria defined above.
2. Extraction Set-up:
◦ Assemble the RNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer’s insert.
◦ Transfer the required volume of specimen into the extraction
tubes while avoiding any contamination.
◦ Perform the extraction protocol as outlined by the extraction
kit, ensuring all steps are followed precisely.
◦ Elute the RNA in the appropriate solution and store it on ice
until ready for RT-PCR setup.
C. RT-PCR Set-up
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the master mix according to kit instructions,
including primers/probes, reaction buffers, and enzyme mix.
◦ Mix through gentle vortexing and brief centrifugation.
2. Template Addition:
◦ Aliquot the master mix into each PCR tube or well of a PCR
plate.
◦ Add extracted RNA template, positive control, negative
control, and nontemplate control (NTC) to the designated
wells.
◦ Seal the wells with appropriate covers to prevent
evaporation and contamination.
D. PCR Amplification
1. Instrument Set-up:
◦ Load the PCR tubes or plates into the real-time PCR
instrument.
◦ Program the thermal cycler according to the SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR kit instructions.
◦ Verify that the correct detection channels are selected for
real-time fluorescence monitoring.
2. Run the RT-PCR:
◦ Start the run and monitor for any errors or anomalies during
the amplification.
◦ Once completed, save and print the PCR run file including
the amplification curves and Ct values for all samples.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
1. Analysis:
◦ Review the amplification curves and Ct values. Confirm that
positive and negative controls are within expected
parameters.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret results based on Ct values:
▪ Positive: Ct value ≤ the cut-off value defined by the kit.
▪ Negative: No Ct value or Ct value > cut-off indicating no
detectable viral RNA.
▪ Invalid: Presence of Ct signal in negative control or
absence in positive control, indicating a test anomaly.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Ensure each run includes both positive and negative RNA
controls.
◦ Execute a reagent and equipment validation check before
analysis.
2. External Quality Assessment:
◦ Participate in an external proficiency testing program
periodically.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. Results should be
reviewed and verified by a licensed technologist before release into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Document all steps, results, and any deviations in the appropriate
logbook. Maintain records in accordance with CLIA regulations and
laboratory policy.
