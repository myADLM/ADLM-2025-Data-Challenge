Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Severe Combined
Immunodeficiency (SCID) Gene Panel
Effective Date: [Insert Date] Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to establish the
analytical procedures for generating and reporting results for the
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) gene panel. This
includes the extraction of DNA, amplification of target genes,
sequencing, data analysis, and interpretation to identify genetic
variants associated with SCID.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all aspects of the analytical procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
protocol adherence, and addressing any issues encountered
during the procedure.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the analysis of the SCID gene panel. It covers the steps from DNA
extraction to data reporting.

• PCR reagents: [Specify Brand/Model]
• Thermal cycler: [Specify Brand/Model]
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) system: [Specify Brand/
Model]
• Bioinformatics software: [Specify Software]
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. DNA Extraction
• Ensure that all specimens have been properly accessioned and
labeled.
• Extract DNA from the patient sample using the specified DNA
extraction kit.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction
protocol.
• Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
• Record the DNA concentration and quality metrics in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
4.2. PCR Amplification
• Prepare a master mix for PCR amplification of the target genes
associated with SCID.
• Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates, adding extracted
DNA to each sample.
• Include appropriate positive and negative controls to ensure the
quality of the amplification process.
• Program the thermal cycler with the appropriate cycling conditions
for the SCID gene panel.
• Run the PCR and confirm the presence of amplification products
via gel electrophoresis or other appropriate methods.
4.3. Library Preparation
• Prepare sequencing libraries from the amplified products following
the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Quantify and validate the libraries to ensure they meet the
specifications for sequencing.
• Pool libraries as per the protocol requirements.
4.4. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
• Load the sequencing libraries onto the NGS system according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform sequencing following the specified run parameters.
• Monitor the sequencing run to ensure optimal performance.
4.5. Data Analysis
• Transfer sequencing data to the bioinformatics software platform
for analysis.
• Use the software to align sequence reads to reference genome(s)
and call genetic variants.
• Apply filters to identify clinically significant variants associated
with SCID.
• Validate any detected variants using supplemental methods, such
as Sanger sequencing if necessary.
4.6. Interpretation and Reporting
• Review and interpret the identified variants in the context of SCID.
• Generate a comprehensive report detailing the results, including
identified variants, their potential clinical significance, and
interpretation.
• The report should also include any limitations of the test.
• Ensure that the final report is reviewed and signed off by a
qualified laboratory director or geneticist.
• Communicate critical findings to the referring physician as per
laboratory policy.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative and positive controls in each step of the
procedure to monitor the integrity and performance of the
process.
• Verify NGS system calibration and maintenance according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Participate in external quality assessment schemes for genetic
testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.
6. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to all relevant safety protocols and wear appropriate PPE.
• Follow all institutional and regulatory guidelines for handling and
disposing of biological and chemical waste.
• Maintain compliance with CLIA, CAP, and other regulatory
requirements.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Document all steps, from DNA extraction to data reporting, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Maintain records of all quality control measures and corrective
actions taken.
• Securely store all sequencing data and analysis reports.
