Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SEVERE CONGENITAL
AND CYCLIC NEUTROPENIA GENE PANEL Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized process for the analysis of samples using
the Severe Congenital and Cyclic Neutropenia Gene Panel to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for the identification of
genetic mutations associated with severe congenital and cyclic
neutropenia.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technicians and
technologists to perform the gene panel analysis following this SOP.
Supervisors and laboratory management should ensure compliance
with the procedure and handle any deviations or issues that arise
during the analysis.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type:
• Peripheral blood in EDTA tubes or buccal swabs
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Peripheral blood: Store at 2-8°C and process within 24-48 hours
of collection.
• Buccal swabs: Store at room temperature and process within 7
days of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have not been stored or transported under
appropriate conditions.
• Hemolyzed blood samples.
• Buccal swabs with insufficient cellular material.
Note: If specimens cannot be processed immediately, they should be
stored appropriately as per the above guidelines to maintain integrity.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (validated for the sample type)
• PCR machine
• Reagents for PCR (primers, polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
• Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform
• Standard laboratory consumables (tubes, tips, etc.)
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Peripheral Blood:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction using
the validated DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis.
2. Buccal Swabs:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction from
buccal swabs.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare a master mix containing the following components as
per the kit instructions:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTPs
◦ Primers specific for the Severe Congenital and Cyclic
Neutropenia genes
◦ DNA polymerase
◦ Sterile water
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes and add the extracted
DNA.
3. Perform PCR using the following cycling conditions (example):
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Number of cycles: 35
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Purify PCR products using a suitable purification method.
◦ Quantify the purified PCR products.
◦ Prepare sequencing libraries according to the NGS
platform's protocol.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform.
◦ Perform sequencing following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze raw sequencing data using bioinformatics tools and
software specified in the laboratory’s protocol.
2. Identify and annotate genetic variants using a pre-defined panel
of genes associated with severe congenital and cyclic
neutropenia.
3. Interpret the identified variants based on clinical significance
and guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Controls:
• Include positive control (known mutation) and negative control (no
template) in each batch of PCR and sequencing runs.
• Include internal controls to ensure the integrity and fidelity of the
process.
Maintenance:
• Follow the manufacturer’s maintenance schedule for all
equipment used.
• Calibrate equipment according to the laboratory’s calibration
schedule.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Report the identified variants with clinical interpretation and
recommendations.
• Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify with patient ID and specimen details.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kits, PCR reagents,
and NGS platforms.
• Clinical guidelines for the interpretation of genetic variants in
neutropenia.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Log all steps, equipment used, and personnel involved in the
analysis.
• Record all findings, controls, and any deviations from the SOP.
Review and update the SOP as needed and ensure compliance with
CLIA and laboratory accreditation requirements.
