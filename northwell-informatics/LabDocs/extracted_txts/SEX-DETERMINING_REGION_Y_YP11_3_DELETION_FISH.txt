Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for SEX-
DETERMINING REGION Y, YP11.3 DELETION, FISH
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be taken in the analytical phase
for generating results for SEX-DETERMINING REGION Y, YP11.3
deletion using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH).
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in this procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring the accuracy
and integrity of the FISH results.
• All laboratory personnel must ensure compliance with the GLP
(Good Laboratory Practices) and CLIA (Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments) regulations.
1. DEFINITIONS
• FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization): A molecular
cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes that bind to
only those parts of the chromosome with a high degree of
sequence complementarity.
• SEX-DETERMINING REGION Y (SRY): A gene located on the Y
chromosome at Yp11.3 that is critical for male sex determination.
• YP11.3 Deletion: A deletion in the short arm of the Y
chromosome.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Slides Preparation:
• Ensure slides labelled with the specimen identifier are available.
• Pre-treat slides with appropriate solutions to ensure adherence of
the specimen.
1. Sample Preparation:
• Fix the subject’s cells (typically peripheral blood lymphocytes or
bone marrow cells) onto prepared slides according to standard
cytogenetic protocols.
• Ensure fixation and drying times are strictly followed to preserve
the integrity of the samples.
B) Hybridization:
1. Probe Preparation:
• Thaw the FISH probe specific for the SRY region and any control
probes to room temperature.
• Mix the indicated amounts of probe with denaturation buffer.
1. Denaturation:
• Place slides in a humid chamber pre-warmed to 37°C.
• Apply the probe mixture to the sample area on the slides.
• Cover the samples with a glass coverslip and seal the edges with
rubber cement.
• Denature the DNA on a hotplate at 72°C for 2 minutes.
1. Hybridization:
• Transfer slides in a humid chamber to a 37°C incubator.
• Allow hybridization to occur for 16-18 hours undisturbed.
C) Post-Hybridization Wash & Detection:
1. Post-Hybridization Wash:
• Remove coverslips carefully after hybridization.
• Wash slides in 2X SSC buffer at room temperature for 5 minutes.
• Wash slides in 2X SSC/0.1 % NP-40 buffer at 45°C for 5 minutes.
1. Detection:
• DAPI counterstain (or other suitable counterstains) can be applied
to identify cell nuclei.
• Mount slides with a coverslip using an anti-fade reagent.
D) Result Interpretation:
1. Microscopic Analysis:
• Place slides under a fluorescence microscope equipped with
appropriate filter sets.
• Examine at least 200 interphase nuclei for each sample.
• Identify the presence or absence of the SRY signal (typically a
green fluorescence signal).
1. Scoring:
• Count and record the number of cells with two copies of the SRY
signal (indicating normal Yp11.3 region) and cells with no signal or
a single signal (indicating Yp11.3 deletion).
• Utilize appropriate control signals to validate the consistency of
the hybridization.
1. Quality Control:
• Include a known positive and negative control in each batch of
tests.
• Review all control results to verify the assay performance.
E) Documentation and Reporting:
1. Documentation:
• Record the FISH results, including the number of SRY signals in
each cell, on the FISH Result Recording Sheet.
• Ensure that each step in the process is logged with the respective
initials of the performing technologist.
1. Reporting Results:
• Convey the results to the requesting physician or clinician via the
LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Document any interpretation or comments noting unusual findings
or technical limitations.
1. Quality Assurance:
• Any anomalous findings should be double-checked by an
experienced technologist or pathologist.
• Equipment maintenance logs and procedure adherence must be
reviewed periodically by the laboratory supervisor.
