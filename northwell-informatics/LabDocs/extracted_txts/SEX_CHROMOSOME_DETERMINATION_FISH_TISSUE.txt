Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Sex Chromosome
Determination Using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) -
Tissue Specimens
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for determining the presence and
type of sex chromosomes (X and Y chromosomes) in tissue
specimens using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). The
FISH method allows for the identification and visualization of specific
chromosomal content within tissue sections, which is essential for
diagnosing chromosomal abnormalities.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in FISH techniques are responsible for
performing the procedure as outlined. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring proper implementation of the protocol and addressing any
technical or procedural issues as they arise.
1. DEFINITION
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic
technique that uses fluorescent probes that bind specifically to
particular chromosomal sequences, allowing for the visualization of
chromosomal content under a fluorescence microscope.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Tissue biopsy or resected tissue
• Volume: Minimum of one formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue block or six unstained sections of 4-5 microns
thickness on positively charged slides.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Pretreatment Kit (for deparaffinizing and rehydrating slides)
• FISH Probe Cocktail (commercially available sex chromosome-
specific fluorescent probes: X-chromosome probe and Y-
chromosome probe)
• Denaturation and Hybridization Buffer
• Stringency Wash Buffers
• Fluorescent Counterstain (DAPI)
• Mounting Medium
• Positive and Negative Control Slides
• Fluorescence Microscope
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Place FFPE tissue sections at 60°C for 1 hour.
◦ Deparaffinize by immersing slides in three changes of
xylene, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate tissue sections by passing through a series of
graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 3 minutes.
2. Pre-treatment
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the pre-treatment
steps using the provided reagents in the pretreatment kit.
◦ Enzymatically digest the tissue if necessary, as per the
treatment kit instructions.
B. Probe Hybridization
1. Denaturation
◦ Apply the FISH probe cocktail to the tissue section.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal edges with rubber cement
or a similar adhesive.
◦ Place the slides on a pre-warmed hybridization plate at
75°C for 5 minutes to denature the DNA.
2. Hybridization
◦ Transfer the slides to a 37°C humidified chamber.
◦ Allow the probes to hybridize overnight (12-16 hours).
C. Post-Hybridization Wash
1. Stringency Wash
◦ Remove coverslip carefully. Avoid disturbing the tissue.
◦ Wash slides in stringent wash buffer at 72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in a second stringent wash buffer at room
temperature for 1 minute.
2. Counterstaining and Mounting
◦ Apply DAPI counterstain and a small drop of mounting
medium.
◦ Cover with a clean coverslip and let dry.
D. Microscopy and Analysis
1. Microscopic Examination
◦ Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope
equipped with appropriate filters for the detection of
fluorophores used in the FISH probes.
◦ Assess at least 200 nuclei for the presence of signals.
Signals corresponding to the X and Y chromosomes should
be visualized and enumerated.
2. Result Interpretation
◦ Record the number of X chromosome signals (red signals)
and Y chromosome signals (green signals) observed in the
nuclei.
◦ Compare with control slides to ensure assay performance.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
samples.
• Ensure all reagents and buffers are within their expiration dates.
• Document lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents used.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report findings as the number of X and Y chromosomes observed
per cell.
• Include any observed abnormalities in the interpretation.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the laboratory
supervisor before reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal male tissue: One X and one Y chromosome.
• Normal female tissue: Two X chromosomes.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Tissue quality and fixation may affect hybridization efficiency and
signal strength.
• Overlapping cells may complicate signal enumeration and
interpretation.
