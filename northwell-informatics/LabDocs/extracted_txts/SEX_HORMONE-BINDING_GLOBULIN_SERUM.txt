Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SEX HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULIN
(SHBG), SERUM
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reliable measurement and
reporting of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) levels in
serum for diagnostic and research purposes.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the test,
maintaining equipment, and ensuring quality control processes
are followed.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify and report any
deficiencies or issues that may affect test results and to perform
corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITION Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) is a
glycoprotein that binds to sex hormones, including testosterone
and estrogen, and regulates their access to tissues.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection: Blood should be collected by venipuncture into a
serum separator tube (SST) or a red top tube without
anticoagulants.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C): Stable for up to 6 months. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or equivalent.
• SHBG assay kit (Follow manufacturer's instructions).
• Calibrators and controls (Low, Medium, High).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red top tubes.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) PRE-ANALYSIS
1. Verify patient information and specimen integrity.
◦ Ensure the specimen is appropriately labeled with patient
identification, collection date, and time.
◦ Check for hemolysis, lipemia, or other interferences.
2. Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
Note: If the specimen has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature prior to analysis.
B) ANALYSIS
1. Calibrate the instrument:
◦ Perform calibration using the calibrators provided in the
SHBG assay kit.
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for setting up and running
calibrations.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (Low, Medium, High) at the
beginning of each shift, after calibrations, and as per the
laboratory's QC protocol.
◦ Ensure that all quality control results are within acceptable
ranges. Document and take corrective actions if controls are
out of range.
3. Sample Loading:
◦ Load patient serum samples, controls, and calibrators onto
the analyzer according to the instrument's instructions.
◦ Ensure the samples are processed in the listed order.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided in the SHBG
assay kit for assay steps and incubation times.
C) POST-ANALYSIS
1. Result verification:
◦ Review analyzer output for each sample to ensure that
results are within the reportable range and free from error
codes.
◦ Re-assay samples if results fall outside the system
calibration range or if flagged by the instrument.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify that they match the analyzer printout.
◦ Ensure critical values are promptly communicated to the
supervising technologist or clinician per laboratory policy.
3. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Reference Intervals (example):
◦ Males: 10 – 57 nmol/L
◦ Females: 18 – 144 nmol/L
• Use the site-specific protocol for result reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Daily: Evaluate QC samples with each SHBG assay routine run.
• Monthly: Implement proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparison to ensure ongoing assay performance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens may affect the assay
performance.
• Refer to the SHBG assay kit insert for specific reagent pad
limitations.
