Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Sézary Cells
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the processes involved in the analytical phase of
testing for Sézary cells in peripheral blood samples. This includes the
identification and enumeration of Sézary cells to assist in the
diagnosis and monitoring of Sézary syndrome, a type of Cutaneous
T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
hematopathology and engaged in the analysis of peripheral blood
smears for Sézary cells.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and hematologists are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of
results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Sample: Peripheral blood collected in
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated tubes.
◦ Volume: Minimum 4 mL.
◦ Labelling: Each tube must be properly labeled with patient
information, date, and time of collection.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Samples must be analyzed within 24
hours of collection.
◦ Refrigeration: If analysis is delayed, samples can be stored
at 4°C for up to 48 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Light microscope
• Hematology analyzer (optional for initial screening)
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Staining reagents (May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain or Wright-Giemsa
stain)
• Immersion oil
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Slide Preparation
1. Preparation of Blood Smear:
◦ Mix EDTA blood sample gently by inversion.
◦ Place a drop of blood on a clean glass slide.
◦ Using a spreader slide, create a thin smear with a feathered
edge.
◦ Allow the smear to air dry completely.
6.2 Staining
1. Staining Process:
◦ Stain the smear using the May-Grünwald-Giemsa or Wright-
Giemsa method.
▪ Immerse the slide in May-Grünwald solution for 5
minutes.
▪ Rinse with distilled water for 1-2 minutes.
▪ Immerse the slide in Giemsa solution for 10 minutes.
▪ Rinse gently with distilled water and allow to air dry.
6.3 Microscopic Examination
1. Examination:
◦ Place a drop of immersion oil on the dried slide.
◦ Using a light microscope at 1000x magnification (oil
immersion), systematically scan the slide.
◦ Identify and enumerate Sézary cells, characterized by:
▪ Convoluted (cerebriform) nuclei
▪ Dense chromatin pattern
▪ Scant cytoplasm
6.4 Documentation
1. Documentation:
◦ Record the number of Sézary cells per 1000 lymphocytes.
◦ Calculate the percentage of Sézary cells in the sample and
record in the patient’s report.
6.5 Reporting
1. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure results are verified by a hematopathologist.
◦ Report any critical values to the requesting physician
immediately.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize control slides with known positive and negative results
alongside patient samples.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the microscope and staining
equipment.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals and critical values should be established
based on laboratory-specific validation.
9. NOTES AND PRECAUTIONS
• Ensure proper adherence to PPE guidelines and biosafety
protocols.
• Avoid sample contamination and ensure proper handling to
maintain integrity.
• Properly dispose of all biohazardous waste according to local
regulations.
