Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Sézary Diagnostic Flow Cytometry, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical procedures
necessary to perform, analyze, and document results for Sézary
diagnostic flow cytometry of whole blood specimens. This protocol
ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the assessment of
Sézary syndrome, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory staff trained in flow cytometry
operations and analysis. It covers the steps from sample preparation
through running the sample on the flow cytometer, to the analysis
and reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the flow
cytometry analysis following this SOP. Supervisors and experienced
flow cytometry technologists are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP and for reviewing and validating the final results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto, Beckman Coulter Navios)
• Computer with flow cytometry analysis software (e.g., FACSDiva,
Kaluza Analysis)
• Anticoagulated whole blood (EDTA)
• Flow cytometry tubes
• Monoclonal antibodies specific for Sézary cell markers (e.g., CD3,
CD4, CD7, CD26, CD8, CD45, TCR Vβ)
• Lysing solution
• Positive and negative control samples
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• FACS lysing solution (for red blood cell lysing)
• Disposable pipettes
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
5.1.1 Reagents Preparation
• Prepare freshly diluted lysing solution according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Label all flow cytometry tubes clearly with patient identifiers and
required staining panel identifiers.
5.1.2 Staining Protocol
• Add 100 μL of well-mixed, anticoagulated whole blood to each
properly labeled flow cytometry tube.
• Add the appropriate volumes of the monoclonal antibodies to the
tubes as per the manufacturer’s recommended concentration.
Vortex gently to mix. Use the following antibody panel:
◦ CD3 FITC
◦ CD4 PE
◦ CD7 APC
◦ CD26 PE-Cy7
◦ CD8 PerCP-Cy5.5
◦ CD45 V500
◦ TCR Vβ (specific fluorochrome as per laboratory standard)
• Incubate tubes in the dark at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
5.1.3 Red Blood Cell Lysis
• Add 2 ml of lysing solution to each tube.
• Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
• Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
• Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
5.1.4 Washing and Fixing
• Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml PBS.
• Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
• Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 300 µL of PBS for
flow cytometry analysis.
5.2 Instrument Setup
• Perform daily calibration and quality control of the flow cytometer
using standard beads as per the instrument manual.
• Verify that all compensated settings are accurate for the specific
fluorescence channels used.
• Load compensation controls and establish compensation settings
to correct for spectral overlap of fluorochromes.
5.3 Sample Acquisition
5.3.1 Acquisition Settings
• Set up acquisition templates specific for Sézary syndrome
analysis in the flow cytometry software.
• Gate on the lymphocyte population using forward scatter (FSC)
and side scatter (SSC) to exclude debris and artifacts.
5.3.2 Running Samples
• Acquire data for at least 10,000 events in the lymphocyte
population.
• Ensure that each population of interest (particularly CD4+ T cells)
has a sufficient number of events for reliable analysis.
5.4 Data Analysis
5.4.1 Initial Gating Strategy
• Confirm lymphocyte gating based on FSC and SSC
characteristics.
• Gate on live, single-cell lymphocytes by using viability dye
exclusion if applicable.
5.4.2 Sequential Gating
• Gate on the CD3+ T cell population.
• Identify and gate on CD4+ T cells within the CD3+ population.
• Sequentially gate to analyze markers indicative of Sézary cells,
such as aberrant loss of CD7, reduced expression of CD26, and
abnormal TCR Vβ usage.
5.4.3 Interpretation
• Identify markers that exhibit abnormal expression patterns
consistent with Sézary syndrome.
• Assess the percentage of abnormal cells within the CD4+ T cell
population.
• Compare findings against established diagnostic criteria for
Sézary syndrome.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Daily Instrument QC
• Perform and document daily instrument calibration using standard
QC beads.
6.2 Internal Quality Control Samples
• Run internal positive and negative control samples with each
batch of patient samples.
• Ensure quality control results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Verification
• Review all gated populations and analyses to ensure consistency
and accuracy.
• Compare the data to historical patient data, if available, for
longitudinal assessment.
7.2 Documentation
• Document all steps in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include detailed notes on any deviations from the standard
protocol and corresponding justifications.
7.3 Results Reporting
• Report abnormal findings in the context of established reference
ranges and diagnostic criteria for Sézary syndrome.
• Communicate critical findings with the physician immediately and
document the communication.
