Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Sezary Monitoring Flow
Cytometry, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedure for monitoring Sezary cells in
blood using flow cytometry. Sezary cells are atypical T lymphocytes
found in patients with Sezary syndrome, a type of cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma. Regular monitoring of Sezary cells helps in evaluating
disease progression and patient response to therapy.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel trained in flow cytometry
techniques are responsible for performing, documenting, and
interpreting the test results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this protocol and addressing any issues that arise.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Specimen requirements:
◦ Collect 4 mL of peripheral blood in an EDTA (lavender top)
tube.
◦ Transport the specimen at room temperature within 24
hours of collection.
2. Upon arrival, verify the specimen for suitability:
◦ Confirm the specimen is labeled correctly with the patient’s
full name, date of birth, and collection date/time.
◦ Ensure there is no hemolysis or clotting.
◦ Discard any specimens that do not meet these criteria and
request a new sample.
B) Reagents and Supplies:
• Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II)
• Monoclonal antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes (e.g., CD3,
CD4, CD7, CD26, TCR-Vβ)
• Lysing solution (e.g., ammonium chloride-based)
• Wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% sodium azide)
• Fixative solution (e.g., 1% paraformaldehyde)
• 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
C) Staining Procedure:
1. Prepare tubes for each panel:
◦ Label tubes appropriately for different antibody panels.
2. Aliquot 100 µL of blood into each labeled tube.
3. Add appropriate volumes of fluorochrome-conjugated
antibodies to each tube:
◦ CD3 (FITC), CD4 (PE), CD7 (APC), CD26 (PC7), TCR-Vβ
(FITC or PE)
4. Incubate tubes in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
5. Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 minutes.
6. Centrifuge tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes and remove the
supernatant.
7. Wash cells by adding 2 mL of wash buffer, vortex briefly, then
centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes. Discard the supernatant.
8. Resuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of fixative solution.
9. Store fixed cells at 2-8°C in the dark if not analyzed
immediately (analyze within 24 hours).
D) Flow Cytometry Acquisition and Analysis:
1. Set up the flow cytometer:
◦ Perform daily startup and calibration using calibration
beads.
◦ Ensure proper compensation settings for fluorochrome
spillover.
2. Acquire samples:
◦ Run each sample on the flow cytometer, acquiring at least
20,000 lymphocyte events per tube.
3. Use appropriate gating strategies to identify Sezary cells:
◦ Gate on lymphocytes based on forward and side scatter
characteristics.
◦ Determine CD4+ T cells (CD3+CD4+).
◦ Analyze for the loss of CD7 and CD26 expression on CD4+
T cells.
◦ Evaluate TCR-Vβ usage if applicable.
4. Document findings and print histograms.
E) Quality Control:
1. Include quality control samples (e.g., normal peripheral blood
lymphocytes) with each run to validate antibody performance
and instrument settings.
2. Record and review QC results:
◦ QC samples should fall within established ranges.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot and repeat testing.
F) Result Reporting:
1. Document observed percentages and absolute counts of
Sezary cells in the electronic laboratory management system
(LIS).
2. Review and verify the data.
3. Provide a final report, including interpretation and
recommendation for further testing if required.

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
flow cytometry.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the antibodies and reagents used.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are analyzed within the specified time frame to
prevent cell degradation.
• Variability in staining and gating techniques may affect results.
Consistent methods should be used.
1. SAFETY
• Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle biological specimens with caution to prevent exposure.
