Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for SF-1 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for performing the technical
component of SF-1 immunostaining in the laboratory to ensure
consistent and accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel trained and authorized to
perform SF-1 immunostaining in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol accurately and report any issues or deviations to the
supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Immunostaining: A technique used to detect specific antigens in
cells or tissue sections by using antibodies conjugated with a
detectable label.
• SF-1 (Steroidogenic Factor-1): A nuclear receptor protein
involved in the regulation of steroidogenic genes.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue Samples: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Thickness: Sections should be cut at 3-5 micrometers.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Microtome, water bath, slide rack, incubator,
microscope, and coverslipper.
• Reagents:
◦ Primary antibody against SF-1
◦ Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
◦ DAB substrate
◦ Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol
◦ Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
◦ Mounting medium
7. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical
1. Sectioning and Slide Preparation:
◦ Use a microtome to cut 3-5 micrometer sections of FFPE
tissue.
◦ Float sections on a 40°C water bath and pick up onto
positively charged slides.
◦ Allow slides to dry at room temperature or in a 37°C
incubator overnight.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 70%) - 3 minutes each.
◦ Wash slides in distilled water.
B) Analytical - Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) in a microwave or pressure
cooker.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the retrieval
buffer.
◦ Wash slides in TBS.
2. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with blocking solution (e.g., TBS with 5%
normal serum and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes at
room temperature to minimize non-specific binding.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with primary antibody against SF-1 (dilution
as recommended in datasheet) for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in TBS 3 times for 5 minutes each.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
appropriate for the primary antibody used (dilution as
recommended in datasheet) for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in TBS 3 times for 5 minutes each.
7. DAB Substrate Development:
◦ Incubate slides in DAB substrate solution until desired
staining intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes),
monitoring under a microscope.
◦ Immediately rinse slides in distilled water to stop the
reaction.
8. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse thoroughly in running tap water.
C) Post-Analytical
1. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%), 1 minute each.
◦ Clear slides through 2 changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
◦ Apply coverslip using appropriate mounting medium.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control tissue sections with each
batch of staining to ensure reagents are working properly.
• Document the lot numbers and expiration dates of all antibodies
and reagents used.
• Record all observations and any deviations from the protocol in
the laboratory logbook.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• No Staining: Check that all reagents are functioning, ensure
proper antigen retrieval, repeat blocking steps.
• High Background Staining: Increase blocking time or
concentration, ensure thorough washing steps, verify proper
antibody dilutions.
• Weak Staining: Optimize antigen retrieval conditions, increase
primary antibody concentration or incubation time.

immunostaining.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all results are documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS).

measures.
12. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL

guidelines for biological samples and chemical reagents.
