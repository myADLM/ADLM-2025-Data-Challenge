SOP: Analytical Protocol for Sheep Wool IgE (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the analysis of Sheep Wool
IgE in serum specimens. This analysis is used to detect the presence
of specific IgE antibodies against sheep wool, which are potential
markers for allergic reactions.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the analytical
procedures as outlined in this SOP. Supervisors must ensure
compliance and the necessary training of personnel.
1. DEFINITION
Sheep Wool IgE (log E) Antibody Test: An immunoassay used to
determine the presence of IgE antibodies specific to sheep wool in
patient serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection:
• Collect whole blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
Handling:
• Centrifuge SST at 1000-1300*g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the serum to a labeled laboratory grade sample tube.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, freeze samples at -20°C or colder.
Acceptable Criteria:
• Hemolysis-free serum specimens.
• Sufficient volume for analysis (minimum 0.5 mL).
Unacceptable Criteria:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens not labeled properly or received beyond the stability
period.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia™ 250, ImmunoCAP)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Sheep Wool IgE-specific ImmunoCAP reagent
• Conjugate reagent
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Quality control materials at multiple levels (negative and positive
controls)
Supplies:
• Vials/tubes for serum aliquots
• Reagent cartridges
• Gloves, lab coat, and disposable labware
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Allow all reagents, controls, and samples to reach room
temperature prior to use.
• Prepare wash buffer according to manufacturer’s instructions.
B) Calibration:
• Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using specific calibrators
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
• Ensure calibration is within acceptable limits before proceeding
with sample testing.
C) Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document control results and verify they fall within the acceptable
range before validating patient results.
D) Sample Analysis:
1. Label all tubes and reagent wells appropriately.
2. Pipette required volume (as per reagent kit insert) of serum
sample into the test wells.
3. Add specific sheep wool allergen reagent to test wells
according to immunoassay protocol.
4. Incubate samples according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Conduct washing steps using the wash buffer to remove
unbound substances.
6. Add conjugate reagent to test wells and incubate for the
specified time.
7. Repeat washing steps.
8. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for color
development.
9. Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
10. Read the absorbance of the wells at the specified wavelength
using the immunoassay analyzer.
E) Result Interpretation:
• Analyze data using dedicated software of the immunoassay
analyzer.
• Compare absorbance values to the standard curve and control
values.
• Report the concentration of Sheep Wool IgE in IU/mL.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify calculations and data integrity.
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Reference values: Interpret results based on established clinical
thresholds for Sheep Wool IgE levels.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <0.35 IU/mL
• Borderline/Equivocal: 0.35 – 0.70 IU/mL
• Positive: >0.70 IU/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Performance is influenced by sample integrity and proper
adherence to the protocol.
• Interferences: Gross hemolysis, lipemia, or bacterial
contamination may affect results.
• Refer to the specific reagent kit insert.
