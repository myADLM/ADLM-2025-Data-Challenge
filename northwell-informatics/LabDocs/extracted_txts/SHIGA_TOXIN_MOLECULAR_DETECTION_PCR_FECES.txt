Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SHIGA TOXIN,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, FECES
1. PURPOSE
To establish a consistent protocol for the molecular detection of Shiga
toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) in fecal specimens using Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) technology.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
conduct this procedure accurately and to ensure that all analyses and
documentation are performed according to this protocol.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the molecular detection of Shiga toxin
genes (stx1, stx2) in fecal specimens received in the laboratory.
4. DEFINITIONS
PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a molecular biology technique to
amplify DNA sequences. STEC: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia
coli.
5. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable Specimens
◦ Freshly collected stool in Cary-Blair medium, received within
24 hours.
◦ Frozen stool samples, if transport or processing delays are
expected.
• Unacceptable Specimens
◦ Specimens not received in the appropriate transport medium.
◦ Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection
without proper refrigeration.
◦ Leaking or contaminated specimens.
◦ Specimens without appropriate labeling or collection date/time.
6. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents
◦ PCR Master Mix (includes Taq polymerase, dNTPs,
magnesium chloride, and reaction buffer).
◦ Primers specific for stx1 and stx2 genes.
◦ Positive control DNA (known STEC strain).
◦ Negative control (nuclease-free water).
◦ Nucleic acid extraction kit.
• Equipment
◦ Biosafety cabinet.
◦ Microcentrifuge.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Thermal cycler.
◦ Gel electrophoresis apparatus and power supply.
◦ UV-transilluminator.
◦ Pipettes and tips (aerosol-resistant recommended).
◦ Microtubes.
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as lab coat,
gloves, and safety glasses.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens.
2. Process stool specimens using a nucleic acid extraction kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Label all tubes appropriately (e.g., with specimen ID).
4. Centrifuge the samples if recommended by the kit.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a new labeled tube without
disturbing the pellet.
6. Store DNA at -20°C or proceed to PCR immediately.
B. PCR Preparation
1. Prepare the PCR master mix on ice following the kit’s
instructions (e.g., 25 µL reaction volume per sample, primer
concentration, etc.).
2. Dispense the master mix into labeled PCR tubes.
3. Add extracted nucleic acid (sample DNA), positive control DNA,
and negative control into corresponding tubes.
4. Cap the tubes securely to prevent evaporation.
5. Mix gently by flicking the tubes and briefly centrifuge to collect
the liquid at the bottom.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes.
◦ 35-40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (depending on
primer set).
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Hold: 4°C.
2. Load PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and start the run.
D. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel in TAE buffer containing ethidium
bromide or an alternative DNA stain.
2. Load the PCR products and a molecular weight marker into the
gel wells.
3. Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 30 minutes or until
the dye front has traveled an appropriate distance.
4. Visualize the results under UV light using the UV-
transilluminator.
5. Document the gel image for record-keeping.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive Result: The presence of bands corresponding to the
expected sizes of stx1 and/or stx2 genes alongside the positive
control.
• Negative Result: Absence of bands in patient samples but the
presence of bands in the positive control and absence of bands in
the negative control.
• Invalid Result: Absence of bands in the positive control or the
presence of bands in the negative control sample. Repeat the
extraction and PCR process for confirmation.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform PCR with positive and negative controls with each run.
• Record the lot numbers of reagents and kits used.
• Check instrument calibration and maintenance logs prior to use.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the interpreted results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Alert the clinician immediately of any positive findings due to the
clinical significance of STEC infections.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all biosafety guidelines while handling human specimens.
• Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment after use.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to institutional policies.
