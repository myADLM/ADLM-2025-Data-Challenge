Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Shigella Culture, Feces
1. PURPOSE
To provide consistent and reliable results for identifying and
confirming the presence of Shigella species in fecal samples. This
protocol defines the procedures for the culture, isolation, and
identification of Shigella species from fecal specimens.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to clinical laboratory personnel responsible for
conducting the analytical phase of Shigella culture from fecal
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory personnel performing Shigella culture and identification
must follow this protocol. Staff are responsible for documenting all
observations and results accurately and taking corrective actions
when necessary.
4. SPECIMEN RECEIPT AND INITIAL HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Feces.
• Container: Sterile, leak-proof container.
• Transport: The specimen should be transported to the laboratory
as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours of collection. If
transportation time exceeds 2 hours, refrigerate the specimen at
2-8°C, but do not freeze.
• Check for proper labeling and integrity of the specimen.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Buffered Peptone Water
• Selenite F Broth (enrichment broth)
• Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate (XLD) Agar
• Hektoen Enteric (HE) Agar
• Salmonella-Shigella (SS) Agar
• MacConkey Agar
• Biochemical reagents and media (e.g., Triple Sugar Iron Agar,
Urea Agar)
• Antibiotic susceptibility test materials
• Incubator set at 35-37°C
• Bunsen burner or a biosafety cabinet for aseptic techniques
• Inoculating loops and sterile swabs
• Centrifuge and vortex
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 PRE-ENRICHMENT AND ENRICHMENT
1. Transfer approximately 1 g of fecal material into 10 mL of
Buffered Peptone Water.
2. Vortex to mix thoroughly.
3. Incubate at 35-37°C for 6-8 hours.
4. After pre-enrichment, transfer 1 mL of the Buffered Peptone
Water fecal suspension into 9 mL of Selenite F Broth.
5. Incubate the Selenite F Broth at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
6.2 PRIMARY ISOLATION
1. Streak the enriched fecal suspension from Selenite F Broth
onto the following agar plates:
◦ XLD Agar
◦ HE Agar
◦ SS Agar
◦ MacConkey Agar
2. Incubate the agar plates at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
6.3 CULTURE EXAMINATION
1. Examine the plates for lactose non-fermenting colonies, which
appear as colorless or pale colonies on XLD, HE, SS, and
MacConkey Agar.
2. Select potential Shigella colonies for further testing.
6.4 BIOCHEMICAL TESTING
1. Perform Gram staining to confirm the presence of Gram-
negative rods.
2. Subculture suspect colonies onto Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) Agar
and Urea Agar.
3. Incubate the TSI and Urea Agar slants at 35-37°C for 18-24
hours.
• Interpretation:
◦ TSI: Shigella typically shows an alkaline slant (red) and an
acid butt (yellow) without gas production.
◦ Urea: Shigella does not hydrolyze urea (remains yellow).
6.5 IDENTIFICATION AND CONFIRMATION
1. Confirm the identification using a biochemical test panel or a
commercially available identification system.
2. Perform serological typing to identify the specific Shigella
serogroup using Shigella antisera.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Use known Shigella species to culture
periodically to ensure media and reagents are functioning
correctly.
• Negative Control: Include specimens known not to contain
Shigella.
8. RESULT REPORTING
• Report as “Shigella species isolated” or “Shigella not isolated”
based on the final culture results.
• If isolated, specify the Shigella serogroup.
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider immediately if Shigella
is isolated.
• Enter all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by a senior technologist.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If growth is not observed on selective media, repeat the
procedure with another specimen aliquot.
• Ensure all media and reagents are within their expiration dates
and properly stored.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Record all observations, culture results, and identification
outcomes.
• Document corrective actions taken in case of procedural
deviations or equipment failure.
12. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• All manipulations of fecal specimens should be conducted in a
Class II Biosafety Cabinet.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and face protection.
• Follow all biohazard disposal regulations.
