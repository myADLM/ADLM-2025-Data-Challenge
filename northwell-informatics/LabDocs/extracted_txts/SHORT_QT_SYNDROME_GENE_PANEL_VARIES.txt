Standard Operating Procedure SHORT QT SYNDROME GENE
PANEL TESTING
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the procedure to be followed
during the analytical phase of generating results for the Short
QT Syndrome Gene Panel. It ensures accurate, reliable, and
consistent results, according to CLIA standards.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
performing short QT syndrome gene sequencing and analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assay according to the stipulated protocols.
◦ Supervisors must ensure that personnel are adequately
trained and that adherence to the protocols is maintained.
◦ Quality control personnel are responsible for monitoring
performance, troubleshooting issues, and documenting all
procedures.
4. DEFINITIONS
◦ Short QT Syndrome: A rare genetic disorder characterized
by a short QT interval on ECG and increased risk of sudden
cardiac death.
◦ Gene Panel: A test that checks for mutations in several
genes associated with short QT syndrome.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ PCR reagents
◦ Short QT syndrome gene panel kit (includes primers,
dNTPs, polymerase, buffers and probes)
◦ Thermal cycler
◦ Capillary electrophoresis or next-generation sequencing
system
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Buffer solutions, nuclease-free water
◦ Software for sequencing data analysis
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Samples: Peripheral blood (collected in EDTA
vacutainer), buccal swabs.
◦ Unacceptable Samples: Clotted samples, insufficient
volume, and samples with improper labeling.
Note: Stored specimens must be handled as per laboratory
protocol ensuring DNA integrity. Ensure all specimens are
accompanied by proper documentation.
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
◦ Label all samples clearly with the appropriate patient
information.
◦ Perform DNA extraction using the DNA extraction kit. Follow
the manufacturer's instructions precisely.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer. The desired
concentration is >50ng/μL, and the A260/A280 ratio should
be between 1.8-2.0.
B) PCR Amplification
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix as outlined in the Short QT
syndrome gene panel kit instructions.
◦ Add extracted DNA to the PCR master mix as specified.
◦ Load into the thermal cycler and run the program specified
for the gene panel. Ensure to document the thermal cycling
conditions.
C) DNA Sequencing
◦ Prepare the PCR product for sequencing according to either
capillary electrophoresis or next-generation sequencing
protocol.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
sequencing platform in use.
◦ Include appropriate controls (positive, negative, and no-
template controls) in each sequencing run.
D) Data Analysis
◦ Import raw sequencing data into the designated software
tool for analysis.
◦ Identify variants by comparing sequences against the
reference genome.
◦ Classify identified variants based on their pathogenicity
using databases like ClinVar, HGMD, and others.
◦ Interpret and evaluate the clinical significance of variants
using guidelines from the American College of Medical
Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).
2. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
ensure assay accuracy.
◦ Periodically validate equipment and reagents according to
laboratory protocols.
◦ Follow internal and external quality control measures as
outlined in established QC programs.
◦ Document and address any deviations or non-conformities
in real-time.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Generate a comprehensive report based on data analysis.
◦ Include detailed information about identified variants, their
clinical significance, and interpretation.
◦ Review by a certified geneticist before final approval.
◦ Ensure results are entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) accurately.
◦ Provide patient results in a clear, concise, and clinically
useful format suitable for physician interpretation.
