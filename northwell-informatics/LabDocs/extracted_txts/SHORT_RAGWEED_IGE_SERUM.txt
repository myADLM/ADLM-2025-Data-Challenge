Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Short Ragweed, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process for the analysis of Short Ragweed-specific
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum samples to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
Responsibility: The responsibility lies with all designated laboratory
staff involved in the analytical process, including technologists and
supervisors, to ensure that all procedures are followed correctly,
results are accurately generated and documented, and any
deviations or issues are reported promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Short Ragweed, IgE, Serum refers to the quantification of IgE
antibodies specific to Short Ragweed pollen in a patient's serum.
These levels are indicative of an allergic response and are measured
using immunoassay techniques.
1. PROCEDURE
A. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Equipment:
◦ Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA, or
similar)
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated storage units
2. Reagents:
◦ Short Ragweed-specific IgE calibrators (provided by the
assay manufacturer)
◦ IgE-specific enzyme-labeled anti-IgE conjugate
◦ Substrate solution (e.g., TMB for ELISA)
◦ Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid for ELISA)
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
3. Supplies:
◦ Microtiter plates or reaction vials specific to the
immunoassay system
◦ Control samples (Low, Medium, High)
◦ Disposable tips for pipettes
◦ Laboratory personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ Serum sample collection tubes
B. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
1. Preferred/acceptable:
◦ 2-10 mL of venous blood drawn into a serum separator tube
(SST). Allow blood to clot and then centrifuge to separate
serum from cells.
2. Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 8
hours post-collection.
3. Specimen Handling:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours.
◦ For long-term storage, aliquot serum into labeled vials and
store at -20°C or lower.
C. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are brought to room
temperature before use.
◦ Prepare the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Label and arrange samples, calibrators, and controls in the
appropriate order.
◦ Dilute serum samples as needed according to the assay
protocol.
3. Assay Execution: a. Add appropriate volumes of calibrators,
controls, and serum samples to the designated wells or reaction
vials. b. Incubate as per the specific time and temperature
protocol (e.g., 60 minutes at 37°C). c. Wash wells or reaction
vials to remove unbound analytes. d. Add enzyme-labeled anti-
IgE conjugate to each well or reaction vial. e. Incubate as
specified. f. Wash to remove excess conjugate. g. Add
substrate solution to each well or reaction vial, and incubate as
specified. h. Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
4. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength(s)
using the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Generate a standard curve from the calibrators and
interpolate the IgE concentration of the samples.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure all three levels of control samples (Low, Medium,
High) are within acceptable ranges before accepting patient
results.
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log.
6. Reporting Results:
◦ Transcribe the IgE concentration results into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Flag any results that fall outside the reference interval or
pre-defined critical values for further review.
REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• The standard reference interval for Short Ragweed IgE levels is
typically: <0.10 kU/L.
• Values above this threshold may indicate sensitization and should
be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical history and
symptoms.
METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Heterophilic antibodies in patient specimens can interfere with
immunoassays and cause erroneous results.
• Ensure sample integrity by avoiding repeated freeze/thaw cycles.

inserts for detailed reagent handling and procedure instructions.

updates as necessary based on new information or changes in
guidelines/procedures.
