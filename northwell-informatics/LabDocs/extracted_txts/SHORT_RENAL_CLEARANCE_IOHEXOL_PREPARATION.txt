Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Short Renal Clearance
Analysis Using Iohexol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating Short Renal Clearance (SRC) results using Iohexol as the
contrast agent. This SOP includes instructions on the preparation,
analysis, and necessary quality control procedures to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to follow these
procedures and ensure proper documentation.
• The supervisor should be notified of any inconsistencies or issues
encountered during the process.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all trained laboratory personnel involved in the
Short Renal Clearance analysis using Iohexol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Blood samples should be collected in heparinized tubes from
patients at specified time intervals post-Iohexol administration
(typically at 2, 3, and 4 hours).
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled with patient identification,
collection time, and date.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed immediately
and avoid prolonged storage beyond 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• Iohexol Standard solution
• Quality Control samples (low, medium, high)
• Heparinized blood collection tubes
• Sample processing tubes
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENTS
• Mobile phase: prepare according to HPLC requirements
• Iohexol standard stock solution
• Quality control materials and calibrators
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Pre-analysis Guidelines:
◦ Allow blood samples to reach room temperature before
beginning sample processing.
◦ Mix the blood sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
2. Blood Plasma Extraction:
◦ Centrifuge the collected blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the plasma.
◦ Carefully transfer the plasma into labeled processing tubes
using a pipette.
B. Standard and QC Preparation:
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare calibration standards of Iohexol at various
concentrations by diluting the Iohexol stock solution in a
suitable solvent (e.g., mobile phase solvent).
◦ Prepare at least 5 calibrators covering the expected
concentration range of the patient samples.
2. Quality Control (QC) Samples:
◦ Use commercially available QC materials or prepare in-
house controls at three concentration levels (low, medium,
high).
◦ Document the preparation and storage conditions for QC
samples.
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. System Setup:
◦ Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Allow the HPLC system to equilibrate with the mobile phase
for at least 30 minutes before analysis.
2. Injection of Samples:
◦ Use an HPLC autosampler or manual injection system.
◦ Inject calibration standards, QC samples, and patient
samples into the HPLC system.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Set the detector wavelength specific for Iohexol (typically
245 nm).
◦ Record the retention time and peak area for each sample.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Iohexol in patient samples
using the calibration curve.
◦ Ensure that QC samples fall within acceptable limits; if not,
troubleshoot and reanalyze as necessary.
D. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Documentation:
◦ Record the identification of each sample, calibration
standard, and QC sample in the laboratory information
system.
◦ Maintain records of the calibration curve, QC results, and
any troubleshooting performed.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Report patient Iohexol concentrations and calculated renal
clearance values into the laboratory information system.
◦ Ensure compliance with the laboratory’s reporting guidelines
and reference intervals.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC procedures daily or alongside each batch of patient
samples.
• Analyze three levels of QC materials to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the HPLC system.
• If QC results are out of acceptable range, identify and correct the
issue before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the HPLC system displays inconsistent results or out-of-range
QC values, reset the system and re-evaluate the mobile phase
and column conditions.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions taken.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all safety protocols for handling blood specimens and
hazardous materials.
• Wear appropriate PPE including gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to laboratory
guidelines.
