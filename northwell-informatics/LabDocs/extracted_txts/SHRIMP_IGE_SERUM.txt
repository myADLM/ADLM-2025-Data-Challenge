SHRIMP, IgE, and SERUM ANALYSIS - STANDARD OPERATING
PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE: The objective of this SOP is to outline the
procedure for the analytical phase of generating results for
Serum SHRIMP (specific IgE), Total IgE, and Serum analysis.
Responsibility: - Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the tests as outlined in this procedure. - It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure that quality control measures are
followed and to report any deviations to a supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Automated Analyzer specific for SHRIMP IgE detection
◦ Automated Analyzer specific for Total IgE detection
◦ Spectrophotometer or other analyzers for Serum analytes
◦ Serum samples
◦ Standard reagents and controls for SHRIMP IgE, Total IgE,
and Serum analysis
◦ Centrifuge, Pipettes, Tips, Test Tubes
◦ Calibration and Quality Control materials
2. PROCEDURES:
SHRIMP Specific IgE Testing:
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation: - Verify patient identification and
ensure the sample collected is labeled correctly. - Inspect the
specimen for any signs of hemolysis or contamination. Discard
unacceptable specimens.
B) Running the SHRIMP IgE Test: - Prepare the analyzer and
ensure it is calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. - Load the patient's serum sample and necessary
reagents into the analyzer as per the manufacturer's protocol. -
Set the run parameters and initiate the test. - Monitor the test
progress while maintaining adherence to the instrument
guidelines.
C) Post-Analytical Actions: - Once the test is complete, retrieve
and evaluate the results generated by the analyzer. - Compare
results with established reference ranges and flag any
abnormal values. - Document the results on the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification by a
laboratory technologist.
D) Quality Control: - Perform quality control runs at the
beginning of each shift or as defined in the instrument’s manual.
- Record and review all QC results prior to processing patient
samples. - Record corrective actions for any QC outliers before
resuming patient sample analysis.
Total IgE Testing:
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation: - Verify patient information and
label accordingly. - Check the serum sample for any
inconsistencies or hemolysis.
B) Running the Total IgE Test: - Calibrate the IgE analyzer as
recommended by the manufacturer. - Pipette required volumes
of serum and reagents into designated wells or cups. - Run the
test cycle as defined in the analyzer's operating instructions.
C) Post-Analytical Actions: - Confirm test completion and
validity of the results against control runs. - Input the results into
the LIS, noting any values outside the normal reference range.
D) Quality Control: - Run quality control samples before patient
testing and after changing reagent lots. - Any deviations in
control results must be addressed and corrected before testing
patient samples.
Serum Analysis:
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation: - Confirm patient details on the
sample. - Check the sample for proper quality (no hemolysis or
clotting).
B) Running Serum Analytes: - Centrifuge the serum samples if
needed to separate the serum from cells. - Load sample into
the spectrophotometer or designated analyzer. - Initiate the run
sequence per the instrument’s manual, ensuring correct test
selection for parameters required.
C) Post-Analytical Actions: - Ensure all results align with
standard reference values, flagging anomalies for review. -
Document in the LIS for verification by the responsible
technologist.
D) Quality Control: - Regularly perform calibration and quality
control checks on all analytes. - Review all control outcomes
and log results accordingly.
3. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Verify all results through the LIS.
◦ The responsible technologist must review and sign off the
results before release.
◦ Any flagged results require further evaluation and
documentation of review/correction.
4. REFERENCES:
◦ Manufacturer's Manuals for SHRIMP IgE Analyzer, Total IgE
Analyzer, and Serum Analyzer.
◦ Relevant Quality Control Procedures
◦ Laboratory-specific guidelines and protocols.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Detailed references regarding the limitations of each test
method are found in the respective manufacturer’s manual
and SOP appendices.
6. SAFETY AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ Ensure all laboratory safety protocols are followed while
handling samples and reagents.
◦ In case of any instrument errors or unexpected results,
consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guidelines and
notify the supervisor for further action.
This procedure is designed to maintain consistent and accurate
results in the testing of SHRIMP specific IgE, Total IgE, and Serum
analysis. All laboratory personnel must adhere to this SOP to
maintain quality and integrity in patient results.
