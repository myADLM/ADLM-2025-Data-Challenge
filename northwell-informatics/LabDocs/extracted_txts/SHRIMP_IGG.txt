Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for
Determining SHRIMP IGG Levels
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized, systematic approach for the analysis and
quantification of Serum Helicobacter pylori Immunoglobulin G
(SHRIMP IGG) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) method. This procedure ensures accuracy, reliability, and
consistency in the results provided.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
SHRIMP IGG assay according to this procedure. All personnel must
ensure that the assay is conducted under appropriate conditions and
corrective actions are taken where deviations occur.
2. DEFINITION
The SHRIMP IGG assay is a diagnostic test used for the detection of
IGG antibodies against Helicobacter pylori in human serum. This test
assists in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents and Equipment Required:
1. Reagents:
◦ SHRIMP IGG ELISA Kit (including microplate strips, stop
solution, substrate solution, wash buffer, and conjugate)
◦ Control samples (positive and negative controls)
◦ Calibration standards
◦ Diluent buffer
◦ Deionized water
2. Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader with a wavelength setting of 450 nm
◦ ELISA washing equipment
◦ Micropipettes and tips (volumes: 10 µL, 100 µL, and 1000
µL)
◦ Laboratory centrifuge
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Absorbent paper
B. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
1. Specimen:
◦ Preferred: Serum collected in a SST tube.
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
2. Stability:
◦ Specimen can be stored at 2–8°C for up to 48 hours before
testing.
◦ For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
C. Reagent Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, microplate strips, and samples to reach
room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Dilute wash buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Prepare other reagents (conjugate, substrate, stop solution) as
required by thawing or diluting per the ELISA kit instructions.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Allow serum specimens and controls
to reach room temperature. b. Vortex serum samples and
controls briefly to ensure homogeneity. If samples are frozen,
thoroughly thaw and mix before use.
2. Assay Execution: a. Place the required number of microplate
wells into the frame; unused wells should be stored with
desiccant in a sealed bag. b. Pipette 100 µL of controls,
standards, and patient serum samples into the appropriate
wells in duplicate. c. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
d. Wash the wells four times with 300 µL of prepared wash
buffer to remove unbound material. e. Add 100 µL of enzyme
conjugate to each well. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at
37°C. f. Wash the wells four times with 300 µL of prepared
wash buffer. g. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
Incubate the plate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature,
protected from light. h. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well
to terminate the reaction.
3. Read the Plate: a. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
E. Calculation of Results:
1. Deduct the average blank control absorbance value from all
other absorbance readings.
2. Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
of the standards against their corresponding concentrations on
a linear or semi-logarithmic graph.
3. Determine the concentration of SHRIMP IGG in patient samples
by interpolating the absorbance readings from the standard
curve.
F. Quality Control:
1. Each assay must include negative and positive controls, along
with a set of standards.
2. Verify that control readings are within expected ranges before
interpreting patient results.
3. Document all controls and patient sample results in a logbook.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Report SHRIMP IGG concentrations in international units per
milliliter (IU/mL).
2. Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for result
interpretation.
3. Include comments if results are outside the expected ranges or
if technical difficulties occur.
H. Method Limitations:
Refer to the kit manufacturer’s insert for limitations and potential
interferences that may affect test results.
4. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL:
1. Handle all reagents and patient samples using appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Dispose of biological and chemical waste in accordance with
institutional and regulatory guidelines.

5. REVIEW AND REVISION:
This SOP shall be reviewed on an annual basis and updated as
necessary to incorporate new regulations, technologies, or
procedural improvements. Changes should be documented and
communicated to all relevant personnel.
This document outlines the comprehensive guidelines for the
consistent and reliable analysis of SHRIMP IGG levels in patient
serum, ensuring stringent adherence to quality control and safety
standards.
