Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Sialic
Acid, Free and Total, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To define the analytical method and procedure for the quantitative
determination of free and total sialic acid in random urine samples,
following receipt and accessioning.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the assay as
described in this SOP and for adhering to the quality control
protocols. The supervisory staff is responsible for ensuring
adherence to this SOP, troubleshooting issues, and validating results
prior to reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Random urine
• Volume: Minimum of 5 mL preferred
• Collection: Collect urine in a sterile container
• Stability: Room temperature for up to 2 hours; refrigerate at 2-8°C
for up to 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Sialic Acid Assay Kit
• Pipettes and Pipette tips
• Microplate reader
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Deionized water
• 96-well microplates
• Standard calibrators (provided with the kit)
• Quality control material (commercially available)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify that all reagents, standards, calibrators, and controls are
within their expiry date and stored under recommended
conditions.
2. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature prior
to analysis.
3. Thoroughly mix each urine sample before analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards provided in the assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare quality control samples following the manufacturer’s
instructions or use commercially available controls.
3. Perform all assays in duplicate to ensure accuracy.
C. Sample Preparation and Handling
1. Centrifuge urine samples at 1,500 g for 5 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
2. Pipette appropriate volumes of the urine sample, calibrators,
and controls into assigned wells of a 96-well microplate,
following assay protocol.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Add reagents to the wells as directed by the Sialic Acid Assay
Kit instructions.
2. Cover the microplate and incubate for the specified time at
room temperature.
3. Measure absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (example:
570 nm) using a microplate reader.
4. Record absorbance readings and calculate the concentration of
free and total sialic acid from the construct standard curve.
6. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
1. Subtract the blank reading from all sample, standard, and
control readings.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the concentration of
standards on the x-axis and the corresponding absorbance on
the y-axis.
3. Use the standard curve to interpolate the concentration of free
and total sialic acid in urine samples.
4. Ensure all sample readings fall within the linear range of the
assay. Dilute samples if necessary and re-assay.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Include low, medium, and high concentration control samples in
each assay run.
2. Compare control sample results to established expected value
ranges.
3. Repeat analysis if controls are out of expected range until
acceptable results are obtained.
B. External Quality Assurance:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy of assay results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
2. Report results in mg/dL (or according to lab specific units).
3. Flag any abnormal results based on lab-specific reference
intervals.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Free Sialic Acid: [Lab-specific interval, e.g., 0-2 mg/dL]
• Total Sialic Acid: [Lab-specific interval, e.g., 0-10 mg/dL]
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit instructions for specific limitations related to the
detection and quantification of sialic acid.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Sialic Acid Assay Kit.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and laboratory manuals.
12. REVISION HISTORY
[Include detailed revision history with dates and descriptions of
changes.]
By following this SOP, laboratorians can effectively and consistently
perform the accurate analysis of sialic acid levels in random urine
samples, ensuring high-quality results and reliable patient care.
