Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Sickle Cell Test, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the sickle cell test in blood, including all steps
from specimen preparation to result reporting. The goal is to ensure
accurate and timely results while maintaining adherence to set
standards and quality controls.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for executing the steps
outlined in this procedure. The staff must also identify any deviations
or issues that may affect test results and report them to the
supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP and
monitoring corrective actions when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes
◦ Minimum volume: 2 mL
◦ Specimens should be kept at refrigerated temperatures
(2-8°C) if not processed immediately.
◦ Specimens must be received within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected in EDTA tubes.
• Clotted specimens or specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens received beyond the 24-hour time frame post-
collection.
Preparation:
• Mix the EDTA blood specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion 8-10
times.
• Ensure that the specimen has been properly labeled with patient
identification, collection time, and date.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
Materials:
• Reagent kit specific for sickle cell test (e.g., Sickledex reagent)
• Positive and negative controls
Equipment:
• Light microscope
• Centrifuge
• Test tubes
• Pipettes
1. PROCEDURE
2. Prepare the test reagents and controls as specified by the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Label test tubes for each specimen, including patient ID and
collection time.
4. Pipette 2 mL of the patient’s blood into a clean test tube.
5. Add the required amount of reagent (as specified in the
reagent’s insert) to the blood sample to initiate the test reaction.
6. After adding the reagent, gently mix the contents of the test
tube to ensure a homogenous mixture.
7. Allow the mixture to stand for the time indicated in the reagent’s
instructions.
8. Observe and record the appearance of the solution:
◦ Positive: Solution turns turbid; presence of sickle
hemoglobin (HbS).
◦ Negative: Solution remains clear or slightly turbid; absence
of sickle hemoglobin (HbS).
9. For positive results, confirm with microscopic examination of
blood smear:
◦ Prepare a blood smear and stain according to laboratory
protocols.
◦ Examine under the microscope for the presence of sickle
cells.
10. Record the microscopic observations along with the results
from the initial reagent test.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure the accuracy of the test.
• Controls must yield expected results; otherwise, repeat the test
batch after troubleshooting.
• Document all control results in the QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All test results must be recorded, including observations from
reagent testing and microscopic examination.
• Negative Results: Report as "Sickle Cell Test - Negative for HbS."
• Positive Results: Report as "Sickle Cell Test - Positive for HbS.
Sickle cells observed under microscopic examination."
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for further details.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for reagent-specific limitations and
interferences affecting the sickle cell test.
