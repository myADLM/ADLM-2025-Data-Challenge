Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Sickle Solubility, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process for performing and reporting the Sickle
Solubility test on patient blood specimens. This test determines the
presence of Hemoglobin S, which causes sickle cell disease or trait.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
Sickle Solubility test as per this procedure and ensure that the results
are accurately recorded and communicated.
2. DEFINITION
The Sickle Solubility test is a qualitative screening assay used to
detect the presence of Hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S is insoluble in
specific solutions, leading to the formation of a cloudy precipitate
when present.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 2-5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) or ACD
(yellow top) tube.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in tubes containing sodium fluoride or citrate
Stability:
• The specimen should be tested within 24 hours of collection if
stored at room temperature (15-25°C). If refrigerated (2-8°C), it
can be stable up to 7 days.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Laboratory timer
• Test tubes or microcentrifuge tubes
• Test tube rack
• Pipettes
Reagents:
• Working Sickle Solubility reagent (commercially available or
prepared in-house as per manufacturer’s instructions containing
sodium dithionite and a suitable osmotic stabilizer such as
saponin or detergent)
Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Disposable pipette tips
• Waste container for biohazard disposal
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure that reagents and equipment are at room
temperature and properly calibrated, if necessary.
◦ Label test tubes with patient identification.
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ Gently invert the blood collection tube to mix the specimen.
◦ Using a pipette, transfer 20 µL of whole blood into a labeled
test tube.
3. Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 2 mL of the working Sickle Solubility reagent to the
blood specimen in the test tube.
◦ Mix thoroughly by inverting gently and ensure there are no
air bubbles.
4. Incubation:
◦ Allow the mixture to stand at room temperature (15-25°C)
for 10 minutes. During this time, observe but do not disturb
the mixture.
5. Observation:
◦ After 10 minutes, observe the turbidity of the solution
against a white background.
◦ A positive test is indicated by a turbid/cloudy solution due to
the presence of Hemoglobin S.
◦ A negative test results in a clear solution.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with patient samples to ensure
test validity.
• Document control results. Control results must be within
acceptable limits as defined by quality assurance guidelines.
• Positive control: Known Hemoglobin S positive blood sample.
• Negative control: Hemoglobin S negative blood sample or saline
solution.
Procedure:
• Add positive control to a test tube with the reagent and follow
steps 2-5.
• Repeat for the negative control.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results as "Positive" if the test solution is turbid or cloudy.
• Record results as "Negative" if the test solution is clear.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The Sickle Solubility test does not differentiate between sickle cell
trait and disease.
• False positives can occur due to other hemoglobins or high
protein concentrations.
• False negatives can be seen in severe anemia or low red blood
cell count specimens.

• Manufacturer's instructions for the Sickle Solubility reagent.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines and standards.
10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of biohazardous materials according to safety and waste
disposal protocols.
Note: This protocol must be reviewed and approved by laboratory
management and/or the clinical laboratory director before being
implemented.
