Analytical Phase Protocol for STAT6 Testing - Technical
Component Only
1. Purpose This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical
phase in generating results for Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription 6 (STAT6) testing. The purpose of this protocol is to
ensure accurate and reproducible results following established
laboratory methods. This SOP applies solely to the technical
component of the testing process.
2. Responsibility All designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing STAT6 testing according to this protocol. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any anomalies or issues during the
testing process and report them to the laboratory supervisor.
Supervisors must ensure that all testing is performed and
documented according to the procedure.
3. Definitions STAT6: A protein involved in signal transduction and
activation of transcription. It plays an important role in cellular
responses and regulation of gene expression.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Accepted specimens include fixed tissue paraffin embedded
(FFPE) blocks, slides, or RNA samples.
• Specimens must be appropriately labeled with patient
identification details and requisition forms.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• STAT6 antibody
• Positive and negative controls
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining equipment or Real-Time
PCR equipment
• Tween 20, Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS)
• DAB substrate kit for IHC
• RNA extraction kits and Real-Time PCR reagents (if applicable)
• Microscopy supplies and devices
• Standard lab PPE
6. Procedure A. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for STAT6:
1. Pre-Staining: Prepare FFPE specimens by sectioning and
mounting on slides.
◦ Deparaffinize and rehydrate sections using graded alcohols.
2. Antigen Retrieval: Perform antigen retrieval using an
appropriate buffer solution.
◦ Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) is commonly used.
3. Blocking: Incubate sections with blocking solution to minimize
non-specific binding.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation: Incubate slides with STAT6-
specific antibody at optimized concentration for recommended
duration.
◦ Wash with PBS/Tween 20 buffer.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation: Incubate slides with
secondary antibody specific to STAT6.
◦ Wash with PBS/Tween 20 buffer.
6. Detection: Develop sections using DAB substrate or other
chromogenic substrate.
7. Counterstaining and Mounting: Counterstain with
hematoxylin and mount coverslips.
8. Microscopy: Examine and document STAT6 staining patterns
using a microscope. Capture digital images for record-keeping.
B. Real-Time PCR for STAT6:
1. RNA Extraction: Extract high-quality RNA from specimens
using an RNA extraction kit.
2. cDNA Synthesis: Convert RNA to cDNA using reverse
transcription reagents.
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for optimal yield.
3. PCR Setup: Prepare PCR reaction mix with STAT6-specific
primers and probes.
◦ Include positive and negative controls.
4. Real-Time PCR Cycling: Run Real-Time PCR with specified
cycling conditions.
◦ Monitor amplification curves and CT values.
5. Data Analysis: Analyze amplification data to determine STAT6
expression levels.
◦ Normalize against housekeeping genes.
6. Reporting: Document results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
7. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each testing batch.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of equipment.
• Verify antibody lot numbers and expirations.
• Document all sample preparation, testing, and results in the LIS.
8. Result Reporting
• Ensure all results are verified by a technologist before transmitting
to the healthcare provider.
• Include control results and interpretation notes.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
9. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for STAT6 antibodies, PCR reagents,
and kits.
• Industry-standard protocols for IHC and Real-Time PCR.
• Laboratory's internal quality control procedures.
10. Notes
• This protocol is subject to revision following new updates in
laboratory standards and technology.
• Any troubleshooting instances must be recorded and reported to
the supervisor for further action.
11. Documentation
• All procedures, results, and quality control checks are to be duly
recorded in the laboratory’s information system.
• Maintain confidentiality and integrity of patient data according to
HIPAA guidelines.
