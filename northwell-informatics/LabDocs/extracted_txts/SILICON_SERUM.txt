Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Silicon in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the accurate
and precise analysis of silicon in serum samples in accordance with
industry standards and guidelines.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow
the procedures and guidelines outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
compliance with this SOP and address any deviations or issues.
1. DEFINITION
Silicon is an essential trace element involved in various physiological
processes. Accurate measurement of silicon in serum is important for
assessing exposure, nutritional status, and potential toxicity.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a silicon-free tube.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C and up to 3
months at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing silicon.
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for over
24 hours.
3.2 EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)
• Silicon-free laboratory glassware and containers
• Calibration standards for silicon
• Quality control (QC) materials: Certified reference materials with
known silicon concentrations
• Nitric acid (ultrapure)
• Deionized water (ultrapure)
3.3 CALIBRATION
• Prepare calibration standards with known concentrations of silicon
using certified reference materials.
• Calibration standards should bracket the expected concentration
range of silicon in serum samples.
• Run calibration standards before sample analysis to establish a
calibration curve.
• Verify calibration accuracy by analyzing QC materials.
3.4 PROCEDURE FOR SILICON ANALYSIS
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to come to room temperature.
◦ If frozen, thaw samples completely and mix gently.
◦ Dilute serum samples with ultrapure nitric acid (1:1) in
silicon-free containers.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Initialize and calibrate the ICP-MS or AAS according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Set the instrument parameters for silicon analysis
(wavelength, plasma conditions, etc.).
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Analyze calibration standards and QC materials to ensure
instrument accuracy.
◦ Analyze prepared serum samples.
◦ Perform a rinsing step between samples using ultrapure
deionized water to prevent contamination.
4. Data Review:
◦ Review analytical data for each sample.
◦ Ensure that the silicon concentration falls within the
calibration range.
◦ Reanalyze samples if necessary to confirm results.
3.5 QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze QC materials at the beginning and end of sample runs.
• Include at least one blank sample and a duplicate sample in each
analytic batch.
• Record and monitor QC results to ensure they fall within
acceptable limits.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
sample analysis.
3.6 REPORTING RESULTS
• Report silicon concentrations in serum in µg/L (micrograms per
liter) or as specified based on clinical relevance.
• Review and verify all results prior to reporting.
• Report any results that fall outside of the reportable range with
appropriate comments.
3.7 METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s user manual for limitations related to
the instrumentation.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with silicon
measurements.
• Ensure silicon-free container use to avoid contamination.
3.8 REFERENCES
• ICP-MS or AAS manufacturer’s user manual.
• Current literature on clinical silicon analysis and nutritional
guidelines.
