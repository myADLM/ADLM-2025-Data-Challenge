SOP Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Silver
Birch, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose: The purpose of this SOP is to provide a
comprehensive guide for the analytical phase of generating
results for Silver Birch IgE testing in serum samples. This
includes detailed instructions for handling, processing, and
analyzing the samples, as well as ensuring the quality and
accuracy of the results.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Silver Birch IgE testing in serum samples in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. Definitions:
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a class of antibodies involved in allergic
reactions.
• Silver Birch IgE: IgE antibodies specific to Silver Birch pollen,
indicating an allergic response.
1. Responsibility:
• Laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure,
troubleshooting issues, and ensuring compliance with quality
control measures.
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen: Serum.
• Collection tube: SST or plain red-top tube.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum is stable for 48 hours at room temperature, 7
days refrigerated (2-8°C), and up to 1 month frozen (-20°C).
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples;
specimens in anticoagulant tubes; specimens not labeled
properly.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia, Immulite)
• Silver Birch IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• SST or plain red-top tubes
• Quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. Procedure:
7.1. Preparation:
• Verify the specimen information and integrity. Accept or reject the
specimen based on the criteria mentioned in section 5.
• Briefly centrifuge the samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes if not
already separated.
7.2. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run appropriate controls (positive and negative) for each batch of
assays to ensure assay accuracy.
• Document calibration and QC results in the appropriate log.
7.3. Sample Loading and Analysis:
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is operational and in the
readiness state.
• Load samples, controls, and reagents into the analyzer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Enter patient and sample identification into the laboratory
information system (LIS) or analyzer interface.
• Initiate the assay run and monitor the analyzer for any error
messages or alerts.
7.4. Result Verification:
• After the assay run, review the generated results for each sample.
• Check for flags or error messages related to each result.
Investigate and resolve any discrepancies per the analyzer's
troubleshooting guide.
• Compare patient sample results with the control results to ensure
consistency and reliability.
7.5. Reporting Results:
• Transfer verified results from the immunoassay analyzer to the
LIS.
• Evaluate patient results against established reference intervals:
◦ Normal: <0.35 kUA/L
◦ Equivocal: 0.35-0.70 kUA/L
◦ Positive: >0.70 kUA/L
• Document any critical or atypical results and notify the appropriate
healthcare provider according to the laboratory’s policies.
7.6. Quality Control and Trouble-Shooting:
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, repeat the assays
for the affected samples.
• If persistent issues occur, refer to the manufacturer's maintenance
and troubleshooting guide or contact technical support.
• Document all QC activities, maintenance, and troubleshooting
steps in the appropriate logs.
1. Method Limitations:
• Interference: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples may impact
result accuracy.
• Cross-reactivity: Other plant or pollen proteins may exhibit cross-
reactivity, potentially affecting specificity.
1. Safety and Compliance:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols and wear appropriate PPE.
• Ensure all waste is disposed of according to biohazard
regulations.
• Maintain compliance with all relevant regulations and
accreditation standards, including CLIA.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the immunoassay analyzer and
Silver Birch IgE reagent kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory quality management systems documentation.
1. Revision History:
• Document any changes or updates to this SOP and obtain
necessary approvals.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely results for Silver Birch IgE testing in serum
samples.
