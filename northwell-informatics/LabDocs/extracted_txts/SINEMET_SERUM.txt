Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SINEMET (Carbidopa-Levodopa), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for SINEMET (Carbidopa-Levodopa) in serum, ensuring
accuracy, precision, and compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing SINEMET
(Carbidopa-Levodopa) analysis in serum.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis using this SOP to ensure consistency and reliability of
results. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring staff
adherence to these procedures and maintaining the quality control
standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum obtained from a blood sample using standard
venipuncture technique.
• Specimen should be separated from the cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store and transport specimen at 2-8°C and avoid hemolysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with evidence of hemolysis.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA).
• Samples not appropriately labeled or without collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or an
equivalent analyzer validated for SINEMET analysis.
• Calibrators and internal standards for Carbidopa and Levodopa.
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, buffer solutions).
• Serum sample tubes.
• Methanol, acetonitrile and other reagents as per method
requirement.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. Mix serum samples gently by inversion.
3. Pipette 1 mL of serum sample into a clean, labeled tube.
4. Add 200 µL of internal standard (IS) solution to the serum
sample.
5. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds to ensure thorough mixing.
6. Add 1 mL of methanol to precipitate proteins, then vortex for 1
minute.
7. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
8. Transfer the supernatant to a new labeled tube and evaporate
to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 37°C.
9. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of mobile phase and
vortex for 30 seconds before analysis.
B. HPLC Instrument Setup
1. Column: Select a suitable reverse-phase column according to
method validation.
2. Mobile Phase: Prepare the mobile phase as per validated
method, typically a mixture of water (0.1% formic acid) and
acetonitrile.
3. Flow Rate: Set the flow rate to 1.0 mL/min.
4. Detection: Set the UV detector wavelength to 280 nm for
Levodopa and 325 nm for Carbidopa, or as optimized.
5. Column Temperature: Maintain at 25-30°C.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards ranging from low to high
concentrations of Carbidopa and Levodopa.
2. Run a calibration curve by injecting calibration standards before
running the samples.
3. Run quality control (QC) samples (low, medium, high
concentration) at the beginning, middle, and end of sample
runs.
4. Ensure calibration curve r² value is > 0.99 for both analytes.
5. Accept a run only if QC samples are within accepted
tolerances.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Inject 20 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system.
2. Record the retention times and peak areas for Carbidopa and
Levodopa.
3. Run samples in duplicate to ensure reproducibility.
4. Compare the sample chromatograms to the calibration curve to
quantify the Carbidopa and Levodopa concentrations.
E. Reporting Results
1. Ensure the results of duplicate measurements are within ±20%
of each other.
2. Average the duplicates if they meet the criteria, otherwise re-
run the sample.
3. Report results in ng/mL or as specified by the clinical
requirements.
4. Document all results including sample ID, run ID, QC results,
and any deviations observed.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform external quality controls at least once per run using
certified reference material.
• Regularly check and document the performance of the HPLC
system including detector sensitivity and column efficiency.
• Any QC failures must be investigated, and corrective actions
implemented before sample analysis proceeds.
8. REFERENCES
• HPLC method validation guidelines.
• Manufacturer's instructions for HPLC equipment.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on Carbidopa and
Levodopa analysis.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING
• Maintain a logbook for all analytical runs including dates, times,
personnel, and any deviations.
• Store raw data, calibration curves, quality control data, and final
results according to laboratory data retention policies and CLIA
requirements.
10. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of PPE.
• Handle all reagents and samples in accordance with safety data
sheets (SDS).
• Dispose of waste materials following institutional and regulatory
guidelines.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results or instrument errors occur, consult the
instrument manual and method validation documents.
• Document any troubleshooting steps taken and results observed.
This protocol must be followed precisely to ensure the generation of
accurate and reliable results for SINEMET (Carbidopa-Levodopa) in
serum. All deviations and corrective actions must be documented and
reviewed by the laboratory supervisor.
