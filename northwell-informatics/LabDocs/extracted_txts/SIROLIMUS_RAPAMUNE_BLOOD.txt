Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Sirolimus (Rapamune), Blood
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase
involved in generating accurate and reliable results for Sirolimus
(Rapamune) blood levels in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow this
procedure accurately to ensure quality results are generated.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure
and addressing any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in either EDTA (purple top) or lithium
heparin (green top) tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum: 2 mL
• Preferred: 4 mL
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA or lithium heparin.
• Grossly hemolyzed samples.
• Samples with visible clots.
• Improperly labeled specimens.
Specimen Collection:
• Ensure the patient is appropriately identified and informed
consent is obtained.
• Collect the blood sample in the appropriate collection tube.
• Invert the tube gently several times to mix the anticoagulant with
the blood.
Specimen Transport:
• Transport specimens to the laboratory promptly to avoid
degradation.
• If transporting samples offsite, ensure they are appropriately
packaged with temperature control measures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Analytical balance.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator/freezer for sample storage.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Sirolimus (Rapamune) calibration standards.
• Sirolimus quality control materials.
• HPLC or LC-MS/MS grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile).
• Mobile phase reagents as per method requirements.
• Clean vials and tubes for sample preparation.
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coats, safety glasses).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature, if applicable.
2. Vortex the sample for approximately 1 minute to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
4. Using a calibrated pipette, transfer the plasma or serum to a
clean vial.
5. Prepare the samples along with calibration standards and
quality controls.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Perform calibration verification to establish linearity across the
assay range.
3. Use at least three levels of quality control materials (low,
medium, high) in each analytical run.
C. Instrument Setup:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system as per manufacturer
guidelines.
2. Prepare and degas the mobile phase as required.
3. Ensure the column is conditioned and equilibrated to the
appropriate temperature.
4. Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and quality
controls onto the autosampler.
D. Analytical Run:
1. Program the analytical run sequence in the instrument control
software, including blanks, calibration standards, quality
controls, and patient samples.
2. Set the method parameters (e.g., flow rate, column
temperature, gradient program) according to the validated
assay protocol.
3. Initiate the run and monitor the instrument performance
throughout the analysis.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Review the chromatograms generated by the HPLC or LC-MS/
MS system.
2. Verify the integrity of quality control results to ensure the assay
is within acceptable limits.
3. Calculate the concentration of Sirolimus in patient samples
using the calibration curve.
4. Review any atypical results and address analytical flags or
issues immediately.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Ensure that quality control materials are analyzed with each
batch of patient samples.
7. Check that quality controls fall within the established limits
before reporting patient results.
8. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken in the
quality control log.
9. Perform a 3-patient comparison with another validated
instrument if quality control outliers are detected.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed
by the technologist.
12. Verify results for accuracy before release.
13. Enter comments or special instructions for results as needed.
14. Report critical values per the established laboratory protocol,
including immediate notification to the requesting clinician if
required.
15. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND CRITICAL RESULTS
16. Inspect samples for any indications of hemolysis or clotting and
document appropriately.
17. Report critical results following the laboratory's critical values
policy, ensuring proper documentation and clinician
communication.
18. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the laboratory's reference intervals for Sirolimus
(Rapamune) as determined by the assay validation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay validation and instrument method description
for limitations related to the assay.
References:
• Refer to the manufacturer's package insert and the assay
validation documentation for detailed instructions and quality
control specifics.
This SOP is subject to periodic review and updates to maintain
compliance with current best practices and regulatory guidelines.
