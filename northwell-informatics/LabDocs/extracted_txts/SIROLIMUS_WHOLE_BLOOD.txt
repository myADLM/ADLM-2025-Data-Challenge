Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Sirolimus, Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for Sirolimus in whole blood specimens, ensuring accurate
and reliable results are produced and documented according to
standardized laboratory protocols.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel authorized and trained
to perform Sirolimus whole blood level testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Technologists: Perform the procedure as described, ensuring
accuracy and reliability of results.
• Supervisors: Oversee and verify compliance with the SOP,
address any issues, and ensure proper training of personnel.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Sample Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
Sample Stability:
• Refrigerated: Stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
• Frozen: Stable for up to 3 months at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Clotted or hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) or
equivalent.
• Sirolimus calibration standards.
• Sirolimus control samples (low, medium, and high levels).
• Extraction reagents.
• Analytical columns for LC-MS/MS.
• EDTA tubes for collection and storage.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Mixing:
◦ Gently invert the EDTA tube 8-10 times to ensure mixing.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Aliquot 100-200 µL of whole blood into a labeled
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Protein Precipitation (if applicable):
◦ Add appropriate volume of protein precipitating reagent (as
per method validation) to the aliquot.
◦ Vortex briefly to mix.
◦ Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a new labeled tube.
6.2 LC-MS/MS Analysis: 4. Instrument Setup: - Ensure LC-MS/MS
is calibrated and properly maintained. - Load the analytical column as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. - Program the LC-MS/MS with
validated method parameters for Sirolimus.
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run a full calibration curve using Sirolimus calibration
standards.
◦ Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
2. Sample Injection:
◦ Inject sample extracts and ensure each is followed by a
blank to prevent carryover.
◦ Follow the sequence of calibration standards, quality
controls, patient samples, and blanks.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire data according to method parameters.
◦ Monitor and record retention times, peak areas, and mass-
to-charge ratios.
6.3 Data Analysis: 8. Integration and Quantification: - Integrate
peaks corresponding to Sirolimus. - Quantify Sirolimus levels using
calibration curves. - Ensure all quality control samples are within
acceptable ranges.
6.4 Recording and Reporting: 9. Documentation: - Record all
relevant data including instrument settings, calibration, and QC
results in the designated logbook or electronic system.
1. Result Verification:
◦ Verify results to check all controls are within specified limits.
◦ Repeat the analysis if discrepancies are found.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Communicate critical values to the appropriate healthcare
provider promptly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Routine performance of quality controls (daily at a minimum
before patient samples).
• Acceptability criteria must be established for calibration curves,
and quality controls must meet defined parameters.
• Adhere to corrective actions for any out-of-range controls.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of PPE
(Personal Protective Equipment).
• Handle and dispose of biological samples and reagents according
to biohazard guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manual for LC-MS/MS instrumentation.
• Sirolimus assay validation protocol.
• CLIA regulations for analytical methods.
10. REVISION HISTORY
• Date of creation: October 2023.
• Revisions and review dates: To be documented as necessary.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure high
standards of accuracy, consistency, and reliability in the analysis and
reporting of Sirolimus levels in whole blood specimens.
