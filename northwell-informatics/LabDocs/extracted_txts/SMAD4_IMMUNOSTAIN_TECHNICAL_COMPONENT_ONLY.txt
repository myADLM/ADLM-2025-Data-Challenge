Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SMAD4 Immunostain:
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical process for generating results for
SMAD4 immunostaining of tissue specimens in the laboratory. The
standardized procedure ensures the consistent and accurate
application of the SMAD4 immunostain and includes guidelines for
quality control and documentation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
staining procedure and document the results accurately. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring the adherence to the procedure and
addressing any issues that arise during the process.
1. DEFINITION
SMAD4 Immunostain: A specific immunohistochemical stain used to
detect the presence of SMAD4 protein in tissue sections.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark ULTRA,
Leica Bond, Dako Autostainer)
• Microtome
• Warm water bath
• Slide drying oven
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• SMAD4 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated with an enzyme (e.g., HRP-DAB)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate kit)
• Positive control tissue slides
• Negative control (e.g., no primary antibody or isotype control)
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
• Microscope slides (charged)
• Coverslips
• Forceps
• Water bath solution (distilled water)
• Absorbent paper
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Retrieve paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from storage.
2. Cut tissue sections at 4-5 microns using a microtome.
3. Place tissue sections on charged microscope slides.
4. Dry slides in a slide drying oven at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure
tissue adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 3 cycles of 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%, and 50%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval by placing slides in a
preheated retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0) and
heating in a microwave, pressure cooker, or automated system
according to manufacturer recommendations.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Load slides into the automated immunostainer.
2. Apply SMAD4 primary antibody to each slide and incubate
according to the manufacturer's instructions (typically 30-60
minutes).
3. Rinse slides with wash buffer provided by the automated
system.
4. Apply secondary antibody conjugated with HRP and incubate
according to the system’s protocol.
5. Develop the chromogen reaction using DAB substrate solution
until optimal color development is achieved (typically 5-10
minutes).
6. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes, rinse in distilled
water.
7. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (50%, 70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
E. Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium to each slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and allow slides to dry.
F. Quality Control:
1. Include a positive control slide known to express SMAD4 in
each staining run.
2. Include a negative control slide by omitting the primary
antibody.
3. Review stained slides under a light microscope to ensure
appropriate staining and compare with control slides.
4. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
5. Document date, time, and initials of the personnel performing
the staining.
6. Record any deviations or issues encountered during the
staining process and corrective actions taken.
7. Verify the accuracy and completeness of all entries.
8. REFERENCES
Include references for manufacturer's instructions for SMAD4
antibodies and equipment used in the staining process.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP shall be reviewed annually and approved by laboratory
management to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and
best practices.
By conducting SMAD4 immunostaining as outlined, the laboratory
ensures high-quality, reproducible results essential for accurate
pathological interpretation.
