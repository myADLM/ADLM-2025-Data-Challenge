Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized method for the analysis of Small Dense
Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (sdLDL-C) in serum samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for executing the
procedure as defined. It is imperative that all laboratory staff adhere
to the protocol to ensure accuracy and reliability of test results.
Supervisors must ensure proper training and compliance with the
procedure.
2. DEFINITION:
Small Dense Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (sdLDL-C) refers
to the cholesterol carried by small dense LDL particles. These
particles are more atherogenic and are considered an important
marker for cardiovascular risk assessment.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator
• Serum collection tubes (red or gold top)
• sdLDL-C assay kit (e.g., Denka Seiken sd-LDL Cholesterol Assay
Kit)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Microplate reader or dedicated clinical chemistry analyzer
• Standard laboratory PPE (personal protective equipment)
4. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Requirements:
1. Preferred Sample:
◦ Serum collected in a red or gold top tube.
2. Stability:
◦ Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days. If longer storage is required, samples must be
frozen at -20°C or colder.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum sample to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Centrifuge the serum sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes
to separate the serum from the clot.
3. Carefully pipette the supernatant serum into a clean, labeled
tube.
C. Reagents and Calibration:
1. Prepare reagents and calibrators as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
3. Perform calibration using the calibrators provided in the assay
kit.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run both low and high control sera at the beginning of each
run.
2. Quality control results must be within the specified ranges
provided by the assay kit.
E. Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
serum samples into the designated wells of the microplate or
tubes for analysis.
2. Add the appropriate volume of reagents to each well/tube as
specified by the assay kit protocol.
3. Incubate the microplate or tubes at the specified temperature
and duration as per the kit instructions.
4. After incubation, measure the absorbance using a microplate
reader or clinical chemistry analyzer set at the specific
wavelength mentioned in the kit instruction.
5. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION:
• Calculate sdLDL-C concentration in the serum samples using the
calibration curve generated from the standard solutions. Ensure
all calculations are consistent with the instructions in the assay kit.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report sdLDL-C results as mg/dL or mmol/L.
• The report should include the sample ID, patient identifiers, date
of analysis, sdLDL-C concentration, and reference range.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal reference interval: Typically <20 mg/dL; Cross-reference
the manufacturer’s insert for specific ranges.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the specific sdLDL-C assay kit for detailed limitations. Note
potential interferences from hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus, and
ensure that these are checked before performing the assay.
9. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• Handle all specimens and materials as potentially infectious.
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols and standard precautions.
• Ensure proper disposal of biohazardous materials per laboratory
regulations.
10. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain records of calibration, quality controls, and patient
results in the laboratory information system.
• Record any deviations from the SOP along with corrective actions
taken.
