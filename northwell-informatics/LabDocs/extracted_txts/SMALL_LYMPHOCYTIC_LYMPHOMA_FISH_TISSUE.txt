STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed and standardized
procedure for the analytical phase of generating fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) results for small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)
using tissue specimens. This ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists must perform the FISH analysis
and document the results as defined in this SOP. It is also their
responsibility to identify and address any deficiencies that may affect
test results and bring them to the attention of the supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing that the FISH analysis is
conducted according to the protocol, and any corrective actions
required are performed and documented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
Specimen Preparation:
• Sections should be cut at 4-5 microns and mounted on positively
charged slides.
• Ensure tissue specimens are properly fixed and have not dried
out.
• Bake slides at 56°C for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• FISH probe specific for small lymphocytic lymphoma (such as LSI
TP53 and ATM probes)
• Pre-treatment solutions (citrate buffer, formamide, SSC)
• Hybridization buffer
• DAPI counterstain
Equipment:
• FISH hybridization oven
• Fluorescence microscope
• Water bath set at 95°C
• Humidity chamber
• Centrifuge
Supplies:
• Positively charged microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Tissue embedding medium
• Pipettes and pipette tips
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Treatment of Tissue Sections
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes, twice.
◦ Rehydrate slides in a series of ethanol washes: 100%
ethanol for 5 minutes, twice; followed by 95%, 80%, and
70% ethanol each for 3 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Heat slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a water bath at 95°C
for 20 minutes.
◦ Let slides cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in distilled water for 5 minutes, twice.
B. FISH Probe Hybridization
1. Denaturation:
◦ Apply 10 µL of FISH probe mix to the target area of the
tissue slide.
◦ Place coverslip and seal edges with rubber cement.
◦ Denature slides in a hybridization oven at 73°C for 5
minutes.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Incubate slides in a humid chamber at 37°C overnight
(14-18 hours).
C. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Wash slides in 2x SSC at room temperature for 5 minutes,
twice.
2. Rinse slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 73°C for 2 minutes.
3. Briefly wash in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1
minute.
D. Counterstaining and Analysis
1. Air dry slides in the dark.
2. Apply DAPI counterstain and mount with coverslip.
3. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope using
appropriate filters.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of slides.
• Ensure proper calibration of the fluorescence microscope.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
• Review FISH signals manually and corroborate with automated
analysis if available.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Document FISH findings, including signal enumeration and any
observed anomalies.
3. Verify results accuracy by cross-referencing with controls.
4. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring proper verification.
5. Provide interpretation of results in the context of the patient’s
clinical information.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for FISH probe kits.
• Relevant literature on FISH testing in small lymphocytic
lymphoma.
1. VERSION HISTORY AND REVIEW
• Document version number, date of issue, and any updates.
• Schedule regular review of the SOP to ensure compliance with
current best practices and guidelines.
This protocol aims to ensure rigorous standards are maintained for
the effective and accurate performance of FISH analysis for small
lymphocytic lymphoma using tissue specimens.
