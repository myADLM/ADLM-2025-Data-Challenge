SMITH-LEMLI-OPITZ SCREEN, PLASMA PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and reporting of SMITH-
LEMLI-OPITZ SCREEN in plasma to ensure accurate and timely
results. The testing is performed to determine the levels of 7-
dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) and other sterols in the plasma, which
are indicative of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing the analysis as described in this
procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
deficiencies during the analytical phase that may affect test results
and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma
Collection:
• Collect blood in a lithium heparin or EDTA tube.
• Minimum required volume: 2 mL of plasma.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the collected blood at 1000-2000 g for 10-15 minutes
to separate the plasma from blood cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Transfer the plasma into a clean, labeled polypropylene tube.
• Store plasma samples at -20°C or lower until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in a tube other than lithium heparin or EDTA
tube.
• Specimens that have not been properly processed (e.g., plasma
not separated from cells within 2 hours).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a UV detector or Mass Spectrometer (MS)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Cryogenic freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Sonicator (if required)
• Polypropylene tubes
Reagents:
• HPLC-grade methanol, acetonitrile, and water
• Analytical standards for 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) and
cholesterol
• Calibration standards
• Mobile phase reagents specific to HPLC system
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare stock solutions of 7DHC and cholesterol in methanol.
2. Dilute stock solutions to prepare a series of calibration
standards covering the expected range of patient samples.
3. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex mix the samples to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 0.5 mL of plasma into a clean polypropylene tube.
4. Add 1 mL of methanol to the tube. Vortex mix for 1 minute.
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 12000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
6. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new polypropylene tube.
Avoid disturbing the pellet.
7. Evaporate the supernatant to dryness using a gentle stream of
nitrogen gas or a vacuum concentrator.
8. Reconstitute the residue in 100 µL of mobile phase (e.g.,
methanol:water 1:1). Vortex mix and sonicate if necessary.
HPLC or MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or Mass Spectrometer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Inject 10-20 µL of prepared sample, calibration standard, and
QC sample into the system.
3. Run the samples in duplicate or triplicate to ensure accuracy
and reproducibility.
4. Analyze the eluted compounds with UV detector or MS,
focusing on the specific retention times/mass transitions for
7DHC and cholesterol.
Interpreting Results:
1. Calculate the concentrations of 7DHC in the plasma samples
by comparing the sample peak areas with those of the
calibration standards.
2. Ensure the QC samples fall within the established acceptable
limits.
3. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and resolve the
issue before proceeding with sample analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. Review and verify the results for accuracy and completeness.
7. Results must be reviewed by a senior technologist or
supervisor before being finalized and reported.
8. For abnormal results indicative of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome,
consult with the clinical team as necessary.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Analyze QC samples at the beginning and end of each batch
run to ensure system performance.
11. Regularly calibrate and maintain the HPLC or Mass
Spectrometer as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
12. Troubleshoot and resolve any issues identified during QC
checks.
13. Document all QC activities and corrective actions taken in the
appropriate log.
14. METHOD LIMITATIONS
15. This method is specific to the identification and quantification of
7DHC and cholesterol in plasma.
16. Interference may occur from other sterols or compounds with
similar retention times/mass transitions.
17. Ensure that samples are not hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric to
avoid inaccurate results.
