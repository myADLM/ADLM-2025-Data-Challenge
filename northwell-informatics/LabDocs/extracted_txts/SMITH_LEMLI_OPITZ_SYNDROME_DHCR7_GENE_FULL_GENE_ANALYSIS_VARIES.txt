Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome, DHCR7 Gene,
Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Smith-Lemli-Opitz
Syndrome (SLOS) via DHCR7 gene full gene analysis. This process
will ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency in detecting
mutations in the DHCR7 gene.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory scientists are responsible for carrying out the
procedures as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results, ensuring
adherence to the procedure, and validating the final reports.
1. DEFINITION
Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is a genetic disorder caused by
mutations in the DHCR7 gene. This analysis involves sequencing the
entire coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the DHCR7 gene
to identify pathogenic variants.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify that the specimen has been correctly accessioned and is
suitable for analysis.
• Ensure proper documentation is available and confirm the patient
information.
B) DNA Extraction:
• Use a standardized kit or protocol for genomic DNA extraction
from the received biological sample.
• Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorometry (e.g., Qubit).
◦ Acceptable DNA purity: A260/A280 ratio of 1.8-2.0.
◦ DNA concentration should be sufficient for downstream
applications, generally >50 ng/μL.
C) PCR Amplification:
• Design primers to amplify all coding exons and exon-intron
boundaries of the DHCR7 gene.
• Perform PCR amplification following established protocols.
◦ PCR conditions should include appropriate positive and
negative controls to monitor performance.
• Verify PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis.
◦ Ensure clear and discrete bands corresponding to the
expected size of the target amplicons.
D) Sequencing:
• Purify PCR products using a suitable method (e.g., ExoSAP-IT or
column-based purification).
• Prepare sequencing reactions using a DNA sequencing kit (e.g.,
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit).
• Run the sequencing reactions on a capillary electrophoresis
platform (e.g., ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer).
◦ Include sequencing controls to monitor the quality of the
sequence data.
E) Data Analysis:
• Analyze the raw sequencing data using appropriate bioinformatics
tools (e.g., SeqScape, Mutation Surveyor).
• Align the obtained sequences against the DHCR7 reference
sequence (NCBI accession NM_001360).
◦ Identify and annotate variants, focusing on pathogenic
mutations that correlate with SLOS.
• Validate identified variants using secondary methods if required
(e.g., Sanger sequencing).
F) Interpretation and Reporting:
• Interpret identified variants in the context of SLOS based on
available literature and databases (e.g., ClinVar, OMIM).
• Generate a report detailing the identified variants, their potential
impact, and clinical significance.
◦ Include information on the method of analysis, coverage of the
gene, and limitations of the test.
• Review the report by a certified molecular geneticist or laboratory
director.
G) Record Keeping:
• Keep detailed records of all steps, including DNA extraction, PCR
conditions, electrophoresis results, and sequencing data.
• Maintain a secure and confidential database of patient results and
supporting documents.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Quality Control:
• Include positive controls with known DHCR7 mutations and
negative controls (no DNA template) in each run.
• Periodically verify the performance of the thermocycler,
sequencer, and other critical equipment.
• Participate in external proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons when available.
B) Corrective Action:
• Follow troubleshooting steps if control results are not within
acceptable limits.
• Document any deviations from standard procedures and
corrective actions taken.
