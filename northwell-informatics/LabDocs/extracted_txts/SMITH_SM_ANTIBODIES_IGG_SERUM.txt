SMITH (SM) ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the analysis and reporting of
Smith (SM) Antibodies, IgG, Serum to ensure accurate and reliable
test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL serum collected in a gel barrier tube (SST).
• Serum specimens should be separated from cells within 2 hours
of collection and stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable:
• Serum specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Specimens that have been hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without collection date/time
information.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA or
chemiluminescence instrument)
• Smith (SM) Antibodies, IgG assay kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to the assay
• Pipettes and tips
• Temperature control equipment (e.g., refrigerators)
• Timer
4. PROCEDURE
1. Pre-Analysis Preparation:
◦ Verify the specimen ID and check for any discrepancies.
◦ Ensure the specimen has been properly stored and is within
the acceptable limits.
2. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Power on the immunoassay analyzer and ensure it has
passed daily calibrations and quality control checks.
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure the temperature and humidity are within the
acceptable laboratory limits (refer to Temperature Monitoring
SOP).
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature.
◦ Gently mix serum samples by inversion.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the Smith (SM)
Antibodies, IgG assay kit.
◦ Pipette the required volume of serum into the assay wells or
tubes.
◦ Start the assay run by initiating the programmed protocol on
the analyzer.
5. Reading Results:
◦ Once the run is complete, review the results generated by
the instrument.
◦ Check the assay control results to ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
◦ If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
instrument and assay kit manufacturer's guidelines.
6. Troubleshooting:
◦ If the sample or control shows any signs of failure (e.g.,
hemolysis, improper calibration), repeat the assay with fresh
sample or control.
◦ If the issue persists, notify the designated supervisor.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC according to laboratory guidelines using specific
controls for Smith (SM) Antibodies, IgG assay.
• Record QC results in the QC log.
• Ensure QC results are within the accepted range. If out of range,
recalibrate the analyzer and rerun QC before analyzing patient
samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and validate results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Critical values should be reported immediately following
laboratory protocol (refer to Critical Result SOP).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Less than the threshold value defined by the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Positive: Equal or greater than the threshold value defined by the
manufacturer's instructions.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations associated with the
Smith (SM) Antibodies, IgG assay.
9. REFERENCES
• Assay kit insert for Smith (SM) Antibodies, IgG
• Manufacturer's instrument manuals
10. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain records of assay kits used, lot numbers, QC results, and
patient results according to the laboratory's record-keeping
guidelines.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to perform,
document, and report the assay according to this protocol and
identify any deficiencies that may impact test results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to these procedures and
addressing any corrective actions.
Note: This protocol must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
director before implementation.
