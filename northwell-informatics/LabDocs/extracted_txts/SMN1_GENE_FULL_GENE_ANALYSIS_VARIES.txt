STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) FOR SMN1
GENE, FULL GENE ANALYSIS, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedures for the accurate and efficient
analysis of the SMN1 gene, full gene analysis, ensuring that results
generated are reliable and meet the standards required for clinical
diagnostic testing.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory scientists and technologists will perform
the gene analysis and ensure proper documentation of
procedures and results.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to review and
validate the findings.
2. DEFINITIONS
SMN1 Gene Analysis: A test designed to identify mutations or
deletions in the SMN1 gene that may be associated with diseases
such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top)
tubes.
• Alternative: Buccal swabs collected using validated DNA
collection kits.
Specimen Stability:
• Peripheral blood: Stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. If longer
storage is required, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Buccal swabs: Stable at room temperature (15-30°C) for up to 7
days. For longer storage, refrigerate at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or inadequately filled tubes.
• Specimens without proper identification or labeling.
• Specimens received beyond the stability time frame.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Gel Electrophoresis Apparatus
• Real-time PCR Instrument
• DNA Extraction Kits
• SMN1-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-Free Water
• Standard molecular biology reagents (e.g., Taq Polymerase,
dNTPs, buffers)
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Peripheral Blood:
◦ Isolate genomic DNA using a validated DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
document the yield.
2. Buccal Swabs:
◦ Extract genomic DNA using a validated DNA extraction kit
optimized for buccal swabs.
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
document the yield.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Set up PCR reactions in a 50 µL total volume using SMN1-
specific primers.
2. Include appropriate positive and negative controls in every run.
3. Conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 Cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
4. Analyze the PCR products by gel electrophoresis to confirm the
presence of amplified segments.
C. Real-Time PCR (for quantitative analysis):
1. Prepare the real-time PCR mix including SMN1-specific probes.
2. Load the PCR mix into a 96-well plate, along with DNA samples
and controls.
3. Recommended conditions:
◦ Initial Activation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 40 Cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 10 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 30 seconds
4. Record and analyze amplification data using real-time PCR
software.
D. Data Interpretation:
1. Based on gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR results,
interpret the presence or absence of SMN1 gene mutations or
deletions.
2. Cross-reference findings with known mutation databases to
confirm any identified mutations.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control samples in each batch of
analysis.
• Validate new reagents and equipment before use.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of equipment.
• Document all QC results, ensuring they meet established criteria.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile and review data.
• Generate a comprehensive report including interpretation of the
results, detailing any mutations or deletions identified.
• Ensure correctness of the patient information on the report.
• Results are reviewed and authorized by a senior laboratory
scientist or pathologist before release.

This protocol ensures consistency, reliability, and accuracy in the
analytical phase of SMN1 gene full gene analysis. All laboratory
personnel must adhere strictly to these procedures.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimen integrity; compromised specimens may lead to
inaccurate results.
• Sensitivity may vary; any aberrant results should be verified or
retested.
• Amplification inhibition; thoroughly assess the presence of
inhibitors in the DNA extraction phase.
