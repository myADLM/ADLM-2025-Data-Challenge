SMOOTHELIN IMMUNOSTAIN – TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To outline procedures for the immunohistochemical staining of tissue
specimens using the Smoothelin antibody to ensure consistent,
reliable preparation and assessment of tissue samples.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the technical
preparation and staining of tissue specimens using Smoothelin
immunostain in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated histotechnologists are responsible for the
implementation of this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all
staff are trained and competent in this procedure.
• All staff members must follow this SOP and report any deviations
or issues to a supervising technologist or lab manager.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE).
• Ideal section thickness: 4 micrometers (µm).
• Appropriate positive and negative controls should be utilized.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Primary Antibody: Anti-Smoothelin antibody.
• Secondary Antibody and Polymer Detection System.
• Chromogen: e.g., DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine).
• Counterstain: e.g., Hematoxylin.
• Xylene, Ethanol (100%, 95%), and Distilled Water.
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., Citrate Buffer pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA
Buffer pH 9.0).
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for
washing.
• Automated stainer (if available) or manual staining equipment.
• Microscope slides and coverslips.
• Humidified chamber if staining manually.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place slides with FFPE tissue sections into a staining rack.
2. Deparaffinize sections by soaking in 3 changes of xylene, 5
minutes each.
3. Rehydrate through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%), 5
minutes each.
4. Wash in distilled water for 5 minutes.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using either Citrate Buffer (pH 6.0) or
Tris-EDTA Buffer (pH 9.0) in a microwave or pressure cooker.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes, followed by PBS or
TBS for 5 minutes.
C. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity
1. Incubate slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes.
D. Primary Antibody Application
1. Apply anti-Smoothelin primary antibody to each section.
2. Incubate according to the manufacturer's instructions (typically
30-60 minutes at room temperature).
3. Rinse slides thoroughly with PBS or TBS.
E. Secondary Antibody and Polymer Detection System
1. Apply secondary antibody as per the instructions provided in
the detection system kit.
2. Incubate slides for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse with PBS or TBS.
F. Chromogen Development
1. Apply DAB chromogen solution to each section.
2. Monitor the development under a microscope, typically for 3-10
minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
G. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
H. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%) and clear
with xylene.
2. Mount slides with a coverslip using a mounting medium.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
• Review controls to ensure correct staining pattern and
troubleshoot if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• This protocol covers the technical preparation only. Pathologists
or qualified personnel will review and interpret the stained
sections.
• Ensure results are documented and reported according to
laboratory SOPs.
1. REFERENCES
• Reference manufacturer’s guidelines for anti-Smoothelin antibody
and detection systems.
• For further information, consult the laboratory’s standard histology
and immunohistochemistry texts.
1. REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required.
