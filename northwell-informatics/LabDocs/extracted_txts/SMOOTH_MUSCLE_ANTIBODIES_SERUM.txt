Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Smooth Muscle
Antibodies (SMA), Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Smooth
Muscle Antibodies (SMA) in serum using Indirect
Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA). This test aids in the diagnosis of
autoimmune hepatitis and other related autoimmune disorders.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate and
timely analysis of SMA. All staff members are expected to follow this
procedure and report any discrepancies to their supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Smooth Muscle Antibodies (SMA) are autoantibodies directed against
smooth muscle components, including actin, tubulin, and
intermediate filaments. Presence of SMA is a hallmark of
autoimmune liver disease.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from 5-10 mL of clotted blood.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants containing EDTA, citrate,
or fluoride.
Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-
term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Microscope with fluorescence capability
• Pipettes
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• Commercially prepared HEp-2 cell slides
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Smooth Muscle Antibody positive and negative controls
• Anti-human IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate
• Mounting medium
• Cover slips
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Slide Preparation:
◦ Label the slides for each patient and control.
◦ Pipette 20 µL of patient serum or control onto the
appropriate well on the HEp-2 cell slide.
◦ Incubate slides in a moist chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides gently with PBS and then immerse in PBS for 5
minutes.
◦ Repeat the rinse step twice.
5. Conjugate Application:
◦ Pipette 20 µL of diluted anti-human IgG FITC conjugate onto
each well.
◦ Incubate in a moist chamber at room temperature for 30
minutes in the dark.
6. Final Washing:
◦ Rinse slides gently with PBS and then immerse in PBS for 5
minutes.
◦ Repeat the rinse step twice.
7. Mounting:
◦ Apply a small drop of mounting medium to each well and
cover with a coverslip.
8. Microscopy:
◦ Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Evaluate the fluorescence pattern and intensity of each well.
◦ Record the findings as either positive or negative, including
the titer (starting from 1:40 dilution) and specific pattern
(rod-like, fibrillary, etc.).
9. QUALITY CONTROL
Control Materials:
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
Procedure:
• Ensure that controls give expected results (positive control
exhibits a specific fluorescence pattern and negative control
shows no fluorescence).
• Document control results in the Quality Control Log.
• If control results deviate, do not release patient results until the
issue is resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Interpretation:
• Positive: Specific fluorescence pattern present at a dilution of
≥1:40.
• Negative: No specific fluorescence pattern at a dilution of 1:40.
Documentation:
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include titer and fluorescence pattern.
• Verify and sign off the results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Negative: No specific fluorescence at a dilution of 1:40. Positive:
Presence of specific fluorescence pattern at a dilution of ≥1:40.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Certain medications or conditions can produce false-positive or
false-negative results.
• The assay's sensitivity and specificity are dependent on the
quality of reagents and adherence to protocol.
