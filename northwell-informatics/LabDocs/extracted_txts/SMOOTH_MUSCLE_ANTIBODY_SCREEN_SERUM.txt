Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Smooth Muscle
Antibody Screen, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the detection and reporting of smooth
muscle antibodies (SMA) in serum samples, ensuring consistent and
accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing, analysis, and reporting of smooth muscle antibody
screens in serum samples within the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
smooth muscle antibody screen following this protocol. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to ensure compliance with
this SOP and to address any issues that may arise during the
analysis.
4. DEFINITIONS
Smooth Muscle Antibody (SMA): Autoantibodies directed against
smooth muscle components, commonly associated with autoimmune
liver diseases.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Type of Specimen: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum 1.0 mL of serum
• Collection Procedure: Blood should be collected in a standard
serum separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot at room
temperature before centrifugation.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for short-term
storage or -20°C for long-term storage.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microscope with UV illumination
• Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) slides coated with smooth
muscle substrate (e.g., rat stomach tissue sections)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with Tween
• Fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG
• Mounting medium, e.g., glycerol or an anti-fade reagent
• Positive and negative control sera
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation of Equipment and Reagents:
• Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and functioning.
• Thaw reagents as necessary and allow them to come to room
temperature.
• Prepare PBS with Tween solution.
7.2 IIF Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Label IIF slides with patient identification and control
designations.
◦ Apply 10 µL of patient serum to each well on the slide.
◦ In parallel, apply positive and negative control sera to
separate wells.
◦ Incubate slides in a humid chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes.
2. Washing:
◦ Gently rinse slides with PBS with Tween to remove unbound
serum.
◦ Immerse slides in PBS with Tween for 5 minutes. Repeat
this wash step two times.
3. Detection:
◦ Apply fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG to each well.
◦ Incubate slides in a humid chamber at room temperature for
another 30 minutes.
◦ Wash slides as described above to remove unbound
conjugate.
4. Mounting:
◦ Use mounting medium to cover the wells and place a
coverslip over the slide.
◦ Allow slides to dry for a minimum of 5 minutes in the dark.
7.3 Microscope Examination:
• Examine slides using a UV microscope at 400X magnification.
• Assess fluorescence patterns in patient samples compared to
controls.
◦ Positive Result: Bright apple-green fluorescence along smooth
muscle fibers.
◦ Negative Result: No specific fluorescence or weak, diffuse
background fluorescence only.
• Document results and patterns observed.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform assays with both positive and negative controls for each
batch of tests.
• Review results of controls prior to reporting patient results:
◦ Positive control should show bright fluorescence.
◦ Negative control should show minimal to no fluorescence.
• If control results are not as expected, troubleshoot and repeat the
assay.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive results should be reported as "Positive for smooth muscle
antibodies" with a corresponding titration (if dilution series is
performed).
• Negative results should be reported as "Negative for smooth
muscle antibodies".
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Presence of SMA with titer indicating the strength of the
reaction.
• Negative: Absence of significant SMA fluorescence.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may affect the
assay.
• Cross-reactivity: Other autoantibodies may sometimes exhibit
similar fluorescence patterns.
• Interpretation: Variability in subjective interpretation; therefore, all
findings should be reviewed by a second qualified technologist if
necessary.

diseases.
• Good laboratory practices as outlined by CLIA regulations.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all temperatures, reagent lot numbers, control results, and
any deviations from standard procedures in the appropriate log
book or electronic record.
14. HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
• Use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including
gloves, lab coats, and eye protection.
• Dispose of waste according to biomedical waste disposal
regulations.
