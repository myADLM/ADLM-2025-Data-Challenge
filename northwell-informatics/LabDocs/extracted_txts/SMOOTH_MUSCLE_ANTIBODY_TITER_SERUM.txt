Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Smooth Muscle
Antibody Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Smooth Muscle Antibody (SMA) Titer
in serum samples. The smooth muscle antibody test is used to help
diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and to differentiate it from other liver
diseases.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the smooth muscle antibody titer testing according to
this procedure.
2. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
2.1 Specimen Type: - Preferred: Serum - Acceptable: None
2.2 Specimen Collection: - Collect blood in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST). - Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes before
centrifugation. - Centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum from the clot.
2.3 Specimen Storage: - Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. - For
longer storage, aliquot and store at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Reagents: - Smooth Muscle Antibody Indirect
Immunofluorescence Testing Kit - PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) -
Mounting Medium - Fluorescent Anti-Human IgG Conjugate
3.2 Equipment: - Fluorescence Microscope - Micropipettes and Tips -
Centrifuge - Incubator (37°C) - Glass Slides - Cover Slips
3.3 Supplies: - Disposable Gloves - Lab Coats - Timer
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Slides: - Prepare tissue substrate slides (e.g., rat
kidney or stomach sections pre-treated according to the
manufacturer's instructions). - For each patient sample, prepare one
slide.
4.2 Dilution of Serum: - Label small dilution tubes for each patient
sample and control. - Dilute serum samples 1:10 in PBS. - Prepare
serial dilutions (e.g., 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, etc.) if necessary.
4.3 Incubation: - Add 50 µL of each diluted serum sample to
designated wells on the tissue substrate slides. - Incubate slides in a
moist chamber at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4.4 Washing: - Wash slides three times with PBS for 5 minutes each.
4.5 Secondary Antibody Incubation: - Add 50 µL of Fluorescent Anti-
Human IgG Conjugate to each well. - Incubate slides in a moist
chamber at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4.6 Washing: - Wash slides three times with PBS for 5 minutes each.
- Rinse slides briefly with distilled water to remove any PBS residue.
4.7 Mounting: - Add a drop of mounting medium to each well. - Cover
with cover slips.
4.8 Microscopic Examination: - Examine slides under a fluorescent
microscope at 400x magnification. - Locate FITC fluorescence
pattern indicating smooth muscle antibodies. - Record the highest
dilution that shows specific fluorescence as the titer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Positive Control: - Run known positive control serum with each
batch of patient samples. - The positive control should demonstrate a
distinct fluorescent pattern.
5.2 Negative Control: - Run known negative control serum with each
batch of patient samples. - The negative control should show no
fluorescence or background staining.
5.3 Documentation: - Record all results, including positive and
negative controls, in the laboratory information system.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Reporting Titer: - Report the smooth muscle antibody titer as the
highest dilution at which specific fluorescence is observed.
6.2 Reference Ranges: - Negative: < 1:20 - Borderline: 1:20 -
Positive: > 1:20
6.3 Interpretation: - Reflect on the clinical context of the patient when
interpreting results. Consult with clinical teams as necessary.
1. LIMITATIONS
7.1 Method Limitation: - False positives can occur due to the
presence of other autoantibodies. - Serum samples that are severely
lipemic, hemolyzed, or contaminated can interfere with results.
7.2 Technical Limitation: - Ensure the correct substrate tissue and
reagent conditions are maintained for accurate results. - Observers
must be adequately trained in immunofluorescence microscopy.
