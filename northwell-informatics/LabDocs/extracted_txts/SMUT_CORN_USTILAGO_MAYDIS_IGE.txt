Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for SMUT
CORN (USTILAGO MAYDIS) IGE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and procedures for the analytical phase in testing
the presence and levels of Ustilago maydis (Smut Corn) IgE in
patient samples in order to ensure accuracy, consistency, and
compliance with relevant regulatory standards.
2. DEFINITION
Ustilago maydis (Smut Corn) IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to
Ustilago maydis, an allergen found in smut-affected corn. Elevated
levels indicate sensitization or allergic recognition by the immune
system.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the testing, ensure all equipment is calibrated, and all
procedures are followed according to this SOP. Data entry and review
of results are to be handled by qualified technical staff.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2–8°C and analyzed
within 7 days. If longer storage is needed, store at -20°C or lower.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA microplate reader
• Microplate shaker
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Microplate washer
• Ustilago maydis specific IgE ELISA kit
• Deionized or distilled water
• Calibration curves and control sera with known IgE concentrations
• Laboratory timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Receive and Accession the Sample:
◦ After receiving the sample, ensure it is properly labeled and
recorded in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Centrifuge the SST tube at 2000–3000 RPM for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw and bring all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C)
before starting.
◦ Prepare the wash buffer by diluting the concentrated wash
solution with deionized water.
◦ Prepare standards, controls, and samples as per the ELISA
kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Designate wells for blank, standards, positive and negative
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Add 100 µL of sample diluent into designated blank wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and patient sample
into their designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate with adhesive film. Incubate at 37°C
for 60 minutes on a microplate shaker at 500 RPM.
3. Washing:
◦ After incubation, remove the adhesive cover and discard the
content of the wells.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer using
an automated microplate washer or manually with a
multichannel pipette.
4. Detection Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated anti-IgE into each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes on a
microplate shaker at 500 RPM.
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well. The color should
change from blue to yellow.
7. Reading:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader at 450 nm.
C. Calculation and Result Interpretation
1. Generate Standard Curve:
◦ Plot the OD values of the standards against their
concentrations to generate a standard curve.
◦ Use the standard curve to interpolate the IgE concentrations
of the control and patient samples.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that the control values fall within the expected range.
If controls are outside expected limits, repeat the assay.
◦ Review assay data for any discrepancies.
3. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter the results into the LIS.
◦ Review and verify the results before releasing the final
report.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Run positive and negative controls in each assay to ensure assay
performance.
• Check for any significant variations or trends in control data and
address any deviations.
• If assay performance is outside of acceptable limits, perform a
troubleshooting procedure which may include repeating the assay,
checking reagent integrity, reviewing equipment calibration, or
contacting technical support.
8. PRECISION AND ACCURACY
• Verify assay precision by performing replicate testing on control
samples.
• Ensure the accuracy of the test by using certified reference
standards and participating in proficiency testing programs.
9. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all assays performed including sample
identification, reagent lot numbers, controls, calibration data, and
any issues or deviations encountered.
• Document corrective actions taken during troubleshooting
procedures.
