STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase for Generating Results for SNAIL, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the analysis
and reporting of SNAIL (analyte), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and
SERUM. This ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results
with necessary corrective actions when required.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis as per the SOP. The
supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to these
procedures, addressing any deficiencies, and reviewing the results.
2. DEFINITION
1. SNAIL: Specific assay related to snail allergens or particular
analytes.
2. IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a type of antibody measured in serum
for allergy diagnostics.
3. SERUM: Refers to the serum portion of the blood sample used
for various tests including SNAIL and IgE.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing the Specimen
1. Specimen Acceptance
◦ Verify the specimen integrity, labeling, and volume according
to the laboratory’s pre-analytical procedures.
◦ Ensure sample is not hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric which
could interfere with results.
2. Specimen Storage
◦ Serum specimens must be kept at 2-8°C if analysis will
occur within 48 hours.
◦ For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C
or below.
◦ Thawed specimens should be brought to room temperature
and gently mixed before analysis.
B. Equipment and Materials
1. Appropriate assay kits for SNAIL, IgE.
2. Calibrators and controls for IgE and SNAIL.
3. Standard laboratory equipment including pipettes, centrifuges,
and sample cups.
4. Automated analyzer capable of performing the immunoassay.
5. Reagent grade water.
◦ Note: Ensure all equipment is in calibration and
maintenance logs are up-to-date.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Daily Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions
using the provided calibration standards.
◦ Perform calibration verification using controls that
encompass the clinically relevant range.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run at least two levels of quality controls (low and high) at
the beginning of each analytical batch.
◦ Ensure controls are within the predefined limits. If controls
fail, troubleshoot and correct discrepancies before patient
sample analysis.
D. Analysis Procedure:
1. SNAIL and IgE Assay
• Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents, controls, and calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
• Automated Analyzer Setup:
◦ Load the samples, controls, and calibrators into the analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate assay protocol for SNAIL and IgE on
the analyzer.
• Run Analysis:
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the progress ensuring no errors or
alarms are triggered.
• Data Verification:
◦ After the assay completion, review the results for quality
control acceptance.
◦ Validate the patient results only if controls are within the
acceptable range.
1. Serum Processing:
◦ Follow the same steps as above for any additional serum
tests as required by the laboratory's testing menu.
◦ Ensure to include relevant calibrators and controls for each
specific serum assay.
E. Reporting Results
• Transfer results from the analyzer to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for documentation.
• Ensure all results meet the quality criteria before validation.
• Flag and document any critical values and follow laboratory
protocol for critical result notification.
F. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
1. Control Failure:
◦ Re-run controls and check for procedural errors.
◦ If controls continue to fail, refer to the analyzer’s
troubleshooting guide and consult the supervisor.
2. Instrument Errors:
◦ Perform routine maintenance as suggested by the
manufacturer.
◦ If unresolved, contact the service engineer and document all
actions taken.
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND MONITORING Regularly monitor
assay validation parameters (calibration, controls) and reagent
inventory to ensure compliance with quality standards. Perform inter-
laboratory comparisons periodically.
