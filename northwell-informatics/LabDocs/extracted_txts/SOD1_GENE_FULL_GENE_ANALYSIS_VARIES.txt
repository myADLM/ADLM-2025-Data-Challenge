Standard Operating Procedure for SOD1 Gene Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures necessary for the full gene
analysis of the SOD1 gene. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results from the analytical phase of testing,
following specimen collection, receipt, and accessioning.
Responsibility:
Designated staff perform the full gene analysis of the SOD1 gene
according to this procedure. All staff are responsible for identifying
any deficiencies in the process which may affect test results and
report them to the supervisor. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring the procedure is performed and documented correctly,
including any required corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 2-5 mL of peripheral blood, collected in EDTA (lavender-top)
tubes.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in heparinized tubes.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or significantly degraded.
• Specimens received greater than 72 hours post-collection (unless
refrigerated).
Notes:
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
• Ensure specimen is labelled correctly with patient's name, date of
birth, and collection time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Sequencing instruments (e.g. Next-Generation Sequencing
platforms)
• DNA Extraction Kits
• Primers for SOD1 gene amplification
• Nucleotides, polymerase, buffer solutions
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Documentation materials (e.g. Temperature Monitoring Log, Lab
Notebook)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction using a standardized protocol (e.g. spin
column-based extraction kit).
2. Verify the integrity and concentration of the extracted DNA
using spectrophotometry (e.g. Nanodrop).
3. Document the yield and quality of DNA in the Lab Notebook.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Design primers specific to the SOD1 gene and verify their
sequences.
2. Setup PCR reactions for amplification using the following
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Number of cycles: 35
3. Verify PCR product size using agarose gel electrophoresis.
C) Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a purification kit protocol.
2. Set up sequencing reaction according to the sequencing
platform used.
3. Load purified PCR products onto the sequencing instrument.
4. Run sequencing according to the instrument manual and
protocol.
5. Analyze the sequences using bioinformatics software tools.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Examine sequencing data for quality and coverage.
2. Align the sequences to the reference SOD1 gene.
3. Identify variants within the coding and non-coding regions.
4. Interpret variants according to established guidelines (e.g.
ACMG standards).
5. Document variant findings and interpretations in the Lab
Notebook.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Controls:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing run.
2. Record the control results and confirm their accuracy before
proceeding with patient samples.
B) Equipment Calibration:
1. Regularly calibrate sequencing instruments and PCR thermal
cyclers according to manufacturer recommendations.
2. Maintain calibration logs for audit purposes.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Compile the analysis results, including identified variants, and
their interpretations.
5. Verify the results and documentation for accuracy.
6. Fill out the designated reporting forms or electronic records
according to laboratory guidelines.
7. Review the results by a qualified geneticist before final sign-off.
8. Issue the report to the requesting physician or relevant
department.
