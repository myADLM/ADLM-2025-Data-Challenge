SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for SODIUM, 24
HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a complete and reproducible procedure for the analysis of
sodium concentration in a 24-hour urine specimen. The procedure
ensures accurate and reliable results that aid in clinical assessment
and diagnosis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff responsible for conducting
urinalysis must strictly follow this procedure. All staff must be familiar
with and adhere to these protocols to maintain the integrity of the
results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical balance
• Transfer pipettes
• 24-hour urine collection container
• Centrifuge
• Sodium ISE (ion-selective electrode) analyzer or equivalent flame
photometer
• Quality control samples
• Deionized water
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat and safety goggles
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: Preferred/acceptable:
• 24-hour urine collection: Instruct the patient to discard the first
urine sample of the day and then collect all subsequent urine over
the next 24 hours in the provided collection container, including
the first urine sample the next morning.
Unacceptable:
• Incomplete 24-hour collection
• Contaminated or improperly stored specimens
Stability:
• Room temperature: 2 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 24 hours
• Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
1. PROCEDURE
A) RECEIVE AND VERIFY SPECIMEN
• Receive the specimen ensuring it is properly labeled with the
patient's identification, date, and time of collection.
• Verify that the specimen volume aligns with expected values for a
24-hour collection (typically 1-2 liters).
• Inspect the specimen for any contamination or abnormalities. If
the specimen is unacceptable, reject it and request a new sample.
B) PREPARATION
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Measure the total volume of the urine and record it.
3. Aliquot a 10 mL sample of the well-mixed urine into a labeled
centrifuge tube.
C) SAMPLE PROCESSING
1. Centrifuge the urine aliquot at 1500g for 10 minutes to remove
any possible sediments.
2. Transfer a clear 2 mL aliquot of the supernatant to a new
labeled sample tube.
D) ANALYSIS
1. Calibrate the sodium analyzer (ion-selective electrode or flame
photometer) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run a quality control sample to ensure accuracy of the
instrument. Acceptable control limits must be met before
proceeding with patient samples.
3. Using a transfer pipette, load the patient urine sample into the
sodium analyzer.
4. Initiate the analysis according to the analyzer's operational
procedure.
E) QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both low and high level quality control samples at the
beginning of the session, after every 10th sample, and at the end
of the batch.
• Ensure the analyzer passes quality control checks. If the QC fails,
troubleshoot according to manufacturer guidelines and re-run QC
before patient samples.
F) RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Record the sodium concentration value obtained from the
analyzer.
2. Calculate the total sodium excretion per 24 hours using the
formula:
Total sodium (mmol/L) = Urine sodium concentration (mmol/L) ×
Total urine volume (L)
3. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure results are reviewed and verified by a technologist
before releasing.
G) CALCULATED RESULTS
Calculated Results: Sodium in 24-hour urine = Sodium concentration
(mmol/L) x Total volume of urine (L)
Document these results with appropriate reference intervals based
on the patient's demographic information.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for sodium in a 24-hour urine collection is
typically 40-220 mmol/L, but may vary based on patient
conditions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure the patient collects all urine over the 24-hour period
without contamination.
• Calibration and routine maintenance of the sodium analyzer are
crucial for accurate results.
• Any deviation in sample handling or analysis can significantly
affect the results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results should be directly entered into the LIS.
• Technologists must verify results before they are released to
ensure accuracy and clinical relevance.
