Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Results for Sodium (Na), Blood
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, reliable, and timely measurement of sodium (Na)
concentration in blood specimens using appropriate equipment and
validated methodologies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis, validate the equipment, and ensure the accuracy and
precision of the results. It is also the responsibility of staff and
supervisors to monitor and document each step of the procedure,
including taking corrective measures when necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Sodium (Na+) is an essential electrolyte in the body, critical for
maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle function.
Accurate measurement of serum sodium levels is crucial for
diagnosing and managing various medical conditions, including
electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and kidney issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum or Plasma (lithium heparin anticoagulant)
Preferred collection tube: Serum separator tube (SST) or lithium
heparin tube (preferably PST) Volume required: Minimum 1 mL
Specimen Stability:
• Serum and plasma are stable for up to 7 days when stored at
2-8°C.
• Extended stability is possible if stored at -20°C or lower for up to
one month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
1. Hemolyzed samples.
2. Samples collected in sodium heparin tubes.
3. Samples with significant air contamination or improper storage.
4. Clotted or insufficiently mixed specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Electrolyte analyzer or ion-selective electrode (ISE) analyzer
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Calibrators and quality control (QC) materials specific for sodium
measurement
• Deionized water
Supplies:
• SST or lithium heparin tubes
• Sample cups or appropriate containers for the analyzer
• Quality control log sheets
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Verify that the specimen meets acceptance criteria: check for
proper labeling, collection time, and storage conditions.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15
minutes to separate serum. For lithium heparin tubes, separate
plasma after centrifugation.
3. Ensure clear supernatant without hemolysis for analysis.
B) Analytical Phase
1. Daily Equipment Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the analyzer using sodium calibrators
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Document calibration results, including date, time, and
initials of the staff member performing the calibration.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run at least two levels of quality control (QC) material at the
start of each shift and after any major maintenance,
calibration, or reagent change.
◦ Record QC results in the log sheet and verify that they fall
within acceptable control limits.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared specimen into the analyzer.
◦ Follow the specific analyzer's instructions for running the
test.
◦ Ensure identification and tracking throughout the analysis.
4. Data Handling:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results for clinical significance and proper
documentation.
5. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC results are outside the acceptable range, recalibrate
the instrument and rerun the controls.
◦ If the problem persists, notify the supervisor and take
appropriate corrective actions as defined in the
instrumentation manual.
◦ Document all troubleshooting and corrective actions taken.
C) Post-Analytical Phase
1. Validate results:
◦ Cross-check sodium results with initial patient demographics
and clinical history to ensure consistency.
◦ Flag any critical values according to laboratory policy and
inform the responsible clinician as required.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Verified and validated results should be reported to the
requesting department or clinician promptly using the LIS.
◦ Ensure all paper and electronic documentation is
appropriately filed and maintained.
3. Sample Retention:
◦ Retain test samples per laboratory policies for a defined
period post-analysis in case of result queries or repeat
testing requirements.
4. REFERENCE RANGES Standard Reference Range for Serum
Sodium:
• Adults: 136-145 mmol/L
• Refer to age-specific reference ranges as necessary based on
patient demographics.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
2. Regularly participate in proficiency testing programs specific to
electrolyte analysis.
3. Maintain instrument and reagent QC logs, documenting all
issues, maintenance, calibrations, and corrective actions taken.
4. Participate in periodic audits and reviews to ensure compliance
with CLIA regulations and laboratory quality standards.
