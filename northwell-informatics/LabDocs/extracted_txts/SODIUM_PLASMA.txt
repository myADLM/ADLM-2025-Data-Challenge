Sodium, Plasma Analysis Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
plasma sodium levels. The accurate measurement and reporting of
plasma sodium are essential in diagnosing and managing a variety of
medical conditions, including electrolyte imbalances, dehydration,
and kidney disorders.
Responsibility:
All laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the steps
outlined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of the technologists
to ensure that all steps are followed precisely to maintain the integrity
of the result. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
adherence to these procedures and addressing any issues that arise
during analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma obtained from a heparinized blood sample (lime green top
tube).
• Specimen should be processed within 2 hours of collection to
prevent hemolysis and degradation.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL plasma.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 2 hours or refrigerated for more than 12 hours.
• Specimens with visible lipemia or icterus, unless these conditions
are noted on the request form.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas or similar equipment)
• Reagents for plasma sodium measurement (e.g., ion-selective
electrode reagents)
• Quality control materials (2 levels: low and high)
• Heparinized blood collection tubes (lime green top)
• Calibrated pipettes and appropriate tips
• Centrifuge
1. PRE-ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
• Verify specimen identity and labeling.
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to
separate the plasma from the cells.
• Carefully pipette the plasma into a labeled analysis tube without
disturbing the buffy coat or red cells.
1. ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
• Turn on the automated analyzer and ensure it is calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
• Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the analyzer.
• Select the test for sodium, plasma, ensuring to input the correct
settings according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Initiate the analysis run.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low and high) at the beginning of the
analysis batch, after every 20 patient samples, and at the end of
the batch.
• Record all QC results in the quality control log.
• Compare QC results to established ranges. If QC results are out
of range, troubleshoot the instrument and rerun the QC samples
before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document any corrective actions taken in case of QC failures.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Upon completion of the analysis, review all results for accuracy.
• Results that fall outside of the reference range (136-145 mmol/L)
must be checked and reanalyzed if required.
• Document and verify all patient results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Critical values (Sodium < 120 mmol/L or > 155 mmol/L) must be
immediately communicated to the requesting physician or nurse
following hospital policy.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform daily maintenance on the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
• In case of instrument malfunction, refer to the troubleshooting
section of the manufacturer’s manual or contact technical support.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal plasma sodium levels: 136-145 mmol/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with sodium
measurements and potentially alter results.
• Proper sample handling and prompt processing are critical for
accurate results.

All laboratory personnel must be familiar with and adhere to this SOP
when performing plasma sodium analysis to ensure consistent and
high-quality results.
