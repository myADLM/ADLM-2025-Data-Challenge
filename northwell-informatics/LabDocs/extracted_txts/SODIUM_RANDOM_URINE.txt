Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Sodium, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the standard process of
generating results for sodium concentrations in random urine
samples. This ensures the accuracy, precision, and reliability of the
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting the results, and notifying a supervisor in
the event of any discrepancies or errors.
• It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure adherence to this
SOP and to handle any necessary corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL random urine sample collected in a clean container without
preservatives.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with visible contamination, incorrect specimen
volume, or improper labeling.
• Speciments arriving in laboratory more than 6 hours after
collection without being refrigerated, or without collection date/
time noted.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) Analyzer or Flame Photometer
• Calibration standards for sodium
• Quality control solutions (low, medium, and high levels)
• Urine sample containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) - lab coat, gloves, and
safety goggles
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify that the urine sample is appropriately labeled and meets
the acceptance criteria.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly before analysis to ensure
homogeneity.
B. Calibration of the Analyzer:
1. Calibrate the analyzer using the sodium calibration standards
as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Document the calibration in the calibration logbook, noting the
date, time, and initials of the person performing the calibration.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each shift
and after every 20 patient samples.
2. QC levels should include low, medium, and high concentrations
of sodium.
3. Document QC results and ensure that they fall within the
acceptable range.
4. If QC results are outside the acceptable range, do not proceed
with patient samples until the issue is resolved and re-
calibration is performed.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the properly labeled urine sample onto the analyzer.
3. Initiate the analysis and ensure that all parameters are set
correctly.
4. Record the sodium concentration generated by the analyzer in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
E. Post-Analysis:
1. Verify the generated results and check for any flagged data that
may indicate errors or abnormal values.
2. Notify the supervisor immediately if any discrepancies or
unexpected results are identified.
3. Store or dispose of the specimen as per the laboratory's waste
management guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Perform QC checks as outlined in the QC section above.
◦ Document results, and take corrective action if controls fall
outside the predefined range.
6. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external quality assurance programs (if
available) to ensure accuracy and comparability of results
with other laboratories.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed by
the technologist for verification.
• Report sodium concentrations in mmol/L within the reference
interval: 40-220 mmol/L.
• For critical values, notify the appropriate clinical personnel
immediately following the laboratory's critical result notification
policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Sodium: 40-220 mmol/L (confirm with site-specific guidelines as
reference ranges might differ)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the analyzer’s manual for specific limitations of the ISE
Analyzer or Flame Photometer.
• Interfering substances such as high glucose or protein levels may
affect sodium analysis and should be considered when evaluating
results.

• Analyzer Manufacturer's Instruction Manual
• Relevant Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
Guidelines
• Internal Laboratory Quality Control Manual
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain records of calibration, quality control results, and all
generated patient results in the laboratory information system.
• Properly document and retain corrective actions taken for any QC
failures or discrepancies found during the analytical process.
APPROVAL
This SOP is to be approved and signed by the laboratory’s director or
authorized personnel and reviewed periodically to ensure continued
compliance and accuracy.
