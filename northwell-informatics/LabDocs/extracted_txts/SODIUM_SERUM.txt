SOP for Serum Sodium Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
accurate and precise measurement of serum sodium (Na+)
levels to ensure quality results for diagnostic, therapeutic, and
monitoring purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Medical Laboratory Scientists (MLS) are
responsible for performing the assay, adhering to the protocol,
documenting the results, and performing necessary
troubleshooting. The Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for
ensuring that the MLS follow the protocol and for overseeing
quality control and maintenance procedures.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred specimen: Serum,
collected in a serum separator tube (SST). Specimen stability:
Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days if refrigerated at
2-8°C. Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens (causes artificially high results)
• Improperly labeled specimens
• Specimens with visible contamination
• Specimens collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
sodium heparin)
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Calibrated and validated ion-selective electrode (ISE) analyzer or
specified chemistry analyzer.
• Calibrators and reagents specific to the analyzer.
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal ranges).
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE A) Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and quality control materials are within their
expiration dates and have been brought to room temperature, if
applicable.
• Verify the analyzer's status, including calibration and
maintenance, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Perform any required calibration and maintenance activities prior
to starting the assay.
B) Running the Assay
• Check and document the temperature of the analyzer (if
applicable) to ensure it is within the operational range.
• Label the sample tubes with appropriate patient identification.
• Centrifuge serum separator tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
Ensure the serum is separated from blood cells.
• Aliquot serum samples into secondary tubes if necessary to avoid
contamination.
• Load the calibrators, quality control materials, and serum samples
onto the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Initiate the analysis run following the analyzer’s specific operating
procedure.
C) Quality Control
• Analyze two levels of quality control (QC) materials (e.g., normal
and high) at the beginning of each shift, after any major
maintenance, or after a reagent change.
• If the QC results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
by re-running the QC. If still out of range, recalibrate the
instrument and/or replace reagents before proceeding.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions in the QC log.
D) Review Results
• Review and validate the test results generated by the analyzer.
Verify that the results match the clinical context and no error
codes or flags are present.
• Verify quality control results. Accept the patient results only if QC
results fall within acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter validated serum sodium results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). Ensure that patient identification and
results are accurately recorded.
• The reference interval for serum sodium levels is typically
135-145 mEq/L. Critical values (<125 mEq/L or >155 mEq/L)
should be reported immediately to the requesting clinician as per
the laboratory’s critical result policy.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the analyzer flags an error or if results are inconsistent with
quality control, follow the analyzer's troubleshooting guide.
• Repeat analysis with a fresh aliquot of the specimen, if required.
• Consult the Analyzer’s user manual or contact technical support if
initial troubleshooting steps are unsuccessful.
• Document all actions taken in the troubleshooting log.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can significantly affect sodium measurement. Recollect
any hemolyzed specimens.
• Lipemia and icterus might interfere with the measurements. Use
validated methods to minimize these interferences.
• Ensure correct sample type and handling to avoid preanalytical
errors.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Operator Manual for the specific analyzer used.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
electrolyte testing.
• Laboratory policy documents and procedures.
1. DOCUMENT HISTORY Include any updates and revisions to
the SOP, with the date of implementation and reviewer’s initials.
This protocol ensures a standardized approach to serum sodium
measurement intended to produce reliable and reproducible results
with adherence to quality assurance and quality control procedures.
