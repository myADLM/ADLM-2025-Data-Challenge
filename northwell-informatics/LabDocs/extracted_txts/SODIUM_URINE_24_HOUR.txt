Standard Operating Procedure for SODIUM, URINE, 24 HOUR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a comprehensive guideline for the accurate analysis
of Sodium (Na) in 24-hour urine specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to perform all
steps outlined in this procedure to ensure accurate and precise
results. This includes handling, analysis, documentation, and
reporting of Sodium in 24-hour urine specimens.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection.
◦ Collection Container: Clean, chemical-free collection jug,
often containing a preservative as per laboratory's
recommendation.
◦ Volume: Entire volume collected over 24 hours.
◦ Storage Temperature: Refrigerate during and after
collection.
◦ Transport to Laboratory: Transport to the laboratory
promptly after the 24-hour collection period ends.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ Calibrated Analytical Balance
◦ Automated chemistry analyzer capable of Sodium analysis
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated)
◦ Urine collection jugs
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
◦ Sodium Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) or Flame Photometer
◦ Control materials (2 levels)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Sterile containers for aliquots
◦ Deionized water for dilutions and rinses
5. REAGENTS AND STANDARDS
◦ Sodium stock standard solution
◦ Calibration standards for Sodium assay
◦ Quality control materials with known sodium concentrations
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Handling and Preparation
◦ Verify that the total volume and collection period are
documented correctly.
◦ Mix the urine collection thoroughly by gentle inversion.
◦ Record the total volume of the collected urine.
◦ Transfer an aliquot of urine (~5 mL) to a sterile container.
6.2 Calibration and QC
◦ Ensure that the analyzer is calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using appropriate Sodium
calibration standards.
◦ Run quality control samples (2 levels) at the beginning of
the analytical run, after every 20 samples, and at the end of
the run.
6.3 Sample Analysis
◦ Set up the automated chemistry analyzer:
▪ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the Sodium
ISE or Flame Photometer assay.
▪ Load the calibration standards, quality control materials,
and patient samples.
◦ Analyze the urine samples.
Note: For analyzers using ion-selective electrodes (ISE),
ensure the electrodes are properly maintained and
functioning.
6.4 Post-Analysis
◦ Review and verify the quality control results before
validating patient results.
◦ If QC results are within acceptable limits, proceed to review
patient results.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat the analysis as necessary.
6.5 Calculations
◦ Sodium concentration is often given in mmol/L (or other
specified units).
◦ Calculate the 24-hour excretion: Total Na (mmol/24 hr) =
[Sodium concentration (mmol/L)] x [Total urine volume (L)]
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
◦ Notify the supervising technologist of any critical or
unexpected results as per laboratory protocol.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal range for a 24-hour urine Sodium excretion: 40–220
mmol/24 hr.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
◦ Ensure that control material results fall within established
acceptable ranges.
◦ Maintain all documentation for calibration, quality control,
and patient results.
◦ Perform regular maintenance and function checks of the
analyzers according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure collection methods mitigate the volume loss or
potential contamination.
◦ Samples should not have visible particulates. If present,
centrifuge and decant before analysis.
◦ Highly acidic or alkaline specimens may interfere with
sensor readings; address this as per analyzer guidelines.

guidelines.
12. RECORD OF REVISIONS
◦ Maintain a record of SOP revisions, with dates and details of
changes implemented.
This SOP ensures the standardized and precise determination of
Sodium in 24-hour urine specimens, contributing to consistent and
reliable patient results.
