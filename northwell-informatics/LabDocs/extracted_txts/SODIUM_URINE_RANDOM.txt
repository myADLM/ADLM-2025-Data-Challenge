Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Measurement of
Sodium in Random Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE This SOP describes the procedure for measuring
sodium levels in random urine samples. The purpose is to
ensure the reliability, accuracy, and reproducibility of the test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and verifying all steps of the procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
approving test results, ensuring compliance with this SOP, and
taking corrective actions when required.
1. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
• Freshly voided random urine sample in a clean, dry container.
• Specimens should be delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection if kept at room temperature, or within 24 hours if
refrigerated at 2-8°C
• Ensure the sample volume is at least 10 ml for testing.
Unacceptable:
• Samples not meeting the temperature and timing criteria.
• Specimens with visible contamination or excessive particulate
matter.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-
OES) or ion-selective electrode (ISE) analyzer.
• Calibrators and controls specific for sodium analysis.
• Quality control (QC) materials.
• Urine collection containers.
• Disposable gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment
(PPE).
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and in proper working order.
• Verify reagent and control materials are within their expiration
dates.
• Put on appropriate PPE.
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly before aliquoting.
B. Calibration:
• Prepare calibration standards according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Perform system calibration using the prepared standards.
• Document calibration results and ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding.
C. Quality Control:
• Run QC samples (low, normal, high) according to the laboratory’s
QC policy.
• Document QC results. If results fall outside acceptable limits,
investigate and resolve any issues before proceeding with patient
samples.
• QC results must be documented and deemed acceptable before
patient testing commences.
D. Testing:
• Aliquot a sufficient volume of the urine sample into the testing
vessel.
• Place the urine sample onto the analyzer according to the
instrument’s operating manual.
• Input the specimen identification number and any pertinent
information into the computer system or analyzer.
• Initiate the analysis process according to the analyzer’s operating
instructions.
E. Results Verification:
• Review raw data and results generated by the analyzer.
• Compare analyzer results with control limits for method
consistency.
• Results outside acceptable limits must be verified by retesting.
• Investigate any significant discrepancies by performing necessary
troubleshooting steps before releasing results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the laboratory information system (LIS) for
reporting.
• Review and verify the results within the LIS before releasing:
◦ Confirm that no error codes or flags are associated with the
results.
◦ Document any exceptions or deviations from the protocol.
◦ Notify the ordering physician or relevant healthcare provider of
any critical values as per the laboratory’s protocol for
communicating critical results.
• Reference Interval: Document the laboratory’s established
reference intervals for urine sodium (typically 20-220 mmol/L).
Verify the intervals periodically based on current clinical guidance
and patient population data.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the analyzer
as specified in the manufacturer’s guide.
• Record and document all maintenance activities.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
continued accuracy and reliability of the sodium testing method.
• Review and address any corrective actions taken in response to
QC failures or discrepancies observed during the analytical
process.
1. REFERENCING
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for specific operating
procedures.
• Adhere to laboratory safety manuals and biosafety guidelines.
• Refer to clinical laboratory standards and guidelines such as
those published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) and relevant regulatory bodies.
