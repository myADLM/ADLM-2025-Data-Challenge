Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis
of SODIUM, URINE, TIMED
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
the analysis of urine samples to determine timed sodium
concentrations. The procedure ensures accuracy, precision, and
reliability of results while maintaining compliance with all relevant
regulations and quality standards.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff is responsible for conducting the test,
monitoring quality control, and documenting results.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify and report
any issues that may affect the accuracy of the analysis.
2. DEFINITION
• Timed Urine Collection: Urine collected over a specified period
(e.g., 24-hour) to measure the concentration of sodium.
• Analyte: Sodium (Na⁺)
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Timed urine collection
• Collection Requirements: The patient should collect all urine
output over a specified time period, typically 24 hours, into a
provided container. The collection period should begin after
discarding the first morning void and end after including the first
void of the next morning.
• Labeling: Each specimen container must be labeled with the
patient's identifiers, collection start and end times, date of
collection, and volume of urine.
• Storage: Refrigerate the specimen immediately after collection
and maintain at 2-8°C. If there is a delay in transport, the
specimen must be kept refrigerated and should reach the
laboratory within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected in the proper container
• Specimens without appropriate labeling
• Specimens containing preservatives not recommended for
sodium analysis
• Specimens not refrigerated and/or received more than 24 hours
after collection
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: Ion-selective electrode (ISE) analyzer
• Reagents:
◦ Sodium calibration solutions (Traceable to NIST standards)
◦ Quality control materials at low, medium, and high sodium
concentrations
◦ Diluent (if applicable)
• Supplies:
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Urine collection containers
◦ Sample cups
◦ Gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURES
5.1. PRE-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
• Verify specimen integrity: Check for proper labeling, collection
instructions, storage conditions.
• Measure and record the total urine volume.
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
• Aliquot a portion of the urine into a sample cup for analysis.
5.2. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
• Calibrate the ISE analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions, using the appropriate calibration solutions.
• Run the quality control materials:
◦ Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range. Document
and investigate any outliers.
• Load the urine sample:
◦ Place the sample cup containing the aliquoted urine sample in
the analyzer.
◦ Enter patient information and total urine volume into the
analyzer system.
• Perform the analysis:
◦ The analyzer will measure the sodium concentration in mmol/
L.
◦ The analyzer will automatically account for the total urine
volume to calculate the total sodium excretion over the
collection period (mmol/collection period).
5.3. POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
• Verify the results and ensure there are no analyzer error
messages.
• Document the sodium concentration in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Report any critical values immediately to the requesting clinician,
and document the communication.
• Maintain documented evidence of calibration, QC, and patient
results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality controls at the beginning of each testing day and after
any calibration.
◦ Compare QC results to established acceptable ranges.
◦ Document all QC results and actions taken if controls fall
outside the acceptable ranges.
• In case of QC failure, investigate the cause, repeat the QC,
recalibrate the analyzer if necessary, and reanalyze patient
samples as needed.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report urine sodium concentration in mmol/L and total sodium
excretion in mmol/collection period.
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing them.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Reference Intervals:
◦ May vary between labs; specific reference intervals should be
verified against literature or established lab values.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that urine samples are stored properly to avoid bacterial
contamination and degradation of analytes.
• Ensure accurate urine collection over the specified period for
precise sodium measurement.
