Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Serum Soluble Lymphocyte Extract (SOLE),
Immunoglobulin E (IGE), and other Serum Analytes
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed procedures for the analytical phase of
testing serum samples for Soluble Lymphocyte Extract (SOLE),
Immunoglobulin E (IGE), and other relevant serum analytes. It aims
to ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent results, maintaining
patient safety and quality standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following these
procedures to accurately analyze serum samples. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure testing protocols are adhered to
and any discrepancies or concerns are reported to a supervisor
immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-top
tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens must be centrifuged to separate serum from cells.
• Ensure serum is free of hemolysis or clots.
• Label specimens clearly with patient identification and collection
time.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed (stable for up to
48 hours).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens older than 48 hours without proper storage.
• Samples without clear patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Assay-specific automated analyzers or ELISA kits
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents and Supplies:
• Assay-specific calibrators, controls, and reagents
• Tubes, plates, and other containers as specified by the
manufacturer's instructions
1. PROCEDURE
A) Centrifugation of Samples:
1. Collect serum samples in SST or plain red-top tubes.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to ensure
complete separation.
3. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, labeled aliquot tube.
B) Assay Setup and Calibration:
1. Prepare the analyzer or ELISA workstation according to
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents and calibrators are at the recommended
temperature.
3. Conduct calibration procedures as specified, recording results
in the log.
C) Analysis of Serum Samples:
1. Load serum samples onto the analyzer or perform manual
pipetting for ELISA plates following the assay protocol.
2. Include appropriate quality control samples (low, medium, high)
with each batch of tests.
3. Run the assays according to protocol, ensuring timing and
conditions are strictly adhered to.
D) Result Interpretation and Verification:
1. Review assay outputs automatically generated by the analyzer;
for ELISA, calculate and interpret data manually.
2. Ensure results fall within acceptable ranges of internal quality
controls.
3. Investigate and document any discrepancies or anomalies.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Use commercial controls (low, medium, high) and calibrators
specific to each assay.
Storage:
• Store controls and reagents as per manufacturer's specifications
(usually 2-8°C).
Procedure:
1. Perform quality control for each assay batch, ensuring controls
are within specified limits.
2. Record results regularly and investigate any deviations
immediately.
3. Correlate results of the new reagent lot comparison before
releasing patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed and verified by a trained technologist prior
to reporting. Reference ranges for SOLE, IGE, and other relevant
serum analytes must be adhered to when generating reports. Critical
results must be flagged and communicated promptly to the
appropriate clinical personnel.
Reference Intervals (example ranges): SOLE: [Specific to assay
method used] IGE: 1-90 IU/mL (specific patient population and assay
method may vary) Other Serum Analytes: Refer to specific assay
inserts.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Each assay has inherent limitations that could affect the accuracy
and reliability of results. Refer to the specific reagent and assay
manual inserts for detailed information regarding interferences,
expected ranges, and limitations.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to specific reagent and instrument manuals for detailed assay
procedures, expected results, and limitations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All assay-related activities must be documented in the laboratory
information system (LIS) or appropriate logs. Ensure proper tracking
of specimen handling, assay performance, quality control results, and
data output verification.
This protocol is designed to provide clear guidance for generating
accurate and reliable serum analyte results, maintaining laboratory
standards of practice, and ensuring patient safety.
