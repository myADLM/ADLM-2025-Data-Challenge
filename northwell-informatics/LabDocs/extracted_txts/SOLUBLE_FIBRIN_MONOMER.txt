Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Procedure for Generating Results for Soluble Fibrin
Monomer
1. PURPOSE
This procedure is designed to ensure accurate and consistent
measurement of Soluble Fibrin Monomer (SFM) levels in patient
samples using a specific immunoturbidimetric assay. It outlines the
step-by-step analytical processes, quality control measures, and
reporting protocols.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the
performance, documentation, and review of SFM assay results.
• Supervisory staff are responsible for ensuring that procedures are
followed, quality controls are maintained, and corrective actions
are taken when necessary.
2. DEFINITION
Soluble Fibrin Monomer (SFM) is a protein fragment formed during
blood coagulation. Elevated levels may be indicative of thrombotic
disorders.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment and Reagents:
• Equipment:
◦ Immunoturbidimetric analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-7000)
◦ Precision pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
• Reagents:
◦ SFM reagent kit (including antibodies and calibration
materials)
◦ SFM control materials (positive and negative controls)
◦ Diluent and wash solutions as specified by the manufacturer
B) Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate). Collect blood using
standard venipuncture technique and ensure proper mixing
with the anticoagulant.
◦ Separate plasma by centrifugation at 2000-2500 g for 15
minutes within 30 minutes of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with visible hemolysis.
◦ Incorrectly labeled or insufficient volume samples.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration: a. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to
prepare and load calibration materials onto the analyzer. b.
Perform calibration before each run. Document the calibration
results in the calibration log.
2. Quality Control: a. Run low and high-level control materials at
the beginning and end of each batch of samples. b. Document
control results in the Quality Control Log. c. Ensure results fall
within the specified control range provided by the manufacturer
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
D) Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare the immunoturbidimetric analyzer according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Ensure that all reagents are at room temperature and properly
mixed.
3. Load patient samples, calibrators, and control materials onto
the analyzer.
4. Select the Soluble Fibrin Monomer assay from the analyzer
menu.
5. Initiate the run and allow the analyzer to process samples
automatically.
6. Verify that all samples and controls have been processed
correctly. Re-run any samples flagged by the analyzer (e.g.,
high turbidity, clot detection).
E) Reporting Results:
1. Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). Review and verify results for
accuracy.
2. Reference intervals for Soluble Fibrin Monomer levels will be
included in each report.
3. Critical results (e.g., SFM levels significantly outside the
reference range) must be immediately communicated to the
requesting physician and documented accordingly.
Reference Intervals:
• Soluble Fibrin Monomer: <4 mg/L (refer to manufacturer or
validated laboratory-specific ranges)
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations,
interferences, and precautions related to the assay.
References:
• Manufacturer’s product insert and user manual.
• Laboratory quality assurance and control guidelines.
Approval:
• Approved by: _____ (Laboratory Director)
• Date of Approval: _____
• Review Date: _____
