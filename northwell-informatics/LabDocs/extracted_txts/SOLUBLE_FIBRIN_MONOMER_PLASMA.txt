Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Soluble
Fibrin Monomer, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the accurate and
reliable measurement of Soluble Fibrin Monomer in plasma samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
analysis of Soluble Fibrin Monomer according to this SOP, ensuring
the quality and accuracy of results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring technologists are
adequately trained and competence assessed.
1. DEFINITION
Soluble Fibrin Monomers (sFM) are intermediate products formed
during clot formation and can indicate hypercoagulable states or
thrombotic disorders when present in elevated levels in plasma.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Plate Reader or Coagulation Analyzer that supports endpoint and
kinetic readings
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Cooling rack or refrigerator
• Timer
Reagents:
• Soluble Fibrin Monomer Assay Kit (includes specific reagents as
indicated by the manufacturer)
• Calibrators
• Control plasmas (2 levels: Normal and High)
• Diluent (as specified by the assay kit)
Supplies:
• Plasma samples
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Polystyrene, polypropylene, or suitable assay plates (as required
by the assay kit)
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Appropriate clean containers for waste disposal
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Ensure plasma samples have been handled correctly post-
collection (centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15 minutes, then stored at
2-8°C if short term, or at -20°C for long-term storage).
2. Confirm proper labeling and checks on sample identity.
3. If plasma is frozen, thaw samples rapidly in a 37°C water bath
and then mix thoroughly. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
4. Ensure all reagents and plates are at room temperature before
use.
Assay Preparation:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation of
reagents, calibrators, and controls.
2. Make sure calibration and control materials are ready to use.
Prepare fresh working solutions if necessary.
Testing Protocol:
1. Pipette the required volume of sample, calibrators, and controls
into designated assay plate wells as per the assay kit
instructions.
2. Add the appropriate reagent(s) to each well according to the
assay protocol.
3. Mix gently but thoroughly by tapping the plate margins or using
a plate mixer.
4. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time
recommended by the manufacturer.
5. Measure the optical density or endpoint/kinetic reading with the
plate reader or coagulation analyzer.
Data Collection and Analysis:
1. Record the absorbance or endpoint readings of each sample,
control, and calibrator.
2. Plot the calibration curve using the readings derived from the
calibrators.
3. Determine the Soluble Fibrin Monomer concentration in
samples by interpolation from the calibration curve.
4. Ensure controls read within acceptable ranges.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation:
1. Record the Soluble Fibrin Monomer concentration in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) or manual logbook.
2. Report results in appropriate units (e.g., μg/mL), ensuring
correct format and structure in the patient report.
3. Compare the resulting sFM levels to the established reference
intervals:
Reference Intervals:
◦ Normal: less than 3 μg/mL (or as specified by the
manufacturer and validated by the laboratory).
Quality Control:
1. Run quality controls with each batch of samples tested.
2. If any of the control results fall outside the acceptable range,
investigate potential sources of error, correct the issue, and
reassay affected samples.
3. Document all quality control activities and any corrective
actions taken.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay manufacturer’s instructions for any specific
limitations. Ensure to note any interferences such as lipemia,
hemolysis, or icterus which may affect the test’s performance and
validity.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
Safety:
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves and lab coats.
2. Handle all plasma samples and reagents according to biosafety
regulations.
Waste Disposal:
1. Dispose of all biohazardous waste in accordance with the
laboratory's waste disposal protocols.
2. Ensure proper decontamination of the workspace post-assay.
