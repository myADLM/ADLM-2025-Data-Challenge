Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Soluble Liver Antigen (SLA) Autoantibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely analysis of Soluble Liver Antigen
(SLA) Autoantibody testing performed in the laboratory. This SOP
outlines the procedure for using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) to detect and quantify the presence of SLA
autoantibodies in patient serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
SLA autoantibody assay according to this protocol. Supervisors will
ensure that personnel are adequately trained and compliant with this
SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Accepted Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a standard red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
3.2 Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within 7
days. For long-term storage, keep at -20°C or below.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3.3 Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens in any anticoagulated tube such as EDTA or heparin.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1 Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm (with
630 nm as a reference)
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set at 37°C
4.2 Reagents:
• SLA Autoantibody ELISA Kit
• Calibrators (negative, low positive, medium positive, high positive)
• Wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20)
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution (1N H2SO4)
• Quality control (QC) samples
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Calibration:
• Perform a calibration using the provided calibrators with each new
lot of reagents or once a month, whichever is more frequent.
• The calibrator results must fall within the ranges specified by the
kit manufacturer to ensure the accuracy of results.
5.2 Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of QC (one high and one low) in each
run.
• QC results must be within defined acceptable ranges. Any run
with QC failure must be repeated.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
• Prepare wash buffer according to the kit instructions.
6.2 Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples into
designated wells of the microplate.
2. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL wash buffer per well.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL wash buffer per well.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with 630 nm as a
reference using a microplate reader.
11. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
The absorbance values of the calibrators are used to construct a
standard curve. The concentration of SLA autoantibodies in patient
samples is determined by plotting the absorbance readings against
the standard curve.
7.1 Reference Range:
• Negative: <15 U/mL
• Indeterminate: 15-25 U/mL
• Positive: >25 U/mL
Results outside these reference intervals must be reviewed and
interpreted in the clinical context by a qualified healthcare
professional.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify all results before releasing the report.
• Document any critical values and notify the treating physician
immediately following the established laboratory protocol.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results are out of range, do not report patient results.
• Check all reagents, equipment settings, and procedural steps.
• Recalibrate equipment if necessary and repeat the assay.
• Consult the kit insert and/or contact the manufacturer for
additional troubleshooting guidance.
