Soluble Transferrin Receptor (sTfR), Serum Assay Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of measuring soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels in
serum samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This assay is important
for evaluating iron status and diagnosing iron deficiency anemia.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the sTfR assay, ensure the accuracy of test results, and
maintain proper documentation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 3-5 mL of serum obtained from a properly collected and
processed fasting blood sample, separated within 1 hour of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens kept over 48 hours at room temperature without
proper storage.
• Improperly labeled or unlabeled specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader and Washer or appropriate automated analyzer
• Pipettes and disposable pipette tips
• Microwell plates
• Reagents kit for soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) assay,
including standards and controls
• Calibrators and internal controls (Biorad Liquichek or equivalent)
• Deionized water
• Incubator
• Timer
• Laboratory notebook for documentation
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. DEFINITION AND REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR): A circulating protein that
reflects the quantity of transferrin receptor available on the cell
surface.
• Reference Interval: 1.9 - 4.4 mg/L (Note: Reference intervals may
vary depending on method and patient population.)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation:
1. Allow reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples to
reach room temperature before starting the assay.
2. Label all tubes/plates appropriately.
6.2. Assay Protocol:
Perform the assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions provided
with the sTfR assay kit. Example steps are provided below:
1. Prepare Standards and Controls:
◦ Standard solutions and controls provided in the kit must be
reconstituted and diluted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Add appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples to the microwell plate. Typically 50-100 µL
per well.
◦ Use a new pipette tip for each dispense to avoid cross-
contamination.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the duration specified by the
reagent kit (typically 60 minutes).
4. Washing:
◦ Wash each well according to kit instructions, generally 3-5
times, to remove unbound reagents.
5. Add Conjugate:
◦ Add enzyme-conjugate solution to each well as per kit
instructions.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified duration
(typically 30-60 minutes).
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the chromogenic substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the
specified duration (typically 10-20 minutes).
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
8. Measurement:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well at the specified
wavelength using an ELISA plate reader (usually 450 nm
with a reference wavelength of 620-630 nm).
9. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of sTfR in patient samples using
the standard curve generated from the known standards.
6.3. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control sera (high, medium, and low) alongside
patient samples to validate assay performance.
2. Document all QC results, ensuring they fall within the
acceptable range provided by the manufacturer.
3. If QC results are outside the specified limits, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's guidelines before proceeding
with patient sample analysis.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
If unexpected results are obtained, consider the following steps:
• Verify the stability and storage conditions of reagents and
samples.
• Ensure correct incubation periods and temperatures were
maintained.
• Check for potential pipetting errors or cross-contamination.
• Review instrument calibration and maintenance logs.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify and review all test results for accuracy.
2. Report results in mg/L to one decimal place.
3. Critical values or anomalous findings must be urgently
communicated to the clinical team as per laboratory policy.
9. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
1. Regularly inspect and calibrate equipment according to
manufacturer guidelines.
2. Maintain detailed records of maintenance and calibration
activities.
