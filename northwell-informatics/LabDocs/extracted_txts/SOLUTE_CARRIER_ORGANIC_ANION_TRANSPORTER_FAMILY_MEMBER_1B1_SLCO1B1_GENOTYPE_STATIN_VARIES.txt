SOP FOR SLCO1B1 GENOTYPE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for analyzing the SLCO1B1 genotype in patient
specimens. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and timely
results for determining the SLCO1B1 genotype, which is
essential for personalized statin therapy.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the analytical phase of SLCO1B1 genotype testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedures as outlined in this SOP.
◦ The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
adherence to this SOP and for addressing any issues that
may arise during the testing process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable specimens: EDTA or sodium citrate anti-
coagulated whole blood in lavender or blue top tubes.
◦ Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly
labeled specimens.
◦ Minimum volume: 1 mL of whole blood.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini
Kit)
◦ Real-Time PCR instrument (e.g., Thermo Fisher
QuantStudio 5)
◦ SLCO1B1 genotyping assay (e.g., TaqMan SNP Genotyping
Assays)
◦ PCR master mix
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Laboratory consumables (e.g., tubes, pipette tips, gloves)
◦ Vortex mixer and microcentrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Label all tubes and reagents clearly.
2. Follow the DNA extraction kit manufacturer’s protocol to
extract DNA from the blood specimen.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready to proceed with
genotyping.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Thaw reagents on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the genotyping assay
instructions.
3. Dispense the PCR master mix into each well of a PCR
plate.
4. Add the appropriate volume of DNA template to each well.
5. Seal the PCR plate with optical adhesive film.
6. Briefly centrifuge the plate to ensure all contents are at
the bottom of the wells.
C. Real-Time PCR:
1. Load the PCR plate into the Real-Time PCR instrument.
2. Program the instrument according to the genotyping
assay protocol, including the appropriate thermal cycling
conditions.
3. Start the run and monitor the amplification in real time.
D. Data Analysis:
1. After the PCR run completes, analyze the data using the
instrument’s software.
2. Verify the genotype calls by assessing the amplification
plots and allelic discrimination plots.
3. Record genotype results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
ensure the accuracy of the genotyping assay.
◦ If controls fail, do not report results and initiate
troubleshooting steps as per the troubleshooting guide.
◦ Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the Real-
Time PCR instrument as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review all genotype calls before reporting results.
◦ Transmit results to the LIS and ensure proper
documentation.
◦ Report critical or unexpected results to the ordering
physician immediately.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Reference intervals and interpretation guidelines are
provided by the assay manufacturer and should be followed
strictly.
◦ Provide interpretation based on known SLCO1B1 variants
and their impact on statin therapy.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If any issues occur during DNA extraction or PCR, consult
the respective kit’s troubleshooting guide.
◦ Common issues include contamination, low DNA yield, or
amplification failures.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the specific genotyping assay package insert for
any method limitations.
◦ Ensure awareness of possible cross-reactivity or
interference from other substances in the sample.
12. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for all kits
and reagents used.
◦ Relevant scientific literature on SLCO1B1 genotyping and
statin response.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and accurate
SLCO1B1 genotype analysis, providing valuable information for
personalized statin therapy.
