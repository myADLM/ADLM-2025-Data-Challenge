Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SOMATOSTATIN
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the technical execution of
somatostatin immunostaining on tissue specimens. This SOP is
designed to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and repeatability of
results for the technical component of the somatostatin immunostain
assay.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff performing somatostatin
immunostaining to follow the procedures specified in this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the laboratory
personnel are adequately trained and comply with the SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen:
1. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are to
be used.
2. Optimal tissue thickness for sectioning should be around 4-5
micrometers (µm).
Unacceptable Specimens:
1. Tissue blocks showing signs of poor fixation or processing.
2. Sections thicker or thinner than the specified range.
3. Dehydrated or improperly handled blocks.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
1. Microtome
2. Microscope slides (positively charged)
3. Slide heating oven/incubator
4. Humidity chamber
5. Staining racks
6. Light microscope
Reagents and Supplies:
1. Xylene
2. Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%, and deionized water)
3. Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
4. Blocking solution (e.g., normal serum or casein-based solution)
5. Primary antibody for somatostatin
6. Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
7. DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate kit
8. Hematoxylin or counterstain of choice
9. Mounting medium
4. PROCEDURE
Sectioning:
1. Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 4-5 µm thick sections using a
microtome.
2. Float sections in a water bath at 40-45°C to stretch them.
3. Mount sections on positively charged microscope slides.
4. Bake slides in a slide heating oven at 60°C for 30 minutes to
ensure adherence.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by soaking in xylene for 2 x 5
minutes.
2. Rehydrate in a series of descending ethanol concentrations:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 x 3 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 x 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 1 minute
◦ Rinse in deionized water for 5 minutes
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval buffer.
2. Perform heat-mediated antigen retrieval in a microwave or
pressure cooker following the buffer manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in deionized water followed by PBS.
Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate sections with blocking solution for 10 minutes at
room temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Incubate sections with the primary antibody specific for
somatostatin, following the manufacturer’s recommended
dilution and incubation time (typically 1 hour at room
temperature).
◦ Wash slides 3 x 5 minutes in PBS.
3. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Incubate sections with the HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash slides 3 x 5 minutes in PBS.
4. DAB Staining:
◦ Apply DAB substrate to sections and incubate until desired
stain intensity is achieved, monitoring under a microscope.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water once the staining is
complete.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in deionized water.
3. Dehydrate sections in ethanol (70%, 95%, and 100%) and clear
in xylene.
4. Mount with appropriate mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include a positive control slide known to express somatostatin
in each staining run.
2. Include a negative control slide (without the primary antibody) in
each staining run.
3. Monitor reagent performance and check lot numbers and
expiration dates before use.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. The technologist performing the immunostaining should
document the staining results and any issues encountered
during the process.
2. Review the stained slides under a microscope by a qualified
pathologist.
3. Verify that the technical quality of staining meets the
acceptance criteria.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for each reagent.
• Laboratory’s internal quality assurance and control
documentation.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If staining is too weak or inconsistent, review antibody
concentrations and incubation times.
• Ensure proper functioning of all equipment, including the heating
and humidity conditions during deparaffinization and antigen
retrieval.
• Address any deviations from expectations with proper
documentation and communication with a supervisor.
9. TRAINING AND COMPETENCY
• All staff must receive training in performing the somatostatin
immunostain procedure.
• Competency assessments shall be conducted annually or
whenever a significant change to the procedure occurs.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain detailed records of all staining runs, including reagent lot
numbers, any modifications to the procedure, and quality control
results.
• Store records in accordance with institutional and regulatory
requirements.
11. SAFETY
• Observe all relevant safety guidelines and wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling reagents and
specimens.
12. REVISION HISTORY
• Log any changes or revisions to this SOP, including the date and
nature of the change, to ensure proper maintenance and updates
are communicated to all relevant personnel.
This SOP ensures standardized and high-quality technical execution
of somatostatin immunostains, critical for accurate and reliable
diagnostic outcomes.
