Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Somatostatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process and procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Somatostatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2)
immunostain. This specifically covers the technical component only,
which includes preparation, staining, and preliminary evaluation of
tissue specimens.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technicians to carry
out the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all procedures are
followed correctly and for addressing any issues that may arise
during the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
(typically 4-5 micrometers in thickness).
• Proper labeling and documentation of specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Drying oven
• SSTR2 primary antibody
• Secondary antibodies
• Detection reagents (e.g., DAB or other chromogens)
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Xylene, ethanol, distilled water
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Cover slips
• Microscope
• Temperature and humidity monitored environment for the storage
of reagents
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 micrometers using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath and pick up on positively
charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides in a drying oven at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper
adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 10 minutes three times.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of decreasing ethanol
concentrations (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and incubate in a pressure cooker or
microwave for the time specified by the primary antibody
protocol.
2. Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by a wash in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS).
D. Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Encircle the tissue sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
2. Apply blocking solution to the sections and incubate for 10
minutes at room temperature to block non-specific binding.
3. Incubate sections with the primary antibody specific to SSTR2,
diluted as per manufacturer's instructions, for 1 hour at room
temperature.
4. Rinse sections in PBS for 5 minutes three times.
5. Incubate sections with secondary antibody (biotinylated or
polymeric conjugate) for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Rinse sections in PBS for 5 minutes three times.
7. Apply detection reagent (DAB or another chromogen) and
develop color as per manufacturer's instructions.
8. Rinse sections in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting:
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse sections in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate sections through increasing concentrations of
ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%) for 5 minutes each.
4. Clear sections in xylene for 10 minutes three times.
5. Mount sections with a cover slip using a suitable mounting
medium.
F. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each batch of
staining.
2. Ensure that the control tissues show expected staining patterns
before evaluating patient samples.
3. EVALUATION AND DOCUMENTATION:
4. Inspect stained slides using a microscope to ensure proper
staining quality.
5. Document any discrepancies such as non-specific staining,
weak staining, or background issues.
6. Provide stained slides to the pathologist for final interpretation
and report generation.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING:
8. If staining is inadequate, repeat the staining procedure with
adjustments according to the troubleshooting guide provided by
the antibody manufacturer.
9. Address issues such as inconsistent staining, tissue
detachment, or inappropriate background staining by consulting
relevant pathology and immunohistochemistry reference
materials.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
11. Results are submitted to the pathologist for diagnostic
interpretation.
12. Ensure that all pertinent data including reagent lot numbers,
control staining results, and any deviations from protocol are
documented in the laboratory information system (LIS).
13. REFERENCES:
Include primary antibody datasheet, manufacturer’s protocol,
pertinent pathology reference books, and in-house validation data.
This protocol ensures that the technical component of SSTR2
immunostaining is performed accurately and reliably, providing high-
quality slides for pathologists to interpret accurately.
