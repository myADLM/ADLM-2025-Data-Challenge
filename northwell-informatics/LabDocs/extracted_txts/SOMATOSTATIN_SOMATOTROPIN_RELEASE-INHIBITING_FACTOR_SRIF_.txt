Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Somatostatin (SRIF)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines procedures for the analytical phase of
Somatostatin (Somatotropin Release-Inhibiting Factor, SRIF) testing
to provide accurate, reliable results following specimen collection and
accessioning.
RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this protocol and ensuring accurate and precise measurement of
Somatostatin (SRIF) levels. It is the duty of all staff members to
report any inconsistencies or issues to their supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Somatostatin (SRIF) is a peptide hormone that regulates the
endocrine system and inhibits the release of various secondary
hormones, including growth hormone.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred/acceptable:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes, immediately placed on ice, and
centrifuged within 30 minutes to separate plasma.
• Serum separator tubes are also acceptable but must be
processed within specified stability limits.
Unacceptable:
• Samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
• Specimens arriving more than one hour after collection and not
refrigerated or kept on ice
• Non-centrifuged samples arriving at room temperature
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge capable of 2000 x g
• Freezer (-80°C)
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Vortex mixer
• ELISA kit specific for Somatostatin (SRIF)
• Multichannel pipette and tips
• Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
• Calibrated traceable thermometers
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Negative and Positive QC provided by ELISA kit
• Internal QC sample run with each batch
Storage:
• Store controls and standards as per manufacturer’s instructions,
typically at -20°C or -80°C
Procedure:
• Run controls along with patient samples in each assay to ensure
accuracy and precision of the test.
• Record control results and assess validity before continuing with
patient sample analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Thaw frozen plasma/serum samples to room temperature.
• Mix samples by gentle inversion or vortexing.
Assay Execution:
1. Prepare reagents, samples, and standards per the
manufacturer’s ELISA protocol.
2. Pipette predetermined volumes of standards, controls, and
patient samples into designated wells of the microplate.
3. Incubate the plate as per assay instructions.
4. Wash the plate to remove unbound substances.
5. Add substrate solution to each well. Incubate according to kit
instructions for color development.
6. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
7. Measure the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader
set at 450 nm.
Calculation of Results:
• Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of
standard wells.
• Calculate the concentration of Somatostatin (SRIF) in patient
samples from the standard curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and verification.
• Reference Intervals: Report results as defined by validated
reference intervals specific to the patient demographic, generally:
◦ Normal Range: 10-90 pg/mL
• Indicate any procedural or integrity issues noted during analysis in
the report.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
accuracy of the test.
• Inconsistent handling or storage conditions may affect the stability
of the hormone.
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for detailed information on individual
reagent limitations and cross-reactivity.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS AND ACTIONS
• Any critically aberrant values must be rechecked and confirmed
before reporting.
• Critical results involving patient care should be communicated to
the appropriate healthcare personnel immediately.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs of specimen receipt, assay batch runs, quality
control results, and instrument calibration.
• Document any deviations from protocol and corrective actions
taken.
