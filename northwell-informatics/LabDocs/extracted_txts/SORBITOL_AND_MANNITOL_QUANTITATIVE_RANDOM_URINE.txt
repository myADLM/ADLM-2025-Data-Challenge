Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SORBITOL AND
MANNITOL, QUANTITATIVE, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
sorbitol and mannitol in random urine samples to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
quantitative analysis of sorbitol and mannitol in random urine
samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All personnel performing the test must adhere to this SOP and be
trained on the equipment and procedures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and providing any necessary training and resources.
• Designated staff are responsible for maintaining records and
ensuring quality control protocols are followed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Random urine.
Collection and Handling:
• A clean, dry container should be used for specimen collection.
• Record the collection date and time on the container and
requisition.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately; store at
2-8°C if there is a delay in transport.
• Ensure the specimen is mixed thoroughly before aliquoting for
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens that are heavily contaminated or visibly altered.
• Specimens stored incorrectly or delayed in transport as per
stabilized storability protocols.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) system.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Analytical balance.
Reagents:
• Analytical grade sorbitol and mannitol standards.
• Internal standard solution.
• LC-MS grade methanol.
• Water (HPLC grade).
• Mobile phase solutions (example: methanol and water with 0.1%
formic acid).
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
a. Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
• Prepare calibration standards by diluting analytical grade sorbitol
and mannitol in HPLC grade water.
• Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations in urine.
b. Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge the urine samples at 1500xg for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates.
• Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 1 mL) of the centrifuged urine
into a sample vial.
• Add internal standard solution to each sample vial.
• Vortex the vials thoroughly to ensure proper mixing.
LC-MS Analysis:
a. Instrument Setup:
• Set up the LC-MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Prepare the mobile phases (e.g., 0.1% formic acid in water and
0.1% formic acid in methanol).
• Program the LC-MS system with the appropriate gradient elution
method optimized for sorbitol and mannitol separation.
b. Sample Injection:
• Load the prepared calibration standards, QC samples, and urine
specimens into the autosampler.
• Initiate the LC-MS run using the programmed method.
c. Data Acquisition and Processing:
• Ensure the LC and MS parameters are correctly set to detect
sorbitol and mannitol.
• Review chromatograms to confirm the correct retention times and
quantification of peaks.
• Integrate the peaks using the instrument’s software for
quantification.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
• Run calibration standards and QC samples at the beginning,
middle, and end of each batch of samples.
• Ensure QC samples are within established acceptance criteria
before reporting patient results.
• Perform internal quality control checks as per laboratory
guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all analytical data before result reporting.
• Report results in mmol/L, ensuring they fall within the method’s
linear range.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure they are properly reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for the LC-MS instrument for
specific limitations regarding sensitivity, specificity, and matrix
effects.
• Ensure sample integrity to avoid false results due to
contamination or improper storage.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manual for the LC-MS system.
• Analytical method development literature for sorbitol and mannitol
quantification.
• Laboratory quality control and validation protocols.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines for handling biological
specimens and reagents.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Handle reagents and samples in a well-ventilated area.
Documentation:
Maintain proper logbooks and records for all calibration standards,
QC samples, and patient samples analyzed. Document any
deviations, troubleshooting steps, and corrective actions taken.
This protocol ensures standardized procedures for the accurate and
reliable analysis of sorbitol and mannitol in random urine specimens,
maintaining compliance with regulatory standards and ensuring high-
quality patient care.
