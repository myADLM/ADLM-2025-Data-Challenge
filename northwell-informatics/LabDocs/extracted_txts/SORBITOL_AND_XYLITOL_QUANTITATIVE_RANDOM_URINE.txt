Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative Analysis
of Sorbitol and Xylitol in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
quantitative analysis of sorbitol and xylitol in random urine samples.
This procedure is intended for use by qualified laboratory personnel.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analytical
phase of generating results for sorbitol and xylitol, quantitative,
random, urine tests.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere strictly to
the following procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
test results. All deviations from this SOP must be documented, and
appropriate corrective actions must be taken.
1. DEFINITION
• Sorbitol: A sugar alcohol used as a sugar substitute.
• Xylitol: A sugar alcohol used as a sugar substitute.
• Quantitative Analysis: Measurement of the concentration of
specific substances in the sample.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Random urine sample.
• Specimen volume: Minimum 5 mL of urine.
• Storage: Specimen must be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed
more than 24 hours but less than 72 hours. For delays longer
than 72 hours, the specimen should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens with visible contamination
or significant hemolysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a refractive index detector (RID) or mass
spectrometer (MS) detector.
• Analytical columns suitable for sorbitol and xylitol separation.
• Standard solutions of sorbitol and xylitol.
• Internal standards (if applicable).
• Mobile phase reagents.
• Laboratory glassware and disposable pipette tips.
• Urine sample vials and labels.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen urine samples at room temperature if applicable.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
3. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
4. Transfer the supernatant into a clean sample vial.
5. Prepare standards and quality control samples using the same
procedure.
B) Calibration and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare standard solutions of sorbitol and xylitol at different
concentrations.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
3. Run the calibration standards and QC samples at the beginning
of each analytical batch.
C) Instrumental Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Program the HPLC system with the following parameters
(adjust as necessary):
◦ Column type: Suitable for sorbitol and xylitol separation.
◦ Mobile phase: Choose an appropriate solvent (e.g., water/
acetonitrile gradient).
◦ Flow rate: Adjust according to column specifications.
◦ Detection wavelength/parameter: As specified for sorbitol
and xylitol detection.
3. Inject an appropriate volume of the prepared urine sample into
the HPLC system.
4. Run the HPLC analysis.
5. Collect the chromatograms and identify the peaks
corresponding to sorbitol and xylitol by comparing with standard
retention times.
D) Quantification:
1. Calculate the concentration of sorbitol and xylitol in the urine
samples using the standard curve generated from the
calibration standards.
2. Ensure all QC samples meet the acceptance criteria.
3. If any QC sample falls outside the acceptable range, investigate
and take corrective actions before proceeding with sample
analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the calculated concentrations into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify the results by a qualified technologist.
• Report the quantitative results for sorbitol and xylitol in mg/dL
units.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run quality control samples with each batch of urine samples.
• Investigate and document any QC failures and implement
corrective actions.
• Maintain records of all quality control activities and results for
audit purposes.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC system.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards for urine analysis.
NOTE: This SOP is to be reviewed annually, or whenever there are
changes to methods, reagents, or instrumentation.
