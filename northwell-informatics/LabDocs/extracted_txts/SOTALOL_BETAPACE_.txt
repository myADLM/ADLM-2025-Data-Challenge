Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Sotalol (Betapace)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized methodology for analyzing blood levels of
Sotalol (Betapace) in patient specimens within a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This procedure ensures accuracy, reliability, and
consistency in the quantification of Sotalol for therapeutic monitoring.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis of Sotalol as described in this procedure. All staff are
accountable for ensuring that quality control procedures are followed,
results are accurately documented, and any deviations or issues are
promptly communicated to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Plasma collected in heparinized vacutainers (dark green or PST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected with sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate,
or EDTA.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled.
• Specimens collected in vacutainers other than SST or heparinized
vacutainers.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately and are stable for up to 7 days when stored at 2-8°C.
• If frozen, specimens are stable for up to 3 months at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or LC-
MS/MS.
• Centrifuge.
• Calibrated pipettes.
Reagents:
• Commercially available Sotalol calibrators and quality control
materials.
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, buffer solutions).
Supplies:
• SST or heparinized vacutainers.
• Centrifuge tubes.
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., solid-phase extraction
columns if HPLC is used).
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge whole blood specimens at 1,500-2,000 g for 10
minutes to separate the serum or plasma.
◦ Transfer the supernatant (serum or plasma) to a clean,
labeled centrifuge tube.
2. Extraction:
◦ If using HPLC, perform the extraction using Solid Phase
Extraction (SPE) columns according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ If using LC-MS/MS, follow the recommended sample
preparation protocol ensuring minimal matrix effects.
Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Prepare Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare a series of Sotalol calibrators (e.g., 0, 50, 100, 200,
500, 1000 ng/mL).
◦ Run calibration standards through the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
to generate a calibration curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze at least two levels of QC samples, incorporating
one low and one high concentration of Sotalol to validate the
accuracy of the assay.
◦ Ensure QC results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
Sample Analysis:
1. Load the Instrument:
◦ Load prepared patient samples, calibrators, and QC
samples into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
2. Run the Analysis:
◦ Start the instrument’s run according to the validated method
parameters (e.g., gradient elution if HPLC, optimized mass
transitions if LC-MS/MS).
3. Data Acquisition and Analysis:
◦ Monitor chromatograms or mass spectra.
◦ Utilize the system software to quantify Sotalol
concentrations in patient samples based on the calibration
curve.
Result Reporting:
1. Review Results:
◦ Verify the sample integrity and consistency of QC results
before reporting.
◦ Any samples with anomalies or QC failures should be re-
analyzed.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter quantified Sotalol results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Apply appropriate reference ranges for therapeutic and toxic
levels.
Critical Results:
• Report any critical results immediately to the requesting clinician
and document the communication.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Conduct routine performance checks and system maintenance for
the HPLC or LC-MS/MS instruments.
• Adhere to the internal quality control protocols and external
proficiency testing as per CLIA standards.
• Document and investigate any deviations or anomalies observed
during sample processing and analysis.
