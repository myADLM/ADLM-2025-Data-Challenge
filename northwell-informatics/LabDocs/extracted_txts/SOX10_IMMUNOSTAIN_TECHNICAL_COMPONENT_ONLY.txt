Protocol for SOX10 Immunostain - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for the
technical component of SOX10 immunostain, including the
preparation, staining, and quality control steps necessary to generate
reliable and reproducible results.
RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all trained personnel to
ensure that immunostain procedures are performed following this
protocol and to report any discrepancies or deviations to the
supervising pathologist.
1. DEFINITION
SOX10 is a marker used for identifying neural crest-derived cells,
Schwann cells, and melanocytes. It is typically employed in the
diagnosis of neural and melanocytic tumors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue requirements:
◦ Preferred: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue block.
◦ Unacceptable: Tissue that has been fixed in alternative
fixatives, inadequate fixation, or improperly processed
specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Hot plate or oven
◦ Coplin jars or staining dishes
◦ Immunostaining platform (automated or manual)
◦ Microscope
• Reagents and Consumables:
◦ SOX10 primary antibody
◦ Detection system reagents (e.g., HRP/DAB or AP/Red)
◦ Hematoxylin for counterstaining
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Positive and negative control slides
◦ Xylene and alcohol for deparaffinization and rehydration
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
for washes
◦ Cover slips
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Slides:
1. Cut 3-4 µm sections from the paraffin-embedded tissue block
using a microtome.
2. Float the sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C.
3. Transfer the sections onto microscope slides and incubate on a
hot plate or in an oven at 60°C for 30-60 minutes to ensure
adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in xylene for 5 minutes, repeat once.
2. Transfer slides through a graded series of alcohols:
◦ 100% ethanol for 3 minutes, twice.
◦ 95% ethanol for 3 minutes.
◦ 80% ethanol for 3 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in running distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a microwave or pressure cooker and
follow the manufacturer’s instruction for the specific SOX10
antibody.
2. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for at least 20
minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking and Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply a protein block solution to prevent non-specific binding
and incubate per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Drain the blocking solution and apply the primary antibody
(SOX10), incubate as per manufacturer’s recommendations
(typically 30-60 minutes at room temperature).
3. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS three times, 5 minutes each.
E. Detection:
1. Apply appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody and incubate
as per manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS three times, 5 minutes each.
3. Apply enzyme-conjugated streptavidin (e.g., HRP or AP) and
incubate per manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS three times, 5 minutes each.
5. Develop the chromogen (e.g., DAB for HRP, Red substrate for
AP) and monitor under a microscope until the desired staining
intensity is achieved.
6. Rinse sections in running distilled water for 5 minutes.
F. Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Blue slides in PBS or TBS for 2-3 minutes.
G. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions:
◦ 80% ethanol for 3 minutes.
◦ 95% ethanol for 3 minutes.
◦ 100% ethanol for 3 minutes, twice.
2. Clear slides in xylene for 5 minutes, twice.
3. Apply mounting medium and coverslips.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive control: Include a known positive control slide with each
staining run to ensure the staining has worked correctly.
• Negative control: Include a negative control (no primary antibody)
to check for non-specific staining.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
The prepared slides will be reviewed by a pathologist for
interpretation. The technical component does not involve result
interpretation but ensures that the staining quality is consistent and
reliable.

1. DISPOSAL
Dispose of all reagents and consumables according to standard
laboratory biohazard and chemical waste protocols.
By following this protocol, laboratory staff will ensure consistent and
accurate technical preparation of SOX10 immunostains for diagnostic
purposes.
