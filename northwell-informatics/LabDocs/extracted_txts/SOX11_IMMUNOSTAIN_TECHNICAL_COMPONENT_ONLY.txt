Standard Operating Procedure for SOX11 Immunostaining, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE To standardize the procedure for performing SOX11
immunostaining on tissue specimens to ensure accurate and
reproducible immunohistochemical results that aid in clinical
diagnosis.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
immunostaining procedures, maintaining instruments, and
documenting the process.
• Quality control personnel are responsible for reviewing the
staining results to ensure they meet set standards.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the competency of staff
and compliance with SOPs.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or
sections mounted on positively charged slides.
• Tissue sections should be 4-5 micrometers thick.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens not fixed in formalin.
• Unlabeled or improperly labeled specimens.
• Tissue sections thicker than 5 micrometers or thinner than 4
micrometers.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody: SOX11 (clone and supplier details)
• Secondary Antibody: Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody
• Detection Reagent: DAB substrate or other chromogen
appropriate for HRP detection
• Wash Buffers: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS)
• Mounting Medium: Permanent mounting medium
• Control slides: Known positive and negative tissue controls
• Xylene and ethanol for deparaffinization and rehydration
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
• Light microscope
• Oven set to 60°C
• Humidified chamber for incubation
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Place sections on positively charged slides.
3. Dry slides at 60°C for at least 30 minutes to ensure adherence.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene for 2
x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a series of ethanol solutions (100%, 95%,
85%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) or other appropriate retrieval solution.
2. Heat the slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath
for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in buffer for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by wash buffer.
Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply SOX11 primary antibody and incubate in a humidified
chamber at room temperature for 60 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and
incubate for 30 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
Chromogen Development:
1. Apply DAB substrate solution and incubate until desired
staining intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water.
3. Blue the hematoxylin stain by dipping slides in weak ammonia
water or Scott’s tap water substitute.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate tissue sections through graded ethanols (70%, 85%,
95%, 100%).
2. Clear in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
3. Apply permanent mounting medium and coverslip.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative control slides with each run.
• Review stained control sections under a light microscope to
confirm the appropriate staining pattern and intensity.
• Document all quality control results in the laboratory logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The pathologist will review the stained slides and ensure the
technical quality is acceptable.
• Any deviations or issues noted during staining should be
documented and communicated to the supervisor.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocols for SOX11 antibody.
• Standard immunohistochemistry textbooks and guidelines.
• Internal laboratory quality control procedures and documentation
forms.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all procedures, reagent lot numbers, and any
deviations from the protocol in the laboratory information system
(LIS) or departmental logbook.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
maintain compliance with the latest standards and practices in
immunohistochemistry.
