Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Soybean IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedure for the analysis and quantification of
soybean-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum specimens using
standardized laboratory methods. This will ensure accurate and
reliable test results for clinical diagnosis.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the soybean IgE assay.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to perform
the assay and adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP and to address any
deviations.
4. DEFINITION:
Soybean, IgE, Serum:
• Soybean-specific IgE: Immunoglobulin E antibodies specific to
soybean proteins.
• Serum: The clear liquid that can be separated from clotted blood
and used for various immunoassays.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Type:
• Serum obtained from a clotted blood sample.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using a standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and
then centrifuge at 1500x g for 10 minutes to separate the serum.
Storage and Stability:
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if analyzing within 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles to preserve the integrity of the
IgE antibodies.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or oxalate tubes.
6. MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, AND REAGENTS:
• ELISA or ImmunoCAP instrument
• Microtiter plates (if using ELISA method)
• Soybean-specific IgE calibrators and controls
• Conjugate reagent (enzyme-labelled anti-IgE)
• Substrate reagent
• Stop solution
• Wash buffer
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (if using ELISA) or relevant analyzer
• Reagent-grade water
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
Controls:
• Use low, medium, and high internal quality controls with every
assay run.
• Verify that control values fall within the acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results.
Calibration:
• Calibrate the instrument daily before testing patient specimens.
• Use calibrators provided or recommended by the assay
manufacturer.
8. PROCEDURE:
A) Setup and Calibration:
1. Turn on and preheat the analyzer (ELISA reader or
ImmunoCAP instrument).
2. Perform daily calibration using soybean-specific IgE calibrators.
3. Prepare all reagents and bring them to room temperature.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Label microtiter plate wells or sample cups for each patient
sample, control, and calibrator.
2. Pipette required volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum specimens into designated wells/sample cups.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Add enzyme-labelled anti-IgE conjugate to each well/sample
cup containing the serum samples, controls, and calibrators.
2. Incubate at the recommended temperature and time specified
by the kit's protocol (typically at 37°C for 30-60 minutes).
3. Wash the wells/sample cups thoroughly to remove unbound
components.
4. Add substrate reagent to each well/sample cup and incubate for
the specified time.
5. Add stop solution when the colorimetric reaction is sufficient.
6. Measure absorbance using a microplate reader (ELISA) at the
specified wavelength or release samples on ImmunoCAP, and
allow the automated system to measure the response.
D) Data Analysis and Result Interpretation:
1. Calculate the IgE concentration for each patient specimen by
comparing the absorbance (ELISA) or signal (ImmunoCAP) to
the standard curve generated from calibrators.
2. Report results in kU/L.
E) Documentation:
1. Document all calibration, quality control, reagent lot numbers,
and equipment maintenance in the appropriate logbooks.
2. Record patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) for validation and reporting.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If control values are out of range, re-run the assay with new
controls.
• Inspect reagents for expiration and contamination.
• Check instrument calibration and maintenance logs.
• Consult the supervisor for persistent problems or unexpected
results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review and verify patient results in the LIS.
• Report critical values immediately to the requesting clinician as
per laboratory policy.
• Document all communications and actions taken.
11. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert and operations manual.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards and guidelines.
12. REVISION LOG:
• Initial document: October 2023
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed if procedural
updates are required.
