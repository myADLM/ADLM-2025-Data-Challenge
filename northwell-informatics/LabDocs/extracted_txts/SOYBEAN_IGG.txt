Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Soybean IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) delineates the procedures
to be followed for the analysis and generation of results for Soybean
Immunoglobulin G (IgG). This protocol ensures consistent and
accurate analysis for diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Laboratory Technologist: Perform the assay strictly
according to this SOP.
• Quality Control Supervisor: Ensure all QC measures are
followed and documented.
• Laboratory Manager: Ensure all personnel are trained and
compliant with the SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 7 days when stored at
2-8°C. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. Samples not labeled with patient ID. Samples that have
not been stored properly.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Micropipettes (variable volume)
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator (set to 37°C±0.5°C)
• Soybean IgG ELISA Kit
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Buffer (e.g., TMB)
• Stop Solution (e.g., 2N H₂SO₄)
• Controls (Positive and Negative)
• Distilled Water
• Laboratory Timer
• Laboratory Coats, Gloves, and Eye Protection
5. PROCEDURES
A. Preparation
• Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
• Mix all reagents thoroughly by gentle inversion before use.
• Prepare any required reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions provided in the ELISA kit.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and samples. Each
standard, control, and specimen should be tested in
duplicate.
2. Specimen Addition:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and specimens into
their designated wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate with a plate sealer and incubate at
37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ After incubation, manually or automatically wash the plate
using Wash Buffer.
◦ Perform 5 wash cycles with 300 µL of Wash Buffer per well.
Ensure no residual liquid remains at the end of the washing
steps.
5. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of HRP-Conjugate into each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate again at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Second Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
7. Addition of Substrate:
◦ Add 100 µL of Substrate Buffer (TMB) to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate (covered) at room temperature (20-25°C)
in the dark for 15 minutes.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of Stop Solution to each well. The color will
change from blue to yellow.
9. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well within 30
minutes using an ELISA reader set to 450 nm (reference
filter at 630 nm is optional).
C. Result Calculation
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their known concentrations.
2. Determine the concentration of Soybean IgG in patient
samples by comparing their OD values to the standard
curve.
3. Record results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with every assay. Ensure that
control results fall within acceptable ranges stated by the
manufacturer.
• Document all QC results in the QC logbook. Any deviations must
be investigated, and corrective actions should be documented.
7. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• All results must be reviewed and validated by a certified
laboratory technologist before reporting.
• Record results, QC data, and any deviations in the laboratory's
record-keeping system.
• Report critical and out-of-range results to the attending physician
immediately according to the laboratory's critical results policy.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls fail: Review the procedure, reagents, and equipment
calibration. Repeat the test. Document any issues and corrective
actions.
• Deviations in standards: Check the expiration date and storage
conditions of standards and reagents. Repeat the assay if
necessary.
• Instrument errors: Refer to the manufacturer's troubleshooting
guide or contact technical support.
