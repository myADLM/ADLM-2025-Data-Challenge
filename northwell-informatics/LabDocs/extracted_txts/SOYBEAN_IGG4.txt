Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Soybean IgG4
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the accurate and reliable
analysis of Soybean-specific IgG4 levels in human serum using
automated immunoassay technology.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff performing the analysis of Soybean
IgG4 in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure accurately and document all actions taken.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are properly
trained and that the procedures are followed.
4. DEFINITIONS
Soybean IgG4: Immunoglobulin G subclass 4 specific to soybean
proteins. Immunoassay: A biochemical test that measures the
presence or concentration of Soybean IgG4 in a sample through
antigen-antibody binding.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (with Soybean IgG4 specific
assay capability)
• Soybean IgG4 calibration standards
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
• Reagent kits specific for Soybean IgG4
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sample cups or tubes
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) access
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant-containing tubes (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Specimen Preparation
1. Receive and accession the specimen according to the
laboratory's specimen handling protocol.
2. Allow the serum specimen to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
4. Transfer the clear serum to a labeled sample cup or tube.
5. Store the serum at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately. Ensure analysis is performed within 7 days of
collection.
7.2. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the automated immunoassay analyzer using Soybean
IgG4 calibration standards. Refer to the manufacturer's
instructions for calibration procedures.
2. Perform quality control (QC) using negative and positive
controls before running patient samples. Record QC results in
the QC log.
3. Ensure the QC results are within established acceptable ranges
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
4. If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, investigate and
resolve the issue before analyzing patient samples. Consult the
supervisor if necessary.
7.3. Patient Sample Analysis
1. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and QC
materials onto the automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions for Soybean IgG4 assay.
3. Initiate the analysis sequence.
4. Once the analysis is complete, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
5. Verify that all patient results are within the reportable range.
6. If any results are flagged by the analyzer or outside the
reportable range, repeat the analysis or perform additional
verification steps as required.
7. Document all actions, results, and any corrective measures
taken in the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
2. Review and validate the results in the LIS.
3. Ensure that results are reported within the established
turnaround time.
4. Document and communicate any critical results to the
requesting healthcare provider promptly following laboratory
policy.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the automated
immunoassay analyzer as per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Participate in bi-annual proficiency testing for Soybean IgG4
analysis.
3. Address any instrument errors, calibration failures, or QC
issues immediately.
4. Document any troubleshooting steps and corrective actions
taken.
