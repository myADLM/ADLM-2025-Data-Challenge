SP100 AND GP210 ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable analysis of SP100 and GP210
Antibodies, IgG, in serum samples. This protocol describes the
procedures to be followed for the analytical phase of testing to
ensure consistency and accuracy in generating results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document all procedures related to the SP100 and GP210
Antibodies, IgG, serum analysis. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that proper procedures are followed, and any corrective
actions are taken if necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL of serum
• Specimen Stability: Specimens should be tested immediately or
stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term storage, serum
samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plates and reader
• Incubators
• Plate washer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Reagents and controls as per the ELISA kit specifications
• SP100 and GP210 Antibodies, IgG ELISA kit
• Deionized or distilled water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and lab
coat
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the collected blood sample to separate the serum.
2. Aliquot the serum into labeled secondary tubes if sample will be
tested later. Store as per stability guidelines.
B) ELISA Setup
1. Bring all reagents, serum samples, controls, and calibrators to
room temperature before use.
2. Label the ELISA plate to match the sample identification.
3. Prepare the wash solution, substrate solution, and any other
required reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
C) Sample and Reagent Addition
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to the
designated wells.
2. Incubate the plate for the specified time at room temperature
(usually 30-60 minutes).
3. Wash the plate as per the manufacturer's instructions, typically
3-5 times.
D) Detection and Measurement
1. Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well (if
applicable).
2. Incubate for the specified time at room temperature.
3. Wash the plate 3-5 times.
4. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
5. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the
specified time (usually 10-20 minutes).
6. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
7. Read the absorbance using an ELISA plate reader at the
specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
E) Data Interpretation
1. Enter the raw absorbance values into the ELISA software for
analysis.
2. Generate the standard curve based on the calibrator values.
3. Calculate the concentrations of SP100 and GP210 Antibodies,
IgG in the patient samples.
4. Compare patient results to the reference intervals to determine
normal or abnormal results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run internal quality control (QC) samples alongside patient
samples in every batch to ensure the accuracy of the results.
2. Acceptable control values should fall within the specified range
provided in the manufacturer’s insert.
3. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, do not report
patient results. Investigate the cause, repeat QC and patient
samples, and take corrective actions as needed.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. All results should be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results to ensure accuracy before
releasing them.
3. Results should be reported in standard units (e.g., U/mL) with
appropriate reference intervals included in the report.
4. Include any comments regarding sample integrity or deviations
from the standard procedure.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for SP100 and GP210 Antibodies, IgG should
be established based on the population served by the lab and
according to the ELISA kit manufacturer’s guidelines.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for individual test limitations. These
limitations should be understood and considered when
interpreting the results, especially in patients with known clinical
conditions that might interfere with the assay.
