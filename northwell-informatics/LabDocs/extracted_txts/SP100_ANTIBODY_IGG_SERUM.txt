Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
SP100 Antibody, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the necessary steps for
accurately generating results for SP100 Antibody, IgG in serum
samples. This involves detailed instructions for processing, analyzing,
and reporting results in order to ensure consistency, accuracy, and
validity of the test outcomes.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in processing
and analyzing serum samples for SP100 Antibody, IgG levels using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other relevant
immunoassay methodologies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing the assay
to follow this SOP as described. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring staff competency, overseeing the
implementation of the SOP, and troubleshooting any issues
encountered during the assay process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• SP100 Antibody: Autoantibodies targeting the SP100 antigen,
often associated with autoimmune diseases.
• IgG: Immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a plain red-top
tube or serum-separating tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C
or 6 months at -20°C.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit specific for SP100 IgG antibodies
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
with a reference wavelength of 620 nm
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Timer
• Distilled or deionized water
• Laboratory coat and gloves
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) prior to use.
2. Prepare all necessary reagents as per the ELISA kit
instructions, including wash buffer, sample diluent, substrate
solution, stop solution, and standards/calibrators.
3. Label all microplate wells according to the standards, controls,
and patient samples plan.
B) Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Dilute serum samples as required by the kit instructions,
typically 1:100 with sample diluent or as specified by the
protocol.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted patient samples
to the appropriate microplate wells.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1
hour, according to kit instructions.
3. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the plate 3-5 times
with wash buffer. Ensure complete removal of liquid after each
wash.
4. Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well and
incubate at room temperature for the period specified by the kit.
5. Repeat the aspirate and wash step as above.
6. Add 100 μL of TMB substrate solution to each well and incubate
for 10-15 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
7. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well - the stop solution will
change the color from blue to yellow.
8. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 620 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run internal controls provided by the ELISA kit to ensure assay
reliability.
2. Each assay run must include a blank, a negative control, a high
positive control, and calibrators to generate a standard curve.
3. Review control results to verify their acceptance against
predefined ranges.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the concentration of SP100 IgG antibodies in patient
samples using the standard curve and the OD values.
2. Document results and ensure they are consistent with historical
data or expected ranges.
3. Ensure that abnormal or critical results are flagged and
reported to the responsible clinician promptly, following lab
protocols.
10. INTERPRETATION AND REFERENCE RANGES
• Negative Result: SP100 IgG levels below the cut-off as defined
by the assay (usually <20 U/mL, but refer to specific kit
instructions).
• Positive Result: SP100 IgG levels above the cut-off.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer instructions for any specific limitations of
the ELISA kit, which may include interference by certain substances
or the need for additional confirmatory testing in ambiguous cases.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific ELISA kit used for
SP100 IgG antibody detection.
• Relevant literature on SP100 antibodies and their clinical
significance.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If aberrant control results are observed, verify reagent preparation
and assay setup.
• Rerun controls and samples in duplicate if necessary.
• Consult the kit’s troubleshooting guide or a supervisor if persistent
issues occur.
