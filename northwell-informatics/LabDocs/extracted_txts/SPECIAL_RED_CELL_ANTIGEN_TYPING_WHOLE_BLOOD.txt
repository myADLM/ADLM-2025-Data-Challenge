Special Red Cell Antigen Typing, Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the typing of special red cell
antigens in whole blood. This procedure outlines the testing steps to
accurately determine an individual's red blood cell antigens beyond
the routine ABO and Rh(D) antigens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure is to be performed by qualified medical laboratory
scientists with competency in immunohematology. The laboratory
staff are responsible for following this protocol, documenting all test
results, and reporting any anomalies to the laboratory supervisor or
designated authority.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen type: Whole blood Acceptable anticoagulants: EDTA
(lavender top) or ACD (yellow top) Specimen volume: Minimum 5 mL
Stability: Specimen must be tested within 72 hours of collection; if
delayed, store at 2-8°C and test within 7 days.
1. MATERIALS, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Reagent red cells (commercially available panel)
• Anti-human globulin (AHG) reagent
• Monoclonal and polyclonal antisera for specific red cell antigens
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Microtubes for centrifugation
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (set at 37°C)
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes
• Timer
• Anti-IgG (for direct antiglobulin testing if needed)
• Indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) reagents
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analysis:
1. Verify patient identification and label all samples accurately.
2. Record the specimen details, including date and time of
collection, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Inspect the sample for signs of hemolysis or clots. Reject and
request a new sample if present.
B) Preparation of Red Cell Suspension:
1. Prepare a 3-5% suspension of the patient's red cells in PBS: a.
Add approximately 40 μL of packed red cells to 960 μL of PBS.
b. Mix thoroughly.
C) Direct Agglutination Test (Immediate Spin):
1. Label test tubes with patient information and appropriate
antisera.
2. Add 1 drop of the prepared red cell suspension to each
appropriately labeled tube.
3. Add 1 drop of specific antisera to the corresponding tubes.
4. Mix gently and centrifuge at 1000 RPM for 20 seconds.
5. Immediately read macroscopically for agglutination. Grade the
reaction and record results.
D) Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT):
1. Add 2 drops of red cell suspension to each tube.
2. Add 2 drops of specific antisera to test tubes.
3. Incubate the tubes at 37°C for 15-30 minutes.
4. Wash the cells three times with PBS. Decant the wash solution
completely after each wash.
5. Add 2 drops of AHG reagent to each tube.
6. Centrifuge at 1000 RPM for 20 seconds.
7. Read macroscopically for agglutination. Grade the reaction and
record results.
E) Confirmatory Procedures:
1. If the direct test shows weak or no reactions, perform an
indirect antiglobulin test to enhance sensitivity.
2. For antigens that require enzyme treatment (e.g., Rh, Kidd
system), treat cells with the enzyme and repeat the direct and
indirect tests if necessary.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Include a negative control (PBS) and positive control (known
antigen-positive cells) with each batch of testing.
5. Perform daily checks of reagent performance using commercial
control cells.
6. Verify the calibration of the centrifuge and incubator once
monthly.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Enter the test results into the LIS, along with the technologist's
initials.
9. Report any positive or atypical results to the ordering physician
immediately.
10. Ensure prompt documentation and communication of any
critical findings.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific package inserts for limitations on the use of
monoclonal and polyclonal antisera. Hemolyzed, clotted, or
improperly stored specimens may yield unreliable results.
Temperature variations can affect the specificity and sensitivity of the
antibody-antigen reactions.
