Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Specific Gravity
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the accurate and precise
measurement of urine specific gravity (SG). Specific gravity
measures the concentration of solutes in the urine, providing an
indication of renal concentrating ability and hydration status.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel and includes the
steps necessary to determine specific gravity using a refractometer,
automated urinalysis instrument, or dipstick method.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Staff: Perform and document specific gravity
measurements, ensure accurate calibration of instruments, and
carry out any necessary quality control procedures.
• Supervisors: Monitor compliance with this protocol, review
quality control data, and troubleshoot as needed.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Specific Gravity (SG): A measurement that compares the density
of urine to the density of water.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen: 10 mL freshly voided urine,
preferably first-morning void, sent to the laboratory within 6 hours
of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens arriving in the laboratory
greater than 6 hours post-collection without proper preservation,
or those without proper patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
• Refractometer: Calibrated to 1.000 with distilled water.
• Automated Urinalysis Instrument: Calibrated and maintained
per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Dipsticks: Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG, stored at room
temperature, not used past expiry date.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Using a Refractometer
1. Calibrate Refractometer:
◦ Calibrate the refractometer daily using distilled water. It
should read 1.000.
◦ Record the calibration in the logbook.
2. Measurement:
◦ Using a clean pipette, place a few drops of well-mixed urine
onto the refractometer prism.
◦ Close the cover plate and read the value from the SG scale.
◦ Clean the prism with distilled water and dry after each
measurement.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document the specific gravity on the patient’s report and
data log, include date, time, and initials of the technologist.
B. Using an Automated Urinalysis Instrument
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure the instrument is calibrated and quality control
checks have been performed.
◦ Load the urinalysis strip into the instrument as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Measurement:
◦ Pour a small amount of urine sample into the sample holder.
◦ Follow the instrument’s instructions to initiate the test.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record the specific gravity result as displayed by the
instrument on the patient’s report.
C. Using Dipsticks
1. Preparation:
◦ Remove one strip from the bottle, avoiding contact with
other strips.
◦ Ensure the bottle is capped immediately after removing the
strip to avoid contamination and exposure to moisture.
2. Measurement:
◦ Immerse the strip completely in well-mixed urine and
remove immediately.
◦ Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to remove
excess urine.
◦ Read the specific gravity pad at the time indicated in the
package insert.
3. Documentation:
◦ Compare the color change on the strip to the color chart on
the strip bottle.
◦ Record the specific gravity on the patient’s report.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks with both low and high specific gravity
controls daily.
• Document QC results and take corrective action if controls are not
within acceptable limits.
• Refractor: use known standard solutions.
• Automated Instrument: follow manufacturer’s QC protocol.
• Dipsticks: use provided controls.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Notify the supervisor if specific gravity results fall outside normal
reference intervals (1.005 – 1.030).
• Document any corrective actions taken in case of instrument or
procedural failure.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure there are no interferences in the sample (e.g., highly
colored or turbid samples) that may affect SG measurement.
Refer to the equipment and reagent inserts for limitations.
