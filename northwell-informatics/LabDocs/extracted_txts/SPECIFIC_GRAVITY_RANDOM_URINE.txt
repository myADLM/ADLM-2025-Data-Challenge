STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Specific
Gravity, Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the accurate and precise
measurement of the specific gravity of random urine samples.
Responsibility:
The laboratory staff is responsible for conducting the specific gravity
test according to this protocol and ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of the results. It is also their duty to identify any issues or
discrepancies during the testing process and report these to their
supervisor for appropriate corrective action.
1. DEFINITION
Specific Gravity (SG): Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of
urine to the density of an equal volume of water. It is a measurement
of the concentration of solutes in the urine.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Refractometer or Urinalysis Dipstick
• Calibrated pipettes
• Disposable gloves
• Urine sample container
• Deionized water (for refractometer calibration)
• Quality control materials (high and low specific gravity controls)
• Disinfectant wipes
• Laboratory logbook or electronic documentation system
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration
Refractometer:
1. Calibrate the refractometer before use with deionized water.
Apply a few drops of deionized water on the measurement
prism, close the cover plate, and ensure it reads 1.000. If
necessary, adjust according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Urinalysis Dipstick:
1. Verify the expiry date on the dipstick bottle and ensure it is
within the acceptable date range.
2. Perform quality control tests using high and low specific gravity
control materials before patient sample testing. Record the
results in the quality control log.
B. Sample Handling and Preparation
1. Ensure that the urine sample meets the acceptable criteria
(random urine sample received within appropriate time frame,
adequate volume).
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gentle inversion to ensure
homogeneity.
C. Analytical Measurement
Refractometer:
1. Apply a few drops of the urine sample on the refractometer’s
measurement prism.
2. Close the cover plate gently, ensuring no air bubbles are
trapped.
3. Direct the refractometer towards a light source and read the
specific gravity value from the scale.
4. Record the specific gravity directly onto the laboratory log or
electronic documentation system.
5. Clean the refractometer's prism with a disinfectant wipe and dry
with a soft tissue.
Urinalysis Dipstick:
1. Completely immerse a urinalysis dipstick in the urine sample for
about one second, ensuring all reagent pads are wetted.
2. Drag the edge of the dipstick along the container’s rim to
remove excess urine.
3. Hold the dipstick horizontally to prevent cross-contamination
between reagent pads.
4. Read the specific gravity result at the appropriate time indicated
on the dipstick bottle label.
5. Compare the color of the specific gravity pad to the color chart
on the dipstick bottle and determine the specific gravity value.
6. Record the result in the laboratory log or electronic
documentation system.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Review and verify all specific gravity results for consistency and
accuracy.
9. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
10. Notify the ordering physician of critical or anomalous results
following laboratory policy.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
12. Perform quality control checks using high and low specific
gravity controls at the beginning of each shift or before testing a
new batch of samples.
13. Document the results of quality control tests in the quality
control log.
14. If quality control test results fall outside of acceptable limits, do
not proceed with patient testing until the issue has been
resolved. Notify a supervisor for corrective action.
15. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Specific Gravity: 1.005–1.030
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for the limitations of
specific gravity measurement using the urinalysis dipstick or
refractometer.
