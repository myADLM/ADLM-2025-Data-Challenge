Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Spinach, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Spinach (IgE) using serum specimens in the
laboratory. This includes handling, preparation, analysis, and
documentation to ensure accuracy, reproducibility, and compliance
with regulatory standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing, documenting, and validating the analytical procedures
described herein. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to
adhere to this SOP and report any deviations or anomalies to a
supervisor.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Laboratory-grade microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Serum collection tubes (SST or red-top)
• Spinach-specific IgE ELISA kits (manufacturer: insert specific
manufacturer name/location)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Plate reader spectrophotometer (capable of reading at 450 nm)
• Calibrated timers
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coats, goggles)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for documentation and result
entry
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
1. Serum specimens should be collected following standard
venipuncture procedures using SST or red-top tubes.
2. After collection, allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Centrifuge the collection tubes at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum from cellular components.
4. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean polypropylene tube,
avoiding contamination with cellular debris. Serum should be
stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours, or aliquoted and
frozen at -20°C for longer-term storage.
Reagent Preparation:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reconstituting the
reagents provided with the Spinach-specific IgE ELISA kit.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
3. Calibrate pipettes and ensure the proper function of all
equipment before running the assay.
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare a 96-well ELISA plate according to the assay layout
plan provided in the kit instructions.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples in
duplicate to the designated wells.
3. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. Incubate for 30
minutes at 37°C.
4. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well to
remove unbound materials, ensuring thorough aspiration after
each wash.
5. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate for 20
minutes at room temperature in the dark.
6. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
7. Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a plate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control samples provided with the
ELISA kit in each batch of tests to ensure performance
accuracy.
2. Control results should fall within the manufacturer’s specified
range. If controls do not meet criteria, repeat the assay and
troubleshoot as necessary.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
Calculations and Result Reporting:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance values for each set of duplicate
standards and sample wells.
2. Generate the standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
of the standards against their concentration using software or
graph paper.
3. Determine the concentration of Spinach-specific IgE in patient
serum samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
4. Results are expressed in kUA/L.
Results Documentation:
1. Submit all raw data, including standard curves and sample
calculations, to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify and review the automated results in the LIS before
releasing them.
3. Flag and document any results that fall outside the normal
reference range or are otherwise unexpected.
4. Reference intervals: <0.35 kUA/L (negative), 0.35-0.69 kUA/L
(borderline), 0.7-3.49 kUA/L (class 1 or low), 3.5-17.49 kUA/L
(class 2 or moderate), 17.5-49.9 kUA/L (class 3 or high), ≥50
kUA/L (class 4 or very high).
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
6. Hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination of the serum
samples may interfere with assay performance.
7. Cross-reactivity with other allergens can lead to false-positive
or false-negative results. Consult the kit insert for detailed
cross-reactivity information.
