SPINACH IGG ANALYSIS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
(SOP)
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed SOP for the analytical phase
for the measurement of SPINACH IgG levels in patient
samples. This procedure will ensure consistent, accurate, and
reliable results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to perform the analysis accurately and to ensure all results are
verified and documented as per the laboratory protocols. It is also
their responsibility to follow all quality control procedures and notify
the supervisor of any inconsistencies or issues detected during the
analysis.
1. DEFINITION SPINACH IgG – An immunoglobulin that reacts to
the antigens present in spinach, used to assess allergic
reactions or immune response to spinach in patients.
2. PROCEDURE
3.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA Microplate Reader
• Precision Pipettes and Tips (variable volumes)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Wash Buffer, Substrate Solution, Stop Solution
• SPINACH IgG ELISA Kit (including microplates coated with
spinach antigen, enzyme conjugate, standards, and controls)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Absorbent paper or cloth
• Timer
3.2 Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Serum samples, 1-2 mL, collected and processed
within 2 hours of collection.
• Centrifuge the blood sample and carefully transfer the serum to a
labeled clean tube. Store at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately,
stable up to 48 hours.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples.
3.3 Sample Preparation:
• If stored, allow the serum to equilibrate to room temperature prior
to analysis.
• Vortex samples to ensure homogeneity.
• Prepare controls and standards as per the SPINACH IgG ELISA
Kit insert.
3.4 Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare working solutions of reagents (wash buffer, enzyme
conjugate) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to the
appropriate wells in duplicate.
3. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plate manually or using an automated washer with
wash buffer, repeating 5 times.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. Incubate at 37°C
for 30 minutes.
6. Repeat washing step.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate in the
dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
9. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA Microplate
Reader within 30 minutes.
3.5 Data Analysis and Interpretation:
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against their concentrations.
• Calculate the concentration of SPINACH IgG in the patient
samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
• Correct for any background noise by subtracting the absorbance
of negative controls from all values.
3.6 Quality Control:
• Ensure that control samples fall within predetermined limits.
Investigate and repeat assay if control values are out of range.
• Record all QC data and verify against the laboratory’s predefined
acceptance criteria.
• Document any corrective actions taken if QC results are not within
acceptable ranges.
3.7 Reporting Results:
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) with
proper verification and documentation.
• Validate and verify all result entries. Ensure that critical values are
promptly communicated to the requesting physician following the
laboratory's communication protocols.
3.8 Method Limitations:
• Results may be affected by gross hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial
contamination.
• Cross-reactivity with other antigens and potential interference
from high levels of other immunoglobulins should be considered.
3.9 Reference Intervals:
• SPINACH IgG levels will be interpreted according to established
reference ranges provided in the SPINACH IgG ELISA Kit
instructions or the laboratory’s validated ranges.
3.10 Limits of Detection:
• Refer to the SPINACH IgG ELISA Kit insert for assay sensitivity
and specificity details.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow standard laboratory safety procedures, including PPE use.
• Handle biological samples as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all biohazard materials according to local regulations.

This SOP will ensure the accurate and consistent detection and
quantification of SPINACH IgG in patient samples, complying with
laboratory standards and regulatory requirements.
