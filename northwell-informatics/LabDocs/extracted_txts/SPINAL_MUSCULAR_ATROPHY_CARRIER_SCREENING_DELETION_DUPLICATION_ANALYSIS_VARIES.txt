SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY (SMA) CARRIER SCREENING:
DELETION/DUPLICATION ANALYSIS SOP
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed during the analytical
phase of generating results for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
carrier screening, focusing on deletion/duplication analysis of the
SMN1 and SMN2 genes. This protocol ensures accuracy,
consistency, and reliability of test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory scientists to perform
the steps outlined in this protocol. Supervisors must ensure all staff
are trained and competent to carry out these procedures and that
performance is monitored regularly.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the SMA carrier screening tests involving
deletion/duplication analysis using validated technologies, such as
Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) or
Quantitative PCR (qPCR).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal Cycler
• Pipettes and tips
• MLPA / qPCR kits for SMN1 and SMN2 gene analysis
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR tubes/96-well plates
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus (if applicable)
• Positive and negative control samples
• Nuclease-free water
• DNA ladder (if applicable)
• Fluorometer/spectrophotometer for quantification of DNA
• Reagent-grade chemicals
1. DEFINITIONS
SMN1 gene: Survival Motor Neuron gene 1 involved in SMA. SMN2
gene: Survival Motor Neuron gene 2 involved in SMA. MLPA:
Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification, a technique used
for deletion/duplication analysis. qPCR: Quantitative Polymerase
Chain Reaction, used for quantifying target DNA sequences.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from the collected blood/saliva samples
using a validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
fluorometer or spectrophotometer. Acceptable DNA
concentration is 20-100 ng/µl with a purity ratio (A260/A280) of
1.8-2.0.
3. Aliquot the DNA samples into designated tubes or 96-well
plates for further processing.
B. MLPA/qPCR Setup
1. Prepare the MLPA or qPCR reaction mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Include necessary positive and
negative controls.
2. Transfer the reaction mix to PCR tubes or 96-well plates
containing the DNA samples.
3. Run the MLPA/qPCR reactions in a thermal cycler with the
recommended thermal profile.
C. Electrophoresis (for MLPA)
1. Prepare the gel electrophoresis apparatus and load the MLPA
products.
2. Run the gel according to standard electrophoresis protocol.
3. Visualize and document the results using an appropriate
imaging system.
D. Data Analysis
1. For MLPA: Analyze the gel images using designated MLPA
software for band intensity and normalization against control
peaks.
2. For qPCR: Calculate the relative quantification of SMN1 and
SMN2 gene copies using appropriate qPCR analysis software.
3. Interpret the results based on established criteria for SMN1 and
SMN2 gene deletion/duplication.
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests to
ensure accuracy and validity.
2. Review the control results before proceeding to the analysis of
patient samples.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
process and take corrective actions as necessary.
F. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify the consistency and accuracy of the results
by a qualified technologist.
2. Generate a report summarizing the findings, including any
detected SMN1 deletions or duplications and copy number
variations of the SMN2 gene.
3. Submit the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure proper review and validation by designated
personnel.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal SMN1 gene copy number: 2 copies
• Carrier status for SMA: 1 copy of SMN1 gene
• Affected individual: 0 copies of SMN1 gene
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
The ability to detect all variants may be limited by the sensitivity of
the MLPA or qPCR platform used. Mutations other than deletions/
duplications in SMN1/SMN2 will not be detected by these methods.
Confirmatory testing or additional genetic analyses (e.g., sequencing)
may be necessary.
