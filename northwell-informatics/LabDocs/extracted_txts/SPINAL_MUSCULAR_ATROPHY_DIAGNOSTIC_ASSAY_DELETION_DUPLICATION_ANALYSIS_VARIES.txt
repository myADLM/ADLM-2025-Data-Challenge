Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Spinal Muscular
Atrophy Diagnostic Assay, Deletion/Duplication Analysis, Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase procedures for conducting Spinal
Muscular Atrophy (SMA) diagnostic assays focusing on deletion/
duplication analysis using specified laboratory techniques. This assay
helps in determining the presence or absence of deletions/
duplications in the SMN1 and SMN2 genes, relevant to the diagnosis
of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
monitoring, and documenting the analysis.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory’s technical supervisor to
review the results and ensure all steps are performed correctly.
• All staff must follow the outlined procedures to ensure the quality
and integrity of the results.
2. DEFINITION
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder caused by
mutations in the SMN1 gene. The deletion or duplication in the SMN1
and SMN2 genes can be analyzed using techniques such as
Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) or
Quantitative PCR (qPCR).
3. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
• Specimen Type: Isolated DNA from peripheral blood, generally
extracted from whole blood samples.
• Sample Storage: DNA samples should be stored at -20°C for
short-term use and -80°C for long-term storage.
B) Reagent Preparation
• Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
specifications and instructions.
• Ensure all reagents, primers, and probes are of analytical grade
and properly labeled with their preparation date, expiry date, and
storage conditions.
C) Equipment and Instrumentation
• PCR Machine (Thermal Cycler)
• MLPA Kits or qPCR Kits specific for SMN1/SMN2 gene analysis
• Electrophoresis System (for MLPA)
• qPCR Instruments (for Quantitative PCR)
• Vortex mixer, centrifuge, micropipettes, and DNA quantification
apparatus
D) Analytical Procedure
I. DNA Quantification and Quality Control
• Use a spectrophotometer or fluorometer to quantify DNA
concentration. Record the concentration and purity (A260/A280
ratio).
• Acceptable DNA concentration: 20-50 ng/µL
• Acceptable A260/A280 Ratio: 1.8-2.0
II. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)
1. Denaturation and Hybridization:
◦ Dilute DNA to a working concentration (50 ng/µL).
◦ Denature DNA at 98°C for 5 minutes and immediately cool
on ice.
◦ Add hybridization buffer and specific MLPA probes to DNA
and incubate at 60°C for 16-20 hours.
2. Ligation:
◦ Add ligase mix to hybridized samples and incubate at 54°C
for 15 minutes.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Perform PCR using ligated DNA with cycling conditions as
per MLPA protocol:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of: Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds,
Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds, Extension at 72°C for
1 minute
▪ Final Extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Fragment Analysis:
◦ Run amplified products on a capillary electrophoresis
system.
◦ Analyze data using specific MLPA software.
III. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare master mix with specific forward and reverse
primers, TaqMan probes, and qPCR reagents.
◦ Distribute appropriate volume into qPCR plate wells and add
DNA templates.
2. qPCR Protocol:
◦ Run qPCR with cycling conditions optimized per
manufacturer's protocol:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
▪ 40 cycles of: Denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds,
Annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 minute
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze Ct values using qPCR software.
◦ Perform relative quantification to determine deletion/
duplication in target genes.
E) Quality Control
• Utilize internal and external controls with every batch of assays.
• Document and review control results before proceeding with
sample analysis.
F) Data Interpretation and Result Reporting
• Evaluate results by comparing sample profiles with controls and
reference standards.
• Generate a report detailing the presence or absence of deletions/
duplications in SMN1 and SMN2 genes.
• Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).

• Manufacturer’s instructions for MLPA/qPCR kits.
• Relevant literature on Spinal Muscular Atrophy diagnosis.
• Practice guidelines for genetic testing and quality control.
5. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all reagent lot numbers, preparation dates, and expiration
dates.
• Maintain temperature logs for all sensitive reagents and
instruments.
• Document all steps, deviations, and corrective actions taken.
6. REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
based on new guidelines, technological advancements, or
laboratory needs.
This SOP ensures the reliability and accuracy in the analysis of
deletions/duplications in SMN1 and SMN2 genes for the diagnosis of
Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It provides standardized procedures that
must be consistently followed by laboratory personnel.
