1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized protocol for
molecular analysis of specimens to identify mutations or genetic
variations associated with Spinobulbar Muscular Atrophy (Kennedy
Disease). This process includes DNA extraction, PCR amplification of
target regions, sequencing, data analysis, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
• Designated molecular technologists are responsible for
performing the procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors and quality assurance personnel are responsible for
monitoring adherence to SOPs, reviewing data, and ensuring
accuracy in reporting.
1. PROCEDURE
The procedure for molecular analysis of Spinobulbar Muscular
Atrophy (Kennedy Disease) is divided into the following steps: DNA
extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, data analysis, and
reporting results.
A) DNA Extraction
1. Obtain specimen (whole blood, saliva, or tissue) that has been
previously collected and accessioned.
2. Extract genomic DNA using the appropriate DNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B) PCR Amplification
1. Design primers specific to the androgen receptor (AR) gene,
which is implicated in Kennedy Disease.
2. Prepare PCR mixture according to the prescribed protocol: a.
10X PCR Buffer b. MgCl2 Solution c. dNTPs Mix (10mM each)
d. Forward and Reverse Primers (10 µM each) e. Taq DNA
Polymerase f. DNA Template g. Nuclease-Free Water to the
final volume
3. Perform PCR in a thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions: a. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes b.
Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds c. Annealing: Optimize
temperature for 30 seconds d. Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
e. Repeat steps b-d for 30-35 cycles f. Final extension: 72°C for
5 minutes g. Hold: 4°C
C) Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare and load 1-2% agarose gel stained with ethidium
bromide or an alternative DNA stain.
2. Load PCR products alongside a suitable DNA ladder.
3. Run gel electrophoresis at 100-120 V for approximately 45
minutes.
4. Visualize bands under UV light and image.
D) Sanger Sequencing
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Prepare sequencing reactions using BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (or equivalent): a. BigDye Terminator
Ready Reaction Mix b. Sequencing Buffer c. Forward or
Reverse Primer d. Purified PCR product e. Nuclease-Free
Water to the final volume
3. Perform sequencing in a thermal cycler using the following
cycling conditions: a. Initial denaturation: 96°C for 1 minute b.
Denaturation: 96°C for 10 seconds c. Annealing: 50°C for 5
seconds d. Extension: 60°C for 4 minutes e. Repeat steps b-d
for 25 cycles f. Hold: 4°C
4. Purify sequencing reactions with Sephadex columns or
equivalent, then run on an automatic sequencer.
E) Data Analysis
1. Trim and align sequencing data using bioinformatics software.
2. Compare sequence data to the reference AR gene sequence.
3. Identify and annotate mutations or repeat expansions within
exon 1 of the AR gene.
F) Interpretation and Reporting Results
1. Interpret findings in the context of known pathogenic variations
and likely benign polymorphisms.
2. Consult with genetic counselors or clinical geneticists if
necessary.
3. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
4. Prepare and issue a finalized report to the ordering physician,
including an interpretation of the results, references to the
clinical significance of identified variants, and related
recommendations.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Include positive, negative, and no-template controls in each run
of PCR and sequencing.
7. Verify that negative controls do not produce amplification or
sequencing products.
8. Ensure that positive controls produce the expected results.
9. Maintain and review quality control logs for each laboratory run.
10. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
11. Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling biological
specimens and reagents.
12. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
13. Handle ethidium bromide and other mutagenic agents in
compliance with safety guidelines to minimize exposure.
14. Properly dispose of all reagents, consumables, and biological
waste according to institutional and regulatory guidelines.
