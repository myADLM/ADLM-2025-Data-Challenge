Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Spinocerebellar Ataxia
Repeat Expansion Panel
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical phase procedures for generating
results for the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Repeat Expansion Panel.
Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a group of inherited
neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive ataxia.
This panel will identify repeat expansions in the ataxia-related genes.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated staff members to
perform and document all analytical phase procedures for the
Spinocerebellar Ataxia Repeat Expansion Panel, as defined in this
SOP. All staff must ensure that procedures are performed correctly
and report any discrepancies to a supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Spinocerebellar Ataxia repeat expansion panel involves the
identification of repeat expansions in specific genes associated with
SCA. Common genes tested include SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6,
SCA7, SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, and others relevant based on clinical
indications.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Ensure that the specimens meet the following criteria:
• Preferred sample type: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes
• Minimum volume: 5 mL whole blood
• Unacceptable samples: Hemolyzed, clotted blood; samples not
collected in EDTA tubes; improperly labeled specimens; samples
older than 72 hours without refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal cycler
• Capillary electrophoresis system
• Spinocerebellar Ataxia Repeat Expansion Panel assay kit
(commercially available)
• DNA extraction kit
• General laboratory supplies (pipettes, tips, microcentrifuge tubes)
• PCR Master Mix
• Gel electrophoresis reagents
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from peripheral blood using the
designated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer and ensure
concentrations are within acceptable range (20-40 ng/μL).
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Set up PCR reactions using the PCR Master Mix and specific
primers for repeat expansions in ataxia-related genes.
2. Pipette the extracted DNA into the reaction tubes and mix
gently.
3. Place the tubes in the thermal cycler and run the appropriate
PCR program as per kit instructions.
4. Verify the completion of the PCR program and store the
amplified products at 4°C until further processing.
C) Capillary Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare the samples for capillary electrophoresis by adding the
internal size standard and denaturing the PCR products.
2. Load the prepared samples into the capillary electrophoresis
instrument.
3. Run the electrophoresis program to separate the PCR products
based on size.
4. Analyze the data generated and ensure clear and well-
separated peaks.
D) Interpretation and Analysis:
1. Use the dedicated software provided with the capillary
electrophoresis system to interpret the data.
2. Identify the repeat expansions by comparing the peaks of the
sample with the control allele ladder.
3. Document each identified repeat expansion and ensure
accurate interpretation.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run controls with each batch of specimens to ensure the
reliability of the results.
2. Validate the results from the controls against expected repeat
sizes for the genes tested.
3. Record all quality control data in the designated log.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate the results before final reporting.
• Issue a formal laboratory report detailing the findings and
interpretations.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for normal repeat sizes and pathogenic
expansions are provided within the assay kit documentation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay kit insert for limitations of the method,
including potential cross-reactions, maximum detectable repeat
sizes, and sensitivity.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If issues arise during any step of the process, consult the
troubleshooting guide provided with the assay kit. Contact a
supervisor for further assistance if the issue persists.
