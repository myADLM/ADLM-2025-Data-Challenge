Standard Operating Procedure for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Types
1, 2, 3, 6, 7 Repeat Expansion Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to detect and analyze CAG repeat
expansions in the ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, and ATXN7
genes, associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7
respectively. This protocol aims to ensure accurate and reliable
results while maintaining consistency across analyses. All steps from
DNA extraction to results reporting are covered in this document.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory Scientists: Conducting the analysis, documenting
the process, troubleshooting as required.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensuring protocol adherence, reviewing
results, addressing any procedural issues or deviations.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA): A group of inherited autosomal
dominant disorders characterized by progressive ataxia and
degeneration of the cerebellum.
• CAG Repeat Expansion Analysis: A molecular technique to
determine the number of CAG repeats in specific gene loci
associated with SCAs.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Specimen: Whole blood samples collected in EDTA tubes,
stored at 2-8°C. DNA extraction should be performed within 24
hours of receipt.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Utilize commercial DNA extraction kits as per
manufacturer’s protocol (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit).
◦ Quantify DNA using spectrophotometry/PicoGreen assay,
ensuring a final concentration of 20-100 ng/μL.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
B) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Setup:
1. Primers and Reagents:
◦ Primers specific to ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, and
ATXN7 with appropriate fluorescent labels for fragment
length analysis.
◦ PCR reagents: Taq DNA polymerase, dNTPs, PCR buffer
with MgCl2.
2. PCR Program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Annealing: Specific temperatures for each primer set (e.g.,
55-65°C) for 30 seconds.
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Store PCR products at 4°C until fragment analysis.
C) Fragment Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis:
1. ABI Genetic Analyzer Setup:
◦ Prepare instrument and fill block with polymer POP-7.
◦ Prepare samples by mixing PCR products with Hi-Di
Formamide and GeneScan 500LIZ size standard.
◦ Denature samples at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by
immediate chilling on ice.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load samples and appropriate controls (normal,
premutation, full expansion controls) onto the ABI
3500/3730 Genetic Analyzer.
◦ Run capillary electrophoresis program.
D) Data Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Use GeneMapper or equivalent software to analyze
electropherograms.
◦ Determine CAG repeat sizes by comparing unknown
samples to size standards and control samples.
◦ Identify normal, intermediate, premutation, and full mutation
ranges as specified for each SCA type.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure all steps are performed according to standard
guidelines.
◦ Validate results by running control samples alongside
patient specimens.
◦ Repeat analysis if discrepancies or anomalies are detected.
3. Results Documentation:
◦ Document all steps, observations, and any deviation from
standard protocols.
◦ Report results in LIS for clinical review, ensuring clear
interpretation notes for clinically relevant findings.
◦ Verify results before reporting, ensuring peer review where
appropriate.
E) Quality assurance
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs to ensure
analytical accuracy and precision.
• Conduct regular competency assessments for all personnel
performing this assay.
