PROTOCAL FOR SPIROCHETE IMMUNOSTAIN (TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY)
1. PURPOSE
The protocol provides guidelines to perform Spirochete
immunostaining on tissue sections. The procedure aims for the
identification of spirochete bacteria in clinical specimen using
immunohistochemistry staining techniques.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to execute this
protocol accurately and safely. The personnel must ensure
consistency and accuracy in staining to obtain reliable results. Any
deviation or errors detected during the process must be reported to
the supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
mounted on positively charged glass slides.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure tissue sections are properly fixed and processed.
• Specimens should be thinly sectioned (3-5 microns) and mounted
securely on slides.
• Slides should be labeled with patient identification details.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody specific for spirochetes
• Secondary Antibody (Enzyme-conjugated)
• Blocking Solution (e.g., BSA or casein-based)
• Antibody Diluent
• Washing Buffer (e.g., PBS or TBS)
• Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting Medium
• Positive Control Slides
• Negative Control Slides
5. EQUIPMENT
• Automated or manual immunostainer
• Humidifying chamber
• Light microscope
• Slide racks & staining dishes
• Timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Bake slides for 1 hour at 60°C.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene (2 changes, 5 min each).
◦ Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%,
and distilled water, 2 min each).
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in antigen retrieval buffer.
◦ Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a
microwave or pressure cooker as specified by primary
antibody datasheet.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water followed by wash buffer.
B. Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply enough blocking solution to cover tissue sections.
◦ Incubate in a humidifying chamber for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Drain excess blocking solution but do not rinse.
2. Primary Antibody Application:
◦ Dilute primary antibody as per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Apply the primary antibody to the sections.
◦ Incubate in humidifying chamber for 60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
3. Washing:
◦ Gently rinse slides in wash buffer (PBS/TBS) for 5 minutes,
3 changes.
4. Secondary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody to cover tissue sections.
◦ Incubate slides in humidifying chamber for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
5. Washing:
◦ Gently rinse slides in wash buffer for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
6. Chromogen Development:
◦ Prepare the chromogen substrate solution.
◦ Apply chromogen to tissue sections and incubate until
desired staining intensity is achieved (usually 3-10 minutes).
◦ Monitor under the microscope for optimum results.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water until sections are clear.
◦ Dip slides briefly in 0.1% acid alcohol to differentiate (if
required).
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
C. Slide Mounting:
1. Dehydrate the slides through graded ethanol (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
2. Apply mounting medium and cover with a coverslip.
3. Allow slides to dry thoroughly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides within each batch.
• Ensure staining quality and consistency by reviewing control
slides before finalizing patient results.
• Record deviations and corrective actions.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides are to be reviewed under a light microscope by
a qualified pathologist.
• Document findings and ensure proper logging in the laboratory
information system.
