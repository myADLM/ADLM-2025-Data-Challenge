Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for
Spironolactone (Aldactone) Testing in Plasma, Serum, Urine, or
Whole Blood for Referral Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for generating results for
Spironolactone (Aldactone) in plasma, serum, urine, or whole blood.
The protocol ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and compliance with
regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE
Applicable to all clinical laboratory personnel trained to perform
Spironolactone (Aldactone) testing using the designated
methodology.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory technologists and analysts are responsible for
performing the analytical tests as per this SOP.
• The lab manager or designated supervisor is responsible for
reviewing results, ensuring compliance with SOP, and
troubleshooting any issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Types: Plasma, Serum, Urine, Whole Blood.
• Collection containers:
◦ Plasma: EDTA or Lithium Heparin tubes.
◦ Serum: Standard red-top tube with no anticoagulant.
◦ Urine: Clean, dry container suitable for urine collection.
◦ Whole Blood: EDTA tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
• Stability:
◦ Plasma/Serum: Stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
◦ Urine: Stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C or up to 7 days if
preserved.
◦ Whole Blood: Stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C.
• Transport Conditions: All specimens must be transported at 2-8°C
in a leak-proof container.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
• Standard laboratory glassware and supplies.
• Calibration standards and quality control (QC) materials for
Spironolactone.
• Mobile phase solvents and reagents specific to the HPLC or LC-
MS/MS method.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
• Prepare mobile phase and reagent solutions according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare calibration standards by diluting the stock solution to the
required concentrations.
• Prepare QC material at low, medium, and high concentrations.
6.2. Sample Preparation
• Plasma/Serum: Centrifuge the specimen at 1500x g for 10
minutes. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial.
• Urine: Measure the volume and adjust pH if necessary. Centrifuge
and transfer the supernatant without disturbing the sediment.
• Whole Blood: Mix gently, ensure complete homogenization before
aliquoting.
6.3. Analytical Run
• Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system as per the instrument’s
user manual.
• Load samples, standards, and QC materials onto the instrument.
• Ensure appropriate instrument settings including temperature,
flow rate, and detection method.
6.4. Data Acquisition and Processing
• Start the analytical run and acquire data for every sample.
• Compare the retention time and peak area of the analyte with
those of the standards.
• Calculate concentrations using the calibration curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each batch.
• Review the QC results. All QC results must fall within the
established acceptance criteria.
• In case of QC failure, investigate and resolve the issue before
proceeding with sample analysis.
8. RESULT REPORTING
• Results are reviewed and verified by a trained technologist
against the established criteria.
• Critical results are communicated to the referring clinician
immediately following SOP for critical value reporting.
• Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for delivery to the referral laboratory.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with the
accuracy of the results and should be treated with caution.
• Any deviations from the standard procedure must be documented
and brought to the attention of the supervisor.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for HPLC or LC-MS/MS.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on Spironolactone
(Aldactone) testing.
11. RECORD-KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of instrument maintenance, calibration, QC,
and specimen handling.
• Documentation should be complete and available for review at all
times.
This SOP is effective as of [date] and will be reviewed annually or as
needed for updates.
