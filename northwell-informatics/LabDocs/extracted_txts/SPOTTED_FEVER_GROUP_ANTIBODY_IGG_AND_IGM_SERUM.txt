Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) SPOTTED FEVER GROUP
ANTIBODY, IgG AND IgM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis and
interpretation of Spotted Fever Group antibody levels (IgG and
IgM) in serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) technology. The results of this test will aid in the
diagnosis of Spotted Fever Rickettsiosis.
Responsibility:
• Authorized laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay and documenting results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff training, adherence
to this SOP, and overseeing quality control and quality assurance
activities.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques.
Allow blood to clot, then centrifuge to separate the serum.
• Storage: Serum may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
long-term storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens may compromise results and should be noted if
analyzed.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA kit specific for Spotted Fever Group (Rickettsia spp.)
antibodies (IgG and IgM).
• Microplate reader with a 450 nm filter.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Deionized water.
• Class II Biosafety Cabinet for sample processing.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples, if applicable, and bring to room
temperature.
2. Set up and calibrate the microplate reader according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Assemble all necessary reagents and allow them to reach room
temperature.
B) ELISA Assay:
1. Refer to the ELISA kit package insert for specific instructions,
which generally include:
◦ Adding controls, standards, and patient samples to the
appropriate wells.
◦ Incubating the plate at 37°C for a specified time (typically
30-60 minutes).
◦ Washing the plates according to the kit instructions to
remove unbound components.
◦ Adding enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies and
incubating.
◦ Performing additional washes as indicated.
◦ Adding the substrate solution and incubating until the
desired color development is achieved.
◦ Stopping the reaction with a stop solution.
C) Reading and Interpretation:
1. Measure absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
2. Record absorbances and calculate results according to the
ELISA kit instructions.
3. Compare results to reference values provided with the kit and
classify as positive, negative, or indeterminate.
D) Quality Control:
1. Include both positive and negative controls with each run.
2. Internal controls must fall within the established range for the
run to be valid. If controls fall outside of the range, troubleshoot
and repeat the assay.
3. Document all quality control results and any deviations or
corrective actions in the log.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a licensed laboratory
technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) along
with any comments on sample integrity or assay quality.
• Report results with interpretation:
◦ Negative: Antibody not detected or below the cut-off value.
◦ Positive: Antibody detected, suggesting current or past
infection.
◦ Indeterminate: Results are inconclusive; repeat testing may be
necessary.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY:
• If hemolysis or other integrity issues are suspected, note on the
report and consider repeating the assay on a new sample.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS:
• Positive results for Spotted Fever Group antibodies should be
reviewed promptly and communicated to the requesting physician
for clinical correlation and potential public health interventions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the ELISA kit package insert for specific limitations and
interfering substances.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ELISA kit specific to Spotted
Fever Group antibody detection.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain records of all test runs, including calibration data, control
results, patient results, and any deviations or corrective actions
taken.
