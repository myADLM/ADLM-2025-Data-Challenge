Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for SPRUCE (Serum Protein Electrophoresis), IGE
(Immunoglobulin E), and SERUM analysis. This procedure specifies
the steps necessary for accurate and reliable measurement and
reporting of results, including quality control measures and corrective
actions if deviations occur.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory technical staff
to perform the analysis, document the results, and report any
anomalies to the supervisor.
2. DEFINITIONS
• SPRUCE: Serum Protein Electrophoresis, a laboratory technique
used to separate proteins in serum based on their physical
properties.
• IGE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody that plays a crucial role in
allergic reactions.
• SERUM: The clear, yellowish fluid part of the blood that remains
after coagulation. Used for various biochemical analyses beyond
protein electrophoresis and immunoglobulin measurements.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration:
1. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ SPRUCE Analyzer
◦ IGE Assay Kits
◦ SPEP Reagents
◦ Standard Calibration Materials
◦ Quality Control Materials
2. Preparation of Equipment:
◦ Turn on and calibrate the SPRUCE analyzer following
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure the IGE assay instrumentation is properly set up and
calibrated.
◦ Confirm that all reagent expiration dates are checked and
reagents are within usable timeframe.
◦ Document all calibration procedures and validation checks
in the equipment logbook.
B. Specimen Handling:
1. Acceptable specimens: Freshly collected serum sample (2-5
mL) in standard serum separator tubes.
2. Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Samples >24 hours post-collection without proper
refrigeration.
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
◦ Clotted or insufficient volume samples.
3. Samples must be stored at 2-8°C and brought to room
temperature prior to analysis.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. SPRUCE: Serum Protein Electrophoresis
◦ Load serum samples onto the SPRUCE analyzer.
◦ Run the electrophoresis as per manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Ensure appropriate separation of protein bands.
◦ Record and document the migration pattern and protein
quantification results.
2. IGE: Immunoglobulin E Measurement
◦ Follow the specific assay kit protocol for IGE quantification.
◦ After adding reagents, ensure proper incubation times and
temperature conditions are met.
◦ Measure the absorbance or fluorescence (depending on kit
type) using the appropriate instrument.
◦ Document and interpret results using the calibration curve.
3. General Serum Analysis:
◦ Conduct necessary biochemical assays based on the tests
required (e.g., glucose, electrolytes).
◦ Use automated analyzers where applicable, ensuring all
maintenance and calibration procedures are adhered to.
◦ Record all findings and ensure accurate result interpretation.
D. Quality Control:
1. Use internal and external QC materials to verify the accuracy
and precision of analytical results.
2. Perform QC checks at the beginning of each analytical run and
if any equipment malfunction is suspected.
3. Document all QC results and investigate any deviations from
expected values.
4. Take corrective actions as necessary (e.g., recalibrate
equipment, repeat tests).
E. Reporting Results:
1. Validate and review all results through the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Flag any abnormal or critical results and follow appropriate
procedures for timely reporting.
3. Ensure all data is accurately transcribed and reviewed before
release.
F. Corrective Actions and Troubleshooting:
1. SPRUCE Analysis:
◦ If separation is not distinct, verify buffer composition,
concentration, and system calibration.
◦ Re-run samples if artifacts or abnormal patterns are
observed.
2. IGE Analysis:
◦ Verify reagent integrity and repeat the assay if QC fails.
◦ Ensure sample handling/preparation did not introduce
errors.
3. General Serum Analysis:
◦ If results fall outside the expected ranges, verify sample
integrity, rerun QC, and recalibrate instruments as needed.
◦ Document and report all troubleshooting steps performed.
G. Documentation and Record Keeping:
1. Maintain a complete log of all samples analyzed, including
dates, times, and personnel involved.
2. Retain calibration, QC log sheets, and troubleshooting records
as part of laboratory documentation.
H. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions of SPRUCE Analyzer, IGE Assay Kits,
and other serum analysis instrumentation.
• Laboratory Quality Management guidelines for equipment
calibration and QC protocols.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
electrophoresis and immunoglobulin testing.
