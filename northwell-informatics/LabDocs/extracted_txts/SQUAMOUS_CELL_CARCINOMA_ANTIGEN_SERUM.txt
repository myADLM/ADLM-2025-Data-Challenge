Standard Operating Procedure for Squamous Cell
Carcinoma Antigen, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized procedure
for the analysis of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) in
serum samples. This SOP ensures accurate and precise laboratory
results while maintaining adherence to CLIA regulatory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing and
documenting all procedural steps.
• Supervisors will monitor adherence to the protocol and handle
any deviations or troubleshooting requirements.
• Quality Control Officers are responsible for reviewing and
validating the quality control measures and results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from whole blood collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate, or
heparin).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and tips
• SCC-Ag assay kit (as recommended by the manufacturer)
• Calibrators and controls
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Allow blood samples to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1,500-2,000 g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer serum into a secondary labeled container for
analysis.
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 48
hours, or freeze at -20°C for longer term storage.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibrators and controls at the beginning of each batch
of tests.
◦ Ensure that all control values fall within the established
range. If control values are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot the assay and rerun controls before proceeding
with patient samples.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Label an appropriate number of tubes or wells for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Pipette the required volume of calibration standards, quality
controls, and serum samples into the designated tubes or
wells.
◦ Add the appropriate reagents to each tube or well according
to the assay kit protocol.
◦ Mix thoroughly and incubate as specified by the
manufacturer.
3. Detection:
◦ After the incubation period, read the results using a
microplate reader or another detection system specified by
the assay kit.
4. Calculation of Results:
◦ Use the calibration curve generated by the known standards
to calculate the concentrations of SCC-Ag in patient
samples.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative control samples with each
batch of patient samples.
• Document all quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
• If controls do not meet acceptable criteria, do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved and acceptable control results
are obtained.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate and verify the results in the LIS.
• Ensure all results are checked for accuracy before release.
• Critical values must be reported to the ordering physician
immediately following the critical result reporting policy of the
laboratory.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be determined by the laboratory based
on the population served or provided by the assay manufacturer
(e.g., < 2.5 ng/mL).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with assay results.
• Refer to the SCC-Ag assay kit insert for specific reagent
limitations.

By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures standardized
procedures for generating reliable and accurate SCC-Ag results,
maintaining high-quality patient care and compliance with regulatory
standards.
