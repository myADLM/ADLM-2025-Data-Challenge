Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SQUASH, IGE, and
SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of SQUASH,
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and SERUM for various biochemical and
immunological markers. This SOP ensures the accuracy, precision,
and reliability of test results in compliance with CLIA-certified
laboratory standards.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of SQUASH, IgE, and SERUM testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Qualified laboratory technicians are responsible for following this
procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel adhere
to the SOP and for addressing any issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: Fresh serum, refrigerated up to 48 hours.
• Acceptable: Serum samples in SST (Serum Separator Tubes) or
red-top tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
Specimen Handling:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing is to be performed within 48
hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
• Ensure samples are properly labeled with patient ID, collection
date, and time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes with tips
• Incubators
• Automated analyzer for IgE and SQUASH assays
• ELISA kit for IgE
• Biochemical analyzer for SERUM testing
• Controls: Negative and Positive controls specific to the assays
• Reagent kits specific to each test (refer to manufacturer
instructions)
• Calibration standards traceable to NIST
1. PROCEDURE
A. General Guidelines
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
• Follow universal precautions and use appropriate PPE.
• Ensure all samples, reagents, and controls are at room
temperature before analysis unless specified otherwise.
B. SQUASH Analysis
1. Preparation
◦ Set up the automated analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Prepare reagents and controls as per the kit insert.
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using approved standards.
2. Analysis
◦ Vortex the serum samples to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Load the samples, controls, and reagents into the
designated slots in the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the run as per the analyzer's instructions.
◦ Document the temperature and humidity of the room during
the run.
3. Post-Analysis
◦ Review the results for any flags or error codes.
◦ Record the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Perform corrective actions as necessary if controls do not
meet acceptance criteria.
C. IgE Analysis
1. Preparation
◦ Set up the ELISA plate as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Prepare all reagents, samples, and controls.
◦ Ensure all reagents are at room temperature.
2. Analysis
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, samples, and
controls into the wells.
◦ Follow the incubation and washing steps as per the kit
instructions.
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate for the required
time.
◦ Stop the reaction and read the plate on a microplate reader
at the specified wavelength.
3. Post-Analysis
◦ Analyze the data using the software provided with the ELISA
reader.
◦ Record the results in the LIS.
◦ Perform corrective actions if controls are out of range.
D. SERUM Analysis
1. Preparation
◦ Set up the biochemical analyzer according to manufacturer
guidelines.
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using recommended standards.
◦ Prepare all reagents and controls.
2. Analysis
◦ Vortex the serum specimens.
◦ Load the specimens, standards, and controls into the
analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate assay program for the analytes being
measured.
◦ Start the analysis as per the analyzer’s instructions.
3. Post-Analysis
◦ Verify the results against the controls.
◦ Document any deviations or errors observed during the
analysis.
◦ Record final results in the LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples.
• Three levels of control material should be run: Negative, Normal,
and High.
• If QC is out of acceptable limits, investigate and resolve before
continuing with patient testing.
• Document all QC data and any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all results and ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
• Validate results in the LIS before final reporting.
• Follow the site-specific guidelines for reporting critical values.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• SQUASH: Refer to manufacturer guidelines
• IgE: <100 IU/mL
• SERUM: Specific reference intervals for each tested analyte
should be provided by the assay kit manufacturer or laboratory-
specific validated reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for each specific assay for
limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer manuals for the specific analyzers and assays.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory quality assurance.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records for a minimum of two years, including
calibration logs, QC results, and patient test records.
1. REVIEW
• This SOP must be reviewed annually or whenever there are
changes in the testing procedure or equipment.
By following this SOP, the laboratory will ensure accurate,
reproducible, and reliable results for SQUASH, IgE, and SERUM
analyses, compliant with regulatory standards.
