Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing and Generating
Results for SQUID (Specific Quantitative Immunoglobulin
Deficiency), IgE (Immunoglobulin E), and Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for Specific Quantitative
Immunoglobulin Deficiency (SQUID), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and
serum analysis through the use of standardized procedures and
quality control measures.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for following
this SOP and ensuring that all procedures are carried out accurately.
Supervisors are responsible for verifying the results and ensuring
compliance with the SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable: 5-10 mL of serum obtained from a blood
sample collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable: Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric;
specimens received in incorrect tubes or with improper labeling;
specimens not collected, stored, or transported under the specified
conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubators
• Analyzers specific for IgE and SQUID assays
• Calibrators and controls for IgE, SQUID, and general serum
analysis
• Reagents and kits specific for IgE and SQUID assays
• Quality control materials
• Sample storage containers and racks
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Centrifuge the SST at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum from the clot.
2. Transfer the serum into appropriately labeled storage
containers if not analyzed immediately.
3. Store the serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or at
-20°C for longer storage.
B. SQUID and IgE Analysis
1. Calibration: a. Perform calibration of the analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions. b. Use appropriate calibrators and
ensure calibration curve falls within acceptable ranges.
2. Quality Control: a. Run internal quality control samples at the
start of each shift, after any calibration, and whenever a new
reagent lot is introduced. b. Document the quality control results
and take corrective actions if QC results are outside acceptable
limits.
3. Sample Analysis: a. Load patient serum samples onto the
analyzer following manufacturer’s guidelines. b. Ensure that the
sample identification matches the test request form. c. Initiate
the analysis program specific to SQUID or IgE as required. d.
Document the analysis run, including date, time, analyzer ID,
and technologist initials.
4. Verification of Results: a. Review analyzer printouts for flagged
results or error codes. b. Validate results against quality control
data and clinical context. c. Enter validated results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
C. General Serum Analysis (if additional tests are requested)
1. Conduct serum analysis (e.g., liver function tests, renal function
tests, etc.) using the respective analyzers.
2. Follow similar steps for calibration, quality control, and sample
analysis as described above.
3. Document, verify, and enter results into the LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Calibrators and Controls: Refer to the specific guidelines provided
by the reagent manufacturer for the preparation, handling, and
storage of calibrators and controls.
B. Internal Quality Control: Run and document at least two levels of
control material for each analyte at the start of each shift and after
calibration or reagent changes.
C. External Quality Control: Participate in proficiency testing
programs and document all results and corrective actions taken for
any outliers.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Result Documentation:
1. Verify that all results are accurately documented in the LIS.
2. Ensure that abnormal or critical results are promptly
communicated to the requesting physician or healthcare
provider.
3. Maintain records of all results, quality control data, and
corrective actions for regulatory compliance.
B. Validation and Verification:
1. Laboratory supervisors must review and approve all results
before final reporting.
2. Critical results should prompt an immediate review and
communication as per laboratory policies.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent and analyzer manufacturer’s inserts for method
limitations, potential interferences, and specific performance
characteristics.
1. REFERENCES
Include manufacturer inserts for the specific analyzers and reagents
used in SQUID and IgE analysis. Adhere to guidelines from
regulatory bodies such as CLIA, CAP, and local laboratory
accreditation policies.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever there are
significant procedural changes. Final approval must be documented
by the laboratory director.
Date of Implementation: ___________ Review Date: ___________
