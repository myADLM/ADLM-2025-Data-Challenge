Standard Operating Procedure for SS-A
and SS-B Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of SS-A and
SS-B Antibodies, IgG in serum to ensure accuracy, reliability, and
timeliness of patient results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel performing
SS-A and SS-B antibodies, IgG testing on serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all clinical laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP when performing and reporting SS-A and SS-B antibodies,
IgG testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum specimen collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required for testing.
• Specimens should be transported and stored at 2-8°C if testing is
performed within 72 hours; otherwise, store at -20°C or below for
longer periods.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient name, date of birth,
collection date & time).
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader or
chemiluminescence analyzer)
• Microplate washer (if using ELISA)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• commercially available SS-A and SS-B Antibodies, IgG test kits
(including controls and calibrators).
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution (if using colorimetric assay)
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Materials:
• Positive and negative control sera specific for SS-A and SS-B
antibodies.
Quality Control Procedure:
• Run quality control materials with each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure control results are within the manufacturer's specified
range before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document all control results and take corrective action if controls
fall outside the acceptable range.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, patient sera, and controls to come to
room temperature (18-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare the required number of wells in the microplate
based on the number of samples, controls, and calibrators.
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ Centrifuge serum specimens at 1000-1500 x g for 10-15
minutes to remove any particulates.
◦ Transfer clear serum to a clean tube and avoid any cellular
debris.
3. Assay Protocol:
◦ Calibration:
▪ Prepare calibrators according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
▪ Add an appropriate volume of calibrators to designated
wells.
◦ Sample and Control Addition:
▪ Add an appropriate volume of patient serum samples
(usually 10-20µL) to the test wells.
▪ Add an equal volume of positive and negative controls to
the designated wells.
◦ Incubation:
▪ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time
according to the test kit instructions (usually 30-60
minutes).
◦ Washing:
▪ Wash the wells 3-5 times with wash buffer to remove
unbound materials.
▪ Blot the plate on absorbent paper to remove excess
wash buffer.
◦ Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add the enzyme-labelled conjugate reagent to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time.
◦ Washing:
▪ Repeat the washing step as described above.
◦ Substrate Addition:
▪ Add the substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for
the specified development time.
◦ Stopping Reaction:
▪ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ Reading:
▪ Read the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader at the wavelength specified by the
manufacturer (typically 450 nm).
8. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the mean OD value for each calibrator, sample, and
control.
• Generate the calibration curve using the known concentrations of
the calibrators.
• Derive the concentration of SS-A and SS-B antibodies in patient
samples from the calibration curve.
• Interpret the results according to the cut-off values provided by
the test kit manufacturer.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report the results to the requesting physician, ensuring critical
values are communicated according to the laboratory’s policy.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the test kit insert for specific limitations related to method
sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences.
11. REFERENCES
• SS-A and SS-B Antibodies, IgG test kit package insert.
• CLIA guidelines for clinical laboratory testing
12. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed and revised annually, or as needed,
according to the laboratory’s quality management policy.
