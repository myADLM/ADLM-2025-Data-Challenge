Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SS-A/RO ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the detection and
quantification of SS-A/Ro antibodies, IgG in human serum samples
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. It
ensures standardized quality assurance and accurate generation of
patient results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this protocol, ensuring test precision, and the integrity of results.
1. DEFINITIONS
• SS-A/Ro Antibodies: Autoantibodies associated with Sjogren's
Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
• IgG: Immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Human serum
• Collection: Blood samples collected by venipuncture and allowed
to clot. Serum separated by centrifugation.
• Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL of serum
• Storage: Store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days, or freeze at -20°C or
colder for longer storage.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Samples subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Kit for SS-A/Ro Antibodies, IgG (e.g., Manufacturer’s Kit -
XYX)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm and 620 nm
• Microcentrifuge and pipettes
• Laboratory timer
• Deionized or distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Reagent Preparation
• Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions
included in the ELISA kit.
• Bring all kit components to room temperature before use.
6.2. Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples completely, mix gently by inversion.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and any other required reagents
according to the kit instructions.
2. Coating Antigen:
◦ If not pre-coated, coat the microplate wells with provided
SS-A/Ro antigen and incubate as specified in the kit
instructions.
3. Blocking:
◦ Add the blocking solution to the wells to prevent non-specific
binding. Incubate and wash as per kit instructions.
4. Sample Addition:
◦ Dispense 100 μL of diluted sample or controls (according to
the kit-specified dilution) into appropriate wells. Pipette in
triplicates for accuracy.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for the time specified by the
kit instructions.
5. Detection Antibodies:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme-labeled detection antibody to each
well.
◦ Incubate and perform washes as per kit instructions.
6. Enzyme Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of the TMB (3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine)
substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark per kit instructions.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
6.3. Reading and Interpretation of Results:
1. Plate Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm and reference at 620
nm within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
2. Data Calculation:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each control and patient
sample.
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of SS-A/Ro IgG antibodies in
patient samples from the standard curve.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls supplied with the ELISA kit
with each batch of tests.
• Controls should be run in triplicates.
• Ensure all control values are within the defined ranges.
Investigate and resolve any out-of-range control values before
reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the calculated concentration (U/mL) of SS-A/Ro
antibodies, IgG for each patient sample.
• Report results according to laboratory information system (LIS)
guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with results
and should not be used.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings
and other laboratory tests.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Report results as positive, negative, or indeterminate based on
the cutoff values provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s ELISA Kit Insert (e.g., ELISA Kit XYX)
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Relevant medical literature
1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
Any deviations from this procedure must be documented and
justified, detailing the corrective actions taken.
