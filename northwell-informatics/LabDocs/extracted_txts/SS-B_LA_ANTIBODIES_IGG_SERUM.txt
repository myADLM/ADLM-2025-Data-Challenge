SOP for SS-B/LA Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the detection and
quantification of SS-B/La antibodies, IgG, in serum samples. This test
is utilized primarily for the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome and
related autoimmune disorders.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the accurate
execution of this procedure and for maintaining the accuracy and
integrity of patient results.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL serum sample. Blood can be collected in a gold-top (SST) or
red-top tube.
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with
results and should be avoided or documented as such if
unavoidable.
• Specimens that are not properly identified or not submitted with a
requisition form.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit for SS-B/La,
IgG detection.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Microplate reader with a 450 nm filter.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls provided in the ELISA kit with
each batch of samples.
• Verify the controls are within the expected values to ensure the
proper functioning of the assay.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Label the microplate with appropriate patient identifiers,
controls, and calibrators.
2. Prepare the samples by performing any necessary dilutions as
specified by the ELISA kit instructions.
3. Aliquot 100 µL of prepared serum to each designated well.
B. ELISA Protocol
1. Add 100 µL of diluted sample or control to each corresponding
well in the microplate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash the plate three times with Wash Buffer (300 µL/well)
provided in the kit.
4. Add 100 µL of conjugate reagent to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the plate five times with Wash Buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of TMB Substrate Solution to each well and
incubate in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.
8. Add 100 µL of Stop Solution to each well to stop the reaction.
9. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing of the contents
within each well.
C. Reading and Interpretation
1. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set at 450 nm within 30 minutes of stopping
the reaction.
2. Generate a standard curve using the ODs of the calibrators and
calculate the concentrations of SS-B/La antibodies in the
patient samples.
3. Cross-check with the reference ranges provided by the kit or
laboratory standards.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Interpret the values based on the calculated concentration of SS-
B/La antibodies, IgG, and report findings according to established
laboratory reporting guidelines.
• Negative: < threshold value specified by the kit (generally < 10 U/
mL)
• Positive: ≥ threshold value specified by the kit (generally ≥ 10 U/
mL)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives or negatives can arise due to technical error or
sample contamination.
• Suboptimal specimen quality (hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric
samples) may impair accuracy.
• Ensure kit-specific limitations and warnings are adhered to as
specified in the product insert.

requiring SS-B/La antibody testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure accurate documentation of sample processing, assay
procedures, results/log sheets, calibrations, quality control checks,
corrective actions, and any deviations from protocol according to
laboratory SOPs. Maintain all records in compliance with CLIA
regulations.
