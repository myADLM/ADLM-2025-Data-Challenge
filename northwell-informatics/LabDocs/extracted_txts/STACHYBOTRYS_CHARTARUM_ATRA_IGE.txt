Protocol for Generating Results for STACHYBOTRYS
CHARTARUM/ATRA IgE
1. Purpose
To outline the procedures for generating and reporting results for
Stachybotrys chartarum/atra IgE testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and timely analysis of
Stachybotrys chartarum/atra IgE levels in patient specimens.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen Type:
• Serum: Preferred specimen type for IgE testing.
• Plasma: Acceptable specimen type (heparinized or EDTA).
Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature (if serum) then centrifuge
for serum separation.
• Aliquot serum or plasma into a properly labeled tube.
Stability:
• Serum and plasma specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 7 days of collection.
• For long-term storage, specimens may be frozen at -20°C or
below for up to 1 month. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis.
• Specimens received in tubes with anticoagulants other than
heparin or EDTA.
• Specimens that have been stored improperly or beyond stability
limits.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit specific for
Stachybotrys chartarum/atra IgE.
• Calibrators and controls specific for the ELISA kit.
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
recommended wavelength (typically ~450 nm).
• Plate washer or manual washing equipment.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Incubator (if required by ELISA kit).
1. Procedure
A) Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
2. Prepare the ELISA plate and reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
B) Assay Setup
1. Label all wells and specimens appropriately.
2. Add standards, controls, and patient specimens to the
designated wells on the ELISA plate.
3. Follow the ELISA kit instructions for the addition of reagents
(e.g., conjugates, substrate) and incubation times.
4. Wash wells as directed between steps.
C) Plate Reading
1. After the final incubation, read the absorbance of each well at
the specified wavelength using the microplate reader.
2. Record the absorbance values.
3. Data Analysis
A) Calculation of Results
1. Construct the standard curve using the absorbance values of
the calibrators.
2. Calculate the concentration of Stachybotrys chartarum/atra IgE
in patient specimens by comparing their absorbance values to
the standard curve.
B) Quality Control
1. Ensure that the controls fall within the predetermined
acceptable ranges.
2. Repeat the assay if the controls are out of range or if there is an
unexpected pattern in the results.
3. Reporting Results
A) Interpretation Refer to site-specific guidelines for interpretation of
results. Ensure that any critical values are identified and
appropriately flagged.
B) Documentation
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate results before release.
• Report results using authorized format and reference ranges.
1. References
Consult the product insert for the Stachybotrys chartarum/atra IgE
ELISA kit for detailed information on reagent preparation, assay
procedures, and limitations.
1. Quality Assurance
A) Maintenance
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of analytical
instruments as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Validate new lot numbers of reagents in accordance with
laboratory protocols.
B) Troubleshooting
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines and laboratory procedures for
troubleshooting assays.
• Consult the supervisor or technical lead if required.
1. Safety and Compliance
Ensure compliance with all relevant laboratory safety protocols and
CLIA regulations. Use appropriate personal protective equipment
(PPE) and follow waste disposal guidelines.
