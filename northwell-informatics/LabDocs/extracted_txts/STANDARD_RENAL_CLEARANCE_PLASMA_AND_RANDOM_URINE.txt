Standard Operating Procedure for Standard Renal
Clearance, Plasma, and Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidance for determining standard renal
clearance, plasma, and random urine by measuring levels of specific
analytes. This includes processing plasma and random urine
specimens to generate accurate, reliable results, ensuring timely and
correct patient diagnosis and management.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel performing renal clearance
tests from plasma and random urine samples received in the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Staff: Perform assays as per procedure, maintain
equipment, ensure quality control.
• Supervisors and Laboratory Managers: Ensure that procedures
are followed, address issues, and validate results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Renal Clearance: The volume of plasma cleared of a particular
substance per unit time. Plasma Specimen: The liquid component of
blood after centrifuging whole blood. Random Urine Specimen:
Urine collected at any time without any preparation required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Plasma:
• Minimum 2 mL plasma collected in EDTA or heparin tubes.
• Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C within 1 hour of
collection.
• Transfer to a labelled tube and store at 2-8°C if testing is delayed
beyond 2 hours.
Random Urine:
• Minimum 10 mL collected any time.
• Store at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Centrifuge, pipettes, automated chemistry analyzer,
refrigerator.
• Reagents: Standards, controls, and assay-specific reagents kept
per manufacturer guidelines.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Setup
• Verify patient information on specimens.
• Document receipt of specimens, ensuring proper labeling and
handling.
B. Centrifugation and Storage
• Centrifuge all plasma samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
Inspect for hemolysis; reject hemolyzed samples.
• Store plasma and urine samples at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Plasma Analysis: a. Load the plasma samples onto the
automated chemistry analyzer. b. Select the appropriate assay
for the target analytes (e.g., creatinine, urea nitrogen). c. Follow
the analyzer's procedure for assaying plasma samples. d.
Record results post-analysis in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
2. Random Urine Analysis: a. Mix urine sample well. b. Use the
automated chemistry analyzer for urine assays following
manufacturer instructions. c. For multi-step reactions, adhere to
timing and reagent addition specifics. d. Record results post-
analysis in the LIS.
D. Renal Clearance Calculation
• Calculate renal clearance using the formula: [ \text{Renal
Clearance (mL/min)} = \frac{(U_c \times V)}{P_c} ] Where:
◦ ( U_c ) = Urine concentration of analyte (mg/dL)
◦ ( V ) = Urine flow rate (mL/min)
◦ ( P_c ) = Plasma concentration of analyte (mg/dL)
• Apply necessary corrections for patient-specific factors (e.g., body
surface area).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include appropriate QC samples with each batch of tests.
• Verify QC results fall within the acceptable range before
considering patient results valid.
• Document any QC failures and corrective action taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist prior to
release.
• Communicate critical values to the clinician according to
laboratory protocol.
• Results entered into the LIS should include calculations for renal
clearance, if applicable.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the laboratory's established reference intervals for
creatinine, urea nitrogen, and other analytes.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored specimens may affect accuracy.
• Ensure proper sample handling per patient preparation
guidelines; deviations may impact the result's integrity.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for reagents and automated analyzer
protocols.
• Standard medical laboratory textbooks and renal physiology
references.
NOTE: Adherence to this SOP ensures consistency, reliability, and
accuracy in renal clearance testing, plasma, and random urine
sample analysis. Changes to protocols should be documented and
approved by the laboratory director.

This protocol is a comprehensive guide for analytical testing and
reporting results related to standard renal clearance using plasma
and random urine. Any deviation must be documented, and re-
assessment must be performed following the established corrective
guidelines.
