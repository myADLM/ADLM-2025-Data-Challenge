SOP FOR ANALYTICAL PHASE OF TESTING: STEMPHYLLIUM,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of the allergen
Stemphyllium (IgE) in serum samples to ensure consistent, accurate,
and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
the test and documenting results as defined in this procedure.
• Laboratory managers are responsible for overseeing the
procedure, ensuring compliance, and addressing any deficiencies
or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL serum
Collection Tubes: Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top
tubes Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples Storage and Stability:
• Room Temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 1 year
Note: If serum is not tested within 8 hours, refrigerate or freeze as
appropriate. Thaw frozen samples completely and mix well before
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Advanced IgE analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia 100/250)
• Stemphyllium (IgE) assay kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Centrifuge
• Sample cups
• Calibration and control materials specific to the IgE analyzer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-analysis:
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are brought to room
temperature.
2. Verify that the calibration and control materials are within their
expiration dates.
3. Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each
analytical session:
◦ Levels: Low, Medium, and High
◦ Document results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum tubes at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum (as indicated by the kit
instructions) into sample cups.
3. Load the sample cups into the IgE analyzer.
Analysis:
1. Load the Stemphyllium (IgE) assay kit into the analyzer.
2. Follow the steps prescribed by the analyzer’s user manual to
initiate the testing process.
3. Ensure that each sample’s barcode, patient ID, or unique
identifier is correctly entered into the system to match the
specimen with the test results accurately.
4. Start the analysis and await completion.
Post-analysis:
1. Verify that all results are within the analytical measurement
range.
2. Document any flagged or exceptional results and begin
troubleshooting as necessary.
3. Ensure all raw data are stored securely and are retrievable for
audit purposes.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review all test results for accuracy.
6. Confirm all quality control measures have passed.
7. Report results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. Mark any critical or outlier results for prompt review and action
by the supervising pathologist or physician.
9. Print and file results as per laboratory protocol.
Reference Interval:
• IgE specific to Stemphyllium: Specific reference ranges should be
provided based on the analyzer’s kit insert or established
laboratory data.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Perform QC checks:
◦ At the beginning of each shift
◦ After maintenance or calibration of the equipment
◦ After reagent lot changes
3. Maintain logs of QC results and actions taken for any QC
failures.
4. Verify and document calibration and maintenance schedules.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
6. For flagged or outlier results, evaluate sample integrity
(hemolysis, lipemia).
7. Re-run any samples that present analytical issues.
8. If instrument issues occur, refer to the analyzer’s user manual
and contact technical support if needed.
9. Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions
taken.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit and analyzer manuals for specific limitations,
such as: - Potential cross-reactivity with similar allergens -
Interference from high lipid or bilirubin concentrations
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
2. Follow all laboratory safety protocols including appropriate PPE
usage.
3. Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
4. Dispose of waste according to biohazard regulations.
