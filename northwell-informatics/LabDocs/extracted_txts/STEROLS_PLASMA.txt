STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
STEROLS, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE:
This protocol outlines the steps necessary for the accurate and
precise determination of plasma sterols during the analytical phase. It
includes preparation, analysis, quality control, and documentation to
ensure that results are reliable and valid.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
providing training and troubleshooting support.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected in an EDTA or lithium heparin tube.
• Preferred volume: 3-5 mL.
• Sample must be centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at
1500-2000xg to separate plasma from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Aliquot the plasma into a polypropylene tube and freeze at -20°C
or lower until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have not been processed and stored according to
the above guidelines.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS).
• Centrifuge.
• EDTA or lithium heparin blood collection tubes.
• Polypropylene aliquot tubes.
• Solvents and chemicals: Methanol, chloroform, iso-octane,
deionized water.
• Internal standards: deuterated or 13C-labeled sterol standards.
• Calibration standards for sterols.
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thawing:
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples at 4°C or on ice.
◦ Vortex gently to mix once thawed.
2. Deproteinization and Extraction:
◦ Add 500 µL of plasma to a glass tube.
◦ Add 100 µL of internal standard solution to the sample.
◦ Add 1 mL of methanol, vortex for 30 seconds.
◦ Add 2 mL of chloroform and vortex for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 4°C for 10 minutes at 2000xg.
◦ Carefully transfer the lower chloroform layer to a new glass
tube.
◦ Evaporate the solvent under nitrogen flow at room
temperature.
◦ Reconstitute the dried extract with 100 µL of iso-octane.
B) Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Instrument Initialization:
◦ Power on the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS and allow it to
equilibrate.
◦ Ensure that the instrument is calibrated according to the
manufacturer's protocols.
◦ Perform a performance check using laboratory standards.
2. Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare a series of calibration standards spanning the
expected range of concentrations.
◦ Inject the calibration standards into the instrument and
record the peak areas.
◦ Construct a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratios
(analyte/internal standard) against the known standard
concentrations.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Injection:
◦ Inject the reconstituted sample into the GC-MS or LC-MS/
MS.
◦ Use the same injection volume and conditions as those
used for the calibration standards.
2. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire data for the target sterols and the internal standard.
◦ Ensure peaks are properly integrated and the retention
times match those of the standards.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of sterols in the plasma samples
by comparing the peak area ratios to the calibration curve.
◦ Verify that all automated calculations match expected
results where manual verification is required.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each
analytical run.
◦ QC samples should include at least two levels: low and high
concentrations.
◦ Results should fall within established limits before reporting
patient results.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in an external proficiency testing program to
ensure accuracy and precision are maintained.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review results for accuracy.
• Report concentrations in appropriate units (e.g., µg/L).
• Document any sample reanalysis or deviations.
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify results.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If an instrument error or QC failure occurs, halt processing and
notify the supervisor.
• Follow manufacturer's guidelines for troubleshooting and
resolution.
• Reanalyze any effected samples after resolving issues and
document corrective actions.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instrument manual.
• Peer-reviewed scientific literature on sterol analysis.
10. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols and relevant regulations.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required.
• Properly dispose of all waste according to hazardous waste
guidelines.
11. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain all records of sample preparation, instrument calibration,
analysis, and QC in accordance with CLIA requirements.
• Ensure traceability from specimen receipt to result reporting.
