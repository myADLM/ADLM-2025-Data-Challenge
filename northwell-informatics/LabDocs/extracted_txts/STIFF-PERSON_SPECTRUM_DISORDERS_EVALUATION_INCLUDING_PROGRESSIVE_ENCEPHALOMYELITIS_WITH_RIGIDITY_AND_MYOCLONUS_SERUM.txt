Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Stiff-Person Spectrum Disorders
Evaluation, Including Progressive Encephalomyelitis with
Rigidity and Myoclonus, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase in
generating serum results for the evaluation of Stiff-Person Spectrum
Disorders (SPSD), including Progressive Encephalomyelitis with
Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM).
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable test results. It is
crucial for lab staff to identify any potential discrepancies and
immediately report to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume required: Minimum 0.5 mL serum
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
heparin)
• Specimens with insufficient volume
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage
• Aliquoting supplies (pipettes, labeled microtubes)
• Required laboratory analyzers (refer to the specific immunoassay
or other diagnostic platforms)
• Control samples (Positive and Negative Control)
• Calibration standards for the assay
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation and Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Upon receipt, verify specimen identification and documentation.
• Inspect the serum for hemolysis or other visible interferences.
• Centrally log the specimen details.
• If required, centrifuge the specimen to separate serum according
to standard laboratory practices.
• Aliquot a sufficient volume of serum for testing and store the rest
at 2-8°C.
4.2 Control and Calibration:
• Prepare the assay system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Run calibration standards to ensure the accuracy of the
analyzers.
• Analyze control samples (both positive and negative) to validate
the assay. Document these results.
4.3 Testing:
• Thaw aliquoted serum if previously frozen under controlled
conditions.
• Load serum samples onto the designated laboratory analyzers as
per the manufacturer's recommendations.
• Follow the specific test kit procedure instructions to ensure target
antibodies or antigens are effectively detected.
4.4 Validation:
• Evaluate quality control data for trends or deviations.
• Confirm the analyte recovery within acceptable limits.
• Accept or reject test runs based on control performance and
calibration verification outcomes.
4.5 Result Interpretation and Documentation:
• Review results for each specimen to ensure consistency and
validity of the data.
• Interpret findings concerning reference ranges and clinical
relevance.
• Document the results appropriately in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results must be verified by a qualified technologist.
• Any critical findings (e.g., high titers of autoantibodies) should be
communicated promptly to the requesting clinician.
• Results should be reported following site-specific guidelines to
ensure clarity and compliance.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Conduct regular instrument maintenance as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
• Maintain records of all quality control, calibration, test results, and
equipment maintenance logs.
• Review and update procedures periodically to comply with current
clinical standards and guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals will be specific to the assay utilized and
should be defined in relation to the kit insert or assay-specific
guidelines provided by the manufacturer.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Be aware of potential interferences such as presence of
heterophile antibodies or biotin consumption which may affect the
result accuracy.
• Consult the manufacturer’s insert for detailed information on the
assay’s limitations to appropriately interpret the results.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific immunoassay or
diagnostic platform.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Peer-reviewed literature for updates on best practices in SPSD
and PERM diagnostics.
