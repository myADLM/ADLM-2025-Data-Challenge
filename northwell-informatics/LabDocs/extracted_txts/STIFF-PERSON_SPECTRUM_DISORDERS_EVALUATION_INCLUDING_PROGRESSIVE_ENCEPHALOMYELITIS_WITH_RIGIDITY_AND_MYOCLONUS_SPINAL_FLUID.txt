Standard Operating Procedure
STIFF-PERSON SPECTRUM DISORDERS EVALUATION,
INCLUDING PROGRESSIVE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS WITH
RIGIDITY AND MYOCLONUS, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures for generating results for Stiff-
Person Spectrum Disorders Evaluation, including Progressive
Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM) using spinal
fluid. This SOP ensures accurate and reproducible results for clinical
assessments and diagnoses.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures outlined in this document. The designated staff must
perform the analysis and ensure quality control checks are conducted
as defined in this protocol. Any deviations or equipment malfunctions
that may affect test outcomes must be reported to the supervisor
immediately.
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
• CSF Volume: Minimum 2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is
required.
• Specimen Container: Sterile, leak-proof container.
• Specimen Integrity: Ensure that the CSF sample is clear and free
from any clotting.
• Time and Temperature: Specimens must be processed as soon
as possible after collection. If immediate processing is not
possible, store the specimen at 2-8°C and analyze within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze the sample at -20°C or colder,
and transport on dry ice.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• CSF aliquot tubes
• Transport containers
• Centrifuge
• Automated analyzers (specific to the required tests)
• Qualified reference standards for calibration
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Appropriate reagents as per manufacturer’s insert for specific
tests (examples: Immunoassay kits, ELISA kits)
1. PROCEDURE
i. Specimen Preparation
• Allow the CSF sample to reach room temperature if previously
refrigerated.
• Examine for visible signs of contamination or clotting. Reject any
compromised specimen and request a new sample.
ii. Centrifugation
• Centrifuge CSF samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any cellular debris.
• Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean aliquot tube.
iii. Test Setup
• Calibrate all analyzers and pipettes according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Perform necessary quality control checks before running patient
samples. Record the results of quality control material testing.
iv. Analytical Techniques
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for each specific test to be
conducted. This could include: a. Immunoassays for detecting
autoantibodies such as GAD65, Amphiphysin, Glycine receptor,
etc. b. PCR or other molecular diagnostic techniques if required.
v. Result Recording and Review
• Record all results following each assay following the laboratory’s
guidelines.
• Verify results against control material to ensure accuracy and
precision.
• Initial all recorded results to ensure traceability.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use control materials specific for each test run. Control results
should fall within predefined ranges as set by the laboratory's
quality control program.
• Any out-of-range quality control results must be investigated,
resolved, and documented before patient results can be reported.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• For any discrepancies noted in control and patient results, review
the procedural steps, reagent integrity, and equipment calibration.
• Repeat the assay for confirmation if necessary.
• In the event of persistent problems, notify the supervisor and
involve technical support as needed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for technologist review and verification.
• Critical results, as defined by laboratory policy, should be
immediately communicated to the requesting physician and
documented.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of all testing procedures, equipment
calibration, quality control, and troubleshooting activities.
• Ensure proper documentation practices are followed for
compliance with CLIA regulations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and safety data sheets for specific
assay kits
• Laboratory quality control guidelines
• Clinical literature regarding Stiff-Person Spectrum Disorders and
related autoantibodies
Ensure all personnel performing testing activities are appropriately
trained and updated on the latest procedural changes or updates.
This protocol is effective as of [Date] and subject to review and
update as required.
