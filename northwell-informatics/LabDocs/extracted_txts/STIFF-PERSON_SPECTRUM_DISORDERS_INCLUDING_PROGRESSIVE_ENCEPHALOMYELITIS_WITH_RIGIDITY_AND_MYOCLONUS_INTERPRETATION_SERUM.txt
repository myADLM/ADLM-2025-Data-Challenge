STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Name: Analytical Phase for STIFF-PERSON SPECTRUM
DISORDERS (Including Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity
and Myoclonus)
Effective Date: [Insert Effective Date]
Purpose: To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and
interpretation of results for Stiff-Person Spectrum Disorders (including
Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus) in serum
samples.
Scope: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis and interpretation of serum samples for the detection of
antibodies associated with Stiff-Person Spectrum Disorders.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to perform the procedures as outlined and ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the results. Supervisors ensure quality
control and appropriate corrective actions are taken when necessary.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
1. Serum sample (collected, received, and accessioned)
2. Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA,
chemiluminescence)
3. Antibody detection kits specific for Stiff-Person Spectrum
Disorders (GAD65, Amphiphysin, Glycine receptor, etc.)
4. Calibrators and controls (positive and negative)
5. Pipettes and tips
6. Centrifuge
7. Laboratory information system (LIS)
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: 1.1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 1500 x
g for 10 minutes to separate the serum from any cellular material.
1.2. Transfer the clear serum to a new tube, avoiding any pellet or
debris. 1.3. Label the sample with the appropriate patient
identification number and date.
2. Reagent Preparation: 2.1. Prepare reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions provided in the antibody detection kit. 2.2.
Allow reagents, controls, and samples to equilibrate to room
temperature before use.
3. Running the Assay: 3.1. Set up the analyzer and program it
according to the specific parameters for the desired antibody
detection. 3.2. Load samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated positions on the analyzer. 3.3. Initiate the run and monitor
the progress to ensure there are no interruptions or errors. 3.4. Once
the run is complete, review the data generated by the analyzer for
any flagged results indicating potential issues.
4. Quality Control: 4.1. Review quality control (QC) data to ensure
the results of the QC samples are within the acceptable range. 4.2.
Document and address any QC failures, performing necessary
troubleshooting and rerunning samples if required.
5. Data Analysis and Interpretation: 5.1. Analyze the results
according to the reference ranges and cut-off values provided by the
manufacturer. 5.2. Positive Results: Presence of antibodies (e.g.,
GAD65, Amphiphysin, Glycine receptor) indicating a higher
probability of Stiff-Person Spectrum Disorders. 5.3. Negative Results:
Absence of detectable antibodies. 5.4. Equivocal Results: If the result
is borderline or falls within the equivocal range, repeat the test. If
ambiguity persists, additional confirmatory testing may be
recommended.
6. Reporting Results: 6.1. Enter the validated results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) with relevant comments and
interpretations. 6.2. Include comments on the clinical significance,
noting positive, negative, or equivocal results, and recommending
follow-up if necessary. 6.3. Flag critical or urgent results for
immediate review and communication with the healthcare provider.
7. Documentation: 7.1. All steps performed, including the sample
preparation, assay run, QC, and result interpretation, must be
documented in detail. 7.2. Maintain records of all results and QC data
for future reference and audits.
8. Troubleshooting: 8.1. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines and
laboratory protocols for troubleshooting any issues encountered
during the assay run. 8.2. Consult the supervisor or technical support
for persistent problems.

significant changes in procedures or equipment. It must be approved
by the laboratory supervisor and the medical director.
