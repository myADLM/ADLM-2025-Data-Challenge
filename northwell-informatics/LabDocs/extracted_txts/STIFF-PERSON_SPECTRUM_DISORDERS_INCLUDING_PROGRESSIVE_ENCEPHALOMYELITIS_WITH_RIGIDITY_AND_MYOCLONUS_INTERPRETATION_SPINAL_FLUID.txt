Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Stiff-
Person Spectrum Disorders Including Progressive Encephalomyelitis
with Rigidity and Myoclonus (SPSD/PERM) - Interpretation of Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the analytical procedures and interpretation guidelines for
the detection of Stiff-Person Spectrum Disorders including
Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus from
spinal fluid samples. This protocol ensures the generation of
accurate, reliable, and timely results for the diagnosis and
management of SPSD/PERM.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all spinal fluid samples received and
accessioned for the analysis of Stiff-Person Spectrum Disorders,
including Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Medical Laboratory Scientists: To perform the analysis, document
findings, and report results.
• Supervisors: To ensure protocol adherence, review results, and
address any discrepancies or issues in the process.
• Clinical Team: To review and interpret the reported results for
appropriate clinical decision-making.
1. PROCEDURE:
4.1 Reagents and Supplies:
• ELISA kit for anti-GAD65 antibodies, anti-amphiphysin antibodies,
and anti-glycine receptor antibodies
• Lumbar puncture kit (provided by collection team)
• Calibration standards and controls
• CSF albumin, IgG, and IgM kits
• Buffy coat cell count materials
• Automated immunoassay analyzers
• Pipettes, microcentrifuges, and other standard laboratory
equipment
• The traceable thermometer for equipment validation
• Temperature-controlled storage facilities (refrigerators and
freezers)
• Temperature and humidity logs
4.2 Pre-Analytical Checks:
• Ensure the spinal fluid samples are collected in accordance with
the standard collection procedure.
• Verify that samples are appropriately labeled with patient
identification, collection date, and time.
• Ensure samples are delivered to the laboratory within the stability
time frames and stored under proper conditions.
• Check that necessary documentation (e.g., collection form,
clinical history) accompanies the samples.
4.3 Analytical Process:
4.3.1 Quality Control Preparation:
• Perform weekly calibration using provided standards and controls.
• Use manufacturer-provided internal quality control materials for
assays, ensuring they are within the acceptable range.
• Validate electronic equipment against traceable thermometers.
4.3.2 Initial Sample Processing:
• Centrifuge spinal fluid samples at 1000-2000g for 10 minutes.
• Aliquot supernatant spinal fluid into clean tubes for immunoassay
analysis.
• Store an extra aliquot at -20°C for any necessary repeat testing.
4.3.3 Assay for Anti-GAD65, Anti-Amphiphysin, and Anti-Glycine
Receptor Antibodies:
• Perform the ELISA assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions:
◦ Dilute the samples appropriately.
◦ Add reagents and samples to the plate wells as directed.
◦ Incubate, wash, and add substrate according to the kit
specifications.
◦ Measure absorbance using a microplate reader.
• Record results and ensure that quality controls are within
expected values.
• Repeat testing for any out-of-range or borderline results.
4.3.4 Additional assays (if applicable):
• Measure albumin, IgG, and IgM levels in CSF.
• Perform cell count and differential for any inflammatory presence.
• Conduct high-resolution electrophoresis and immunofixation if
oligoclonal bands are suspected.
4.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation:
• Use calibrated software to calculate antibody concentrations
based on standard curves.
• Compare the patient’s results with reference intervals provided by
the assay manufacturer.
• Cross-reference results with patient history and clinical
indications.
• Review results with a focus on sensitivity and specificity for the
involved antibodies.
• Consult clinical guidelines for interpretation in the context of
SPSD/PERM.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
5.1 Documentation:
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure all result interpretations are accompanied by the
appropriate reference values/ranges.
• Verify that the technologist's initials, date, and time of analysis are
recorded.
5.2 Critical Results:
• Immediately communicate any critical results to the requesting
physician.
• Ensure the critical result communication is documented as per
policy.
5.3 Result Verification:
• Supervisors double-check the results for accuracy and
completeness.
• Once verified, results are released through LIS to the attending
clinician.
5.4 Review and Sign-off:
• Ensure a final review and sign-off by a senior clinical pathologist.
• Provide interpretative comments, if necessary, for clarity.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Adhere closely to assay procedural specifications to avoid
potential interferences.
• Ensure adequate time for assay completion to maintain reliability.
