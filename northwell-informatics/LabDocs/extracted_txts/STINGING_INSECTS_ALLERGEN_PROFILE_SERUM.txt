STINGING INSECTS ALLERGEN PROFILE, SERUM STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed procedure for the performance of the
Stinging Insects Allergen Profile, Serum test. It includes processing
guidelines to ensure accurate, precise, and reproducible results.
These results aid in diagnosing sensitivities or allergic reactions to
stinging insects such as bees, wasps, and hornets.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
analysis of stinging insect allergens in serum.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting this
analysis, including instrument operation and maintenance,
preparation, and result interpretation. Supervisors must ensure that
staff comply with this SOP and handle any issues promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
4.1 Specimen Type
• Specimen: Serum
4.2 Collection and Handling
• Collect blood specimen in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen to separate the serum within 2 hours of
collection.
• Transfer the serum into a properly labeled aliquot tube if
necessary.
4.3 Storage
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if the analysis is performed within 48
hours.
• For storage beyond 48 hours, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles as this may degrade the
sample.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
5.2 Reagents
• Stinging Insects Allergen reagent kit (specific to the analyzer, e.g.,
ImmunoCAP ISAC kit)
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Calibrators
• Diluent buffer
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
starting the assay.
• Prepare the work area and ensure all necessary equipment and
supplies are available.
6.2 Calibration
• Perform a calibration check using the calibrators provided in the
reagent kit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.
• Validate the calibration with control samples.
6.3 Assay Procedure
• Load the serum specimen, controls, and standards onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure the proper placement of reagents and samples as per the
analyzer’s requirements.
• Start the assay run through the instrument’s software.
• The automated system will process the samples and generate a
report of allergen-specific IgE levels.
6.4 Verification
• Once the assay is complete, review the control values to ensure
they fall within acceptable ranges.
• Verify the generated results against the controls. If controls are
not within limits, recalibrate and rerun the test.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer the validated results from the analyzer’s software to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results are verified by a qualified technologist.
• Report findings according to site-specific guidelines, indicating
IgE levels for each allergen in the panel.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with every batch run using both
positive and negative controls.
• Maintain a QC log detailing lot numbers and expiration dates of
reagents and controls.
• Document all maintenance and calibration activities for the
immunoassay analyzer.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <0.35 kUA/L
• Borderline: 0.35-0.70 kUA/L
• Positive: >0.70 kUA/L
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with the results.
• Patients must discontinue antihistamines and other interfering
medications before sample collection for an accurate assessment.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens may affect specificity.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Stinging Insects Allergen
reagent kit (e.g., ImmunoCAP ISAC package insert).
• Current protocols and clinical guidelines for allergen testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all analytical results in accordance with established
laboratory protocols and document any anomalies or technical
issues experienced during the assay.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure that the
analysis of the Stinging Insects Allergen Profile, Serum is conducted
accurately, consistently, and safely, providing reliable diagnostic
support for patient care.
