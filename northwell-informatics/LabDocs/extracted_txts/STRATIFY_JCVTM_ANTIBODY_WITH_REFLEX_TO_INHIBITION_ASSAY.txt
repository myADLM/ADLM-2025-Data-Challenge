SOP: STRATIFY JCVTM ANTIBODY WITH REFLEX TO
INHIBITION ASSAY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the STRATIFY JCV™
Antibody with reflex to Inhibition Assay to detect and quantify
antibodies against the JC virus using the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay) method.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting each step of this procedure, as well as ensuring the
accuracy and validity of the results. Supervisors must oversee the
process and address any issues related to test performance.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 3-5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
• Serum must be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection
• Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or at -20°C for longer
storage
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours
• Specimens without a proper label or with a damaged label
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• STRATIFY JCV™ Antibody ELISA kit (including all reagents and
consumables)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• 8-channel and single-channel pipettes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate washer
• Laboratory timer
• Incubator set at 20-25°C
• Refrigerator set at 2-8°C
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls included in the ELISA kit with
each assay
• Perform quality control checks according to the manufacturer's
instructions before analyzing patient samples
• QC results must be within the specified ranges for the assay to be
valid
1. PROCEDURE
A) ELISA Assay:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting.
◦ Label all microplate wells as needed, including controls and
samples.
2. Coating:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted antigen to each microplate well and
incubate according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the provided wash buffer,
ensuring complete removal of liquid.
4. Blocking:
◦ Add 200 µL blocking buffer to each well and incubate as
instructed.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the wash buffer.
5. Addition of Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of patient serum, positive control, and negative
control to the relevant wells. Incubate as directed.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the wash buffer.
6. Detection Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of HRP-conjugated detection antibody to each
well and incubate per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the wash buffer.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well and
incubate in the dark, observing the development of color.
8. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL stop solution to each well. The solution will turn
yellow.
9. Reading:
◦ Read the optical density at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
B) Reflex Inhibition Assay:
1. Criteria:
◦ Samples that yield a positive result (above the cutoff value)
by the initial ELISA screen will be reflexed to the inhibition
assay for confirmation.
2. Procedure:
◦ Pre-treat positive samples with neutralization reagent as
specified by the kit instructions and incubate per
manufacturer's guidance.
◦ Repeat ELISA procedure using the pre-treated samples.
◦ Compare the optical density readings of treated versus
untreated wells.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS AND REPORTING
• Calculate the mean absorbance values for each control and
sample.
• Determine the status (positive/negative) based on the cutoff
values specified in the kit insert.
• For reflex assay results, compare absorbance readings of treated
vs. untreated samples to determine inhibition percentage.
• Document and interpret results following laboratory guidelines.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Negative: Below specified cutoff value
• Positive: Above specified cutoff value
• Reflex Assay Positive: Inhibition percentage as per kit instructions
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the STRATIFY JCV™ Antibody ELISA kit insert for
detailed assay limitations and potential cross-reactivity.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Log all assay run details, including sample IDs, control results,
operator initials, and any deviations from the procedure.
• Maintain records of quality control and patient results per
laboratory policy.

11. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This protocol will be reviewed annually or as necessary by the
laboratory supervisor. Revisions will be documented and
communicated to all relevant staff.
