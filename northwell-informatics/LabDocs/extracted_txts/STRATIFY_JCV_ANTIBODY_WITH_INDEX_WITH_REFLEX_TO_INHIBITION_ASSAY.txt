STRATIFY JCV Antibody (with Index) with Reflex to Inhibition
Assay Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized operating procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for the STRATIFY JCV Antibody (with
Index) assay, with reflex to Inhibition Assay when necessary,
ensuring accuracy, precision, and timely reporting of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the STRATIFY JCV Antibody testing and reflex inhibition assay
according to the procedure outlined below. It is also the responsibility
of all laboratory staff to report any issues or deviations to the
supervisor immediately.
3. DEFINITION
STRATIFY JCV Antibody (with Index) assay is a serological test used
for the detection of antibodies against the JC virus, which is linked to
the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML). The Reflex to Inhibition Assay is performed if the initial index
value falls within a predefined range, requiring further validation.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Specimen type: Serum
- Collection container: Serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top tube.
- Volume: Minimum of 1.0 mL serum
- Storage: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within 48 hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C or colder.
- Unacceptable specimens: Specimens that are lipemic, hemolyzed, or collected in the wrong tube type.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
- STRATIFY JCV Antibody (with Index) assay kit
- Reflex Inhibition Assay kit
- Calibrators and controls provided by the assay manufacturer
- Micropipettes and tips
- Plate reader compatible with the assay requirements
- PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
- Incubator set to 37°C
- Vortex mixer
- Laboratory timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. STRATIFY JCV Antibody (with Index) Assay 1. Bring all
reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples to room
temperature (18-25°C) before starting the assay. 2. Label appropriate
number of microtiter wells for calibrators, controls, and patient
samples. 3. Pipette 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and patient
sample into respective wells. 4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to
each well. 5. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C. 6. Wash the plate
5 times with 300 µL PBS per well. 7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution
to each well and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature (avoid
direct light). 8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate
the reaction. 9. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution. 10. Calculate
the antibody index (AI) using the formula provided in the assay kit
insert.
B. Reflex Inhibition Assay 1. If the AI falls within the borderline
range (e.g., 0.9 - 1.1), perform the Reflex Inhibition Assay. 2. Set up a
new plate and label wells for the borderlines detected. 3. Pipette 100
µL of each borderline sample into the corresponding wells. 4. Add
100 µL of the inhibition reagent provided in the reflex kit to each well.
5. Incubate at room temperature for the time specified in the reflex kit
instructions (usually 1-2 hours). 6. Follow the same wash, substrate
addition, incubation, and stop steps as outlined in the primary
antibody assay. 7. Read the absorbance at 450 nm and evaluate the
inhibition per manufacturer's instructions.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
- Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
- Document all control results to verify they are within the acceptable range prior to releasing patient results.
- If controls fail, do not report patient results, and follow troubleshooting procedures.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
- Report AI values according to the following interpretation criteria:
- AI < 0.9: Negative for JCV antibodies.
- AI 0.9 - 1.1: Borderline; perform Reflex Inhibition Assay.
- AI > 1.1: Positive for JCV antibodies.
- For borderline results confirmed by inhibition assay, report final interpretation based on inhibition results as follows:
- No significant inhibition: Confirmed positive.
- Significant inhibition: Confirmed negative.
9. CRITICAL VALUES AND ACTION LIMITS
- Report all positive results to the requesting physician immediately, adhering to hospital policies for critical result notification.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
- Maintain all records for calibrators, controls, and patient results.
- Ensure all corrective actions for out-of-control runs are documented.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for limitations specific to the
assay.
