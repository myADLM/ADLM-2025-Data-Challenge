STRATIFY JCV DXSELECT ANTIBODY INHIBITION ASSAY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect Antibody Inhibition Assay. This assay is
used for the detection and quantification of antibodies to the JC virus
in human serum or plasma samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
this assay according to the procedures outlined below, report the
results accurately, and maintain all associated documentation. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance
with this protocol and to provide appropriate training to the personnel.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen: Serum or plasma
• Collect blood samples using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Allow the blood to clot fully when collected in a serum separator
tube, then centrifuge to separate the serum.
• For plasma, collect blood in an appropriate anticoagulant tube
(heparin, EDTA) and centrifuge to obtain plasma.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Improper labeling (missing information such as patient’s name, ID
number, date, and time of collection).
• Specimens with prolonged storage or inappropriate temperature
conditions.
1. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store serum and plasma specimens at 2-8°C if they are to be
tested within 5 days of collection.
• For long term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles to prevent the degradation of
the sample.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• STRATIFY JCV DxSelect Antibody Inhibition Assay kit, including
all reagents and controls as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibrated microplate reader capable of measurement at 450 nm.
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated).
• Microplate washer or manual washing equipment.
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.
• Deionized or distilled water.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
• Prepare wash buffer and other working solutions according to the
guidelines provided in the assay kit insert.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Set-Up:
◦ Label the microplate for samples, controls and standards.
Assign an appropriate number of wells for each category.
2. Addition of Reagents:
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and diluted sample to
the designated wells in duplicate.
3. Incubation 1:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing Step:
◦ Wash the wells 6 times with the prepared wash buffer.
Ensure complete filling and aspiration of wells between
washes.
5. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to
each well.
6. Incubation 2:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Washing Step:
◦ Wash the microplate thoroughly as described in step 4.
8. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
9. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the substrate
reaction.
10. Read Plate: - Measure absorbance at 450 nm within 15 minutes
of stopping the reaction.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure internal controls and standards provided in the kit are
included in each run.
• Monitor for any outliers or inconsistencies in the control wells.
• Reject the run if the controls are not within the predetermined
acceptable range.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare the absorbance values of the samples against the
standard curve.
• Determine the concentration of JCV antibodies in the patient
samples using appropriate calculations and the standard curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS),
ensuring accuracy and completeness.
• Review and verify results for accuracy.
• Report any critical or unexpected results to the designated
healthcare personnel immediately.
1. LIMITATIONS
• This assay is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.
• The results should be interpreted within the context of all available
clinical and laboratory data.
• Any deviation from the procedure may affect the test accuracy.
