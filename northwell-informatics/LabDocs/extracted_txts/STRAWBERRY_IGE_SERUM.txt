Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Strawberry IgE Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Strawberry IgE serum analysis in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This SOP ensures accurate measurement and reporting
of Strawbery-specific IgE antibody levels in patient serum samples.
2. DEFINITION
Strawberry IgE serum analysis involves detecting the amount of
immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to strawberries in a patient's serum.
This test helps identify allergic reactions to strawberries.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff is responsible for conducting the analysis,
documenting results, and:
• Performing necessary quality control procedures.
• Implementing corrective actions when necessary.
• Ensuring adherence to SOP to maintain compliance with CLIA
regulations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum samples collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or
plain red-top tube.
Specimen Stability:
• The specimen must be processed within 24 hours of collection.
• If not processed immediately, the serum should be separated and
stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days, or frozen at -20°C for extended
storage up to six months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens not labeled correctly with patient identification and
collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assay system or any other validated
and approved system for IgE analysis.
• Controls: High and low-level IgE controls.
• Reagents: anti-IgE antibodies, calibrators, buffers, wash solutions,
and substrate solution.
• Consumables: Pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes, serum storage
vials.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the SST or red-top tube containing the blood
specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the serum to labeled microcentrifuge tubes,
ensuring no cellular material or clot is transferred.
2. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 7 days.
For extended storage, freeze at -20°C.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Setting Up:
◦ Turn on the ImmunoCAP system and ensure it is ready for
use.
◦ Load reagents, controls, calibrators, and sample according
to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run high and low-level controls with each assay batch.
◦ Perform calibrations as per manufacturer's guidelines and
document results.
3. IgE Analysis:
◦ Add 50µL of patient serum to the designated wells or
reaction tubes.
◦ Load calibrators and controls following system instructions.
◦ Initiate the assay run, ensuring all steps (wash cycles,
incubation, and detection) are followed according to the
assay kit instructions.
C. Documentation:
• Record all sample details, control results, and calibration status in
the system.
• Ensure documentation includes date, time, and initials of the
technician performing the analysis.
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
• After completing the assay, review the printout or digital report
from the ImmunoCAP system.
• Interpret results quantitatively, documenting the Strawberry-
specific IgE levels.
• Compare results with reference intervals for IgE levels as
provided by the manufacturer or site-specific guidelines.
8. QUALITY CONTROL: A. Internal Quality Control:
• Run high and low-level controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Ensure control results fall within acceptable ranges before
verifying patient results.
B. External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as required by CLIA
regulations.
• Address and document any proficiency testing issues or
discrepancies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
A. Reporting Guidelines:
1. Enter the IgE values into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Verify and review patient results ensuring all QC checks have
been passed.
3. Notify attending clinician regarding critical values outside the
reference range.
B. Reference Intervals:
• Define specific IgE levels for Strawberry allergy based on
manufacturer reference ranges or established clinical guidelines.
C. Documentation of Critical Values:
• Follow the laboratory's protocol for handling and documenting
critical values.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure awareness of the limitations of the ImmunoCAP assay as
detailed in the product insert. Limitations may include interference
from high levels of total IgE or cross-reactivity with other
allergens.
11. CORRECTIVE ACTION: A. Temperature Control Issues:
• Address and document any deviations from storage temperatures
immediately as per section 6(B).
B. Assay Errors:
• If controls are out of range, perform corrective actions, re-
calibrate the instrument and re-run affected samples.

• ImmunoCAP Specific IgE product insert and manufacturer's
guidelines.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure accurate and
reliable measurement of Strawberry IgE serum levels and maintain
regulatory compliance.
