Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Strawberry IgG
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and generation of results
for Strawberry IgG levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analyses according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any issues with the assay procedure or results and to report
them to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples collected in red-top or serum separator tubes
(SST).
• The sample must be centrifuged and serum separated and
transferred to a sterile, appropriately labelled 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48 hours
of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens not properly labelled.
• Specimens not transported under the correct conditions (e.g.,
room temperature).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader
• ELISA assay kit for Strawberry IgG
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate washer
• Incubator set at 37°C
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and kit components are at room
temperature before beginning the assay.
2. Calibrate the ELISA reader according to manufacturer
instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare the standards, controls, and samples according to the
instructions provided in the ELISA kit insert.
2. Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and sample to the
appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
3. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
4. Wash the plate three times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well and incubate for
30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Wash the plate three times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate for
15 minutes at room temperature, protected from light.
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
9. Read the plate at 450 nm using the ELISA reader.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
Include appropriate controls (negative and positive) provided by the
ELISA kit in each run. Utilize quality control materials to verify the
accuracy and precision of the assay. Check that the ELISA reader is
within calibration specifications before use.
Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze three levels of quality control material (low, medium,
high) regularly and record results.
• If controls fail to meet the acceptable range, review procedure
steps, repeat the assay, and report to supervisor if issues persist.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Standards & Calculations:
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the optical density (OD)
values of the standards.
• Determine the concentration of Strawberry IgG in each sample by
referencing the standard curve.
• Results are automatically logged into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by a technologist
before reporting.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal range for Strawberry IgG levels in serum: 0-20 U/mL.
• Values above the normal range should be flagged for potential
allergic reactions and reported accordingly.
Critical Results:
• Any result indicating a significantly high level (>100 U/mL) should
be communicated immediately to the appropriate healthcare
provider for further action.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure strict adherence to the ELISA kit protocol and guidelines
to prevent deviations that may affect results.
• Avoid contamination and improper handling of specimens as they
can lead to inaccurate results.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain a record of all specimens, including date of receipt,
sample type, and patient information.
• Document all results, including standards, controls, and samples,
in the Laboratory Information System.

1. NOTES
Any anomalies or discrepancies identified during the testing
procedure should be reported to the supervisor immediately and
documented as per lab protocols.
