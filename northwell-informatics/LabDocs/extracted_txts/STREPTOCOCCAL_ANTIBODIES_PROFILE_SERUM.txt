STREPTOCOCCAL ANTIBODIES PROFILE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a standardized procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for Streptococcal
Antibodies Profile, Serum. This includes the detection and
quantification of antibodies against streptococcal antigens to aid in
the diagnosis and management of streptococcal infections and their
complications.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and reliably.
• The supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
protocol and addressing any issues that may arise.
• Designated staff is responsible for performing the tests, entering
results, and ensuring the integrity of the test system.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 2 mL serum separated from a freshly
collected blood sample.
• Specimen Handling: Serum should be separated from the clot
within 2 hours of collection. Store and transport the serum sample
refrigerated (2-8°C) if not tested immediately.
• Stability: Samples are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents: Streptozyme reagent, positive and negative controls,
appropriate buffer solutions.
• Equipment: Calibrated pipettes, micropipettes, EIA reader or
manual spectrophotometer, water bath or heating block, ELISA
plates or Streptozyme test kits, incubator, refrigerator.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Verify the performance of the EIA reader/spectrophotometer with
standard solutions as per instrument maintenance protocol.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
6. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents as described in the manufacturer's insert.
◦ Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature before use.
2. Equipment Preparation:
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and operational.
◦ Set the incubator to the required temperature as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. TEST PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples and controls to reach room
temperature.
◦ Label the ELISA plate or Streptozyme test kits accordingly.
2. Reagent Handling:
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for dilution of samples
and controls.
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of reagents into each well as
per the test format.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate in the incubator or heating block at the
specified temperature for the designated period (typically
37°C for 30 minutes).
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as per the manufacturer’s instructions using
the appropriate buffer solution.
5. Reading:
◦ Add the substrate and stop solution (if applicable) as per the
kit's instructions.
◦ Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
EIA reader/spectrophotometer.
C. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Compare the absorbance values of the patient samples with
the positive and negative controls.
◦ Calculate the antibody concentration using the standard
curve generated from the positive controls.
2. Reference Ranges:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines or established
laboratory reference ranges for interpretation of the results.
D. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the accuracy of the results.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical results should be immediately reported to the requesting
clinician as per laboratory protocol.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations related to
the test.
• Any deviations from the protocol may affect the accuracy and
reliability of the results.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's product insert for Streptozyme reagent and
associated control materials.
• Laboratory quality control and equipment maintenance manuals.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain documentation of test runs, quality control checks,
equipment calibration records, and any troubleshooting actions
taken.
• Use appropriate documentation forms and logs as specified by
the laboratory's quality management system.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle biological specimens and reagents according to
institutional safety guidelines.
APPROVALS AND REVIEW
• This protocol shall be reviewed annually and updated as
necessary based on new guidelines or technological
advancements.
• Approvals should be documented with signatures from the
supervisors and laboratory manager.
