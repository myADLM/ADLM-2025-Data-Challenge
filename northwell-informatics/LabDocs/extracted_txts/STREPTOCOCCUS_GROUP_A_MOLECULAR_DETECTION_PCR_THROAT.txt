Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP A, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR, THROAT
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed step-by-step
procedure for the molecular detection of Streptococcus Group A
(GAS) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from throat swab
specimens.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform the
Streptococcus Group A PCR test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technician/Technologist: Perform the assay
following this SOP and document each step accurately.
• Supervisor/Manager: Ensure all personnel are trained on this
SOP and handle any deviations or issues that arise.
• Quality Control Personnel: Perform regular checks and
validations as specified in the SOP.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• Throat swabs collected using a sterile synthetic swab (e.g., nylon
or rayon) on a plastic shaft.
• Specimens should be transported in an appropriate transport
medium, such as Amies or Stuart media.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not kept at the correct temperature or those that have
exceeded the recommended transport time.
• Broken or leaking containers.
• Specimens with no identification or with identification
discrepancies.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• PCR thermal cycler
• Class II Biosafety Cabinet
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and sterile filter tips
• Refrigerators and freezers
• RNA/DNAse-free work surfaces and instruments
Reagents:
• PCR Master Mix
• Primers and probes specific for Streptococcus Group A
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive Control (Streptococcus Group A DNA)
• Negative Control (Nuclease-free water)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen integrity and identification.
2. Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing is to be done within 24
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
6.2 Extraction of DNA
1. Use a commercial DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Label all tubes clearly with a laboratory ID and other identifying
information.
3. Add internal controls to ensure extraction efficiency and
inhibitor detection.
4. Process each sample, adding appropriate volumes of reagents
as per the extraction kit instructions.
5. Elute the DNA in a final volume as specified by the kit and store
the extracted DNA at -20°C until PCR setup.
6.3 Preparation of PCR Master Mix
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix in a designated clean area to
avoid contamination.
3. Mix the following components for each reaction:
◦ PCR enzyme mix: X µL
◦ Forward primer: X µL
◦ Reverse primer: X µL
◦ Probe: X µL
◦ Nuclease-free water: X µL
◦ Target DNA (sample): X µL
4. Total volume per reaction should be Y µL (typically 20-25 µL).
6.4 PCR Amplification
1. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
2. Add the extracted DNA (sample) to each tube/plate well.
3. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
4. Seal the reaction tubes or plate adequately.
5. Load the PCR tubes/plates into the thermal cycler.
6. Use the following cycling conditions unless specified otherwise
by the primer/probe manufacturer:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
6.5 Detection and Interpretation
1. After amplification, analyze the results as per the thermal
cycler’s software instructions.
2. A positive result is indicated by a significant increase in
fluorescence during the PCR amplification cycles.
3. Compare results with the positive and negative controls.
4. Document all observations and results accurately.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform an extraction control with every batch of samples.
• Use positive and negative controls in every PCR run.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment involved in the
procedure.
• Record all quality control measures and deviations.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results before reporting.
• Positive results for Streptococcus Group A should be
communicated urgently as per laboratory protocol.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure timely communication to relevant healthcare providers.
9. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow standard biosafety procedures while handling specimens
and reagents.
• Dispose of all waste according to biohazard waste disposal
regulations.
10. REFERENCES
• Inserted here are references to relevant literature, manufacturer's
manuals, and regulatory guidelines adhered to during this
procedure.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure consistent and
accurate detection of Streptococcus Group A in throat swab
specimens using PCR. This SOP should be reviewed and updated
periodically to incorporate advances in technology and changes in
regulatory requirements.
