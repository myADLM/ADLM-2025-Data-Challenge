Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Streptococcus Pneumoniae Antigen in Random Urine Sample
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of testing for Streptococcus
pneumoniae (Spn) antigen in a random urine sample. The SOP
ensures that results are accurate, reliable, and reproducible and
comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
(CLIA) regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all medical laboratory
scientists and technologists to follow this SOP and ensure the
reliability and accuracy of the test results. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for monitoring the adherence to this SOP and providing
necessary training to the staff.
3. SPECIMEN
Type: Random urine sample.
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10-30 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a sterile container.
• Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and tested within 24 hours of
collection.
• If testing is delayed, the urine specimen can be frozen at -20°C or
below.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples that are more than 24 hours old if stored at 2-8°C
without freezing.
• Urine samples collected in non-sterile containers.
• Samples with visible contamination or sediment.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Commercially available Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test
kit.
• Controls (positive and negative) for quality assurance.
• Timer.
• Pipettes.
• Sterile urine containers.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab coat,
and eye protection.
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Verify the test order and specimen according to laboratory
protocols.
◦ Label the test device or reaction area with the patient’s
identification.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Allow the urine sample to equilibrate to room temperature
before testing.
◦ Mix the urine sample gently by inversion before aliquoting.
3. Testing Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions included with the test
kit.
◦ Using a pipette, aliquot the specified volume of urine (as per
the manufacturer's instructions) into the test device.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of reagent provided in the kit.
◦ Allow the mixture to react for the stipulated time frame as
per the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Ensure the control reagents (positive and negative) are run
with each batch of tests to ensure the validity of the results.
4. Interpreting Results:
◦ Interpret the results according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Positive Result: Presence of a visible test line along with the
control line indicates the presence of Streptococcus
pneumoniae antigen.
◦ Negative Result: Only the control line is visible, indicating
the absence of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen.
◦ Invalid Result: If the control line does not appear, the test
result is invalid, and the test must be repeated.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run the positive and negative controls with each new lot
number of kits and daily as part of the quality control
process.
◦ Document the results of the controls in the appropriate
logbook.
◦ If controls do not perform as expected, do not report patient
results and notify the supervisor immediately.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Positive and negative results are recorded accurately, ensuring
that appropriate flags or comments are added if the results are
out of the expected range or if any discrepancies are noted.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a second qualified
technologist or supervisor before release.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Results are qualitative (positive or negative).
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations pertaining
to sensitivity, specificity, and potential cross-reactivity.
• False positive or false negative results may occur. Clinical
correlation with patient symptoms and other diagnostic tests is
recommended.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Use PPE at all times during the handling of specimens and
execution of the test procedure.
• Dispose of all waste materials, including urine samples and test
kits, in biohazard containers according to the laboratory's waste
disposal guidelines.
