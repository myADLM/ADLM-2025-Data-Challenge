STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE ANTIGEN TESTING
PROTOCOL – SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide an accurate and reliable method for the detection of
Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens in spinal fluid specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated medical laboratory scientists and technologists are
responsible for performing the test, documenting results, and
ensuring quality control measures are per the laboratory’s
established guidelines.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 2-5 mL of clear spinal fluid in a sterile container.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens contaminated with blood or other tissues.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without collection date/time
or patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader or lateral flow device appropriate for antigen
testing
Reagents:
• Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test kit (e.g., lateral flow
immunoassay kit, ELISA kit)
Supplies:
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves
• Timer
• Sterile containers for sample aliquoting
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Processing:
1. Verify the specimen container for proper labeling including
patient information, date, and time of collection.
2. Centrifuge the spinal fluid specimen at 2000 RPM for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
3. Transfer supernatant to a sterile container for testing.
B. Test Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature prior to
testing.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the preparation of the
Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test kit.
3. Assemble all necessary materials and ensure workspace is
clean and properly set up.
C. Performing the Test:
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of spinal fluid supernatant as
instructed by the test kit protocol.
2. Add reagents provided in the test kit to the spinal fluid aliquot.
3. Start the timer according to the test protocol for the required
incubation period(s).
4. If using a lateral flow immunoassay, read the results in the time
frame specified in the test kit instructions using the appropriate
reading device or visually by comparing the test strip to the
control strip.
5. If using an ELISA kit, use a microplate reader to measure
optical density (OD) values at the specified wavelength.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Interpret the test results according to manufacturer’s guidelines:
◦ Positive Result: Indicates the presence of Streptococcus
pneumoniae antigens in the spinal fluid.
◦ Negative Result: Indicates absence or undetectable levels
of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens.
◦ Invalid Result: No control line or unusual results. Test must
be repeated.
2. Document the results including patient identification, test
performed, date, time, and initials of the individual performing
the test.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
specimens tested.
◦ Positive control: Should yield positive results.
◦ Negative control: Should yield negative results.
2. Document all quality control results accordingly and take
corrective actions if the controls are not within the expected
limits.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
All test results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and include any pertinent observations or comments.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen
detected.
• Negative: No Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen detected.
• Invalid: Result not interpretable; repeat the test.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for limitations related to
sensitivity and specificity of the test. Potential causes for false
positives or negatives should be considered.
