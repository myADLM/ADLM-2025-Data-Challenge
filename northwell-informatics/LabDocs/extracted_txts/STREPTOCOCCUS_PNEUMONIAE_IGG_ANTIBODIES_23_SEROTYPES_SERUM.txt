Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Streptococcus Pneumoniae IgG Antibodies, 23 Serotypes,
Serum
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the procedure for the quantitative
determination of specific IgG antibodies to 23 Streptococcus
pneumoniae serotypes in human serum. This test is used for
assessing immune response following vaccination or infection and
determining immune deficiency conditions linked to Streptococcus
pneumoniae.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel performing this test
must be adequately trained in both the technical and safety aspects.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Collection: Collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Washer (Microplate)
• Microplate reader
• ELISA kit specific for Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibodies,
23 serotypes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Software for data analysis
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Setup
1. All reagents and materials must be brought to room
temperature for at least 30 minutes before beginning assay
setup.
2. Prepare any standards, controls, and reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Dilute patient serum samples, standards, and controls
appropriately, typically at 1:100 as per kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Standards Addition
◦ Add 100 μL of diluted patient serum, standards, and controls
to designated wells of the microplate.
2. Incubation
◦ Seal the plate and incubate at the specified temperature and
duration (commonly 37°C for 1 hour) according to kit
instructions.
3. Washing
◦ Aspirate wells and wash the plate as directed in the kit
protocol, typically with a wash buffer. Ensure thorough
washing to remove unbound substances.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody
solution to each well.
5. Second Incubation
◦ Seal the plate again, and incubate as previously, following
the specific temperature and duration provided in the kit’s
protocol.
6. Washing
◦ Repeat the washing procedure thoroughly.
7. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 μL of the substrate solution to each well.
8. Final Incubation
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for the specified time
(commonly 15-30 minutes), ensuring the substrate reacts
appropriately.
9. Stopping the Reaction
◦ Add the stop solution as instructed by the kit, usually 100 μL
per well.
C. Reading and Analysis
1. Measure the optical density (OD) at the appropriate wavelength
(e.g., 450 nm) within the specified timeframe after adding the
stop solution.
2. Use the microplate reader to capture the data.
3. Calculate the concentrations of Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG
antibodies using the software associated with the microplate
reader, calibrating against the provided standards.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Ensure QC results fall within the manufacturer's acceptance
ranges. If results are outside the acceptable limits, investigate
and troubleshoot before reporting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify the results against the predetermined reference intervals
and quality control findings.
2. Document the IgG concentrations for all 23 serotypes
accurately in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Note any potential issues in sample integrity or assay
performance in the report.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS Refer to kit insert for reference
intervals for each serotype IgG antibody concentration.
9. LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric samples may interfere with
assay performance.
2. Ensure specimens are free from bacteria or particulate
contamination that could influence the assay.

in the ELISA kit insert for detailed analytical methods and
specifications.
11. DOCUMENTATION Ensure all procedures, deviations,
troubleshooting, and corrective actions are documented according to
laboratory policy.
