SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG Antibodies, Total, Serum
1. Purpose The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedures
for the analytical phase of testing for Streptococcus
pneumoniae IgG antibodies, Total, in serum specimens. This
protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results
using a validated immunoassay method.
2. Scope This procedure applies to all personnel responsible for
performing the Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibody testing
in the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to
perform the test as outlined in this SOP accurately and
promptly. All results must be reviewed and validated by the
designated personnel. It is the responsibility of the supervisors
to ensure staff are trained and adhere to these SOPs.
4. Specimen Requirements Acceptable: Serum specimens
collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-top tube.
Samples must be centrifuged to separate serum and should be
stored at 2-8°C if not tested immediately. Unacceptable:
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples. Specimens received in
collection tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
5. Equipment and Reagents
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Calibrated micropipettes (10 µL, 100 µL, 1000 µL)
• Multichannel pipette
• Calibrators and controls for Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG
antibodies
• Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibody assay kit (e.g., ELISA
kit)
• Plate washer (if applicable)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Laboratory timer
1. Calibration and Quality Control
• Run daily calibration and quality control checks before testing
patient samples.
• Use the calibrators and controls provided with the assay kit and
follow the manufacturer's instructions.
• Record all calibration and QC results in the appropriate QC
logbook.
• Acceptable limits for calibrators and control ranges must be
defined according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Do not proceed with patient testing if control results are outside
acceptable ranges. Troubleshoot and repeat QC as necessary
until acceptable results are achieved.
1. Analytical Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature (18-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare the working solutions as directed by the assay kit's
instructions.
B. Assay Procedure (ELISA Example)
1. Add 100 µL of the diluted serum, standards, and controls to the
appropriate wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (e.g., 1 hour).
3. Wash the plate 3-5 times with the washing buffer provided in
the kit to remove any unbound components.
4. Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugate solution to each well and
incubate at 37°C for the specified time (e.g., 1 hour).
5. Repeat the washing step.
6. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well. Incubate in
the dark at room temperature for the specified time, generally
10-20 minutes.
7. Add 50-100 µL of the stop solution to each well to halt the
enzyme reaction.
8. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at a specified
wavelength (e.g., 450 nm) using an ELISA reader.
C. Results Calculation
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
calibrators against their corresponding concentrations on a log-
linear scale.
2. Determine the concentration of Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG
antibodies in the patient samples and control sera by
comparing the OD values to the generated standard curve.
3. Validate and review all results according to the laboratory's
standard procedures.
4. Reporting Results
• Log the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Clearly flag results that fall outside normal reference ranges.
• Notify suitable medical personnel of any critical results as per
laboratory policy.
1. Reference Intervals Normal/reference range for Streptococcus
pneumoniae IgG antibodies will be provided in the assay kit
insert or validated based on the laboratory protocol.
2. Method Limitations
• Assay performance is subject to the instructions provided by the
assay kit manufacturer.
• Incorrect specimen handling and preparation can impact the
results.
• Cross-reactivity and interference should be evaluated as per the
kit's specifications.
1. Documentation and Record Keeping
• Maintain all logs, worksheets, printouts, and reports as per the
laboratory’s documentation policy.
• Keep records stored securely for a minimum of five years or as
per local regulations.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Streptococcus pneumoniae
IgG antibody assay kit.
• Current clinical guidelines for interpretation of Streptococcus
pneumoniae IgG antibody results.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the reliability and
consistency of results for Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibody
testing in serum specimens.
