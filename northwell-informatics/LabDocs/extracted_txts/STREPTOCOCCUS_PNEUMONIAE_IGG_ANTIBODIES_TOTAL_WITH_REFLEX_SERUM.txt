Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Streptococcus
pneumoniae IgG Antibodies, Total, with Reflex, Serum
1. PURPOSE This procedure provides guidelines for the analysis of
Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG Antibodies, Total, in serum, including
reflex testing. The goal is to ensure accurate and timely results for
patient diagnosis and management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the analysis.
• It is the duty of laboratory supervisors to ensure that all staff
adhere to the procedure and address any issues that arise during
testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required.
• Collection: Use a red-top tube or a serum separator tube (SST).
• Transport: Keep the specimen at 2-8°C if it will be tested within 48
hours. If storage longer than 48 hours is required, freeze the
specimen at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• Pipettes and Tips
• Microtiter Plates
• Control Sera (Positive and Negative)
• Calibrators
• Substrate Solutions
• Wash Buffer
• Stop Solution
• Automated or Manual Incubator
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include Positive and Negative Control sera with each run.
• Calibrators should yield results within specified ranges to validate
the run.
• Run Quality Control (QC) checks at the beginning, middle, and
end of each batch to identify any procedural errors.
6. PROCEDURE 6.1 Preparation
• Thaw specimens, controls, and reagents to room temperature.
• Prepare wash buffer by diluting the concentrate according to
manufacturer instructions.
6.2 Assay Setup
• Label microtiter plates clearly with sample identifiers.
• Add reference standards, controls, and patient samples to
designated wells.
• Add the appropriate dilution buffer to each sample as specified by
the assay kit instructions.
6.3 Incubation
• Incubate the microtiter plate as directed by the assay kit, typically
30-60 minutes at room temperature.
• Wash the plate multiple times with wash buffer using the ELISA
washer.
6.4 Addition of Conjugate
• Add the conjugate (enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG) to each well
according to kit instructions.
• Incubate the plate following specified conditions (e.g., 30 minutes
at 37°C).
6.5 Detection
• Add substrate solution to each well. Allow color to develop in a
dark environment at room temperature (usually 20-30 minutes).
• Add stop solution to cease the reaction.
6.6 Reading Results
• Read the optical density (OD) of each well using the ELISA reader
at the appropriate wavelength specified in the kit (typically 450
nm).
• Document the OD values.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
• Generate a standard curve using the calibrator OD values.
• Calculate the concentration of IgG antibodies in patient samples
using the standard curve.
• Compare the calculated values to reference intervals:
◦ Negative: <20 IU/mL
◦ Equivocal: 20-30 IU/mL
◦ Positive: >30 IU/mL
8. REFLEX TESTING PROCEDURE
• If the initial total IgG antibody result is positive (>30 IU/mL), reflex
testing for individual pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG
antibodies may be performed as indicated by the provider.
• Follow the reflex testing protocol specific to the serotype assays.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Include control values and any deviations noted during testing.
• Reflex test results should be appended to the report of the total
IgG antibodies.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING AND NOTES
• Ensure all reagents are within expiration dates.
• Repeat the assay if controls are out of range.
• Document any irregularities with the assay run and notify the
supervisor.
• Refer to the assay kit manual for specific instructions on handling
unusual results or equipment errors.
