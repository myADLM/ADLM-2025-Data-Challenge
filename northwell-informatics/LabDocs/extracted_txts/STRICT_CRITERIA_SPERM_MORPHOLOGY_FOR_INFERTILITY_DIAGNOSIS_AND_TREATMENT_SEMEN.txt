Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
STRICT CRITERIA SPERM MORPHOLOGY FOR INFERTILITY
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT, SEMEN
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for assessing sperm
morphology using strict criteria in order to provide accurate and
reliable results for infertility diagnosis and treatment.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document the sperm morphology analysis following the
procedures outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that the staff is properly trained, that all procedures are
followed, and that corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS
• Microscope with high power objectives (100X oil immersion)
• Sperm morphology staining kit (Diff-Quik or Papanicolaou stain)
• Glass slides and cover slips
• Immersion oil
• Fine tip marker
• Slide storage boxes
• Timer
• Clean laboratory workspace
• Quality control samples
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure the semen specimen has been received, accessioned,
and brought to room temperature.
2. Mix the specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
3. Using a sterile pipette, place a small aliquot (5-10 µL) of the
semen sample onto a clean glass slide.
4. Using a second slide held at a 45-degree angle, spread the
sample evenly to obtain a thin smear. Allow the slide to air dry.
5. Once completely dry, label the slide with the patient’s unique
identifier, date, and time using a fine tip marker.
B) Staining Procedure:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for either Diff-Quik or
Papanicolaou stain.
2. Carefully stain the air-dried slide to ensure proper differentiation
of sperm head, midpiece, and tail structures.
3. Rinse the slide gently with distilled water or buffer as indicated
by the staining protocol.
4. Allow the slide to dry completely before proceeding to
microscopic examination.
C) Microscopic Examination:
1. Apply a drop of immersion oil onto the stained area of the slide.
2. Examine the slide using the microscope set to 100X oil
immersion magnification.
3. Evaluate at least 200 sperm cells, systematically moving across
the slide to ensure representative sampling of the entire smear.
4. Record morphological criteria for each sperm cell, identifying
abnormalities in head, midpiece, and tail according to strict
criteria guidelines.
Criteria for Normal Morphology:
a. Head: Smooth, oval shape with an even contour.
b. Acrosome: Covers 40%-70% of the sperm head.
c. Midpiece: Thin, less than 1 µm in width, and well-aligned with the
head.
d. Tail: Straight, uniform, and approximately 45 µm in length.
D) Results Documentation:
1. Categorize sperm morphology findings into normal and
abnormal groups based on the detailed criteria.
2. Calculate the percentage of morphologically normal sperm.
3. Record the findings in the patient’s laboratory report, ensuring
that all results are accurately documented and verified by a
second qualified technician or supervisor.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples with known morphologies
alongside patient samples to validate the accuracy of the
staining and analysis procedure.
2. Document results of quality control assessments, and take
corrective actions if results fall outside the established limits.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Results should be reported as the percentage of
morphologically normal sperm according to strict criteria.
2. The final report should include relevant reference intervals and
laboratory comments if necessary.
3. Provide the report to the referring clinician for interpretation and
further management of the patient’s condition.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's inserts for limitations in the staining
procedure. Recognize limitations in sperm morphology assessment
inherent to microscopic examination and ensure appropriate training
and calibration for accurate and consistent results.
