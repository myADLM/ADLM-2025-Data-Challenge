Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for STRONGYLOIDES
ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the analysis of Strongyloides Antibody,
IgG in serum samples using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA).
1. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the analytical determination of
Strongyloides Antibody, IgG in serum specimens in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and ensure all quality control measures are
maintained. Supervisors must oversee that all individuals involved
are compliant with this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
Storage Requirements:
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader (capable of reading at 450 nm)
• ELISA washer
• Incubator set to 37°C
Reagents:
• Strongyloides IgG ELISA Kit
• Distilled or deionized water
Supplies:
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microplate
• Calibrated pipettes
• Timer
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Each run must include positive and negative control sera as
provided in the ELISA kit.
• Run controls according to manufacturer’s instructions; results
must fall within the acceptable range.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in an external quality assessment scheme for
Strongyloides IgG if available.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix by gentle
inversion.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room
temperature before starting the assay.
◦ Prepare the required amount of wash buffer by diluting the
concentrate with distilled water according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Label the microplate and the grid for serum samples,
controls, and standards.
◦ Add 100 µL of each control, standard, and serum sample
into assigned wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate with adhesive foil or lid and incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ After incubation, aspirate the contents of each well and
wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer. Tap the
plate on absorbent paper to remove residual liquid.
5. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugate to each well. Re-cover and
incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate for
10-20 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
9. Measurement:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm
using an ELISA reader.
10. DATA ANALYSIS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Calculation of Results:
1. Determine the average OD for each set of duplicate controls
and samples.
2. Generate a standard curve based on standard OD values and
concentrations.
3. Determine sample concentrations by interpolating OD values
from the standard curve.
Acceptance Criteria:
• Positive control values must be within manufacturer's specified
range.
• Negative control values should fall below the cut-off value.
Interpretation of Patient Results:
• Results above the positive control cut-off are considered positive.
• Results below the negative control threshold are considered
negative.
• Borderline results should be retested or verified by an alternative
method.
1. REPORTING
Reference Ranges:
• Positive: Presence of Strongyloides IgG detected.
• Negative: No Strongyloides IgG detected.
• Equivocal: Results should be repeated or further tested.
Report Format:
• Report the Strongyloides IgG result in qualitative terms: Positive,
Negative, or Equivocal.
• Include a note specifying if results are indicative of active or past
infection, considering clinical context.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives may occur in patients with other parasitic
infections.
• False negatives may occur in the early stages of infection or
immunocompromised patients.
