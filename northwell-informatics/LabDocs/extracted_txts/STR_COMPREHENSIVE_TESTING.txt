Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase: STR
Comprehensive Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for conducting the analytical phase of
Short Tandem Repeat (STR) comprehensive testing from the
preparation of samples through to the analysis of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing STR comprehensive testing are
responsible for following this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring all personnel are adequately trained and adhere to this
procedure.
3. DEFINITIONS
• STR: Short Tandem Repeats, sequences of DNA where a pattern
of two or more nucleotides is repeated and the repetitions are
directly adjacent to each other.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a method used to amplify
copies of a specific DNA segment.
• Capillary Electrophoresis: A technique used to separate DNA
fragments by size.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR thermal cycler
• Capillary electrophoresis equipment (e.g., ABI 3500 Genetic
Analyzer)
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR reaction mix (includes DNA polymerase, primers specific for
STR loci, dNTPs, MgCl2, and buffer)
• STR Ladder (standard reference)
• DNA size marker
• 1x TE buffer
• Formamide
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• Analytical software (e.g., GeneMapper ID-X)
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Preparation
1. Sample Requirements:
◦ Extracted DNA should be quantified using a validated DNA
quantification method (e.g., qPCR or fluorometric assay).
2. DNA Dilution:
◦ Dilute the DNA samples to the required concentration as
specified by the STR amplification kit.
◦ Prepare positive and negative control DNA samples at the
same concentration.
B. PCR Amplification
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare a PCR master mix according to the STR
amplification kit instructions.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into each PCR tube or 96-well plate.
◦ Add DNA samples, positive control, negative control, and
allelic ladder to the appropriate wells.
2. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Program the thermal cycler according to the conditions
specified in the STR amplification kit.
◦ Load the PCR tubes or 96-well plate into the thermal cycler
and start the run.
C. Capillary Electrophoresis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Prepare the formamide/size marker mix and aliquot into a
96-well plate.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of PCR product to the aliquoted
formamide/size marker mix.
2. Denaturation:
◦ Heat the samples at 95°C for 5 minutes and then place
them immediately on ice.
3. Loading the Instrument:
◦ Load the prepared samples, allelic ladder, and controls onto
the capillary electrophoresis instrument.
◦ Ensure the run parameters are set according to the
manufacturer's recommendations.
D. Data Analysis
1. Data Collection:
◦ Collect and save the raw data from the capillary
electrophoresis run.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Use the analytical software to analyze the electrophoresis
data.
◦ Verify the presence of STR peaks within expected size
ranges.
◦ Assign allele calls using the allelic ladder as a reference.
3. Quality Control:
• Ensure that all controls (positive and negative) show expected
results.
• If controls fail or anomalies are noted, troubleshoot the issue and
repeat the analysis if necessary.
E. Reporting Results
1. Results Review:
• Review the allele calls to ensure accuracy.
• Confirm that all quality control criteria are met before reporting
results.
1. Result Verification:
• Verify and record the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Generate a comprehensive final report for the STR results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of samples
run.
• Use an allelic ladder in every run for accurate allele calling.
• Perform biweekly and monthly instrument comparisons to ensure
accuracy across analyzers.
• Document all quality control measures and troubleshooting steps
as necessary.
