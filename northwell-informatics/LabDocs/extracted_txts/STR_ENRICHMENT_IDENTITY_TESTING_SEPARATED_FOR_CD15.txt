Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for STR
Enrichment Identity Testing, Separated for CD15
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the generation of results for STR
(Short Tandem Repeat) enrichment identity testing, specifically for the
CD15 marker, ensuring accuracy, repeatability, and compliance with
regulatory requirements.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel involved in the analytical phase of STR
enrichment identity testing are responsible for following this protocol.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff are adequately
trained and competent to perform these procedures.
3. DEFINITIONS
STR Enrichment Identity Testing: A genetic testing method used to
amplify and identify specific STR markers within the DNA, such as
CD15, for various purposes including identity verification, forensic
analysis, and genetic research.
CD15: An STR marker located in the human genome, often used in
genetic profiling and identity testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Peripheral blood, bone marrow, or other tissue
samples. Collection Tubes: EDTA, heparin, or other appropriate
collection tubes to preserve DNA. Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of
whole blood or equivalent tissue sample. Transport and Storage:
Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 24 hours of
collection. If immediate processing is not possible, samples can be
stored at -20°C for up to one week.

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Transfer 200 µL of whole blood or an equivalent amount of
tissue homogenate to a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of lysis buffer (as per the DNA
extraction kit instructions) and mix thoroughly.
2. Cell Lysis:
◦ Incubate the sample at 56°C for 10-30 minutes with
intermittent vortexing.
3. DNA Binding:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol for binding DNA to the
silica column or magnetic beads.
4. Washing:
◦ Perform the washing steps as indicated in the DNA
extraction kit to remove impurities.
5. Elution:
◦ Elute the purified DNA in 50-100 µL of elution buffer or
nuclease-free water.
6.2 PCR Amplification for CD15:
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix containing:
▪ Taq polymerase
▪ dNTPs
▪ MgCl2
▪ Forward and reverse primers specific for CD15
▪ Buffer (reaction buffer with the appropriate ionic strength
and pH)
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 2-5 µL of extracted DNA to the PCR master mix.
3. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Perform PCR amplification using the following cycling
parameters:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: Optimized temperature specific to CD15
primers for 30 seconds (e.g., 58°C)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
▪ Number of cycles: 30-35 cycles
6.3 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Gel Preparation:
◦ Prepare a 2-3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or an
alternative DNA stain.
◦ Allow the gel to solidify and place it in the electrophoresis
apparatus filled with 1X TBE buffer.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Mix PCR products with loading dye and load into the wells
of the agarose gel.
◦ Include a DNA ladder/size marker in one of the wells.
3. Electrophoresis:
◦ Run the gel at 100-120 volts for 30-45 minutes or until the
dye front reaches an appropriate distance.
4. Visualization:
◦ Visualize the gel under UV light using a UV transilluminator
or gel documentation system.
◦ Capture an image for documentation.
6.4 Result Interpretation:
1. CD15 Evaluation:
◦ Assess the presence and size of the amplified CD15 PCR
product compared to the DNA ladder.
◦ Correspond the expected size with known values for the
CD15 marker.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
to ensure the integrity of the reagents and the accuracy of
the amplification process.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Documentation:
◦ Record the presence or absence of the CD15 marker and
the observed fragment size.
◦ Include images of the gel electrophoresis results in the final
report.
5. Result Interpretation:
◦ Provide a detailed interpretation of the results, noting the
match or discrepancy with any expected identity profiles.
◦ Include any relevant quality control data.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Positive Control:
◦ Use a known DNA sample with a confirmed CD15 marker to
validate the assay's performance.
8. Negative Control:
◦ Include a no-template control (NTC) to check for
contamination and non-specific amplification.
9. Quality Assurance:
◦ Follow laboratory quality assurance procedures to ensure
reproducibility, accuracy, and compliance with regulatory
standards.
