Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for STR Enrichment
Identity Testing Separated for CD19
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for performing STR (Short Tandem
Repeat) enrichment identity testing on samples separated for CD19
to ensure accurate identification of individuals in compliance with
regulatory requirements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting STR
enrichment identity testing on samples separated for CD19. It
includes steps for sample processing, PCR amplification,
electrophoresis, and data analysis to generate accurate STR profiles.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps of the STR enrichment identity testing process.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP and
resolving any issues that may arise during testing.
4. DEFINITIONS
• STR: Short Tandem Repeat, a DNA sequence consisting of
repeating units of 2-6 base pairs in length.
• CD19: A biomarker used to isolate B-cell populations in samples.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique to amplify DNA
sequences.
• Electrophoresis: A method used to separate DNA fragments by
size.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
1. Receive and Verify Samples:
◦ Confirm that samples are properly labeled and accompanied
by relevant documentation.
◦ Ensure samples have been separated for CD19 using
magnetic beads or other separation techniques.
2. Isolate DNA:
◦ Extract DNA from the separated CD19-positive cells using a
designated DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
5.2 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR Reaction:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix containing:
▪ Taq DNA polymerase
▪ dNTP mix
▪ STR primer sets specific to the loci of interest
▪ PCR buffer with MgCl2
▪ DNA template (isolated in the previous step)
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a 96-well plate.
2. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
5.3 Electrophoresis
1. Prepare Gel:
◦ Prepare a polyacrylamide gel or load PCR products on a
capillary electrophoresis system.
2. Load Samples:
◦ Mix amplified products with a loading buffer.
◦ Load samples, a DNA standard ladder, and control samples
into the wells of the gel or into the capillaries.
3. Run Electrophoresis:
◦ Run the gel or capillary electrophoresis system according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
5.4 Data Analysis
1. Visualize Bands:
◦ Use a UV transilluminator or an automated gel imaging
system to capture images of the electrophoresis results.
2. Analyze Data:
◦ Use specialized software to analyze the STR profiles. Match
the DNA fragments to known alleles to generate the STR
profile.
◦ Compare the sample STR profiles to reference profiles or a
database of known profiles for identification purposes.
3. Interpret Results:
◦ Confirm the identity of samples based on the STR profiles.
◦ Document and review the results, ensuring accuracy and
consistency.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of STR
analysis to ensure the reliability of PCR amplification and
electrophoresis.
2. Reproducibility:
◦ Perform replicate analyses of selected samples to confirm
reproducibility of the results.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ Investigate and document any discrepancies or issues that
arise during testing. Implement corrective actions as
needed.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document Results:
◦ Record all findings, including the STR profiles and any
pertinent observations, in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Review Results:
◦ Have a designated supervisor review and verify the results
prior to releasing the final report.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a report summarizing the STR profiles and the
identity conclusions.
◦ Submit the report to the requesting entity, ensuring
confidentiality and adherence to regulatory requirements.
8. REFERENCES
• Relevant manufacturer’s manuals for DNA extraction kits, PCR
amplification systems, and electrophoresis equipment.
• References to validated STR database entries and allele
frequency databases (if applicable).
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP will be reviewed annually by the laboratory director and
updated as necessary to reflect any changes in procedures,
equipment, or regulatory requirements.
APPROVED BY:
Laboratory Director
DATE:
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
consistent results for STR enrichment identity testing separated for
CD19, thereby maintaining the highest standards of laboratory
practice and regulatory compliance.
