Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for STR Enrichment Identity
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures involved in the analytical phase for Short
Tandem Repeat (STR) enrichment identity testing, specifically for
cells separated for CD3. The purpose is to ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for identifying and confirming genetic
profiles.
1. SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITY
This protocol applies to all staff performing STR enrichment and
identity testing in the laboratory. It is the responsibility of the
designated staff to ensure all procedures are followed accurately and
any deviations from the protocol are documented and corrected.
1. DEFINITIONS
CD3: A marker used to identify T-cells in a given sample. STR: Short
Tandem Repeats, repeated sequences of DNA used for identity
testing.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Prior to starting the procedure, ensure that all necessary
reagents, supplies, and equipment are available and
functioning properly.
2. Confirm that the specimen has been collected, received, and
accessioned correctly.
3. Separate the CD3+ cells using an appropriate cell separation
method (e.g., FACS sorting, magnetic bead separation).
B. DNA Extraction
1. Isolate genomic DNA from the separated CD3+ cells using a
validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Verify the DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
3. Document the concentration and purity results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
C. STR Enrichment and Amplification
1. Prepare the STR enrichment reaction mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Include the following components:
a. DNA template b. PCR buffer c. MgCl2 d. dNTPs e. Forward
and reverse primers specific to the STR loci f. Taq DNA
polymerase
2. Set up the PCR reaction in a thermal cycler with the following
cycling conditions: a. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes b.
30-35 cycles of: i. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds ii.
Annealing: 55-65°C (depending on primer Tm) for 30 seconds
iii. Extension: 72°C for 1 minute c. Final extension: 72°C for 10
minutes
3. Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each PCR
run.
D. PCR Product Verification
1. Run the amplified products on a 2% agarose gel to verify the
presence and size of the STR products.
2. Stain the gel with an appropriate nucleic acid stain (e.g.,
ethidium bromide or SYBR Safe) and visualize under UV light.
3. Document the gel image and verify that expected bands are
present in the controls and samples.
E. Capillary Electrophoresis
1. Prepare the capillary electrophoresis instrument according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Mix the PCR products with an internal size standard and a
formamide-based loading buffer.
3. Load the mixture into the capillary electrophoresis instrument.
4. Run the samples according to the instrument settings optimized
for STR analysis.
F. Data Analysis
1. Analyze the electropherogram generated by the capillary
electrophoresis using the instrument's software.
2. Compare the STR profiles of the samples to the known
reference profiles.
3. Document the analysis results in the LIS, including the allelic
data for each STR locus.
G. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify the STR profile results for accuracy and
completeness.
2. Generate a report summarizing the STR analysis, including: a.
Sample identification b. List of STR loci tested c. Allele
designations for each STR locus d. Interpretation of the results
3. Approve and release the report through the LIS to the
appropriate stakeholders.
H. Quality Control and Assurance
1. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of equipment used
in the STR testing process.
2. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to ensure accuracy.
3. Document any deviations from the SOP and take corrective
actions as necessary.
4. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
the quality of STR analysis.
