STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: STR Enrichment Identity
Testing, Separated for CD56
1. PURPOSE This protocol describes the procedure for STR (Short
Tandem Repeat) Enrichment Identity Testing specifically for samples
separated for CD56. This process ensures accurate and reliable
generation of STR profiles.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained
in STR analysis and working with samples undergoing CD56
separation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this procedure. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring
that staff are trained and that the protocol is adhered to.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood or bone marrow aspirate.
• Collection Tubes: EDTA (purple-top) tubes are recommended.
• Storage: Specimens must be processed within 48 hours of
collection and kept at 2-8°C until processed.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Magnetic CD56 MicroBeads
• STR Amplification Kit
• PCR Thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Magnetic separator
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• DNA extraction kit
• Electrophoresis unit
• Fluorescent dye and DNA size standards
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Label Sample Tubes: Label 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with
sample identifiers.
2. Cell Separation: a. Add 100 µL of sample to a 1.5 mL tube. b.
Add 20 µL of Magnetic CD56 MicroBeads to the sample. c. Mix
by vortexing gently and incubate at 4°C for 30 minutes. d. Place
the tube in a magnetic separator for 5 minutes. e. Carefully
remove the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with wash
buffer.
6.2 DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA: a. Use a DNA extraction kit to isolate DNA from
the CD56-enriched cells following the manufacturer's protocol.
b. Elute DNA in 100 µL of elution buffer.
2. Quantify DNA: a. Measure DNA concentration using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
6.3 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR Reaction: a. Prepare a master mix according to
the STR amplification kit instructions. b. In a PCR tube,
combine 10 µL of DNA sample with 15 µL of master mix.
2. Amplify DNA: a. Place the tubes in a PCR thermocycler. b. Run
the PCR program as specified in the STR amplification kit
protocol.
6.4 STR Analysis
1. Prepare for Electrophoresis: a. Mix 10 µL of PCR product with
0.5 µL of fluorescent dye and 0.5 µL of DNA size standards. b.
Heat the mixture at 95°C for 3 minutes and then place on ice.
2. Run Electrophoresis: a. Load samples into the wells of an
electrophoresis unit. b. Run electrophoresis according to the
equipment’s manufacturer instructions.
3. Analyze Results: a. Use STR analysis software to analyze the
electrophoresis results and generate STR profiles.
4. Document and Interpret Results: a. Document all STR profiles
electronically and manually in the laboratory records. b. Review
all results for accuracy and completeness. Verify the integrity
and quality of the generated STR profiles.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Calibration: Calibrate all equipment regularly according to
manufacturer specifications.
2. Controls: Include positive and negative controls in each batch
of samples to monitor the efficiency of DNA extraction, PCR
amplification, and electrophoresis.
3. Reagent Monitoring: Track lot numbers and expiration dates of
all reagents used.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verification: a. Cross-check STR profiles with patient/sample
identifiers.
2. Documentation: a. Record results in Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Communication: a. Communicate any unusual or unexpected
results to a supervisor immediately.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer's instructions for the STR amplification kit and
the DNA extraction kit for specific limitations related to reagent and
equipment performance.
