STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR STR
IDENTITY TESTING IN THE ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides guidelines for generating accurate and reliable
results for Short Tandem Repeats (STR) identity testing in the
analytical phase, ensuring conformity with established standards and
regulatory requirements.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel performing STR identity testing
are responsible for following this protocol. It is also the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisors to ensure adherence to this procedure
and to address any deficiencies or deviations.
3. DEFINITION
STR (Short Tandem Repeats): Repeating sequences of 2-6 base
pairs of DNA. The number of repeat sequences varies among
individuals, making STRs useful for identity testing.
4. SPECIMEN INPUT
Ensure that the DNA sample has already been extracted and
quantified as per the collection guidelines. The sample should be
appropriately labeled, accessioned, and stored under suitable
conditions prior to analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Genetic Analyzer (e.g., ABI PRISM)
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• STR multiplex kits (e.g., AmpFlSTR Identifiler Plus Kit)
• DNA Quantification Kit
• Thermal Cycler
• Gel Electrophoresis apparatus
• Capillary Electrophoresis apparatus
• Micropipettes and tips
• PCR plates or tubes
• Reaction buffers and diluents
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Amplification:
1. Setup of PCR Reaction:
◦ Prepare a PCR master mix according to the STR kit
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Dispense the required amount of master mix into each PCR
tube/well.
◦ Add the DNA sample to each well/tube. Include positive and
negative control samples in each run.
◦ Seal the PCR plate/tubes to prevent contamination.
2. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Load the sealed plate/tubes into the thermal cycler.
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the cycle conditions as
recommended in the STR kit manual (e.g., initial
denaturation, including denaturation, annealing, extension,
and final extension steps).
◦ Start the PCR amplification cycle.
B. Post-PCR Processing:
1. Preparation for Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare the capillary electrophoresis instrument as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Create a mixture of formamide and size standard, and add
to each well of a new PCR plate or tube.
◦ Add the PCR product to the corresponding wells.
2. Capillary Electrophoresis:
◦ Place the PCR plate/tubes in the electrophoresis instrument.
◦ Load the appropriate run module and size standard setting.
◦ Start the electrophoresis run.
◦ Ensure proper instrument calibration and verification before
running samples.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Initial Data Review:
◦ Once electrophoresis is completed, assess raw data for
each sample.
◦ Verify the presence and appropriate size calling of alleles.
◦ Detect artifacts such as stutters, pull-ups, and non-specific
peaks to ensure accurate interpretation.
2. Data Interpretation:
◦ Use analysis software (e.g., GeneMapper ID-X) for
genotyping.
◦ Compare the STR profiles generated from the sample with
control profiles.
◦ Ensure alleles are consistent with repeat motifs defined in
the STR allele database.
D. Quality Control:
1. Control Samples:
◦ Positive and negative control samples should be included in
each batch.
◦ Ensure the performance of control DNA samples meets
predefined criteria.
2. Reproducibility and Reliability:
◦ Repeat the analysis if the control samples do not meet the
expected results.
◦ Document all relevant quality control activities.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Verification Process:
◦ Verify the generated STR profiles by a secondary analyst or
supervisor.
◦ Any discrepancies should be resolved and documented
before reporting final results.
2. Result Compilation:
◦ Compile the STR profile data and include in the test report.
◦ Include method details, specimen details, and any pertinent
observations.
3. Submission:
◦ Submit the verified and compiled STR profile for record and
reporting in accordance with laboratory guidelines.
◦ Ensure result confidentiality and authorized access to the
reported data.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents, specimens, and equipment in compliance
with biosafety regulations.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS:
Maintain all documentation including raw data, PCR setup logs,
electrophoresis run logs, quality control records, and final result
reports as prescribed by the laboratory SOP and regulatory
guidelines.
