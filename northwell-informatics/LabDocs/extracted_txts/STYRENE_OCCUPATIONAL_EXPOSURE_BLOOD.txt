STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
ANALYTICAL PHASE FOR: STYRENE, OCCUPATIONAL
EXPOSURE, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and
quantification of Styrene in blood samples collected for occupational
exposure assessment. The purpose is to ensure reliable and
accurate results for the presence and concentration of Styrene in
blood, which can then be utilized for occupational health
assessments and risk management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any inconsistencies or issues in the analysis process and
promptly report them to their supervisor. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring the procedure is followed correctly and that any
necessary corrective actions are taken.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimens:
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL whole blood, collected in EDTA tubes
or equivalent.
• Stability: Samples should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) and
analyzed within 7 days of collection. If longer storage is
necessary, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples that are hemolyzed
• Samples that are not properly labeled with collection date and
time
• Samples that have been stored at ambient temperature for more
than 24 hours
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system
• Vials and caps suitable for GC-MS
• Styrene standard solutions
• Internal standard solutions (e.g., deuterated styrene)
• Solvents such as methanol, water (HPLC grade)
• Extraction media and solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Verify the sample integrity and labeling.
2. Bring frozen samples to room temperature and mix gently.
3. Centrifuge whole blood at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
plasma if necessary.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Accurately pipette 1 mL of blood/plasma into a clean vial.
2. Add 100 µL of internal standard solution to each vial.
3. Vortex mix each vial for 30 seconds.
4. Perform solid-phase extraction using SPE cartridges:
◦ Precondition cartridge with methanol (1 mL) and water (1
mL).
◦ Load the sample onto the cartridge.
◦ Wash with water (1 mL) and dry under vacuum.
◦ Elute Styrene with methanol (1 mL) into a GC-MS vial.
5. Evaporate the elution solvent under nitrogen to dryness.
6. Reconstitute the residue in 100 µL of methanol.
C. GC-MS Analysis:
1. Prepare the GC-MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Inject 1 µL of sample extract into the GC-MS.
3. Analyze under the following conditions:
◦ Column: HP-5ms (or equivalently suited) column, 30 m x
0.25 mm x 0.25 µm.
◦ Carrier gas: Helium, flow rate 1.0 mL/min.
◦ Oven temperature program:
▪ Initial temperature: 40°C, hold for 2 min.
▪ Ramp up to 250°C at 10°C/min.
▪ Final hold at 250°C for 10 min.
◦ MS settings: Electron ionization mode, scan range 35-350
m/z.
4. Identify and quantify Styrene using selected ion monitoring
(SIM) mode, using the m/z 104, 78, 103 ions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples (negative and positive controls)
with each batch of samples to ensure accuracy and
consistency.
2. Internal standard peak area should be monitored to confirm
extraction and injection consistency.
3. Acceptable limits for control samples must be within ±2
standard deviations of the mean.
7. CALCULATIONS
1. Calculate the concentration of Styrene in blood using the
response ratio of Styrene to the internal standard.
2. Utilize calibration curves generated from the standard solutions
to determine the concentration of Styrene in test samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Report Styrene concentrations in µg/L (micrograms per liter).
3. Flag any results that fall outside established occupational
exposure limits for Styrene.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Review Styrene analysis limitations based on interference, method
sensitivity, and detection limits as noted in the GC-MS system
documentation.
