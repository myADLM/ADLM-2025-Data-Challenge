Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Process for ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS ANTIBODY,
IgG AND IgM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedures for the detection and
quantification of St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) virus-specific IgG
and IgM antibodies in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
timely results in accordance with laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE: This SOP applies to all medical laboratory scientists
working in the serology department of the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to perform the assay, validate results, and
ensure that all quality control measures are met in accordance
with this protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred sample type: Serum
• Volume required: Minimum 1 mL of serum
• Specimen stability:
◦ At room temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Up to 1 year
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
5.1 EQUIPMENT:
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Plate washer
• ELISA reader (with an appropriate filter)
• Timer
5.2 REAGENTS:
• St. Louis Encephalitis Virus IgG and IgM ELISA kit
• Wash buffer solution
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Quality control samples (Positive and Negative controls)
Storage requirements:
• Store ELISA kits and quality control materials as per the
manufacturer’s instructions, usually at 2-8°C.
1. PROCEDURE:
6.1 PREPARATION:
• Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before starting the assay.
• Label all necessary materials, including assay plates, samples,
controls, and reagents.
• Prepare wash buffer and other reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
6.2 ASSAY PROCEDURE:
1. Add 100 µL of sample, positive control, and negative control to
the respective wells according to the assay layout.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Wash the plate 5 times with the wash buffer to remove unbound
antibodies.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate solution to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the plate 5 times with the wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
9. Add 100 µL of the stop solution to each well to stop the
enzymatic reaction.
10. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader within
30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
6.3 CALCULATIONS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION: Calculate
the results by creating a standard curve using the absorbance values
from the controls. Compare the sample absorbances to the standard
curve to determine the concentration of IgG and IgM antibodies in
each sample.
Interpret the results according to the kit’s reference ranges indicating
a negative, equivocal, or positive result for St. Louis Encephalitis
antibodies:
• Negative: Absorbance lower than the cut-off value
• Equivocal: Absorbance close to the cut-off value (interpret with
caution and consider repeat testing)
• Positive: Absorbance higher than the cut-off value
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control tests with each assay run, including both
positive and negative controls to validate the assay.
• Record all quality control results and ensure they fall within the
established ranges before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify for accuracy.
• Flag and review any results that fall outside the acceptable limits
or are marked as equivocal for further evaluation or repeat testing
as deemed necessary.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with the
assay.
• Cross-reactions with other flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile Virus,
Dengue Virus) might occur; additional confirmatory testing may be
needed.
• Early infection may not produce detectable levels of antibodies.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the St. Louis Encephalitis Virus
IgG and IgM ELISA kit.
• Best practice guidelines for enzyme immunoassays in diagnostic
labs.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all relevant data, including sample identification, results,
and quality control measures. Maintain records as regulated by
laboratory policies and regulatory requirements.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
timely detection and quantification of St. Louis Encephalitis virus-
specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum samples.
