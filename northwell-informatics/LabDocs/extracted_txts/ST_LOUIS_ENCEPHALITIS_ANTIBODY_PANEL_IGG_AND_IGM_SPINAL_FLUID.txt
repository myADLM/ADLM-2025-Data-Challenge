Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS ANTIBODY
PANEL, IGG AND IGM, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE This SOP describes the procedure to test for St.
Louis Encephalitis Virus (SLEV) antibodies (IgG and IgM) in
spinal fluid specimens. The objective is to ensure accurate and
reliable results for the detection of SLEV antibodies, which are
vital for the diagnosis of St. Louis Encephalitis.
2. SCOPE The procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
trained in serologic and immunoassay testing and involved in
the analysis of spinal fluid for St. Louis Encephalitis Virus
antibodies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analytical phase of the
procedure and record all necessary data.
• Supervisors: Review results and ensure all documentation is
complete and accurate.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor and maintain logs for Quality
Control (QC) checks and any corrective actions taken.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Spinal Fluid
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Stability: Keep refrigerated between 2-8°C if not tested
immediately. Specimens should be tested within 7 days of
collection. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• Pipettes (adjustable)
• Test tubes and racks
• Vortex mixer
• Timers
• Micropipette tips (sterile, disposable)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENTS
• SLEV IgG and IgM ELISA Kits
◦ Store as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Do not use reagents beyond their expiration date.
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
• Control Sera (Negative and Positive Controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Equipment Calibration: Ensure ELISA Reader and Washer
are calibrated according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Reagents: Bring all reagents and specimens to room
temperature (15-30°C) before use. Mix all reagents gently
before use.
3. Controls: Include both Positive and Negative controls in each
run.
B. Testing Procedure
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Transfer 100 µL of each control, standard, and specimen to
the designated wells in the ELISA plate.
◦ The specimen should be tested in duplicate to ensure
accuracy.
2. Antibody Binding:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Wash the plate with the wash buffer three times to remove
unbound antibodies.
3. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate (as specified by the kit) to
each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate with the wash buffer three times.
4. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15-30 minutes,
avoiding direct light.
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to cease the
reaction.
◦ The color changes immediately; tap the plate gently to mix.
C. Reading Results
1. Measurement:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader set to 450 nm with a reference wavelength of
620-650 nm.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the mean OD values for each duplicate.
◦ Compare the sample OD with the control OD to determine
the presence and concentration of IgG and IgM antibodies
against SLEV.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both Positive and Negative Controls with each batch of
specimens.
• Ensure that QC results fall within the acceptable range provided
by the reagent manufacturer. If QC fails, investigate and resolve
the issue before proceeding with the test run.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer results from the ELISA reader to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Each result must be reviewed by a qualified technologist and
verified by the supervisor.
• Results should be reported in terms of antibody presence
(positive or negative) and, if applicable, concentration (titre level).
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive Result: Indication of IgG and/or IgM antibodies against
SLEV.
• Negative Result: No IgG and/or IgM antibodies detected against
SLEV.
• Borderline/Equivocal Result: Retest specimen; if consistently
borderline, additional clinical correlation and/or alternative
diagnostic methods may be needed.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results appear inconsistent or controls fall outside acceptable
ranges, revisit the preparation, assay setup, and equipment
calibration steps.
• Record any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken in the laboratory log.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgG and IgM Negative Control: Should fall below the
manufacturer’s specified threshold.
• IgG and IgM Positive Control: Should fall above the
manufacturer’s specified threshold.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's ELISA Kit Insert
• Standard laboratory guidelines and manuals for serologic testing
1. REVISIONS
• This procedure will be reviewed annually or as needed when
updates or modifications to reagents, equipment, or methods are
required.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure standardized
and reliable testing for St. Louis Encephalitis Virus antibodies in
spinal fluid specimens.
