Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SUCCINYLACETONE, BLOOD SPOT
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure the accurate and timely
determination of succinylacetone levels in dried blood spot
specimens, following proper laboratory methods and standards. The
aim is to generate reliable results to support diagnostic and clinical
decision-making.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical testing of succinylacetone on dried blood spot specimens
and ensuring quality control throughout the process. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify and report any
deficiencies or issues encountered during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Dried blood spot on filter paper Collection Method:
Blood spots collected via heel prick or fingerstick onto appropriate
filter paper Acceptable Specimen: Dried blood spots properly labeled
with patient information, collection date, and time Unacceptable
Specimen: Blood spots with insufficient volume, contamination,
improper labeling, or exceeding stability timeframe
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Mass Spectrometer (e.g., LC-MS/MS)
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes
• Refrigerator/Freezer (for reagent storage)
Reagents:
• Calibration Standards for Succinylacetone
• Quality Control Materials (high, medium, low)
• Extraction Solvent (e.g., methanol)
• Mobile Phase Solvent (e.g., acetonitrile, water with 0.1% formic
acid)
• Reagent-grade water
Supplies:
• Filter paper (appropriate for blood spot collection)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Sample trays
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coats
• Safety eyewear
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Punch out a 3-mm disc from the dried blood spot specimen
using a designated puncher.
2. Place the punched disc into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add 150 µL of extraction solvent (e.g., methanol) to the tube.
4. Mix the tube using a vortex mixer for 30 seconds.
5. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Centrifuge the tube at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the
extract.
Instrument Calibration and Setup:
1. Prepare calibration standards for succinylacetone according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Run calibration standards through the mass spectrometer to
generate the calibration curve.
3. Set up the mass spectrometer with the appropriate mobile
phase solvents and optimization parameters (e.g., column
temperature, flow rate).
Sample Analysis:
1. Load extracted samples onto the mass spectrometer tray.
2. Run the prepared samples through the mass spectrometer
using the established method.
3. Record chromatograms and peak areas for succinylacetone.
Quality Control:
1. Perform analysis of quality control materials (high, medium,
low) at the beginning, middle, and end of each batch of
specimens.
2. Ensure quality control results are within acceptable limits. If not,
troubleshoot and make necessary adjustments before
proceeding with test analysis.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review chromatograms and peak areas to ensure accurate
identification and quantification of succinylacetone.
5. Calculate succinylacetone levels in each specimen using the
calibration curve.
6. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
7. Verify and review results for accuracy and completeness.
8. Report finalized results according to site-specific guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal range for succinylacetone: < 0.1 µmol/L (or as specified in
clinical guidelines)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the package insert or manufacturer's guidelines for specific
limitations related to individual reagent pads and instrumentation.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
2. Calibrate and maintain instruments according to manufacturer
instructions and laboratory standards.
3. Regularly review and validate the performance of instruments
and reagents.
4. Conduct periodic proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons to ensure analytical accuracy.
