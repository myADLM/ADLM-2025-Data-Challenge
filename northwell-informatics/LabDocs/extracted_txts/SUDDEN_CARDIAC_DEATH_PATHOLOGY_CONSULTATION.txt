Sudden Cardiac Death Pathology Consultation Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for efficient
and accurate histologic and molecular analysis for consultation in
cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD). This protocol ensures
comprehensive analysis for pathology consultation to aid in
determining the cause of death.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This protocol is to be followed by all pathology laboratory personnel,
including but not limited to pathologists, pathology assistants,
histotechnologists, and molecular diagnostic technologists.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Heart Tissue: Autopsy specimens: Full-thickness sections from
representative areas, including:
◦ Left Ventricle (anterior and posterior walls)
◦ Right Ventricle (anterior and posterior walls)
◦ Interventricular septum
◦ Left and right atria
◦ Coronary arteries (left main, left anterior descending, left
circumflex, right coronary artery)
• Ancillary Samples: Blood, splenic and other necessary tissue for
ancillary studies
1. PROCEDURE
A. Gross Examination
• Perform a gross examination of heart tissues, noting any
macroscopic abnormalities.
• Take representative full-thickness sections from critical regions as
defined above.
• Document the presence of myocardial hypertrophy, dilation, and
any other gross pathology.
B. Histologic Examination
• Fix tissue in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24-48 hours
prior to processing.
• Process tissues using standard histologic processing techniques.
• Embed tissue in paraffin blocks, section at 4-5 µm, and stain with
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).
• Additional special stains (e.g., Masson’s Trichrome for fibrosis,
Congo Red for amyloid) may be employed as needed based on
preliminary findings.
C. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
• Perform immunohistochemical staining as warranted, particularly
for markers of myocarditis (e.g., CD3, CD68), cardiomyopathy
(e.g., desmin, myosin), and other relevant markers.
D. Molecular Analysis
• Ensure paraffin blocks are available for molecular studies such as
DNA extraction.
• Target gene panels or whole exome sequencing may be
performed to identify mutations relevant to cardiomyopathies or
arrhythmias using next-generation sequencing (NGS).
• Confirm any identified genetic variants through Sanger
sequencing if required.
E. Ancillary Studies
• Conduct toxicology screens on ancillary samples to rule out
substances contributing to SCD.
• Perform a full panel of biochemical analyses if deemed necessary,
including assessments for electrolyte disturbances, metabolic
disorders and other relevant conditions.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control measures should be strictly adhered to in all steps,
with proper calibration and validation of instruments.
• Internal Quality Assurance procedures should include regular
participation in external proficiency testing.
• Each batch of immune staining and molecular analysis should
include positive and negative controls.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Pathologic findings should be meticulously recorded, detailing
gross, histologic, immunohistochemical and molecular features.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by an experienced
pathologist.
• Summarize findings into a comprehensive report, including any
ancillary studies performed. Provide a definitive cause of death
when identifiable.
• Reports should be reviewed for accuracy and completeness
before final submission.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Utilize relevant reference intervals for both histologic and
molecular analyses as provided by the respective manufacturers
and guidelines from professional bodies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Be aware of the limitations of histologic and molecular methods,
including potential for false positive/negative results in IHC stains
and molecular analysis.
1. RECORD-KEEPING
• Ensure all raw data, including histologic slides, molecular data,
and final reports are adequately documented and securely stored.
• Maintain chain-of-custody records for all specimens.
1. REFERENCES
Consult appropriate literature, manuals, and guidelines relevant to
sudden cardiac death pathology for additional details. Maintain
updated access to resources such as:
• WHO guidelines on cardiac pathology.
• CAP guidelines for autopsy practices.
• Relevant peer-reviewed journals for contemporary methods and
case studies.
By adhering to this protocol, our laboratory aims to deliver precise
and comprehensive diagnostic information that will assist in the
accurate determination of sudden cardiac death causes, enhancing
patient care and contributing to preventative measures.
