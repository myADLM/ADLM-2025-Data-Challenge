1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for SUGARBEET SEED Immunoglobulin E (IGE)
in serum specimens. This includes sample preparation, analysis, and
results documentation ensuring accuracy and reliability of laboratory
findings.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed or lipemic samples,
samples without proper labeling, and clotted samples are
unacceptable.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP 100/250/100E or Phadia 250/500 instruments
• Anti-IgE coated wells or similar substrates
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents specific to the assay
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Refrigerator (2–8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
• Computer with Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the serum specimen is properly labeled and meets the
requirements outlined in section 2.
2. Centrifuge the serum sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum from the cellular components.
3. Transfer the supernatant serum to a clean, appropriately
labeled tube.
B. Analysis
1. Preparation of the Assay:
◦ Prepare the assay plate or wells according to the
manufacturer's guidelines, ensuring all reagents, calibrators,
and controls are at room temperature.
◦ Load the serum sample into the designated wells using
micropipettes. Avoid touching the sides of the wells with the
pipette tip.
◦ Add the anti-IgE substrate and any other necessary
reagents as outlined in the kit's instructions.
2. Incubation
◦ Incubate the plate as directed in the package insert, typically
at room temperature for 1-2 hours, ensuring optimal binding.
3. Washing and Detection
◦ After incubation, wash the wells thoroughly using the
recommended wash solution to remove any unbound
substances.
◦ Apply the detection reagent (often a labeled anti-IgE) and
incubate further as specified.
4. Measurement
◦ Measure the optical density using a spectrophotometer or a
similar instrument calibrated to the appropriate wavelength.
◦ Use the calibrators to generate a standard curve and
quantify the IgE levels present in the serum samples.
C. Documentation and Reporting
1. Record the date, time, and initials of the performing staff
member on the documentation log.
2. Enter the measured values into the LIS. Verify the results
against set quality control standards.
3. If the sample results indicate levels outside the normal
reference range, proceed with appropriate corrective actions,
such as repeating the test, reviewing the procedure steps, or
notifying the supervising lab personnel.
4. Label critical results with corresponding comments, following
the site-specific reporting guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze controls alongside the patient samples. Document control
performance each run.
• If controls do not meet acceptable ranges, troubleshoot following
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Perform instrument calibration using the provided calibrators
routinely.
• Compare inter-laboratory controls monthly to ensure consistency.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Utilize reference intervals provided in the assay kit insert (typically
specific to the instruments used). Standard reference ranges for
serum IgE may vary depending on patient age, sex, and other
factors.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ImmunoCAP 100/250/100E and Phadia systems
product inserts for detailed limitations pertaining to reagent
sensitivity, specificity, interference factors, and cross-reactivity.
8. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Results significantly outside of the reference range, indicating
severe allergic reactions or other critical conditions, must be
verified and flagged in the LIS for immediate review.
• Follow all pertinent laboratory protocols for handling critical
results, ensuring swift communication with the relevant healthcare
provider.

10. REVIEW
• This protocol is to be reviewed annually by designated
supervisory laboratory personnel to ensure compliance with all
current regulations and technological advancements.
