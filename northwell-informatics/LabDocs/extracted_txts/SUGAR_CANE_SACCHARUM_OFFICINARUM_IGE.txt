Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Sugar Cane (Saccharum Officinarum) IgE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
testing for IgE antibodies specific to Sugar Cane (Saccharum
Officinarum) in patient serum samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to
perform and document all steps in the IgE testing procedure
according to this SOP. All staff must ensure the accuracy and
reliability of test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
◦ 5 mL venous blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube.
◦ Serum should be separated within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens not labeled correctly with patient information.
◦ Specimens not stored or transported under proper
conditions (e.g., room temperature for more than 24 hours
without proper storage).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit specific
for Sugar Cane (Saccharum Officinarum) IgE.
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm.
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips.
◦ Incubator set at 37°C.
◦ Distilled water.
◦ Wash buffer.
◦ Sample diluent.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Calibration standards and quality control material.
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
2. Mix samples gently by inverting the tubes several times.
3. Prepare standards, controls, and patient samples
according to the ELISA kit instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples
into the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per
well, ensuring complete removal of liquid after each wash.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and
incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
5. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per
well.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and
incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
7. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
8. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm
using a microplate reader.
5. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
Calculation:
1. Plot the standard curve using the OD values of the
standards.
2. Determine the concentration of Sugar Cane IgE in patient
samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
3. Use appropriate software or manual calculation methods
as described in the ELISA kit instructions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control materials with each batch of samples.
◦ Acceptable ranges for controls are established by the
manufacturer.
◦ Document any deviations and repeat test runs if necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results for accuracy before releasing.
◦ Report critical values immediately to the appropriate
healthcare provider as per the laboratory’s policies.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for Sugar Cane IgE levels should be
provided with the ELISA kit and verified periodically against
internal controls and external proficiency testing results.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the ELISA kit insert for detailed information on
method limitations, cross-reactivity, and potential
interference factors.
◦ Interpret results in conjunction with clinical findings and
other diagnostic tests.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If control values are out of range, recheck reagent
preparation, incubation times, and plate washing steps.
◦ Ensure that all reagents are not expired and have been
stored correctly.
◦ Repeat the assay if necessary.
