Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Sulfamethoxazole, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for the
quantitative determination of Sulfamethoxazole in serum samples.
This SOP ensures accurate, precise, and reliable results are
reported.
2. RESPONSIBILITY

5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
• Prepare the mobile phase by mixing acetonitrile and water with
0.1% triethylamine in a 70:30 volume ratio. Filter and degas the
mixture before use.
• Prepare Sulfamethoxazole calibration standards by serially
diluting the stock solution with serum to cover the therapeutic
range.
B. Equipment Setup
• Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Condition the HPLC column with the mobile phase.
• Verify the system suitability by running a calibration standard.
Ensure the system is providing accurate and reproducible results
before proceeding.
C. Specimen Processing
1. Centrifuge the collected serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the serum from the clot.
2. Transfer the clear serum into labeled sample vials avoiding any
solid particulates.
3. If necessary, dilute the serum sample with a known volume of
diluent for appropriate concentration.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load the processed serum sample into the HPLC system.
2. Inject a controlled volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the serum sample into
the HPLC.
3. Run the HPLC using the pre-determined method parameters
(e.g., flow rate, column temperature).
4. Detect Sulfamethoxazole at the recommended wavelength
using a UV detector.
E. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Run the calibration standards at the beginning of each batch to
construct a calibration curve.
2. Include quality control samples (both low and high
concentration) in each analytical batch.
3. Ensure the calibration curve and QC samples fall within
acceptable ranges before analyzing the patient samples.
F. Data Analysis
1. Integrate the peaks obtained from the HPLC chromatogram.
2. Compare the retention times of Sulfamethoxazole in the sample
with standards.
3. Calculate the concentration of Sulfamethoxazole in the serum
sample using the calibration curve.
G. Reporting and Documentation
1. Review the results for any discrepancies.
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Ensure all control and patient results are recorded in the
appropriate logs with date, time, and technologist's initials.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the instrument’s user manual for limitations. Ensure that
samples do not have interfering substances that may affect accuracy.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to site-specific guidelines for therapeutic ranges and critical
values.
