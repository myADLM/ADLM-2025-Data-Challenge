STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Protocol for the Determination of Sulfate in 24-Hour
Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical process for the measurement of sulfate
concentration in 24-hour urine samples within the laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for ensuring that all steps of
the procedure are followed accurately.
• Designated staff are responsible for the maintenance and
calibration of relevant equipment and instruments.
1. DEFINITIONS
Sulfate: An ion commonly found in urine, which can be indicative of
various metabolic and renal functions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• 24-hour urine collection
Specimen Volume:
• A minimum of 50 mL of the total 24-hour urine collection should
be provided for analysis.
Specimen Storage:
• Store the 24-hour urine collection container at 2-8°C during and
after the collection period until analysis.
Specimen Stability:
• Urine samples are stable at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours post-
collection.
• If longer storage is required, aliquot the sample and store at
-20°C.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Sulfate standard solutions
• Ion chromatography (IC) or turbidimetric analysis reagents
• Deionized water
• Calibrating solutions
• Quality control materials (commercially available urine-based QC
material)
1. EQUIPMENT
• Ion chromatography (IC) system or spectrophotometer setup for
turbidimetric analysis
• 24-hour urine collection containers
• Pipettes and tips
• Volumetric flasks
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Commercial urine-based QC material (2 levels: high and low)
Storage:
• Store QC material at 2-8°C, stable until the stated expiration date.
To Use:
• Allow QC material to come to room temperature before use. Mix
thoroughly before each run.
Procedure:
• Implement quality control with each analytical run, including
calibration verification, using both high and low control levels.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Measure the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection and
record it.
3. Aliquot a minimum of 50 mL of the urine sample in a properly
labeled container for analysis.
Analytical Procedure Using Ion Chromatography:
1. Calibrate the ion chromatograph using sulfate standard
solutions and verifying linearity.
2. Inject a small volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the urine sample into the
ion chromatograph.
3. Run the sample through the chromatograph under conditions
optimized for sulfate analysis.
4. Record the chromatogram and quantify the sulfate
concentration by comparing against the standards.
5. Confirm the accuracy and precision of the result by running QC
materials.
Alternative Analytical Procedure Using Turbidimetric Analysis:
1. Prepare the turbidimetric reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Mix a known volume (e.g., 10 mL) of the urine sample with the
turbidimetric reagent.
3. Allow the mixture to react for the specified time to form a
precipitate that correlates with sulfate concentration.
4. Measure the absorbance of the resulting mixture using a
spectrophotometer set to the appropriate wavelength (e.g., 420
nm).
5. Calculate the sulfate concentration from a calibration curve
prepared using sulfate standard solutions.
6. Verify the results by analyzing QC materials and ensuring
results are within acceptable limits.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Typical reference range (may vary by laboratory): 20-30 mmol/24
hours
Reporting:
• Provide results in mmol/24 hours, ensuring that the total 24-hour
urine volume is reported alongside the concentration for proper
interpretation.
• Review and verify all results before reporting them in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interfering substances (e.g., medications, contaminants) in the
urine may affect results.
• Incorrect sample storage or handling may compromise specimen
integrity.
