Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Sulfatide Antibody
Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
testing of Sulfatide Antibodies in patient specimens. This includes
outlining the necessary steps and protocols to ensure accurate,
reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the Sulfatide Antibody test following the procedure outlined
here. All laboratory personnel must ensure adherence to this
protocol, including running necessary quality control and proper
documentation of the results.
3. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Serum: Preferably collected in a red-top or serum-separator tube
(SST).
• Plasma: Collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes, but not
preferred.
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be conducted within 48
hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at appropriate
wavelengths
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes (single and multichannel)
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37ºC)
Reagents:
• Sulfatide antibody ELISA kit
◦ Coated microtiter plate with sulfatide antigen
◦ Positive and negative control sera
◦ Washing buffer
◦ Dilution buffer
◦ Blocking buffer
◦ Secondary antibody conjugate (horseradish peroxidase-
labeled)
◦ Substrate solution (TMB)
◦ Stop solution (H2SO4 or equivalent)
5. PROCEDURE
Reagent Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare washing buffer and dilution buffer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Mix all reagents thoroughly by gentle inversion before use.
Avoid foaming.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum or plasma samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
2. Dilute serum/plasma samples 1:100 in dilution buffer (e.g., 10
µL of sample + 990 µL dilution buffer).
Assay Procedure:
1. Wash the microtiter plate 3 times with washing buffer.
2. Add 100 µL of diluted patient samples, positive control, and
negative control to designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plate 3 times with washing buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of secondary antibody conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate 3 times with washing buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well and incubate
at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 15 minutes using a
microplate reader.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative control sera with each batch of patient
samples to ensure the assay is performing correctly.
• If control results are outside the established control range, do not
report patient results and investigate the cause of the failure.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the mean absorbance values for patient samples,
positive control, and negative control.
• Subtract the mean absorbance of the negative control from each
sample and control absorbance (background correction).
• Compare patient sample absorbance to control values to
determine the presence or absence of sulfatide antibodies.
• Report results as positive or negative based on the cutoff values
established by the manufacturer.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals and cutoff values will be established based
on the manufacturer's instructions and validated during assay
validation.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions for potential assay
limitations, including cross-reactivity and interfering substances.
