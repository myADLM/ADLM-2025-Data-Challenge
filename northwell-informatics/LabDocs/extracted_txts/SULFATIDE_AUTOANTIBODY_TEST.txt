Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Sulfatide Autoantibody Test
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps involved in performing the Sulfatide Autoantibody
Test, ensuring accurate and reliable results are generated in
compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
procedure meticulously, document all required information, and report
any discrepancies or issues to a supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
The Sulfatide Autoantibody Test is an immunological assay aimed at
detecting the presence of autoantibodies directed against sulfatides
in patient serum samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Microplate washer
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Sulfatide-coated microplate
• Wash buffer
• Blocking buffer
• Patient Serum samples
• Secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme (HRP – Horseradish
Peroxidase)
• Substrate solution (TMB – Tetramethylbenzidine)
• Stop solution (1N H2SO4 or equivalent)
Supplies:
• Micropipettes and tips (range of volumes)
• Multichannel pipette
• 96-well plates
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Deionized or distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Initialization:
1. Pre-analytical Checks:
◦ Confirm that the Sulfatide Autoantibody Test kit’s expiry date
is not exceeded.
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
◦ Prepare the Sulfatide-coated microplate by bringing it to
room temperature.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw patient serum samples if stored frozen.
◦ Mix samples thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
◦ Centrifuge samples for 10 minutes at 2000-3000 RPM to
remove any particulate matter.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Coating:
◦ If the microplate is not pre-coated, coat the wells with
sulfatide antigen at a concentration specified by the
manufacturer.
◦ Incubate overnight at 4°C or for 2 hours at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plates 3 times with wash buffer using the
microplate washer.
2. Blocking:
◦ Add blocking buffer to each well.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature to block any non-
specific binding sites.
◦ Wash plates 3 times with wash buffer.
3. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted patient serum (1:100 in blocking
buffer) to each well.
◦ Also set up positive and negative control wells as per kit
instructions.
◦ Incubate for 1.5 hours at 37°C.
4. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Wash plates 5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
serum.
◦ Add 100 µL of secondary antibody (HRP-conjugate) diluted
in blocking buffer to each well.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
◦ Wash plates 5 times with wash buffer.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark for the time specified by the reagent
manufacturer (usually 5-20 minutes).
◦ Monitor color development; a blue color indicates a positive
reaction.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ The color should immediately change from blue to yellow.
C. Measurement and Result Generation:
1. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm within 30
minutes of adding the stop solution using the microplate
reader.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Subtract the average optical density (O.D.) of the negative
control wells from the O.D. of all sample wells.
◦ Calculate the cut-off value based on the O.D. values of the
positive controls as per the kit instructions.
1. RESULT REPORTING
• Results are reported as positive or negative for Sulfatide
Autoantibody presence based on comparison with the cut-off
value.
• Ensure all recorded data, including O.D. values and controls, are
saved and documented properly.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before being sent to the clinician.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
External QC:
• Participate in proficiency testing as available.
• Follow manufacturer guidelines and inter-laboratory comparison
when possible.
