Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Sulfonylurea Screen,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the analytical phase to
ensure reliable and accurate quantitative measurement of
sulfonylurea levels in urine specimens using validated methods in the
laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in the
preparation, analysis, and reporting of sulfonylurea screen test
results in urine specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP as described. It is the duty of the supervisor to ensure that
laboratory staff members are trained and comply with this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector or Mass spectrometer
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Urine sample containers
• Reagent bottles
• Calibration standards for sulfonylureas
• Quality control (QC) samples
5. REAGENTS
• Methanol
• Acetonitrile
• Deionized water
• Phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
• Sulfonylurea standards (glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride, etc.)
• Internal standard (as applicable)
6. SPECIMEN
• Preferred: 10-20 mL of freshly-collected, clean-catch urine
specimen.
• Acceptable: Urine sample collected within 24 hours, stored at
2-8°C and delivered to the laboratory immediately.
• Unacceptable: Urine specimens that are contaminated,
improperly labeled, or delivered beyond the 24-hour window
without refrigeration.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Sample Preparation
1. Pre-Analysis Check
◦ Verify that the patient's urine specimen is properly labeled
with the correct identification number.
◦ Inspect the specimen for any signs of contamination or
improper collection.
2. Centrifugation
◦ Centrifuge each urine specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to clean labeled tubes for analysis.
3. Sample Aliquot
◦ Pipette 1 mL of the urine supernatant into a clean vial.
7.2 Preparation of Calibration Standards
1. Prepare a series of sulfonylurea calibration standards in
phosphate buffer at the required concentrations (e.g., 0.1, 0.5,
1, 5, 10 µg/mL).
7.3 Preparation of Quality Control (QC) Samples
1. Prepare QC samples including at least one low, one medium,
and one high concentration appropriate for the assay range.
7.4 Analytical Procedure
Using HPLC with UV Detector
1. Column Conditioning
◦ Equilibrate the HPLC column with mobile phase at a flow
rate recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Mobile phase composition: Methanol:Water (70:30 ratio)
with 0.1% phosphate buffer.
2. Sample Injection
◦ Inject 20 µL of each standard, QC sample, and urine
specimen into the HPLC system.
◦ Run an analytical blank to ensure cleanliness of the column
and system.
3. Chromatographic Conditions
◦ Column temperature: 35°C
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Detection wavelength: 235 nm
4. Run Sequence
◦ Start with calibration standards, followed by QC samples,
and finally urine specimens.
◦ After every 10 samples, run a QC sample to monitor system
performance.
5. Data Analysis
◦ Compare the peak areas of the samples to the calibration
curve to quantify sulfonylurea concentration in urine
specimens.
Using Mass Spectrometry
1. Column Conditioning
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for equilibration and
conditioning of the system.
2. Sample Injection
◦ Prepare samples and controls in similar manner as the
HPLC method.
◦ Inject 10 µL of each standard, QC sample, and urine
specimen into the mass spectrometer.
3. Chromatographic and Spectrometric Conditions
◦ Use LC-MS/MS settings as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Ensure proper ionization and fragmentation settings for
desired parent and daughter ions of sulfonylureas.
4. Run Sequence
Follow the same steps as in HPLC methodology for maintaining
sequence and QC checks.
5. Data Analysis
◦ Use software to analyze and determine sulfonylurea
concentrations. Verify with the calibration data.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure each batch run includes calibration standards and QC
samples.
• Evaluate QC samples against established criteria for acceptance.
• If QC fails, troubleshoot and repeat analysis.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed for integrity and plausibility.
• Sulfonylurea levels will be reported as µg/mL or according to site-
specific guidelines.
• Any suspicious or unusual results should be investigated further
before reporting.
• Include critical values and notify the appropriate healthcare
personnel immediately.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Dependent on the sulfonylurea being tested; for most compounds:
• Therapeutic concentration: <2 µg/mL
• Toxic concentration: >2 µg/mL
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Matrix effects may affect the accuracy of results.
• Ensure proper sample, standard, and QC storage.
• Detectability is limited by instrumentation sensitivity and
specificity.
