Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results of SUNFLOWER and IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps required for the
precise and accurate analytical phase of generating results for
SUNFLOWER and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum. This is crucial
for the clinical interpretation of immunoassays for allergy testing and
other clinical significance.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform the assay tests on SUNFLOWER and IgE,
Serum.
3. DEFINITIONS
• SUNFLOWER: Refers to a specific allergen being tested in the
immunoassay for allergen-specific IgE.
• IgE, Serum: A blood test used to quantify the concentration of
Immunoglobulin E antibodies in the serum, which can be
indicative of allergic reactions and conditions.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to adhere to
this protocol and document all actions taken during the testing
process. Staff must ensure all quality control measures are executed
and results are accurately reported.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., CAP System, ImmunoCAP)
• Calibrators
• Quality Control Materials (Positive and Negative Controls)
• Assay Reagents specific for SUNFLOWER and Total IgE
• Patient Serum Samples
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Reaction Vessels/Cuvettes
• Timer
• Computer and Laboratory Information System (LIS)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Checks
1. Verify that the analyzer is calibrated and has passed all quality
control checks.
2. Ensure that reagents are within their expiry dates and have
been stored correctly.
3. Bring all reagents and patient samples to room temperature
prior to analysis.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the patient serum samples at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
2. If automated systems permit direct sample loading, ensure that
any manual dilutions specified by manufacturer instructions are
performed precisely.
3. Label reaction vessels/cuvettes appropriately and load them
into the analyzer as per manufacturer guidelines.
C. Running the Assay
1. For SUNFLOWER Specific IgE:
◦ Load the SUNFLOWER allergen-specific reagent into the
appropriate reagent slots.
◦ Program the analyzer for the SUNFLOWER IgE test,
selecting the appropriate test menu.
◦ Add the patient serum samples to the reaction vessels/
cuvettes as per analyzer instructions.
◦ Ensure the analyzer dilutions and processing as stipulated
in the package insert.
2. For Total IgE:
◦ Load the Total IgE reagent into the reagent slots.
◦ Program the analyzer for the Total IgE test, selecting the
appropriate test menu.
◦ Add the patient serum samples to the reaction vessels/
cuvettes as per analyzer instructions.
◦ Ensure adherence to the pipetting instructions and any
dilution required.
3. Start the run on the analyzer, ensuring that the instrument
operates without error throughout the test batch.
D. Quality Control
1. Include quality control samples (positive and negative) for both
SUNFLOWER and Total IgE with each batch of patient samples
run.
2. Verify that the QC results fall within the acceptable ranges
provided by the control material manufacturer.
3. Document any out-of-range QC results, take appropriate
corrective actions, and rerun associated patient samples as
necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit all results, including patient and quality control data, to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review all patient results for consistency and validity by
comparing against quality control samples.
3. Flag and investigate any discrepancies or critical results using
predetermined criteria.
Handling Critical or Actionable Results
1. Immediately retest samples that yield abnormal or critical
results to confirm accuracy.
2. Notify the respective healthcare provider of confirmed critical
results urgently as per laboratory policies.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for Total IgE and specific IgE (SUNFLOWER)
vary based on the patient’s age and clinical condition. These
reference values should be provided on the test results and
adhered to, in conjunction with specific laboratory ranges
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for
specific assay limitations, potential interferences, and troubleshooting
tips.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
All actions taken, including sample handling, quality control results,
and any deviations or corrective actions, must be documented in the
appropriate monitoring log or laboratory records.
