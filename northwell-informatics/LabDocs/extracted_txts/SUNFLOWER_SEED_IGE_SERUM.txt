SUNFLOWER SEED, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: To provide guidelines for the analytical process to
measure serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to sunflower
seed allergens for diagnostic evaluation of sunflower seed
allergy.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES: • ImmunoCAP
100 (or equivalent automated system for specific IgE
quantification) • Specific IgE calibration standards • Control sera
(Low, Medium, High IgE levels) • Serum sample collection
tubes • Pipette and pipette tips • Centrifuge • Incubation plates •
Reagent storage (as per manufacturers' instructions)
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: • Acceptable specimen: Fresh
serum collected from venous blood into sterile collection tubes.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL • Specimen stability: Serum should be
tested within 7 days if kept at 2-8°C or within 30 days if stored
at -20°C. • Unacceptable specimens: Specimens with
significant hemolysis or lipemia, incorrectly labeled specimens.
4. PROCEDURE:
Preparation: a. Ensure equipment and reagents are within
calibration and expiry. b. Allow all reagents and patient samples
to equilibrate to room temperature.
Sample Processing:
1. Verify patient identification and specimen integrity.
2. Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 2000-3000 RPM
for 10 minutes to separate serum.
3. Carefully transfer the serum to the appropriate test tube/
plate avoiding any carryover of cells/debris.
Analyte Measurement:
1. Add specific calibration standards to the calibration well.
2. Add control sera to their respective wells to validate the
assay.
3. Pipette patient serum samples into designated wells of
the incubation plate.
4. Load the incubation plate into the ImmunoCAP 100
system or appropriate analytical system.
5. Start the assay run according to the automated system’s
operational procedure.
6. Incubate and wash as per the manufacturer's instructions.
7. The automated system will quantify the specific IgE
against sunflower seeds.
5. CALCULATING RESULTS AND QUALITY CONTROL: •
Compare patient results against calibration standards. • Ensure
control sera are within acceptable range. • Document any
instances of control failures and retest if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS: • Verify results in Laboratory
Information System (LIS) • Ensure all required patient
demographics, collection date/time, and testing date/time are
reported. • Printout result for review and documentation.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS: • Specific IgE level reference
interval for sunflower seed:
◦ Negative: < 0.10 kUA/L
◦ Low level: 0.10 – 0.35 kUA/L
◦ Moderate level: 0.36 – 0.70 kUA/L
◦ High level: > 0.70 kUA/L
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS: • Ensure no cross-reactivity with other
allergens. • Refer to ImmunoCAP system insert for detailed
reagent-specific limitations.
9. QUALITY CONTROL: • Control sera should be tested daily and
recorded to ensure assay reliability. • Perform weekly
instrument maintenance and calibration validation. • Participate
in external proficiency testing (EQA) programs.
10. REFERENCE: • ImmunoCAP Product Insert • Relevant clinical
guidelines on serum specific IgE measurement
11. DOCUMENTATION:
◦ Record all sample identifications, results, QC data,
calibrations, and maintenance activities.
◦ Maintain documentation for a minimum of 2 years as per
regulatory requirements.
Ensure compliance with CLIA regulations and follow all safety
guidelines in the laboratory. Regularly review this SOP and update as
necessary based on new research and technological advancements.
