Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Sunflower Seed IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the accurate and reliable
assay of Sunflower Seed IgG in patient specimens.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing Sunflower
Seed IgG testing according to this procedure and ensuring that all
steps are followed accurately. The lead technologist or supervisor is
responsible for verifying the results and for troubleshooting any
issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITION
Sunflower Seed IgG is an immunoglobulin G antibody specifically
targeted against sunflower seed proteins. The assay is used to detect
and quantify the presence of these antibodies in patient blood
samples as part of assessing potential food sensitivities.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• 5 mL SERUM: collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Serum samples should be separated from the clot, cells, or other
cellular components as soon as possible, preferably within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Samples that are hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic should be rejected
and a new sample requested.
• Samples that have not been properly identified or labeled.
Specimen Storage:
• After separation, serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C for up
to 72 hours.
• For longer storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader (capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm)
• Incubator (capable of maintaining 37°C)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
Reagents:
• Sunflower Seed IgG ELISA Kit (includes standards, controls, and
reagents for assay)
• Wash buffer (provided in kit or prepared according to
manufacturer's instructions)
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
• Stop solution (e.g., 1M H2SO4)
Supplies:
• Microtiter plates (ELISA plates, typically 96-well)
• Sample diluent (provided in kit)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
1. ASSAY PROCEDURE
(Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for detailed step-by-step
instructions)
1. Prepare all reagents and samples as directed by the Sunflower
Seed IgG ELISA Kit insert.
2. All reagents must be brought to room temperature before use.
3. Add 100 µL of diluted samples, standards, and controls to the
appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer. Ensure entire contents
of each well are removed at each wash step.
6. Add 100 µL enzyme conjugate to each well.
7. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
8. Wash the plate again 5 times with wash buffer.
9. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 10-15 minutes (exact time
according to kit instructions).
10. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
11. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm within 30 minutes
using the ELISA reader.
12. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control products should be tested concurrently with patient
samples:
• Include at least two levels of QC material (negative and positive
controls) provided with the Sunflower Seed IgG ELISA Kit.
• Control results must fall within the specified range. If controls do
not pass, the run should be considered invalid, and patient results
should not be reported until the issue is resolved.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
2. Calculate the mean absorbance value for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient samples.
3. Construct standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
against the concentration of each standard.
4. Determine the concentration of sunflower seed IgG in patient
samples using the standard curve.
5. Reference intervals: Determine reference intervals based on
the kit manufacturer’s instructions and established laboratory
guidelines.
Results should be reviewed and verified by the lead technologist or
supervisor before reporting to ensure accuracy.
