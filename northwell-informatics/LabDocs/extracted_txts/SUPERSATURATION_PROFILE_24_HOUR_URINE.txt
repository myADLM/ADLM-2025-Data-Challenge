Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Supersaturation Profile, 24 Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and timely analysis of the Supersaturation Profile
for 24-hour urine specimens. This analysis is essential for diagnosing
and monitoring patients with a predisposition to renal stone
formation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
and documenting the analysis as defined in this SOP.
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify any deficiencies
in the analysis process that may affect test results and bring them to
the attention of a supervisor.
Supervisors must ensure the completion of the analytical procedures
according to this SOP and verify the results for accuracy and
completeness.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 24-hour urine collection stored in an appropriate container with
preservative if required.
• Ensure collected urine is refrigerated during the collection period
and transported to the lab immediately upon completion.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected without proper preservation.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post collection without
proper refrigeration.
• Specimens arriving in laboratory that have no collection start and
end date/time indicated on the sample container or requisition.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Required Reagents:
• Supersaturation reagent kit.
• Calibration standards for the relevant analytes (e.g., calcium,
oxalate, uric acid).
Equipment:
• Automated chemical analyzer for urine supersaturation profile.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• pH meter.
Supplies:
• Urine collection containers.
• Transfer pipettes.
• Sample cups.
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Confirm the specimen matches requisition details.
2. Measure total volume of the 24-hour collection and record.
3. Mix the urine thoroughly and aliquot into sample cups for
analysis.
4. Keep aliquots refrigerated if analysis is not performed
immediately.
Analysis:
1. Use the refrigerated centrifuge to spin the aliquots at 3000 rpm
for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer supernatant into a new sample cup.
3. Prepare the sample for the automated chemical analyzer
ensuring it is compatible with the calibration standards.
4. Calibrate the chemical analyzer using the specified calibration
solutions.
5. Insert the prepared urine samples into the chemical analyzer
and initiate the analysis.
6. Use the pH meter to measure the pH of the urine sample.
Data Recording:
1. Document the volume, pH and chemical concentration
readings.
2. Calculate the supersaturation levels using the automated
software if available or manually using standard formulas.
3. Record the supersaturation profile using the laboratory
information system (LIS).
Quality Control:
1. Follow internal quality control procedures by running quality
control samples along with patient samples.
2. Ensure calibration checks are performed before and after the
batch analysis to verify accuracy.
3. Review quality control results to confirm instrument
performance.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
Any discrepancies or abnormal findings should be addressed
according to the lab's protocol for review and troubleshooting. If
necessary, perform a repeat analysis for confirmation.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific reagent kit insert or analyzer manual for details
on individual analyte limitations and interferences.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
In the event of inconsistent or unusual results, verify the sample
preparation, equipment calibration, and quality control data. Repeat
the analysis if necessary or consult with the supervisor for further
action.

Include references to all manuals, inserts, and guidelines specific to
the equipment and reagents used in generating the supersaturation
profile.
