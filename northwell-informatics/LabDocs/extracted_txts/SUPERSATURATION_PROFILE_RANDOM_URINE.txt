Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Supersaturation Profile, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable analysis of the supersaturation
profile in random urine samples by standardizing the procedures
used in the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
testing and analysis as outlined in this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed and for addressing any problems or non-conformances
that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Random urine collected in a clean, sterile container.
• Minimum volume: 20 mL.
• The specimen should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as
possible and stored at 4°C if delayed.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine samples with visible contaminants or precipitates.
• Specimens not labeled correctly with collection date and time.
• Specimens that have not been stored properly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (4°C for storage)
• pH meter or pH indicator strips
• Calcium ion-selective electrode
• Magnesium ion-selective electrode
• Phosphate measurement kit
• Urine Supersaturation Analyzer
• Appropriate Quality Control (QC) materials
1. PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation:
a. Upon receiving the urine sample, ensure proper labeling and
documentation. b. Record the date, time of collection, and initial
inspection results. c. If the specimen has been refrigerated,
allow it to reach room temperature. d. Mix the sample
thoroughly by gentle inversion.
3. Centrifugation:
a. Centrifuge the urine sample at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove any particulate matter. b. Carefully collect the
supernatant in a clean container for analysis.
4. Measurement of pH:
a. Measure the pH of the urine sample using a pH meter or pH
indicator strips. b. Record the pH value in the laboratory
information system.
5. Determination of Urine Constituents:
a. Calcium: - Measure calcium ions using the calcium ion-
selective electrode. - Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for
calibration and measurement. - Record the calcium
concentration in mmol/L.
b. Magnesium: - Measure magnesium ions using the
magnesium ion-selective electrode. - Follow the manufacturer’s
guidelines for calibration and measurement. - Record the
magnesium concentration in mmol/L.
c. Phosphate: - Measure phosphate using the phosphate
measurement kit. - Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for
the assay. - Record the phosphate concentration in mmol/L.
6. Supersaturation Analysis:
a. Transfer a measured aliquot of the supernatant to the urine
supersaturation analyzer. b. Run the analysis as per the urine
supersaturation analyzer’s standard operating procedure. c.
Record the values of supersaturation for calcium oxalate,
calcium phosphate, and uric acid.
7. Quality Control:
a. Perform QC checks using appropriate QC materials to
ensure accuracy of measurements. b. Document QC results,
and take corrective actions if QC results fall outside acceptable
limits.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed by the technologist for consistency
and possible errors.
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
generate a report.
• The report should include:
◦ pH
◦ Calcium concentration
◦ Magnesium concentration
◦ Phosphate concentration
◦ Supersaturation levels for calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate,
and uric acid
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal reference intervals for the supersaturation profile should
be included in the final report, referencing established medical
literature or internal standards.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• The measurements might be affected by improper specimen
handling, contamination, or storage conditions.
• Ensure that reagents and equipment are properly calibrated and
maintained as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for pH meter, calcium and magnesium
ion-selective electrodes, phosphate kit, and supersaturation
analyzer.
• Relevant laboratory manuals and textbooks on urinalysis and
kidney stone risk assessment.
