Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SUPERSATURATION
PROFILE, SELF-COLLECT, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for SUPERSATURATION PROFILE, SELF-COLLECT, 24
HOUR, URINE specimens in the clinical laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the SOP
as detailed. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff are familiar
with and adhere to this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
SUPERSATURATION PROFILE: The comprehensive measurement
of various analytes in a 24-hour urine sample to assess risk for
kidney stone formation.
SELF-COLLECT: Specimen collected by the patient at home.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: Preferred/acceptable: - Collection of all urine voided in a
period of 24 hours.
Unacceptable:
- Incomplete collections that do not represent the full 24-hour period.
- Specimens arriving in laboratory greater than 48 hours after completion of collection.
- Specimens with standing urine accumulating over the collection period without proper preservation.
Ensure specimen integrity: - Specimen should be kept refrigerated or
use appropriate preservatives as advised until brought to the
laboratory.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies: - Refrigerated storage unit. -
Approved preservatives (e.g., hydrochloric acid). - Urine containers. -
Analytical instruments specific for supersaturation profile
measurements (e.g., ion-selective electrodes, spectrophotometers).
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation: - Verify that the collection time, date, and volume are
noted and accurate. Check the integrity of the container for any leaks
or signs of contamination.
Aliquoting and Preservation: - Aliquot the specimen into appropriate
containers for specific analytes (e.g., calcium, oxalate, citrate). - Add
necessary preservatives if they were not pre-added by the patient. -
Ensure proper labeling with identifiers such as patient's name,
collection start and end time.
Measurement: - Follow specific procedural steps for each analyte,
e.g., calibrating equipment, preparing reagents, and ensuring quality
control measures. - For each aliquot, measure the required analytes
as per the standard methods using ion-selective electrodes,
enzymatic methods, or spectrophotometry.
Quality Control: - Perform daily quality control checks including
calibration, and run controls to ensure instrument accuracy. -
Document all quality control measures in the appropriate log.
Result Verification: - Verify that all values fall within the expected
reference range based on the established methodology. - If values
fall outside the expected range, employ troubleshooting measures
including repeating the analyses or addressing instrument issues.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified
by the technologist.
◦ Any significant deviations from normal ranges should be
reviewed in the context of patient history and reported
following indicating protocol (e.g., critical value notification).
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to standard reference intervals provided by literature and
institutional guidelines specific to kidney stone risk assessment.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the insert manuals of specific reagents and analytical
instruments for method limitations.

1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
Maintaining specimen integrity from collection to analysis is crucial to
ensure accurate results. Continual compliance with all quality control
measures and documentation practices is essential.
This SOP covers the complete analytical phase ensuring the integrity
and accuracy of SUPERSATURATION PROFILE, SELF-COLLECT,
24 HOUR, URINE analysis, contributing to reliable diagnostic support
for kidney stone risk assessment.
