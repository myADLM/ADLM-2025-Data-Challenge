Standard Operating Procedure
for Generating Results for
Supplemental Newborn Screen,
Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for generating results for the
supplemental newborn screen from blood spot specimens. This
includes the preparation, handling, analysis, interpretation, and
recording of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase for blood spot specimens
used in supplemental newborn screening.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the relevant laboratory scientists and
technologists to follow this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to this SOP and for addressing any issues that
arise during the process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Blood spots collected on approved neonatal screening cards.
• Blood spots should be dried thoroughly and shipped at room
temperature.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Blood spots that are not completely dried prior to shipping.
• Blood spots that are smeared, layered, or not uniformly applied.
• Specimens with incomplete or incorrect patient information.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Neonatal screening cards
• Puncher calibrated for blood spot extraction
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagents specific to targeted analyses (standards, controls,
solvents, etc.)
• Analyzers and detection devices (e.g., tandem mass
spectrometers, high-performance liquid chromatography)
• Data management system (LIS)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Verify the specimens upon receipt ensuring proper labeling and
condition.
2. Document the receipt of specimens in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
3. Store cards under appropriate conditions until analysis can
begin.
B. Sample Extraction
1. Punch out the required size of blood spots from the neonatal
screening card using a calibrated puncher.
2. Place the punched blood spots into labeled microcentrifuge
tubes or well plates.
C. Analysis
1. Add the appropriate extraction solvent or reagent to the blood
spots and incubate based on standard procedures.
2. Perform analyte-specific testing as described by the
manufacturer’s instructions or laboratory-developed test
protocol.
3. Run the samples on the chosen detection platform (e.g.,
tandem mass spectrometer, high-performance liquid
chromatography).
D. Quality Control and Calibration
1. Run quality controls and calibration samples at the start and
end of each analytical batch, as well as after every 10 patient
samples.
2. Ensure that controls and calibration results are within specified
limits before reporting patient results.
3. Document all quality control results in the LIS.
E. Result Interpretation and Documentation
1. Process the raw data through the analytical software to obtain
quantitative results.
2. Verify the results against established reference ranges and
interpret them.
3. Enter the results into the LIS, ensuring accurate transcription
and documentation.
4. Review and validate all results before final sign-off by the
designated supervisor or authorized personnel.
F. Reporting Results
1. Report results as per the site-specific guidelines and protocol.
2. Ensure all critical values are promptly communicated to the
responsible healthcare provider and documented accordingly.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Hematocrit variability can affect test results.
• Contamination or improper storage of blood spots may lead to
inaccurate results.
• A rare variant that reacts differently than expected by the assay
methodology.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for specific test limitations and
troubleshooting.
