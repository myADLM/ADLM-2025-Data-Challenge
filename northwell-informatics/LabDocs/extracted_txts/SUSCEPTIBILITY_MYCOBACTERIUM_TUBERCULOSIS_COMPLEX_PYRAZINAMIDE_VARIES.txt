Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Susceptibility Testing for
Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) to Pyrazinamide
(PZA)
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for performing
and reporting susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex (MTBC) with respect to the drug
Pyrazinamide (PZA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel
trained in mycobacterial susceptibility testing to execute,
document, and validate the steps detailed in this SOP. All
supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to these
procedures.
3. SPECIMEN Fresh clinical culture of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolated from clinical specimens.
4. DEFINITIONS N/A
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system
• BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA kit
• Positive control strain (H37Rv or other ATCC strain)
• Quality control strain (using MDR-TB strains if necessary)
• Calibrated incubator set at 37±1°C
• Biosafety cabinet (BSC) Class II or higher
• PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection)
• Inoculating loops, pipettes, vortex mixer
• Aseptic transfer supplies (e.g., sterile media, tubes)
1. REAGENTS
• PZA drug solution (Kit-specific concentration as per the
manufacturer’s instructions)
• Sterile saline (0.85% NaCl) for preparation of inoculum
• MGIT culture tubes containing enriched Middlebrook 7H9 broth
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Pre-analytical Phase 7.1.1 Confirm that clinical culture is
identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. 7.1.2 Ensure all
equipment and reagents are calibrated/validated and within
expiration dates. 7.1.3 Prepare all necessary materials under aseptic
conditions in a BSC.
7.2 Analytical Phase
7.2.1 Preparation of Inoculum
1. Harvest sufficient colonies of the freshly cultured MTBC
organism and suspend them in sterile saline.
2. Vortex the suspension to achieve a homogenous mixture.
3. Adjust the turbidity to match that of a 1.0 McFarland standard
(approximately 3 x 10^8 CFU/mL).
7.2.2 Inoculation
1. Transfer 0.5 mL of the adjusted inoculum into the MGIT tube
containing reconstituted PZA.
2. Prepare a drug-free control tube by adding 0.5 mL of the same
inoculum into a non-PZA MGIT tube.
3. Include positive and quality control strains, prepared similarly, to
monitor test reliability.
7.2.3 Incubation
1. Load the inoculated MGIT tubes into the BACTEC MGIT 960
system.
2. Incubate the tubes at 37±1°C.
3. The system will automatically monitor the growth with
continuous reading.
7.3 Post-analytical Phase
7.3.1 Result Interpretation
1. Growth Units (GUs) will be measured and compared between
drug-containing and drug-free control tubes.
2. Analyze the results per the manufacturer’s software to
determine susceptibility or resistance.
3. Interpret according to critical concentrations provided in MGIT
PZA kit insert.
7.3.2 Documentation
1. Record all observations, results, and relevant details in the
designated log or LIS.
2. Perform double verification by a second qualified personnel or
supervisor.
7.3.3 Reporting Results
1. Verify the result in LIS.
2. Report results to the ordering physician. Results should be
reported as Susceptible (S), Resistant (R), or Indeterminate,
following in-house/LIS reporting standards.
7.3.4 Quality Control
1. Include positive control (H37Rv) and appropriate drug-resistant
control organisms.
2. Verify that control results meet expected outcomes. Deviations
must be resolved before releasing patient results.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
4. If results are indeterminate, check inoculum density,
contamination, or deviations in control results.
5. Repeat the test if results are unreliable or control results fail.
