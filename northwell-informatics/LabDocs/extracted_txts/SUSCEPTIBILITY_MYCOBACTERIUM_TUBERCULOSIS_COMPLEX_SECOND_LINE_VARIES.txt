STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING FOR MYCOBACTERIUM
TUBERCULOSIS COMPLEX (SECOND LINE DRUGS)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing second-line
susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
(MTBC). The testing determines the susceptibility of MTBC isolates
to second-line antituberculosis drugs to guide appropriate treatment
for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) or
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff is responsible for
performing susceptibility testing, documenting results, and reporting
to physicians. Supervisors must ensure proper training and
adherence to this protocol.
1. DEFINITIONS
MTBC: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, includes M.
tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, and others. Second-line drugs:
Antituberculosis drugs used when first-line treatments are ineffective
or incomplete. Includes fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin,
moxifloxacin), injectable drugs (e.g., amikacin, capreomycin,
kanamycin), and other agents (e.g., linezolid, clofazimine).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Sputum, bronchial lavage, or other appropriate specimen
collected in a sterile container.
• Specimens should be processed promptly or refrigerated at 2-8°C
until processing.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens with significant contamination or leakage.
• Specimens not suitable for culture (e.g., stool, urine).
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Bio-safety cabinet (Class II)
• Sterile containers and loops
• MGIT (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube) or 7H9 broth medium
• Antibiotic stock solutions for second-line drugs
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Automated susceptibility testing instrument (if available)
• Required PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Inoculum:
1. Use a fresh MTBC isolate obtained from a primary clinical
specimen.
2. Prepare a bacterial suspension in sterile saline or phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS). Adjust to McFarland standard 1.0.
3. Verify concentration via turbidity measurement and adjust as
necessary.
B. Inoculation and Testing:
1. Dispense 100 µL of bacterial suspension into each well of the
96-well microtiter plate containing growth medium.
2. Perform serial dilutions of second-line drugs directly into the
wells (e.g., fluoroquinolones, injectable drugs, linezolid,
clofazimine).
3. Include controls: drug-free wells, wells with known susceptible
strain, and positive growth controls.
4. Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C.
5. Monitor growth continuously if using automated systems, or at
specified intervals usually 7-14 days.
C. Reading Results:
1. Observe the wells for bacterial growth by the turbidity method
or using an automated reading instrument.
2. Compare with control wells to interpret susceptibility results.
3. Document minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for
each drug.
4. Susceptible: No growth at or below critical drug concentration.
5. Resistant: Growth observed at or above critical drug
concentration.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. External Quality Control:
1. Use known susceptible and resistant reference strains for
quality control.
2. Perform testing on reference strains with each batch of patient
specimens.
3. Document and analyze control results for trend shifts or
deviations.
B. Internal Quality Control:
1. Routinely calibrate and validate instrumentation.
2. Ensure proper storage and handling of media and reagents.
3. Maintain proper documentation of all equipment maintenance
and calibrations.
4. RESULT REPORTING
A. Verification:
1. Technologist reviews and verifies results.
2. Confirm against quality control results and interpret MIC values.
B. Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Report consistent with site-specific guidelines and ensure
prompt communication to the requesting clinician.
3. Include comments on test limitations or sample integrity where
applicable.

testing.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Factors such as specimen quality, storage conditions, and
improper inoculum can affect test results.
• Results interpretation may vary based on specific clinical
scenarios and patient health conditions.
1. SAFETY AND BIOSAFETY
• Perform all procedures in a certified Biosafety Cabinet (Class II).
• Follow institutional biosafety guidelines for handling and disposal
of TB cultures and specimens.
• Use PPE consistently and appropriately.
This SOP is to be reviewed annually or as required for compliance
with regulatory standards and clinical best practices.
