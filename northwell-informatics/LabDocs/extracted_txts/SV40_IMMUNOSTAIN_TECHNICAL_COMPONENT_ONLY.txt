Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for
SV40 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the standardized process
for performing SV40 immunostaining on tissue samples for diagnostic
purposes. This SOP ensures that all technical aspects are followed
meticulously to achieve consistent and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Histotechnologists: Responsible for performing the
immunohistochemistry staining procedure, including all
preparation steps, staining, and quality control processes.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring that staff are
trained and SOPs are followed, and for resolving any issues that
may arise during the procedure.
3. DEFINITION
SV40 Immunostain: Immunohistochemistry test used to detect SV40
antigen in tissue samples. The test is performed using the
immunoperoxidase method to visualize the antigen.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Section Thickness: 4-5 microns thick tissue sections on
positively charged slides.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• SV40 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB Chromogen/Substrate
• Hematoxylin (counterstain)
• Xylene, graded alcohol series, and deionized water
• Antigen retrieval solution (pH 9.0, citrate buffer or equivalent)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
6. EQUIPMENT
• Automated immunostainer (if available)
• Water bath for antigen retrieval
• Microscope
• Staining racks
• Pipettes and necessary tips
• Timer
7. PROCEDURE
A. Section Preparation and Dewaxing
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut tissue sections at 4-5 microns and place on positively
charged slides.
◦ Ensure each slide is appropriately labeled with the sample
ID.
2. Dewaxing:
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to melt excess paraffin.
◦ Dewax sections by immersing slides in xylene for 2 x 5
minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through a descending alcohol series:
▪ 100% ethanol for 2 x 3 minutes
▪ 95% ethanol for 2 x 3 minutes
▪ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
▪ Rinse in deionized water for 3 x 2 minutes
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a water
bath or steamer at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the buffer
solution for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water followed by PBS or TBS.
C. Immunostaining
1. Block Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution in PBS/
TBS for 10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Rinse thoroughly in PBS/TBS for 3 x 2 minutes.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply primary SV40 antibody to the tissue sections using an
automated stainer or manually using a hydrophobic barrier
pen around the sections.
◦ Incubate slides for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS/TBS for 3 x 2 minutes.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary HRP-conjugated antibody to the sections.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS/TBS for 3 x 2 minutes.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB chromogen/substrate solution to the sections.
◦ Monitor development under a microscope. Incubate for 5-10
minutes or until desired staining intensity is achieved.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in running tap water.
◦ Differentiate in acid alcohol if necessary.
◦ Blue in tap water or ammonia water.
D. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate:
◦ Dehydrate through a graded alcohol series (70%, 95%,
100% ethanol) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Mounting:
◦ Apply a coverslip with an appropriate mounting medium.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Include a known positive tissue control for each
batch of slides stained to verify that staining reagents are
functioning correctly.
• Negative Control: Run a negative control by omitting the primary
antibody on one section to ensure no non-specific background
staining.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Documentation: Record all staining results, including control
validations, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review: The completed slides are forwarded to the pathologist for
interpretation and reporting.
