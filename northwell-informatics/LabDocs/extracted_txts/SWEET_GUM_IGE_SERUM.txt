Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measuring IgE Levels
Specific to Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) in Serum
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for measuring
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels specific to Sweet Gum allergen
in serum samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or other applicable methods.
2. SCOPE: This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the
laboratory testing of serum samples for Sweet Gum-specific IgE
levels.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP accurately and consistently to
ensure reliable and valid results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: Preferred specimen: Serum
Volume required: Minimum 0.5 mL Storage conditions:
Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
6. Required Equipment:
◦ ELISA plate reader
◦ ELISA washer
◦ Precision pipettes and tips
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Incubator
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Freezer (-20°C or lower)
7. Required Reagents:
◦ Sweet Gum allergen-coated microtiter plates or ready-to-
use specific IgE assay kits
◦ Standards and controls
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Blocking buffer
◦ Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
◦ Stop solution (e.g., H2SO4)
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Secondary antibody conjugate (e.g., anti-human IgE-HRP)
8. PROCEDURE:
9. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare all necessary standards, controls, and samples.
◦ Verify the calibration of all equipment.
10. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples to room temperature and mix
well.
◦ Dilute serum samples if required, following the exact
specifications in the kit insert or standard lab protocol.
11. Assay Procedure: a. Label the required number of wells in the
microtiter plate for standards, controls, and samples. b. Add
100 µL of standards and controls to the appropriate wells. c.
Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples to the designated wells.
d. Incubate the plate at room temperature or as specified by the
manufacturer (typically 1-2 hours). e. Wash the plate 3-5 times
with the provided wash buffer. f. Add 100 µL of the secondary
antibody conjugate to each well. g. Incubate the plate again as
per the manufacturer's instructions (typically 30-60 minutes). h.
Perform additional wash steps as indicated. i. Add 100 µL of
substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark to allow
color development (typically 10-30 minutes). j. Add 50-100 µL of
stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
12. Measurement:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well using the ELISA
plate reader at the appropriate wavelength (typically 450
nm).
13. CALCULATIONS:
◦ Create a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their known concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of IgE specific to Sweet Gum in
the serum samples by interpolating their OD values on the
standard curve.
14. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Results should be reported in IU/mL (international units per
milliliter) or kilounits per liter (kU/L) as required.
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting.
◦ Critical or unexpected results should be communicated to
the healthcare provider immediately per the laboratory’s
policy.
15. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run following
kit instructions or lab protocol.
◦ Document and evaluate control results to assure assay
performance.
◦ Re-run any samples from a batch failing QC standards.
16. LIMITATIONS:
◦ Ensure specimens are free from contamination and
hemolysis.
◦ Follow the specific assay kit limitations and sources of
potential interference detailed in the IFU (instructions for
use).
