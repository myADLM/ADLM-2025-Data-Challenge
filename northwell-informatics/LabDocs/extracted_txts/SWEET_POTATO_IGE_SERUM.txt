Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis and Reporting
of SWEET POTATO, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for performing the analysis and
reporting results for SWEET POTATO, IGE, SERUM.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis and ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of the reported results. Supervisors are responsible
for reviewing the results and ensuring corrective actions are
taken when necessary.
2. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type:
◦ Serum
Specimen Collection:
◦ Collect blood in a red-top or SST tube.
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge within 2 hours of collection at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes.
◦ Separate serum promptly and store at 2-8⁰C if analysis will
occur within 72 hours, or freeze at -20⁰C if storage longer
than 72 hours is required.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly
labeled.
◦ Specimens with contaminants or incorrect storage
conditions.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Immunochemistry Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP 250)
◦ Sweet Potato IGE reagent kit
◦ Calibrators and Controls specific for Sweet Potato IGE
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Specimen tubes
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Disposal Containers
◦ PPE (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
4. Calibration and Quality Control
◦ Perform daily calibration using calibrators provided in the
reagent kit.
◦ Run controls (low, medium, high) daily and document in QC
log.
◦ Verify calibration results. If controls are outside acceptable
range, troubleshoot and recalibrate before proceeding with
specimen analysis.
◦ Ensure instrument maintenance is up-to-date according to
manufacturer recommendations.
5. Procedure
Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure the specimen is at room temperature before
analysis.
◦ Vortex mix the serum to ensure homogeneity.
Assay Procedure:
◦ Load specimen, calibrators, and controls into the
ImmunoCAP analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer according to manufacturer’s
instructions for Sweet Potato IGE.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer for any alarms or
errors during the process.
6. Result Verification and Reporting
Result Verification:
◦ Review analyzer output and verify results against QC data.
◦ Evaluate trends or deviations in results and control values.
◦ Confirm results are within the expected analytical sensitivity
range.
◦ Resolve any discrepancies per the laboratory SOP before
reporting.
Result Reporting:
◦ Enter verified results into LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
◦ Ensure all necessary comments, such as interference
issues or QC deviations, are documented.
◦ Notify physicians of critical values in accordance with
laboratory procedure.
7. Reference Intervals
◦ Reference intervals for SWEET POTATO, IGE:
▪ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
▪ Borderline: 0.35 – 0.70 kU/L
▪ Positive: >0.70 kU/L
8. Method Limitations
◦ Ensure no hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples are
processed.
◦ Ensure samples are free from contaminants to prevent false
negatives/positives.
◦ Validate limits and sources of interference according to the
kit insert.
9. Corrective Actions
◦ Troubleshoot any deviations in QC results using instrument
troubleshooting guidelines.
◦ Notify supervisor immediately if major discrepancies or
instrument errors are detected.
◦ Review patient samples for any errors or unusual results;
repeat assay if necessary.
◦ Follow procedure for handling critical and repeat critical
values.
10. Documentation
• Record all controls, calibrations, and patient results in the
designated analyzers logs.
• Maintain records of any corrective actions taken and instrument
maintenance.
• Ensure all documentation is accurate, complete, and complies
with laboratory SOPs.
