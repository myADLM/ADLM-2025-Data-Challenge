Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SWEET VERNAL GRASS, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the testing of serum samples for IgE
antibodies specific to Sweet Vernal Grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum).
These procedures will ensure accurate and reliable results for clinical
diagnostics.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and reporting SWEET VERNAL GRASS, IgE, Serum tests
in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP to maintain the quality and reliability of the test results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for oversight and ensuring
adherence to the SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Serum Separator Tube (SST) or Red-Top
Tube
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL of serum
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days when
stored at 2-8°C. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen
at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP, Phadia 250)
• Reagents: Specific IgE reagents for Sweet Vernal Grass, quality
control materials, calibration materials
• Supplies: Pipettes, pipette tips, centrifuge, serum storage vials
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples
1. Sample Receipt and Verification:
◦ Verify that the serum samples have been properly collected,
labeled, and received within the acceptable time frame.
◦ Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum, if not already separated.
◦ Inspect the serum for any hemolysis or lipemia, which can
interfere with test results.
2. Sample Aliquoting and Storage:
◦ Aliquot the required volume of serum into labeled storage
vials.
◦ Store the serum aliquots at 2-8°C if testing is to be
performed within 7 days, or freeze them at -20°C for longer
storage.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Allow reagents to reach room temperature before use.
2. Instrument Setup and Calibration:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform a system
check as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibration
materials prior to running patient samples.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each testing
batch to ensure the reliability of results.
◦ Acceptable ranges for QC materials must be determined as
per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
C. Performing the Test
1. Loading the Samples:
◦ Load the serum samples, calibrators, and quality controls
onto the analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument-specific instructions for loading the
assay-specific reagents and samples.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the test run according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Monitor the assay run to ensure no error messages or alerts
are encountered.
D. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review of Results:
◦ After the assay is complete, review the generated results for
each sample.
◦ Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable
limits before accepting and reporting patient results.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document the test results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Enter notes on any deviations or issues encountered during
testing.
3. Result Verification:
◦ The technologist must verify the data entries in the LIS.
4. Reporting Results:
◦ Release the results to the appropriate health care provider.
◦ For critical values, follow the established protocols for
immediate communication.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control: Perform daily quality controls using
control materials provided by the reagent manufacturer.
• External Quality Assurance: Participate in external proficiency
testing programs to ensure an ongoing evaluation of test accuracy
and precision.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all calibrations, controls, and patient results
for a minimum of two years.
• Document any corrective actions taken in response to quality
control failures or instrument errors.
