Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for SWORDFISH, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides detailed instructions for performing
SWORDFISH IgE testing on serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform SWORDFISH IgE tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
SWORDFISH IgE test, ensuring adherence to this SOP and
recording all results accurately. Supervisors must verify that the
protocols are followed, and provide additional training if necessary.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• SWORDFISH IgE Testing Kit
• Microplate Reader
• Calibrated Pipettes (10-1000μL)
• Sterile Pipette Tips
• Timer
• Serum sample tubes
• Laboratory bench protectors
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENTS
• SWORDFISH Standards and Controls
• Detection Antibodies
• Enzyme Conjugates
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
6.1 Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of patient serum
• Serum must be free of hemolysis and lipemia.
• Transport and store samples at 2-8°C if testing will be performed
within 72 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
6.2 Unacceptable:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination
• Specimens not properly labeled or those with no accompanying
requisition form
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
7.1 Upon receipt, inspect the specimens for any unacceptable
conditions. 7.2 Label and record the specimen information using the
laboratory information system (LIS). 7.3 If testing cannot begin
immediately, store specimens at 2-8°C.
1. PROCEDURE
8.1 Assay Preparation: 8.1.1 Set up the microplate reader according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. 8.1.2 Prepare all reagents and
allow them to reach room temperature before starting the assay.
8.2 Sample and Reagent Preparation: 8.2.1 Prepare the wash buffer
solution as per the kit instructions. 8.2.2 Dilute serum samples,
standards, and controls according to the assay requirements.
8.3 Assay Procedure: 8.3.1 Add 100 µL of diluted standards, controls,
and patient serum samples into the designated wells of the
microplate. 8.3.2 Incubate the microplate at room temperature for the
recommended time (generally 60 minutes). 8.3.3 Wash the wells
multiple times (typically 3-5 times) with wash buffer to remove
unbound materials. 8.3.4 Add 100 μL of detection antibody to each
well and incubate for the specified time. 8.3.5 Wash the wells as
instructed. 8.3.6 Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and
incubate for the given time. 8.3.7 Wash the wells to remove excess
enzyme conjugate. 8.3.8 Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each
well. Incubate in the dark, at the recommended temperature and
time. 8.3.9 Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
8.4 Reading the Results: 8.4.1 Read the optical density (OD) of each
well at the appropriate wavelength using the microplate reader. 8.4.2
Calculate the IgE concentration in serum samples based on the
standard curve generated from known standards.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
9.1 Run quality control samples with each batch of patient specimens
to ensure assay performance. 9.2 Evaluate the control results: - If
controls fall within specified ranges, proceed with reporting results. -
If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and repeat the assay if necessary.
1. DATA INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
10.1 Analyze the data using appropriate software or calculation
methods. 10.2 Review and verify all results for accuracy. 10.3 Report
results according to laboratory guidelines, ensuring adherence to
HIPAA regulations.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
11.1 Ensure specimens are free of contaminants that may interfere
with the assay. 11.2 Hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination
can cause erroneous results and must be avoided.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
12.1 Consult the SWORDFISH kit manual for specific troubleshooting
guidelines when control results are not within the expected range.
