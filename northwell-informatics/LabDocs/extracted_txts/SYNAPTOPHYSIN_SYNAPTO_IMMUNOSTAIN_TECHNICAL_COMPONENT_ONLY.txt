Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Synaptophysin (SYNAPTO)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the technical steps required for performing
the Synaptophysin (SYNAPTO) immunostain on tissue specimens.
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure consistent and accurate
staining results that can be used for diagnostic purposes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
Synaptophysin immunostain according to this SOP. All staff must
ensure that each step is followed meticulously to maintain the
integrity and accuracy of the test results.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
• Synaptophysin primary antibody
• Secondary antibody and detection system (such as an HRP-
conjugated detection system)
• Positive control tissue
• Negative control (appropriate buffer or non-immune serum)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Water bath (if required)
• Oven for slide drying
• Deparaffinization and rehydration reagents (e.g., xylene, graded
alcohols)
• Blocking reagents (e.g., protein block)
• Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer or EDTA buffer)
• Wash buffers (e.g., PBS or TBS)
• Humidified chamber (for manual staining)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
mounted on charged microscope slides.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation
1. Ensure tissue sections are mounted on charged microscope
slides.
2. Place slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour to ensure adherence of
tissue sections to the slides.
3. Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene or a suitable
clearing agent for 2-3 changes, 5 minutes each.
4. Rehydrate slides by passing them through graded alcohols
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
5. Rinse slides in distilled or deionized water.
B) Antigen Retrieval
1. Preheat the antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer) to 95°C.
2. Place slides in the antigen retrieval buffer using a suitable
container.
3. Incubate slides in the buffer at 95°C for 20 minutes.
4. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
5. Rinse slides in distilled or deionized water.
C) Immunostaining
1. Peroxidase Blocking:
◦ Immerse slides in peroxidase blocking solution for 10
minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer (PBS or TBS) for 2 changes, 5
minutes each.
2. Protein Blocking:
◦ Apply protein block to the tissue sections and incubate for
10 minutes.
◦ Tap off excess blocking solution.
3. Primary Antibody:
◦ Incubate tissue sections with Synaptophysin primary
antibody diluted as per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
4. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
◦ Apply secondary antibody or detection reagent according to
the detection system protocol.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time (typically 30 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
5. Chromogen Development:
◦ Incubate slides in DAB or another suitable chromogen
substrate solution until sufficient staining is achieved
(typically 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to stop chromogen
development.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to
counterstain.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water.
◦ Differentiate in mild acidic water (optional).
◦ Rinse and blue in alkaline water or 0.1% ammonia water
(optional).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
7. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%,
100%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 2-3 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslips.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide with known Synaptophysin-positive
tissue with each staining run.
• Include a negative control slide that replaces the primary antibody
with an appropriate buffer or non-immune serum for each staining
run.
• Review control slides to ensure the staining procedure worked
correctly before interpreting test slides.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls do not show expected results, review the following:
◦ Antibody expiration dates and storage conditions
◦ Proper antigen retrieval and blocking steps
◦ Adequate washing between steps
◦ Consistency in incubation times and temperatures
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record lot numbers and expiration dates of antibodies and
reagents used.
• Initial and date logs for quality control slides.
• Document any deviations from the standard procedure and the
corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are provided as stained slides to the pathologist for
interpretation.
• Pathology report reflects the pathologist’s interpretation of staining
patterns and intensity.
