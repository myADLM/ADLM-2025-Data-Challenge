Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: SYNOVIAL SARCOMA
PANEL Analysis, Technical Component Only
1. Purpose: To establish a standardized procedure for the
technical analysis of the Synovial Sarcoma Panel, ensuring
accurate, consistent, and reliable results.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to all medical laboratory scientists and
technicians performing the technical component of the Synovial
Sarcoma Panel.
3. Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory
personnel to follow this protocol accurately and to ensure that
all procedures and documentation are completed as required.
In case of any anomalies, staff must report to the laboratory
supervisor immediately.
4. Definitions: Synovial Sarcoma Panel - A set of assays designed
to identify and evaluate potential markers of synovial sarcoma
in tissue samples.
5. Specimen Requirements and Handling:
• Specimens: Formalin Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks or unstained slides.
• Specimens must be labeled correctly with patient information
including name, identification number, and date of collection.
• Store the specimens at room temperature until ready for
processing.
• Ensuring that the specimens arrive in the laboratory with no
visible damage or signs of contamination.
1. Reagents and Supplies:
• Buffer solutions
• Primary antibodies specific to synovial sarcoma markers
• Secondary antibodies
• Detection kits and chromogens
• Mounting media
• Microscope slides
• Staining racks and glass dishes
• Appropriate controls (positive and negative controls for each
batch of specimens)
1. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining set-up
• Microscope
• Incubator
• Water bath
1. Procedure:
8.1. Section Preparation:
• Cut 4-micron thick sections from the FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
• Place sections onto positively charged microscope slides.
• Allow slides to dry at room temperature and then bake in an oven
at 60°C for 30 minutes.
8.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides by running them through xylene for three
changes, 5 minutes each.
• Rehydrate slides by sequentially running through graded ethanols
(100%, 95%, 70%) followed by distilled water.
8.3. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using an appropriate buffer
at pH 6 or 9.
• Preheat the solution in a water bath or microwave, then immerse
slides for 20-30 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool at room temperature and then wash in distilled
water.
8.4. Immunostaining:
• Place slides in an immunostainer or proceed with manual staining
protocol.
• Incubate slides with ready-to-use primary antibodies specific to
synovial sarcoma markers for the appropriate time (usually 30-60
minutes).
• Rinse slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or TBS.
• Apply secondary antibodies and incubate according to
manufacturer instructions.
• Apply the detection system and chromogen; incubate according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Dehydrate sections through ascending grades of ethanol and
clear in xylene.
8.5. Mounting and Cover Slipping:
• Apply mounting media over the stained section and cover the
slide with a cover slip.
• Allow slides to dry completely.
1. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
specimens.
• Ensure that staining intensity and localization match expected
patterns for both control and patient samples.
• Document any discrepancies or issues in the Quality Control log.
1. Interpretation and Reporting:
• Only the technical component is covered under this SOP. The
analysis of stained slides will be performed by a qualified
pathologist.
• Pathology staff will review and interpret the stained slides for
synovial sarcoma markers.
• Results will be entered into the laboratory information system
(LIS) and reviewed by the responsible pathologist.
1. Maintenance and Troubleshooting:
• Regularly maintain and calibrate the staining equipment as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Document any maintenance activities and troubleshooting steps
taken.
• Report any persistent issues to the supervisor.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all antibodies and detection
systems used.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
immunohistochemistry.
• Pathology department protocols and guidelines.
1. Revisions:
• The SOP will be reviewed and revised annually or as required,
based on new findings, guidelines, or changes in procedures.

This SOP covers the technical component only, and proper
interpretation of results should be carried out by the designated
pathologist.
