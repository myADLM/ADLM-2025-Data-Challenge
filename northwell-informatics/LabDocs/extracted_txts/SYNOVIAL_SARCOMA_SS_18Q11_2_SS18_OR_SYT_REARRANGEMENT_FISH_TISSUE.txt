Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for SYNOVIAL SARCOMA
(SS), 18Q11.2 (SS18 OR SYT) REARRANGEMENT, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of the 18q11.2 (SS18 or
SYT) gene rearrangement in synovial sarcoma tissue samples
utilizing Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This test is
paramount for confirming the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma, a type
of soft tissue sarcoma, using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue specimens.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the FISH
analysis for detecting the 18q11.2 rearrangement in synovial sarcoma
tissue samples within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory technologists and
supervisors involved in processing and analyzing the tissue samples
to adhere to this SOP to maintain high-quality, accurate, and reliable
test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block or
unstained sections mounted on positively charged slides should be
used. 4.2. A minimum of 5 serial sections, each 4-5 micrometers
thick, should be cut from the FFPE block.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1. FISH Probes specific for SS18 (SYT) rearrangement. 5.2. FISH
hybridization buffer. 5.3. Fluorescence microscope. 5.4. Water bath.
5.5. Humidified hybridization chamber. 5.6. Heat block or thermal
cycler. 5.7. Microscope slides. 5.8. Coverslips. 5.9. DAPI
counterstain. 5.10. Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%). 5.11. Xylene.
5.12. 2X SSC (Saline-Sodium Citrate) buffer. 5.13. NP-40 detergent.
5.14. FISH-grade Paraffin oil. 5.15. Positive and negative control
slides.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Slide Preparation: a. Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing
in xylene for 10 minutes twice. b. Rehydrate tissue sections in graded
ethanol (100%, 85%, 70%) for 2 minutes each, then rinse in distilled
water. c. Apply 2X SSC buffer to slides and incubate at 37°C for 30
minutes. d. Digest tissue sections with proteinase K solution for the
recommended time (usually 10-30 minutes at 37°C) specific to tissue
type. e. Rinse slides in 2X SSC buffer for 5 minutes and air dry.
6.2. Probe Preparation: a. Denature premixed FISH probe and
hybridization buffer by heating at 73-75°C for 5 minutes and snap
cooling on ice for 5 minutes.
6.3. Co-denaturation and Hybridization: a. Apply 10-15 µL of probe
mixture to each slide and cover with a coverslip. b. Seal coverslip
edges with rubber cement or equivalent. c. Place slides on a
preheated heat block or thermal cycler set at 75-80°C for 5 minutes
to denature DNA. d. Transfer slides to a humidified hybridization
chamber and incubate at 37°C for 12-16 hours overnight.
6.4. Post-Hybridization Washes: a. Remove coverslips and rinse
slides in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 5 minutes. b.
Perform stringent wash in 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for 2
minutes. c. Rinse in distilled water and air dry.
6.5. Counterstaining and Mounting: a. Apply DAPI counterstain and
cover with a coverslip. b. Seal coverslip edges with clear nail polish
or equivalent.
6.6. Analysis: a. Analyze slides using a fluorescence microscope
equipped with suitable filters for DAPI and the fluorophores used in
the FISH probes. b. Count a minimum of 100 non-overlapping nuclei
per sample. c. Record the presence of SS18 (SYT) rearrangement,
using control slides to ensure assay validity.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Include positive and negative controls with each FISH assay
batch. 7.2. Maintain documentation of reagent lot numbers, expiry
dates, and calibration records of equipment. 7.3. Ensure regular
proficiency testing and participation in inter-laboratory comparison
programs.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) with
clear interpretation and detail on the observed gene rearrangements.
8.2. Verify results by a secondary qualified technologist or supervisor
before reporting. 8.3. Report results in accordance with laboratory
protocols and include a signed pathology report.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
9.1. Test accuracy depends on proper tissue handling and
processing. 9.2. FISH signal interpretation may be hampered by
suboptimal sample quality, fixation artifacts, or non-specific binding.
9.3. Test sensitivity and specificity are contingent on the quality of
probes and hybridization conditions.
