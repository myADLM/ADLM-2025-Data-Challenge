1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable screening of synthetic cannabinoid
metabolites in urine samples using validated analytical methods. This
protocol outlines the procedures for handling and analyzing
specimens, operating the instrumentation, monitoring quality control,
and reporting results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to adhere
to this protocol strictly, monitor results, conduct quality control, and
report any issues promptly to supervisors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 30 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a sterile container.
• The specimen should be transported to the laboratory within 24
hours of collection. If the specimen is to be stored, refrigerate at
2-8°C and analyze within 72 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Insufficient volume (<15 mL)
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 24 hours.
• Specimens without proper labeling or missing required
information (e.g., patient identification, collection date, and time).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Volumetric pipettes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Calibrated glassware
• Calibrated analytical balance
• Reagent grade chemicals and standards for synthetic
cannabinoid metabolites
• Internal quality control (QC) materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, log the specimen into the laboratory information
system (LIS), ensuring all relevant information is captured.
2. Vortex the urine specimen to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a clean, labelled
centrifuge tube.
4. Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial without disturbing the
sediment.
6. Add internal standard to ensure accurate quantification of
metabolites.
B. Extraction and Derivatization:
1. Perform a liquid-liquid extraction of the sample:
◦ Add 5 mL of organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate) to the urine
sample.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 5 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the organic layer to a clean vial.
2. Dry down the organic extract under a gentle stream of nitrogen.
3. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of mobile phase or
derivatization reagent (if applicable).
C. Instrumentation:
1. Set up the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure the instrument is calibrated using known standards for
synthetic cannabinoid metabolites.
3. Inject the processed sample into the instrument.
4. Analyze using the appropriate method, monitoring specific ions
or transitions for each target metabolite.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run QC materials with each batch of samples (at least one
positive and one negative control).
2. Accept or reject the run based on the QC results:
◦ If QC results fall within the specified manufacturer or
internally-validated range, proceed with sample analysis.
◦ If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
and reanalyze as needed.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review each chromatogram/mass spectral profile for the
presence of target analytes.
5. Compare the retention times and mass spectra of each peak
with known standards.
6. Quantify metabolites using appropriate calibration curves.
7. Report results through the LIS or manually record and verify,
ensuring all findings are accurate and comprehensive.
8. For any anomalous results, reprocess the sample and confirm
results prior to reporting.
9. INTERPRETATION AND CONFIRMATION:
10. Negative Result: No synthetic cannabinoid metabolites
detected above the limit of detection.
11. Positive Result: Presence of one or more synthetic cannabinoid
metabolites confirmed through retention time and mass spectral
match. Confirm positive results with a second analytical
method, if necessary.

16. DOCUMENTATION:
17. Maintain thorough documentation for each sample, including
sample reception logs, instrument run logs, calibration records,
QC results, and final reporting data.
