SOP FOR SYNTHETIC GLUCOCORTICOID SCREEN, RANDOM,
URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and reporting of synthetic
glucocorticoid screening in random urine specimens to ensure
accurate and reliable results in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis as specified in this SOP. Laboratory supervisors must
ensure all steps are followed and documented.
1. DEFINITION
Synthetic glucocorticoid screening refers to the detection of synthetic
corticosteroids in urine specimens, commonly used to monitor drug
compliance or identify potential abuse.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Random urine sample, collected in an appropriate urine container,
with a minimum volume of 10 mL.
• Specimens must be delivered to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C if there is any delay in transport.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that were collected more than 24 hours prior and were
not stored at 2-8°C.
• Specimens arriving with no collection date/time indicated on the
container or requisition form.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Appropriate HPLC grade solvents, internal standards, and mobile
phases
• Calibrators and controls specific to synthetic glucocorticoids
• Polypropylene sample vials and caps
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical balance
• Laboratory glassware
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Review incoming specimens to ensure proper labeling and
collection criteria.
2. Centrifuge specimen at 1500 xg for 10 minutes to remove
particulates.
3. Transfer a 1.0 mL aliquot of the supernatant to a clean, labeled
polypropylene vial.
4. Add internal standard to urine aliquot, vortex to mix thoroughly.
6.2 Instrument Preparation
1. Prepare and validate the LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Verify that the system’s calibration curve using known
standards is within acceptable performance criteria.
3. Load samples, calibrators, and quality controls into the auto-
sampler tray.
6.3 Analysis
1. Start the LC-MS/MS run. Follow specific programming
instructions for elution of synthetic glucocorticoids.
2. Ensure that the internal standard and synthetic glucocorticoids
are detected with the correct retention times.
6.4 Quality Control
1. Analyze quality control materials alongside patient specimens
at the beginning, middle, and end of the run.
2. Accept or reject runs based on control recovery within
designated ranges.
3. Repeat assay when necessary, if QC materials indicate
potential errors or drifts.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review chromatograms and mass spectral data for correct peak
retention times, shapes, and mass transitions.
• Compare findings to established reference ranges for synthetic
glucocorticoids in urine.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for final
review and verification.
• Report all identified synthetic glucocorticoids including
concentration and relevant observations.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to lab-specific synthetic glucocorticoid concentration ranges for
random urine samples.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• External interferences may affect the accurate identification of
synthetic glucocorticoids.
• Ensure cross-reactivity with other substances is minimized.
• Evaluate suspicious results with repeat testing or confirmatory
methods if required.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Records of specimen testing must include:
• Initials and date of technologist performing assay
• Date and time of specimen processing
• Calibration and QC results for each run
• Maintenance logs for the LC-MS/MS system
1. REFERENCES
• Reference standards for LC-MS/MS operating procedures.
• Product inserts for internal standards and synthetic glucocorticoid
calibrators.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Ensure compliance with lab safety protocols when handling urine
specimens and operating the LC-MS/MS system.
• Follow proper waste disposal procedures for hazardous materials.
