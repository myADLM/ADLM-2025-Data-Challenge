Standard Operating Procedure for SYNTHETIC
GLUCOCORTICOID SCREEN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase
involved in the generation of results for Synthetic Glucocorticoid
Screen in serum. This includes the use of appropriate
equipment, reagents, and methodologies to measure synthetic
glucocorticoids.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to accurately
perform the assay, ensure quality control, and document all
procedures as outlined in this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP and
addressing any issues that arise during the analytical process.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
◦ Serum samples are required for this assay.
Specimen Collection:
◦ Collect blood in a red-top or serum separator tube.
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
◦ Carefully separate the serum and transfer to a clean,
appropriately labeled tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Specimens older than 7 days if stored at 2-8°C.
◦ Unlabeled or mislabeled specimens.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS)
◦ Extraction solvent: Acetonitrile
◦ Calibration standards for synthetic glucocorticoids
◦ Quality control materials (low, medium, and high)
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Laboratory glassware and plastic ware
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Label all tubes and prepare work area.
2. Add 200 µL of serum to a labeled extraction tube.
3. Add 400 µL of acetonitrile to each tube to precipitate
proteins.
4. Vortex mix for 1 minute.
5. Centrifuge the samples at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
6. Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a clean vial,
avoid transferring any precipitate.
HPLC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare and run calibration standards and quality control
samples at the beginning and end of each batch of patient
samples.
3. Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample extract into the
HPLC-MS/MS system.
4. Run the samples under the optimized conditions for
synthetic glucocorticoid detection (refer to instrument-
specific settings and parameters).
5. Monitor the ion transitions specific to the synthetic
glucocorticoids being tested.
Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatographic data using the instrument
software.
2. Construct a calibration curve using known standards.
3. Ensure quality control sample results fall within the
established ranges.
4. Quantify the synthetic glucocorticoid concentrations in
patient samples by comparing with the calibration curve.
5. Review and validate the results, ensuring integrity and
accuracy.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use quality control samples (low, medium, and high) to
assess accuracy and precision of the analysis.
◦ Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each
batch.
◦ Acceptable limits for QC samples must be within ±2
standard deviations of the target value.
Corrective Actions:
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
equipment, reagents, and procedure.
◦ Re-calibrate the instrument if necessary and repeat the
sample analysis.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
◦ Report any critical or abnormal values immediately to the
designated clinician.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s guidelines for HPLC-MS/MS system.
◦ Relevant clinical and laboratory standards for glucocorticoid
testing.
◦ Peer-reviewed journals and validation reports relevant to
synthetic glucocorticoid screening.
