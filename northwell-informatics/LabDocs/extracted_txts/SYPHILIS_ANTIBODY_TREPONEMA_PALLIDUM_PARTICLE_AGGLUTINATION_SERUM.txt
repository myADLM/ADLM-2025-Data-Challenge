Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Syphilis Antibody, Treponema Pallidum
Particle Agglutination (TPPA), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standard procedures and guidelines for the detection of
Treponema pallidum antibodies in serum using the Particle
Agglutination method.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the TPPA test, verifying the test results, and documenting the findings
according to this SOP.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analytical phase of
testing for Treponema pallidum antibodies (TPPA) using serum
samples within the laboratory.
3. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• TPPA Reagent kit
• Serum samples
• Disposable micropipette tips
• 96-well microtiter plate or TPPA test wells
• 0.9% saline solution
• Positive and negative control sera
• Pipettes (manual or automatic)
• Incubator set at specified temperature conditions (if required)
• Plate shaker (optional)
• Timer
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature before
use (15-30 minutes).
• Prepare the testing area, ensuring it is clean and free from
contamination.
4.2 Sample Preparation
• Serum samples should be accessioned, and properly stored at
2-8°C if not immediately tested.
• Allow refrigerated samples to reach room temperature before
testing.
• Visually inspect the serum samples for hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus, which may interfere with test results.
4.3 Reagent Preparation
• Reconstitute reagents as directed by the manufacturer’s
guidelines provided in the kit insert.
• Gently mix reagents before use to ensure homogeneity.
4.4 Positive and Negative Control Preparation
• Prepare positive and negative controls as provided by the
manufacturer. Controls must be included in each run to ensure
the test validity.
• Allow controls to reach room temperature before use if stored at
refrigerated temperatures.
4.5 Testing Procedure
1. Label the microtiter plate or TPPA test wells accordingly for
patient samples, positive controls, and negative controls.
2. Pipette the required volume of 0.9% saline into each well
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Add the required volume of patient sera, positive controls, and
negative controls to the respective wells.
4. Add the specified volume of TPPA reagent to each well.
5. Gently tap the side of the plate or use a plate shaker to mix the
contents properly.
6. Incubate the plate at the recommended temperature and
duration specified by the manufacturer (typically at room
temperature for 1-2 hours).
7. After incubation, observe the agglutination reaction.
4.6 Interpretation of Results
• Positive results are indicated by a clear agglutination pattern,
observable without magnification.
• Negative results show a uniform suspension with no visible
agglutination.
• Any deviation or unusual pattern should be repeated, or the
sample tested using an alternative methodology or supplementary
testing like FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody
Absorption).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure performance validity.
• Document control results. The test run is valid only if the control
results fall within the manufacturer’s recommended range.
• If the controls do not perform as expected, reject the run and
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s guidelines before
repeating the testing.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record patient results carefully in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Verify the results against the control results to ensure accuracy.
• Report results as 'Reactive' or 'Non-reactive' for the presence of
Treponema pallidum antibodies.
• For samples with inconclusive or borderline results, recommend a
retest or follow-up testing using alternative methods.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
results.
• Low antibody titers in early primary syphilis or in cases of treated
syphilis may yield false-negative results.
• Cross-reactivity may occur with antibodies from other treponemal
infections (e.g., yaws, pinta).
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s TPPA Reagent Kit Insert.
• Laboratory standard operating procedures manual.
• Relevant Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
syphilis.
9. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Review the SOP annually and update as necessary.
• Document any changes or deviations in the laboratory’s SOP
records.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate and reliable
detection of Treponema pallidum antibodies in serum samples,
contributing to the proper diagnosis and management of syphilis.
