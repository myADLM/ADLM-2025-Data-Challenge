SYPHILIS IGG ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a protocol for the accurate and timely analysis of Syphilis
IgG antibodies in serum using the Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA)
method. This protocol ensures consistent and reliable results for the
detection of Treponema pallidum infection (Syphilis).
Responsibility:
• All laboratory personnel performing the analysis are responsible
for following this protocol.
• The designated supervisor must ensure protocol compliance and
address any issues that arise during the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric, or
contaminated specimens.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
• EIA microplate reader
• EIA incubator
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Microplate washer
• Timer
• Reagents: Syphilis IgG EIA kit, including controls and calibrators
• Deionized or distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, serum samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare the microplate according to the EIA kit manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Ensure all equipment (microplate reader, washer, incubator) is
functioning correctly and calibrated as per manufacturer's
guidelines.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Label the microplate wells for calibrators, controls, and patient
specimens.
2. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into the designated wells, as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Add the enzyme-labeled antigen or antibody (as specified by
the kit) to each well.
4. Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and time
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Wash the wells with the washing buffer using the microplate
washer.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
7. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
C) Reading and Interpretation
1. Read the absorbance of each well at the specified wavelength
using the microplate reader.
2. Calculate the results based on the absorbance values of the
calibrators, controls, and patient specimens using the formula
or software provided by the kit manufacturer.
3. Interpret the results according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to validate the test run.
• The results of the controls must fall within the specified range
provided by the kit manufacturer. If the control results are out of
range, do not report patient results and troubleshoot the assay.
• Document all quality control results in the designated logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results as negative, equivocal, or positive based on the
manufacturer's interpretation criteria.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by a qualified technologist.
• For equivocal results, repeat the test or recommend further
confirmatory testing, such as Treponema pallidum particle
agglutination (TP-PA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorption (FTA-ABS) tests.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Indicates no detectable level of Syphilis IgG antibodies.
• Equivocal: Suggests retesting or confirmatory testing.
• Positive: Indicates the presence of Syphilis IgG antibodies,
suggesting current or past infection.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Factors such as improper sample handling, technical errors, or
interfering substances may affect results.
• Equivocal results require retesting or additional confirmatory tests.
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for detailed limitations of the
specific EIA kit used.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all revisions and updates to the protocol with dates and
signatures of responsible personnel.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate
and reliable detection of Syphilis IgG antibodies in serum specimens,
facilitating timely diagnosis and patient management.
