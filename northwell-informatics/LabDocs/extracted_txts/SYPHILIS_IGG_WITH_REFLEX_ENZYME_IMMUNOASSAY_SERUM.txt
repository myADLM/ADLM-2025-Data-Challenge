Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Syphilis IgG with
Reflex, Enzyme Immunoassay, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of Syphilis IgG antibodies
in serum using an Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) method, and to
describe the reflex testing procedures when initial test results are
positive.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay according to this SOP, ensuring the quality control, and
documenting all required information. Supervisors must ensure the
procedure is followed, troubleshooting is documented, and corrective
actions are taken as necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum, collected in a red or gold-top tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Stability: Serum must be processed and stored per guidelines to
avoid degradation of the analyte.
• Transport: Specimen should be transported to the laboratory
promptly and stored at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme Immunoassay Kit for Syphilis IgG detection
• Microplate reader
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoir
• Serological pipette
• Plate washer (or manual washing equipment)
• Incubator (set to 37°C)
• Timer
• Quality control sera (positive and negative controls)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control according to kit instructions with each run.
• Quality control material should include both positive and negative
controls.
• Record the results of quality control on the Quality Control Log.
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, do not
report patient results and contact supervisor for further
instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
• Prepare workstation and organize all materials.
• All reagents and specimens must be brought to room temperature
before use.
• Mix all reagents gently but thoroughly before use.
B) Assay Setup
1. Label microplate as per template.
2. Add appropriate amounts of controls, standards, and patient
samples to the assigned wells according to the kit instructions.
3. Follow the kit instructions for the incubation times and
temperatures.
4. Washing steps are critical. Ensure removal of all liquid in each
well after each wash cycle.
C) Detection
1. Add enzyme label and substrate solutions as directed by the kit.
2. Incubate the plate as per kit directions.
3. Stop the reaction as instructed.
4. Read absorbance on a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
5. INTERPRETING RESULTS
• Reactive (Positive) Initial Test: If a sample is reactive, proceed
with reflex testing using a confirmatory Treponema pallidum
particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) or other confirmatory testing
method as per laboratory policy.
• Non-Reactive (Negative) Initial Test: Report as negative. No
further testing is required unless clinically indicated.
• If confirmatory testing is positive, report the result as positive for
Syphilis IgG antibodies.
• If confirmatory testing is negative, the result should be reported as
non-reactive after reflex testing.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for verification by a technologist. Reports should include
interpretative comments according to established guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Non-Reactive: No detectable Syphilis IgG antibodies.
• Reactive: Detectable Syphilis IgG antibodies, indicating possible
infection.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unusual results are obtained, check instrument calibration and
function.
• Ensure that all reagents are within expiration date.
• Repeat assay if pipetting errors or procedural mistakes are
suspected.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Kit Insert for the Enzyme Immunoassay.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant internal laboratory manuals and quality guidelines.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document version and date of implementation.
• Outline any changes made in subsequent revisions in terms of
procedures or reagent use.
This protocol ensures the standardized processing of Syphilis IgG
antibody testing using Enzyme Immunoassay, ensuring accurate and
reliable results for patient care.
