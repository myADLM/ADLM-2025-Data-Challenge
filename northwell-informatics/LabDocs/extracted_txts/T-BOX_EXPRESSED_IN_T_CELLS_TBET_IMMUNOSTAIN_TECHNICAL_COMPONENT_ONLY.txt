Protocol for Generating Results for T-BOX EXPRESSED IN T
CELLS (TBET) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidelines for the
preparation, staining, and analysis of slides for detecting the
expression of T-BET in tissue samples using immunohistochemistry
(IHC).
Responsibility:
Designated lab personnel will perform all steps described within this
procedure, including sample preparation, immunostaining, and initial
analysis.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Unstained tissue sections on positively charged glass slides cut at
4-5 microns.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have not been fixed in formalin.
• Tissue sections that are thicker or thinner than specified.
• Broken or improperly labeled slides.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Primary antibody against T-BET (validated for IHC use).
• Secondary antibody (biotinylated or conjugated to an enzyme).
• Detection reagent (e.g., DAB, or other suitable chromogen).
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin).
• Xylene and ethanol.
• Automated immunostainer (if available).
• Positive and negative control slides.
4. EQUIPMENT:
• Microtome.
• Blade for microtome.
• Water bath.
• Slide warmer.
• Automated or manual staining device.
• Light microscope.
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Cut tissue sections at 4-5 microns from the FFPE tissue block.
2. Float sections onto a water bath set at 40-45°C.
3. Pick up sections on positively charged glass slides and allow
them to dry overnight at room temperature or on a slide warmer
at 37-42°C for 1-2 hours.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in a staining rack.
2. Deparaffinize by immersing slides in xylene or xylene
substitute, two changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate slides by passing them through graded ethanol
(100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) for 3-5 minutes per step.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval by heating slides in a suitable antigen
retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a microwave,
pressure cooker, or steamer for the recommended time.
2. Cool the slides to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
D) Immunostaining:
1. Incubate the slides with a peroxidase block solution to quench
endogenous peroxidase activity for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse the slides in buffer solution (e.g., phosphate-buffered
saline [PBS]).
3. Incubate the slides with a protein block solution to prevent
nonspecific binding for 10 minutes.
4. Incubate the slides with the primary antibody against T-BET at
the recommended dilution (as specified in the antibody
datasheet) for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
5. Rinse the slides in buffer solution.
6. Incubate the slides with the secondary antibody for 30 minutes
at room temperature.
7. Rinse the slides in buffer solution.
8. Incubate the slides in the chromogen solution (e.g., DAB) until
appropriate color development is observed (usually 5-10
minutes).
9. Rinse the slides in distilled water.
E) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain the slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse the slides in running tap water until water runs clear.
3. Blot slides dry.
F) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate the slides by passing them through graded ethanol
(70%, 80%, 95%, 100%) for 1-2 minutes per step.
2. Clear the slides in xylene or xylene substitute for 2 changes, 5
minutes each.
3. Mount coverslips using a synthetic mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive control slides known to express T-BET and
negative control slides (no primary antibody) in each run.
2. Document the staining quality and any discrepancies observed.
3. Resolve any issues encountered during staining, including
troubleshooting as needed.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Scan the slides using a microscope to confirm the presence
and intensity of T-BET staining.
2. Record the staining results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) as "Technical Component Only," which means that the
slides are stained but have not been interpreted.
3. Forward the stained slides to the pathologist for interpretation.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the primary antibody reagent.
• Laboratory’s internal guidelines for IHC procedures.
By adhering to this protocol, the laboratory ensures accurate and
consistent staining of tissue samples for T-BET, facilitating the
diagnostic process for pathologists.
