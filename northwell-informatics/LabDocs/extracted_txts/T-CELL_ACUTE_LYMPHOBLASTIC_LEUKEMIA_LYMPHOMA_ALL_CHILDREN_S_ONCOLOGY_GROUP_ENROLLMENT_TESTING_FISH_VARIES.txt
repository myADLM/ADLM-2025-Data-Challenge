Standard Operating Procedure
T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma (ALL) - Children's Oncology
Group Enrollment Testing, FISH
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized operating procedure for performing T-Cell
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (ALL) Children’s
Oncology Group enrollment testing using Fluorescent In Situ
Hybridization (FISH).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
all required steps in the FISH analysis for T-Cell ALL, including
sample preparation, hybridization, washing, detection, and result
interpretation. All results must be meticulously documented, and any
discrepancies must be reported to the laboratory supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood collected in a lithium
heparin or sodium heparin tube.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Samples with hemolysis, clots, or improper labeling.
Ensure that specimens are transported and stored at 2-8°C until
processing. Specimens should be processed within 24-48 hours of
collection.
4. PRINCIPLE
FISH is a molecular cytogenetic technique used to detect and
localize the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences on
chromosomes. For T-Cell ALL, this method identifies chromosomal
abnormalities that are common in leukemia/lymphoma.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Hybridization chamber
• Incubator
• Fluorescent microscope
• DNA probes specific to T-Cell ALL abnormalities (e.g., TCR, MYC,
etc.)
• Denaturation buffer
• Hybridization buffer
• Wash buffers
• Detection reagents (fluorochromes)
6. REAGENTS
• Precipitated DNA probes specific to ALL
• Formamide (deionized)
• 20X SSC (Saline Sodium Citrate)
• 2X SSC
• NP-40
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%)
• DAPI counterstain
• Mounting medium
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Prepare microscope slides by thoroughly cleaning and drying.
2. Label the slides clearly with patient identification information.
Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
sample at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
2. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of
0.075 M KCl. Incubate at 37°C for 20 minutes to achieve
hypotonic treatment.
3. Fix cells by adding 2-3 drops of freshly prepared cold fixative
(methanol:acetic acid, 3:1). Mix gently and add additional
fixative until the volume is 5 mL.
4. Centrifuge the suspension at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
5. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL
of fixative.
6. Drop 2-3 drops of cell suspension onto a clean, labeled slide.
Allow to air-dry.
Denaturation and Hybridization:
1. Prepare denaturation buffer (70% formamide, 2X SSC, pH
7.0-8.0).
2. Denature the specimen slide by incubating in denaturation
buffer at 72°C for 2 minutes.
3. Immediately immerse the slide in cold 70% ethanol for 5
minutes. Dehydrate through a series of ethanol washes (70%,
85%, 100%) for 2 minutes each.
4. Apply the FISH probe mixture to the sample area of the slide
and cover with a coverslip.
5. Co-denature the slide with the probe by heating at 73°C for 2
minutes in a hybridization chamber.
6. Hybridize the slide overnight at 37°C.
Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Prepare wash buffer (0.4X SSC, 0.3% NP-40).
2. Wash the slide in a pre-warmed wash buffer at 73°C for 2
minutes.
3. Rinse in 2X SSC, 0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1
minute.
4. Air-dry the slide completely in the dark.
Counterstaining:
1. Apply DAPI counterstain to the hybridized area and cover with
a cover slip.
2. Seal the edges of the coverslip with nail polish.
Microscopy and Analysis:
1. Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with the appropriate filters for the fluorochrome used.
2. Analyze cells to identify and count the number of normal and
abnormal hybridization signals as specified by the probe set.
3. Document findings, including the percentage of cells with
abnormal hybridization signals.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
tests.
• Ensure probe validation by using characterized control samples.
• Document temperature and humidity conditions during sample
processing.
• Review and confirm initial results independently by a second
qualified technologist.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified before official reporting.
• Include an interpretation of findings, detailing the chromosomal
abnormalities detected.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• FISH may not detect all chromosomal abnormalities or
submicroscopic deletions.
• Interpretation may be complicated by overlapping signals in highly
proliferative samples.
• Ensure thorough understanding of reagent limitations and probe
specificity as outlined in the manufacturer’s insert.

• Manufacturer’s insert for the specific FISH probe kit used.
• Current clinical guidelines for FISH analysis in T-Cell ALL from
relevant authoritative bodies.
