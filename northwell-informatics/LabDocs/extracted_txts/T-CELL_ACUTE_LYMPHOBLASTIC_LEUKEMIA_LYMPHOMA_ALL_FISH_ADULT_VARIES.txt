Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for T-
CELL ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA/LYMPHOMA (ALL),
FISH, ADULT, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to define the procedures necessary for
the accurate and efficient processing of fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) testing for T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma (ALL) in adult patients. This document outlines the steps
required for the preparation, analysis, and documentation of results,
ensuring compliance with regulatory guidelines and maintaining the
highest standards of quality and reliability.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the FISH testing procedures as outlined. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the accuracy of testing results and
ensuring proper corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
FISH: Fluorescence in situ hybridization is a molecular cytogenetic
technique used to identify and quantify specific DNA sequences
within a chromosome.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Requirements
◦ Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates are acceptable
specimens.
◦ Samples should be received in sterile containers, and
processed within 24 hours of collection.
◦ Ensure proper labeling of specimens with patient
identification, collection date, and time.
2. Fixation and Slide Preparation
◦ Fix cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood in Carnoy's
fixative (3:1 methanol to acetic acid).
◦ Prepare slides by applying fixed cells onto clean glass
slides.
◦ Allow slides to air dry at room temperature.
B. Hybridization
1. Probe Selection
◦ Select appropriate FISH probes targeting genes of interest
for T-cell ALL, as indicated in the patient’s clinical history.
2. Denaturation
◦ Denature DNA on slides in an 85°C solution of 70%
formamide in 2X SSC for 2 minutes.
◦ Dehydrate slides through an ethanol series (70%, 85%,
100%), and air dry.
3. Probe Hybridization
◦ Prepare the FISH probe mixture according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Apply 10 µL of the probe mixture to each slide and cover
with a coverslip.
◦ Perform hybridization in a humid chamber at 37°C overnight
(approximately 16-18 hours).
C. Post-Hybridization
1. Washing
◦ Remove coverslips and wash slides in post-hybridization
wash buffer at 72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 2X SSC at room temperature twice for 2
minutes each.
◦ Allow slides to air dry.
2. Counterstaining
◦ Apply DAPI counterstain (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to
each slide for nuclear visualization.
◦ Cover with coverslip and allow to dry.
D. Analysis
1. Microscopy
◦ Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filter sets for FISH probes and DAPI.
◦ Score a minimum of 200 interphase cells per sample for
signal enumeration.
2. Signal Interpretation
◦ Identify positive cells with the characteristic signal patterns
for T-cell ALL.
◦ Record the percentage of cells showing abnormal signal
patterns indicative of T-cell ALL.
E. Quality Control
1. Controls
◦ Include a positive control with known signal patterns and a
negative control with normal signal patterns in each batch of
tests.
◦ Record results of controls and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
2. Documentation
◦ Document all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS), including any anomalies or deviations from standard
protocols.
◦ Report any critical or unexpected results to the attending
clinician promptly.
F. Reporting Results
1. Verification
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a senior
technologist or supervisor before release.
◦ Ensure all patient results, control results, and data
calculations are correctly entered in the LIS.
2. Results Communication
◦ Relay verified results to the requesting physician through
secure electronic communication.
◦ Include a detailed interpretative report highlighting findings
and potential clinical implications.
