Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for T-
Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma (ALL), FISH, Pediatric
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for
performing Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis to
detect T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (ALL) in
pediatric patients. This protocol ensures that all procedures are
performed consistently, efficiently, and in compliance with regulatory
standards to produce accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory technologists and cytogeneticists are
responsible for performing the FISH analysis.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying the final
results and ensuring adherence to this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens
• Bone marrow aspirates
• Peripheral blood specimens
• Tissue biopsies
Collection and Handling
• Specimens must be collected in a sterile manner using a
heparinized collection tube.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately at
room temperature.
• Specimens received after 48 hours post-collection are
unacceptable.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FISH probes specific to T-Cell ALL markers such as specific gene
rearrangements, translocations, deletions, or amplifications.
• Fluorescently labeled DNA probes
• ThermoBrite or equivalent hybridization system
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters
• Centrifuge
• Humidity chamber
• Hybridization buffer
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol
• DAPI counterstain
• Wash buffers (e.g., SSC solutions)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-Hybridization
1. Prepare slides:
◦ Centrifuge blood or bone marrow samples at 500g for 10
minutes and discard the supernatant.
◦ Prepare a cell pellet from the specimen.
2. Fix cells:
◦ Add fixative (3:1 methanol:acetic acid) to the cell pellet and
resuspend.
◦ Place a drop of cell suspension onto a pre-cleaned glass
slide and air-dry.
5.2 Probe Preparation
1. Prepare the FISH probe according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
5.3 Co-Denaturation and Hybridization
1. Apply 10 µL of the denatured probe mixture to the target area
on the slide.
2. Cover with a glass coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
3. Place slides on a ThermoBrite unit heat at 73°C for 5 minutes
for co-denaturation.
4. Hybridize at 37°C for 16-18 hours in a humidified chamber.
5.4 Post-Hybridization Wash
1. Remove coverslips carefully.
2. Wash slides in 2X SSC at 73°C for 5 minutes.
3. Perform additional washes in 1X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 5 minutes.
4. Rinse briefly in distilled water.
5.5 Counterstaining and Visualization
1. Apply DAPI counterstain to the slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip.
3. Visualize under a fluorescence microscope equipped with
appropriate filters.
4. Examine a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei or 20 metaphase
spreads per case.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Identify positive and negative signal patterns according to probe
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Record and score the signals meticulously.
3. Compare with control samples to validate results.
4. Document findings and review with a senior cytogeneticist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Ensure reagents are within their expiry dates.
• Review slide quality and probe performance regularly.
• Perform inter- and intra-laboratory comparisons periodically.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record raw data in the laboratory information system.
2. Prepare a detailed report including:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Type of specimen
◦ Probes used
◦ Number of cells analyzed
◦ Results including positive or negative findings for T-Cell ALL
markers
3. Results must be reviewed and validated by a licensed
cytogeneticist.
4. Communicate critical result findings to the requesting physician
immediately.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated whenever
necessary by the Laboratory Director.
