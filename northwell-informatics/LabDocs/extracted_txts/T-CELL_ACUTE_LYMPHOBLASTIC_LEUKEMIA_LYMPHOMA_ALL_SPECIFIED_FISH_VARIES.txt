Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma (ALL) Specified FISH, Varies
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect specified genetic markers
in T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (ALL). This
ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the laboratory
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to adhere
to this SOP for performing and analyzing the FISH test on T-Cell ALL
samples. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any issues that arise.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all T-Cell ALL FISH analyses performed in
the laboratory using validated probe sets and following established
protocols for hybridization, washing, and analysis.
3. DEFINITIONS
-FISH: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization -T-Cell ALL: T-Cell Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood with sufficient quality
and quantity.
• Specimens should be freshly collected and processed promptly.
• Specimens must be stored and transported at 4°C if processing is
delayed more than 2 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets
• Hybridization workstation
• Slide preparation area
• FISH probe sets specific to T-Cell ALL genetic markers
• Pretreatment kit (e.g., pepsin solution, saline-sodium citrate
(SSC) buffer)
• Denaturation and hybridization buffers
• Wash buffers (e.g., SSC, Nonidet P-40 (NP-40))
• Mounting medium with DAPI (or other appropriate counterstain)
• Immersion oil (for microscopy)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Slide Preparation
1. Prepare slides with interphase or metaphase cell spreads from
the specimen.
2. Dehydrate slides with ascending ethanol series (70%, 85%,
100%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Allow slides to air dry completely.
6.2. Pretreatment
1. Immerse slides in preheated pretreatment solution at 37°C for
10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in 2X SSC buffer for 5 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Treat slides with pepsin solution for 10 minutes at 37°C.
4. Rinse slides in 2X SSC buffer for 5 minutes.
5. Fix slides in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes.
6. Dehydrate slides through ascending ethanol series (as
described above). Air dry.
6.3. Denaturation and Hybridization
1. Denature DNA by immersing slides into denaturation buffer at
73°C for 5 minutes.
2. Immediately transfer slides to ice-cold 70% ethanol, then
dehydrate through the ethanol series again.
3. Apply appropriate FISH probe (approx. 10 µL of probe solution)
to the target area on each slide.
4. Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
5. Place slides in a hybridization chamber and incubate at 37°C
overnight (16-18 hours).
6.4. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove coverslips by gently soaking slides in 2X SSC buffer.
2. Wash slides in 0.4X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 73°C for 2 minutes.
3. Follow with a room-temperature wash in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40
for 1 minute.
4. Air dry the slides in the dark.
6.5. Counterstain and Mount
1. Apply DAPI-containing mounting medium and cover with a
coverslip.
2. Seal coverslips with clear nail polish.
3. Allow to dry completely in the dark.
7. IMAGE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
1. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope at the
appropriate magnification using appropriate filter sets.
2. Capture images of multiple fields (typically a minimum of 200
interphase cells).
3. Analyze signals for each probe, noting the presence, absence,
or rearrangement of target sequences.
4. Document findings according to laboratory guidelines.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of slides.
• If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, review the entire
procedure and repeat the test if necessary.
• Record and maintain all QC data, and take corrective actions as
needed.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Validate results and ensure the accuracy of reported data.
• Include interpretation of positive results and potential clinical
implications.
• Communicate critical findings directly to the requesting physician
as per laboratory policy.
10. SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling
specimens and chemicals.
• Dispose of waste materials following biohazard guidelines.
For any deviations from this procedure, the technologist must consult
the supervising pathologist or laboratory manager for guidance.
