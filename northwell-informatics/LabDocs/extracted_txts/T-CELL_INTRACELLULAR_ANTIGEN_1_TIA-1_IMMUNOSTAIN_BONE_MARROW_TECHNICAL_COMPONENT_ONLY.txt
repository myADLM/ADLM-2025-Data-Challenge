Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for T-Cell Intracellular Antigen 1
(TIA-1) Immunostain, Bone Marrow, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for T-Cell Intracellular Antigen 1 (TIA-1) Immunostain in bone marrow
to ensure accurate and reliable results. This protocol applies to the
technical component only and assumes that the specimen has
already been collected, received, and accessioned.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing
the TIA-1 immunostain on bone marrow specimens in the laboratory.
It covers the handling, preparation, staining, and quality control
measures necessary for the interpretation of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the
TIA-1 immunostain according to this SOP and for initial quality
control measures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any issues related to equipment, reagents,
or procedures.
• Designated Personnel will maintain records of quality control
and validate the stain performance as required.
4. DEFINITIONS
• TIA-1: T-Cell Intracellular Antigen 1, a cytotoxic granule-
associated RNA binding protein.
• Immunostaining: A laboratory technique that uses antibodies to
detect specific antigens in tissues or cells.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• TIA-1 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (appropriate to the primary antibody used)
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated detection kit)
• Bone marrow specimen slides
• PBS buffer
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Microscopy equipment
6. SPECIMEN PREPARATION
1. Slide Preparation: Ensure bone marrow specimen slides are
properly labeled with patient identification.
2. Fixation: Fix slides in freshly prepared, chilled acetone or cold
methanol for 10 minutes.
3. Drying: Allow slides to air dry completely at room temperature.
7. STAINING PROCEDURE
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour to melt the
paraffin.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes
each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, and 70%) for 3 minutes each, followed by rinsing in
distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) by
heating slides in a microwave or pressure cooker for 20
minutes. Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes and
wash slides in PBS.
3. Blocking:
◦ Incubate sections with blocking buffer for 10 minutes to
reduce non-specific binding.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with TIA-1 primary antibody diluted in
antibody diluent for 60 minutes at room temperature.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each to
remove excess primary antibody.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody to slides and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
7. Washing:
◦ Wash slides again in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
8. Detection:
◦ Apply the detection system according to the manufacturer's
instructions and incubate for the appropriate time period.
9. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water.
10. Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol and
clear in xylene.
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslips.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive Control:
◦ Include a slide of known positive tissue to ensure staining
procedure and reagents are working properly.
2. Negative Control:
◦ Include a slide where the primary antibody is omitted to rule
out non-specific staining.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document all steps, including any deviations from the SOP,
in the laboratory logbook.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Microscopic Evaluation:
◦ Evaluate the immunostained slides under a microscope for
TIA-1 expression.
◦ Identify the presence and pattern of staining in the bone
marrow sample.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document the staining results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Provide technical findings to the pathologist or clinician for
final interpretation and diagnostic reporting.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Non-Specific Staining:
◦ Review blocking steps and primary antibody dilutions.
◦ Validate the proper washing technique.
2. Weak Staining:
◦ Verify the antigen retrieval process.
◦ Check for proper reagent storage and expiration dates.
3. No Staining:
◦ Ensure antibody is specific and functional by testing on
known positive control slides.
