Standard Operating Procedure for T-Cell Intracellular
Antigen 1 (TIA-1) Immunostain, Technical Component
Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for T-Cell Intracellular Antigen 1 (TIA-1)
immunostain. This includes detailed steps for the technical
component which encompasses slide preparation, staining, and
quality control elements to ensure accurate immunohistochemistry
results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
TIA-1 immunostain procedures within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for preparing, staining,
and initial evaluation of slides.
• Laboratory Technologist/Supervisor: Responsible for verifying
the results, performing quality control, and documentation of the
procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimens: Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissue
sections, cut at 3-5 micrometers, mounted on positively charged
slides.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are improperly fixed,
inadequately embedded, or have noticeable tissue degradation.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Positively charged slides
• Automated or manual immunostaining platform
• TIA-1 primary antibody (validated for use in
immunohistochemistry)
• Secondary antibody and detection system
• Appropriate wash buffers (e.g., Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS))
• Mounting medium
6. PROCEDURE
A) SLIDE PREPARATION
1. Sectioning Tissue: Cut 3-5 µm sections using a microtome
and mount onto positively charged slides. Allow to dry overnight
at 37-40°C or bake at 60°C for 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Heat slides at 60°C for 15 minutes.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) each
for 2 minutes, followed by a rinse in distilled water.
B) IMMUNOSTAINING PROCEDURE
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) in a pressure
cooker or microwave. Let slides cool in the buffer and rinse
in distilled water.
2. Blocking Step (Optional, if using a detection system that
requires blocking):
◦ Incubate slides with a blocking solution for 10 minutes to
prevent non-specific binding.
3. Primary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply TIA-1 primary antibody to the sections ensuring
complete coverage and incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS for 2x3 minutes.
5. Secondary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to
manufacturer’s instructions (typically 20-30 minutes).
6. Detection System:
◦ Apply the detection system reagent and incubate as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
7. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB) until desired staining intensity
is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
8. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to
counterstain.
9. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and
xylene.
◦ Mount with permanent mounting medium and cover slips.
C) QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Include a tissue section known to express
TIA-1 as a positive control on each run.
• Negative Control: Use a section treated in the same manner but
omitting the primary antibody to check for non-specific staining.
• Review: Document staining quality, adjust protocol parameters if
necessary, and report any significant variances to the supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) as
soon as staining quality is verified.
• Verify slide labeling and ensure all necessary quality control
measures have been met before final result review by the
pathologist.
