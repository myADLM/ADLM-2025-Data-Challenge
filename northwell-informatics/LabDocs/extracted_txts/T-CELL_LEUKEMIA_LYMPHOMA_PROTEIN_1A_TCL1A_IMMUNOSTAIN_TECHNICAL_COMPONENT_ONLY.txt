Protocol for Analytical Phase of TCL1A Immunostain - Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To accurately determine the presence of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
protein 1A (TCL1A) by immunohistochemical staining in tissue
sections.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
immunostaining as outlined within the protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the quality and
accuracy of the results generated.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the immunohistochemical staining of
TCL1A for diagnostic purposes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections.
4. DEFINITIONS
TCL1A: T-cell leukemia/lymphoma protein 1A FFPE: Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded
5. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• FFPE tissue sections (4-5 micrometer thick)
• Positive and negative control slides
• TCL1A primary antibody (as per manufacturer specifications)
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated, as per manufacturer
specifications)
• Detection system (DAB or similar chromogen)
• Counterstain (Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Xylene and ethanol for deparaffinization and rehydration
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g. citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocking buffer
• Washing buffer (e.g., PBS or TBS)
6. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Slide warmers
• Water bath
• Automated stainer (if applicable)
• Light microscope
• Incubator (37°C)
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation of Slides
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adherence.
◦ Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 3 x 5
minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2
minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer,
pH 6.0).
◦ Heat in a microwave or pressure cooker according to
antigen retrieval protocol.
◦ Allow slides to cool in buffer to room temperature.
◦ Rinse in distilled water and then in washing buffer.
7.2 Immunostaining Procedure
1. Blocking:
◦ Cover sections with blocking buffer to prevent non-specific
binding.
◦ Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides with washing buffer.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the TCL1A primary antibody to cover the tissue
sections.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time (typically 30 minutes to
1 hour) at 37°C or as specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Rinse in washing buffer.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in washing buffer.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB or similar chromogen to the sections.
◦ Monitor color development under a microscope to reach
desired staining intensity.
◦ Rinse thoroughly in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in Hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse in tap water until sections appear blue.
◦ Perform a quick dip in an acid alcohol differentiator if
necessary.
7.3 Final Steps
1. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene.
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include the positive and negative control with each batch of
slides stained.
◦ Ensure controls show appropriate staining patterns.
8. INTERPRETATION
• Evaluate the presence and intensity of TCL1A staining under a
light microscope.
• Compare patient tissue with controls to ensure the accuracy of
staining.
• Document findings in the laboratory reporting system.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Complete the Immunohistochemistry Staining Log, noting:
• Date and batch number
• Antibodies used, lot number, and expiration date
• Results of positive and negative controls
• Any deviations from protocol and corrective actions taken
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all reagents and antibodies used.
• Laboratory’s Quality Control and Assurance guidelines for
immunohistochemistry.
• Relevant literature and protocols for TCL1A immunostaining.
