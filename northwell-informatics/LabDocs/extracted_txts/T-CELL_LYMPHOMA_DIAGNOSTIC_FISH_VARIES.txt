Standard Operating Procedure for Diagnostic FISH
Analysis for T-Cell Lymphoma
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for conducting Fluorescence
In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis to diagnose T-Cell Lymphoma in
patient samples, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analysis and
interpretation of FISH for the diagnosis of T-Cell Lymphoma.
3. DEFINITION
FISH is a molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent
probes to detect and localize specific DNA sequences on
chromosomes, aiding in the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities
associated with T-Cell Lymphoma.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Supervisor: To ensure procedures are followed,
including quality control and result validation.
• Laboratory Technologist: To perform all steps of the FISH
analysis according to this SOP.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
1. Sample Type: Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, or
biopsy tissue from lymph nodes.
2. Sample Collection:
◦ Peripheral Blood/Bone Marrow Aspirate: Heparinized tubes.
◦ Biopsy Tissue: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
3. Handling and Storage: Samples should be transported at
room temperature. Blood and bone marrow samples should be
processed within 24 hours of collection. FFPE tissues can be
stored at room temperature.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
1. Equipment:
◦ Fluorescence Microscope
◦ Hybridization Chamber
◦ Water Bath
◦ Thermocycler (if applicable)
2. Reagents:
◦ FISH Probe specific for T-Cell Lymphoma markers (e.g.,
TCR gene rearrangements)
◦ Hybridization Buffer
◦ Rinse Solution (e.g., SSC buffer)
◦ Mounting Medium with DAPI
3. Supplies:
◦ Glass Slides
◦ Coverslips
◦ Pipettes and Tips
◦ Kimwipes
7. PROCEDURE
1. Pre-Hybridization:
◦ Sample Preparation:
▪ Peripheral Blood/Bone Marrow: Prepare slides by
spreading a thin layer of sample.
▪ FFPE Tissues: Cut 4-5 µm thick tissue sections and
place on slides. Deparaffinize and rehydrate slides using
standard protocols.
2. Denaturation:
◦ Denature sample DNA and FISH probes at 73°C for 5
minutes in a hybridization chamber or thermocycler.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Apply FISH probe to the sample slide.
◦ Cover with coverslip and seal with rubber cement or nail
varnish.
◦ Place slides in a humidified hybridization chamber and
incubate overnight at 37°C.
4. Post-Hybridization Washes:
◦ Remove coverslip and wash slides in 2x SSC at 45°C for 5
minutes.
◦ Rinse in 0.5x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1
minute.
◦ Rinse briefly in water to remove salts and detergents.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply DAPI-containing mounting medium to stain nuclei.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal the edges.
6. Visualization:
◦ Analyze slides under a fluorescence microscope using
appropriate filters.
◦ Identify and count FISH signals in at least 200 nuclei to
determine the presence or absence of T-Cell Lymphoma
genetic markers.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure the accuracy of the FISH procedure.
• Document all control results and any deviation from expected
outcomes.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of fluorescence
microscope to ensure optimal performance.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Interpretation:
◦ Assess the presence, absence, or pattern of fluorescence
signals in patient samples.
◦ Positive result: abnormal signal patterns indicating a
rearrangement or aneuploidy.
◦ Negative result: normal signal pattern.
2. Reporting:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system.
◦ Review and verify results by a certified laboratory
technologist.
◦ Report findings to the ordering physician with relevant
clinical interpretation.
