SOP: FISH Analysis for T-Cell Lymphoma Using Tissue Specimens
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of
chromosomal abnormalities associated with T-cell lymphoma using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on tissue specimens.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document all steps of the procedure accurately.
• Lab supervisors are responsible to ensure personnel are trained
and adhere to the SOP, and address any procedural deviations or
technical issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION
FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) is a cytogenetic technique
that uses fluorescent probes that bind to specific parts of the
chromosome. FISH is used here to identify chromosomal
abnormalities associated with T-cell lymphoma in tissue samples.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Fresh tissue biopsy stored in RPMI medium at 4°C (to be
processed within 24 hours).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or lack clear identification.
• FFPE tissue blocks that have been stored for more than 5 years,
which may result in inferior data quality.
• Tissue specimens with extensive fixation artifacts.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Hotplate
• FISH workstation including fluorescent microscope
• Automated hybridization system (optional)
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (various grades)
• Protease
• Buffer solutions (PBS, SSC, etc.)
• FISH probes specific for T-cell lymphoma markers (e.g., ALK,
TCL1A, 6q, etc.)
• Fluorescence-labeled detection systems
• Mounting medium with antifade properties
Supplies:
• Slides and cover slips
• Laboratory-grade paper towels
• Pipettes and pipette tips
1. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5µm sections from the FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C and mount on
charged slides.
◦ Allow slides to dry at room temperature for 30 minutes, then
place on a hotplate at 60°C for 1 hour.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene
for 2 changes of 10 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate by sequentially immersing slides in:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 changes of 5 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol for 5 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 5 minutes
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes
C) Pre-Treatment and Protease Digestion
1. Immerse slides in pre-warmed citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and
incubate in a microwave for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer slides to room temperature PBS for 5 minutes.
3. Digest tissue with protease solution at 37°C for a time
optimized for the specific tissue type (typically 10-30 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in distilled water and air dry.
D) Denaturation and Hybridization
1. Apply the FISH probe to the tissue section. Cover with a
coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
2. Denature the probe and target DNA together at 75-80°C for 5
minutes on a heating block or hybridizer.
3. Hybridize in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 12-16 hours.
E) Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove coverslips and wash slides in 0.4xSSC at 72°C for 2
minutes.
2. Wash slides in 2xSSC containing 0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 1 minute.
3. Air dry the slides in the dark.
F) Detection and Counterstaining
1. Apply fluorescence-labeled detection reagents according to
probe manufacturer instructions.
2. Counterstain with DAPI or another appropriate nuclear stain.
3. Mount with antifade mounting medium and cover with coverslip.
G) Microscopy and Analysis
1. Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped with
the appropriate filters.
2. Analyze a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei per case.
3. Document the number of cells showing the abnormal signal
pattern indicative of T-cell lymphoma.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use known positive and negative control slides with each run to
ensure the accuracy of the FISH assay.
• Review slides for technical adequacy (e.g., proper hybridization,
absence of autofluorescence).
• Record and address any deviations or technical issues
encountered during the procedure.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Generate a report summarizing the findings, including:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Specimen type
◦ Probes used
◦ Number of cells analyzed
◦ Results (e.g., number and percentage of cells with abnormal
signals)
◦ Interpretation and clinical relevance
Results are to be reviewed and signed off by a qualified laboratory
supervisor before being reported to the clinician.
