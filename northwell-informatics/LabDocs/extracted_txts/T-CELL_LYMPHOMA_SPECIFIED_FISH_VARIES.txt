Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for T-Cell Lymphoma,
Specified FISH Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standardized procedures
for the analytical phase of generating results for T-cell lymphoma
through the use of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel, such as medical laboratory
scientists, cytogenetic technologists, and laboratory supervisors, are
responsible for performing FISH analysis and generating test results
as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff involved to ensure
accuracy, precision, and compliance with the established protocols.
1. DEFINITION
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic
technique used to detect and localize the presence or absence of
specific DNA sequences on chromosomes. This protocol specifically
addresses the FISH analysis for T-cell lymphoma, a type of non-
Hodgkin lymphoma.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Ensure that specimen has been collected, received, and
accessioned following the laboratory's standard specimen
handling protocols.
2. Verify patient identity, specimen type, and appropriate
documentation.
3. Use fresh or appropriately fixed tissue samples, such as lymph
node biopsies, peripheral blood, or bone marrow aspirates, as
specified.
4. Prepare slides with fixed specimens and undergo pretreatment
processes specific to the type of specimen.
B. Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinize fixed tissue sections (if applicable) using xylene
and ethanol series or other validated methods.
2. Perform enzymatic digestion or heat treatment to expose target
DNA sequences in cells.
3. Treat slides with a wash buffer and apply a denaturation step to
denature double-stranded DNA.
C. Probe Hybridization
1. Select appropriate probes specific for T-cell lymphoma FISH
analysis, ensuring probes are properly labeled with
fluorophores.
2. Apply the labeled probe mixture to the slides, cover with a glass
coverslip, and seal edges to prevent drying out.
3. Incubate slides in a hybridization chamber at the appropriate
temperature (typically 37°C) for the validated duration, allowing
the probes to hybridize to the target DNA sequences.
D. Post-Hybridization Washing
1. Carefully remove coverslips and wash slides to remove excess
unbound probes using appropriate wash buffers and conditions.
2. Perform a series of washes at different stringencies to ensure
specific binding of probes.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Apply a counterstain such as DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole) to visualize cell nuclei.
2. Mount cover slips onto slides using an anti-fade reagent to
preserve fluorescence signals.
3. Allow slides to dry properly before analysis.
F. Visualization and Analysis
1. Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped with
appropriate filter sets for the fluorophores used.
2. Systematically evaluate and record images of hybridized cells,
identifying specific signal patterns indicative of T-cell lymphoma.
3. Analyze signals with respect to normal controls and validate the
presence or absence of specific genetic abnormalities.
4. Document findings carefully, ensuring clear differentiation
between normal and abnormal signal patterns.
G. Documentation and Reporting Results
1. Record all observations and quantitative results in the
laboratory information system (LIS) and include images where
relevant.
2. Verify results by a second qualified technologist or
cytogeneticist, if required by laboratory policy.
3. Prepare a detailed report summarizing findings, including
interpretation of FISH results in context with the diagnosis of T-
cell lymphoma.
4. Ensure that final reports are reviewed and signed off by
supervisory staff or laboratory medical director before release.
H. Quality Control
1. Use positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
analyzed.
2. Follow established guidelines for internal and external quality
control measures.
3. Record and review control results for each run to ensure
reliability of the assay.
4. Resolve any discrepancies or issues that arise according to
laboratory protocols and document corrective actions taken.
I. Equipment Maintenance
1. Regularly maintain and calibrate fluorescence microscopy
equipment according to manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Document routine maintenance and any repairs performed on
instrumentation.

and reagents used, and applicable standards for FISH analysis in
diagnosing T-cell lymphoma.
