Title: Standard Operating Procedure: T-Cell Receptor Beta (TCR
Beta F1) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase of generating results for the T-Cell
Receptor Beta (TCR Beta F1) immunostain, focusing solely on the
technical component. This protocol ensures that the staining process
is performed consistently, accurately, and in compliance with the
relevant regulations and standards.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing TCR Beta F1
immunostain in the laboratory. It outlines the responsibilities,
specimen requirements, equipment, reagents, and detailed
procedural steps necessary to complete the immunostaining process
accurately.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
TCR Beta F1 immunostain as outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure the integrity of the test and to
report any deviations or issues to their supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen Types: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections.
• Unacceptable Specimen Types: Specimens that are inadequately
fixed, improperly processed, or not embedded in paraffin.
• Specimen Handling: Ensure that FFPE tissue sections are
properly labeled, stored, and handled to avoid any contamination
or mix-up.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody: TCR Beta F1 (optimized and validated for use
in the laboratory)
• Detection System: Appropriate secondary antibody and detection
reagents (e.g., HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, DAB
chromogen)
• Automated or Manual Staining System: Prepare and operate as
per manufacturer’s instructions
• Microscope: For visualizing stained tissue sections
• Positive and Negative Control Tissue: To validate the staining run
• Other Consumables: Slides, cover slips, mounting medium,
forceps, staining jars, and appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Confirm the identity and adequacy of the specimen.
2. Cut 4-5 micron thick sections from the FFPE tissue blocks
using a microtome.
3. Place the sections on positively charged glass slides and dry
them at 60°C for 1 hour.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5
minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place the slides in a preheated antigen retrieval buffer (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer, pH 8.0) and heat in a
microwave, pressure cooker, or steamer.
2. Allow slides to cool down at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS or TBS buffer.
D) Blocking:
1. Incubate slides with a protein block (e.g., non-serum based
blocking reagent) for 10 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
E) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate slides with the primary TCR Beta F1 antibody in a
humidified chamber. The optimal dilution and incubation time/
temperature should follow laboratory-validated protocols (e.g.,
1:100 dilution for 60 minutes at room temperature).
F) Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
2. Incubate slides with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
for the recommended time.
3. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
4. Develop with DAB chromogen according to manufacturer’s
instructions, monitoring under a microscope for optimal color
development.
5. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
G) Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water followed by distilled water.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
4. Mount with a compatible mounting medium and cover slips.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run
to validate the performance of the assay.
• Document all quality control results in the appropriate logbook.
• Review staining results under a microscope to confirm adequate
staining and specificity.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results from the technical component of the TCR Beta F1
immunostain will be visually assessed for staining quality.
• Document findings and communicate any discrepancies or issues
to the supervising pathologist.
• Follow the laboratory’s protocol for recording and reporting
technical outcomes.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the TCR Beta F1
antibody and detection system.
• Refer to laboratory guidelines for immunohistochemistry
procedures.
• Consult relevant literature and guidelines for TCR Beta F1
immunostaining in diagnostic pathology.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete all required logbooks, worksheets, and reports for
specimen processing, staining, and quality control.
• Maintain records of all equipment maintenance and calibration
relevant to the staining procedure.
1. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary when changes
occur in methodologies, reagents, equipment, or regulations.
