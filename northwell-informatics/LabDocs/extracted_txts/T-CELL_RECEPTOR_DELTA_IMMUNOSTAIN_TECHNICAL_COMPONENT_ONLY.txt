Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure for
T-Cell Receptor Delta Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for the T-Cell receptor
delta immunostain (Technical Component Only) to ensure
consistently accurate and reliable results.
2. PRINCIPLE This procedure outlines the steps necessary to
perform the T-Cell receptor delta immunostain. The results will
be reviewed technically for quality and completeness but will
not include interpretive reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained medical
laboratory scientists to conduct and document this procedure
according to the established protocol. Lab supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance and documentation
accuracy.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Section thickness: 3-4 micrometers.
Any sections that are improperly prepared or compromised should be
rejected and noted in the documentation.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Anti-TCR delta
• Secondary antibody: Suitable biotinylated or enzyme-conjugated
secondary antibody
• Detection system reagents: DAB substrate kit or equivalent
chromogen
• Mounting medium: Neutral mounting medium
• Positive control slides: Known T-cell receptor delta-positive tissue
• Negative control slides: Known T-cell receptor delta-negative
tissue
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Immunostainer (if automated) or staining racks for manual
procedure
• Humidity chamber
• Light microscope
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Retrieve the FFPE tissue block and cut sections at 3-4
micrometers using the microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 45°C and meticulously mount
onto positively charged slides.
3. Dry slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour to ensure adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by placing them in three
changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
80%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in deionized water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0)
and heat in a microwave or pressure cooker as per kit
instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Blocking:
1. Incubate slides with a blocking solution (e.g., 5% normal serum)
for 10 minutes to prevent nonspecific binding.
2. Gently blot around the sections to remove the blocking solution.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the primary anti-TCR delta antibody to each section,
ensuring even coverage.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber for 1 hour at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C.
3. Rinse slides three times with PBS or TBS for 5 minutes each.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the appropriate secondary antibody to each section
ensuring even coverage.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides three times with PBS or TBS for 5 minutes each.
G. Chromogen Development:
1. Apply the development solution (e.g., DAB substrate) to each
section.
2. Incubate until adequate color development is observed under
the microscope (typically 5-10 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
H. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. If required, blue slides in a brief dip of ammonium water, then
rinse in tap water.
I. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (80%, 95%, 100%) for
3 minutes each.
2. Clear in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
3. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative control slides with each batch to ensure
validity.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during staining.
• Microscopically examine all slides to verify correct staining quality
and absence of artifacts.
1. REPORTING
• Technically review the slides for correct staining and artifacts.
• Document the completion of the procedure and submit slides for
pathologist’s review (interpretation is not performed by the
technical lab staff).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all samples processed and results of quality
control measures.
• Document all lot numbers of reagents and solutions used,
ensuring traceability and compliance with Laboratory standards.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to related product inserts for reagent preparation, detailed
procedures, safety guidelines and troubleshooting guides.
