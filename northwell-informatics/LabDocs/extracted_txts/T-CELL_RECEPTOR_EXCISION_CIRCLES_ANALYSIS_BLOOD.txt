1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for the analytical phase of generating results for
T-Cell Receptor Excision Circles (TREC) analysis in blood samples.
This will ensure accurate and reliable quantification of TREC levels
using real-time PCR, facilitating appropriate clinical decision-making.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff perform and document the analysis as
defined in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any discrepancies or
issues encountered during the analysis to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
T-Cell Receptor Excision Circles (TREC) are small DNA by-products
formed during the maturation of T-cells in the thymus. The
quantification of TREC levels in peripheral blood is used as a
surrogate marker to assess thymic output and T-cell immune
reconstitution.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Preferred Specimen: - Peripheral whole blood collected in EDTA
(purple top) tubes. - Minimum volume: 3 mL.
3.2. Specimen Transport and Stability: - Samples should be
transported to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection. -
Samples are stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours. For
longer storage, refrigerate at 4°C for up to 7 days or freeze at -20°C if
further delay is expected.
3.3. Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed samples. - Samples with
insufficient volume. - Samples that have been stored at improper
conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System)
◦ DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen DNA Mini Kit)
◦ TREC quantitative PCR reagents (e.g., specific primers and
probes)
◦ PCR tubes, micropipettes, and appropriate lab consumables
◦ DNase/RNase-free water
◦ DNA standards for calibration
◦ Control samples (positive and negative controls)
2. PROCEDURE
5.1. DNA Extraction: - Perform DNA extraction from 200 µL of whole
blood using the designated DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's instructions. - Elute the DNA in 50 µL of elution buffer
and store at -20°C until ready for analysis.
5.2. PCR Setup: - Prepare the PCR master mix as per the kit
instructions, including TREC-specific primers, probes, and DNA
standards. - Aliquot 18 µL of master mix into each PCR tube or well
of the PCR plate. - Add 2 µL of extracted DNA to each tube or well,
ensuring thorough mixing without contamination. - Include positive
and negative controls in each run.
5.3. Real-Time PCR Cycling Conditions: - Initial denaturation: 95°C
for 10 minutes - Amplification (40 cycles): - Denaturation: 95°C for 15
seconds - Annealing and extension: 60°C for 1 minute - Data
acquisition at the end of each annealing/extension phase.
5.4. Data Analysis: - Analyze the PCR results using the real-time
PCR instrument's software. - Generate a standard curve from the
DNA standards and calculate the copy number of TREC in each
sample using this curve. - Review the amplification curves for the
controls to ensure assay validity before interpreting the patient
results.
5.5. Result Interpretation: - TREC concentration is expressed as
copies per 1 million cells. - Compare the measured TREC levels to
established reference ranges for interpretation. - Document any
anomalies or deviations encountered during the analysis and take
appropriate corrective actions.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with every batch of
samples to monitor the assay performance.
◦ Include internal standards and replicate samples to assess
assay reproducibility.
◦ Any deviations from expected control results should be
addressed by repeating the experiment and investigating
potential causes.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Transmit the results automatically to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
◦ Ensure all results are verified and approved by the
responsible technologist before release to the clinician.
◦ Critical values should be promptly communicated to the
relevant healthcare provider following laboratory protocol.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the specific TREC quantitative PCR reagent
package insert for potential limitations and troubleshooting
guidance.
◦ Be aware of potential interferences such as sample
contamination, suboptimal DNA extraction, and PCR
inhibitors.
