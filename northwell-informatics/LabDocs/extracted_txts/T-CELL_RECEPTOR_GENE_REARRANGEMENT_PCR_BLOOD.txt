Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for T-Cell Receptor Gene
Rearrangement by PCR (Blood Specimens)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for T-cell receptor gene
rearrangement by PCR from blood specimens. This protocol ensures
accurate, reproducible actions and results, thus guaranteeing quality
control throughout the testing process.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing PCR for T-cell receptor gene rearrangement according to
this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
deficiencies affecting test results and bring them to the attention of a
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
T-cell receptor gene rearrangement by PCR is a molecular diagnostic
test that identifies clonal T-cell populations in blood, which may be
indicative of lymphoproliferative disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: 5-10 mL of peripheral blood collected in an
EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Unacceptable: Specimens arriving in the laboratory that have
coagulated or have a significant proportion of hemolysis.
Specimens without collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition are not acceptable.
B. Extraction of DNA from Blood Specimens:
1. Start with ensuring all equipment and reagents are ready and
calibrated.
2. Use designated kits (e.g., Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit) for DNA
extraction, following the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Document specimen ID, date, and time of extraction in the
logbook.
C. PCR Setup:
1. Thaw reagents and ensure they are wholly mixed before use.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows:
◦ PCR Buffer
◦ dNTP Mix (Deoxynucleotide Triphosphate Mix)
◦ TCR gene rearrangement primers
◦ Taq polymerase
◦ Nuclease-free water
3. Aliquot the master mix into labeled PCR tubes.
4. Add extracted DNA to the tubes containing the PCR master
mix.
5. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
D. PCR Thermal Cycling:
1. Program the PCR machine using the following cycling
parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 45 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 45 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
2. Run the PCR cycle on the designated thermal cycler.
E. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or another
suitable stain.
2. Load PCR products into wells with appropriate ladders/markers.
3. Run electrophoresis at 100 volts for approximately 60 minutes.
4. Visualize bands under UV light and document results.
F. Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare patient sample bands to control bands.
2. Identify bands indicating clonal T-cell receptor gene
rearrangements as positive results.
3. Document interpretations in the logbook alongside the analysts'
initials, date, and time.
G. Quality Control:
1. Include appropriate controls to validate the assay's
performance.
2. Maintain records of all tested controls, including batch numbers
and results.
3. Verify that amplification and detection are within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
4. Follow site-specific quality control procedures for PCR setup
and product documentation.
H. Reporting Results:
1. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
verifying integrity and validity. Ensure the transcription of results
is accurate.
2. Positive results should be reviewed by a senior technologist or
pathologist before final reporting.
I. Confirmatory Steps:
If any result is ambiguous or does not meet the QC validity criteria,
repeat the PCR assay. Notify the supervisor of any recurrent issues.
