Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for T-Cell Receptor Gene
Rearrangement, PCR, Bone Marrow
1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the process of generating
results for T-Cell Receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement using
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methodology from bone marrow
specimens.
1. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in molecular
diagnostics responsible for the analysis of bone marrow specimens
for TCR gene rearrangement.
1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to:
• Ensure all reagents, equipment, and instruments are prepared
and calibrated.
• Conduct the assay according to the procedure outlined below.
• Record and report results accurately and promptly.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen: Bone marrow aspirate.
• Collection: Collect 2-5 mL of bone marrow into EDTA-
anticoagulated tubes.
• Transport: Transport at room temperature to the laboratory within
24 hours of collection.
• Storage: Store at 4°C if delay is expected. Specimens should not
be frozen prior to DNA extraction.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR Master Mix (e.g., HotStarTaq Master Mix)
• Primers specific for TCR gene rearrangement
• Nuclease-free water
• Agarose gel electrophoresis and gel documentation system
• Micropipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses)
1. Procedure
A) DNA Extraction
1. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA from the
bone marrow sample.
2. Measure the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.
3. Dilute the DNA to a working concentration of 20 ng/μL.
B) PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix as follows (total volume per
reaction: 25 μL):
◦ 12.5 μL HotStarTaq Master Mix
◦ 1 μL Forward Primer (10 μM)
◦ 1 μL Reverse Primer (10 μM)
◦ 5.5 μL Nuclease-free water
◦ 5 μL DNA template (20 ng/μL)
2. Mix reagents gently and aliquot into PCR tubes.
3. Perform PCR on the thermocycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 15 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
C) Electrophoresis and Visualization
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
2. Load 5 μL of the PCR product mixed with 1 μL of the loading
dye into each well.
3. Include a 100-bp DNA ladder as a size marker in one of the
wells.
4. Run the gel at 100 volts for 45 minutes.
5. Visualize the gel under UV light and document the results using
a gel documentation system.
D) Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the bands obtained from the PCR product to the DNA
ladder.
2. Identify the presence or absence of specific TCR gene
rearrangements based on the expected sizes of the PCR
products.
3. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
4. Quality Control
5. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
6. Ensure that the positive control shows the expected band size.
7. The negative control should show no band.
8. Reporting Results
9. Document and review all results carefully.
10. Provide a detailed report, indicating whether the TCR gene
rearrangement was detected.
