Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: T-Cell Receptor Gene Rearrangement Analysis by PCR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for analyzing T-Cell Receptor
(TCR) gene rearrangements using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR). This analysis is used to assess clonal T-cell populations
typically for diagnoses and monitoring of lymphoproliferative
disorders.
Responsibility: Laboratory staff are responsible for performing PCR
analysis and ensuring accurate and reliable results. Supervisors
oversee the adherence to the protocol and address any issues that
arise during testing.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical specimens subjected to TCR gene
rearrangement analysis using PCR in the laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
• TCR: T-Cell Receptor
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
• cDNA: Complementary DNA
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Peripheral blood
• Bone marrow aspirate
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
• Fresh tissue
Specimen Volume:
• Blood or bone marrow: Minimum 5 mL in EDTA tube
• FFPE tissue: Minimum of 4-5 sections, each 5-10 μm thick
• Fresh tissue: Minimum of 10 mg, placed in sterile buffer or saline
Specimen Transport and Storage:
• Blood/Bone Marrow: Store at 2-8°C, process within 48 hours.
• FFPE: Store at room temperature, process within 1 week of
sectioning.
• Fresh tissue: Store at 2-8°C, process within 24-48 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed blood samples
• Insufficient quantity of tissue
• Incorrectly labeled or unlabeled specimens
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PCR master mix (contains DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and
buffer)
• TCR gene rearrangement primers
• Positive and negative control DNA
• Nuclease-free water
• Agarose gel electrophoresis materials (agarose, TBE buffer,
loading dye)
• DNA ladder (molecular weight marker)
• Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
• PCR tubes and plates
• Thermal cycler
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV transilluminator
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction:
• Extract DNA from the specimen using a suitable DNA extraction
kit as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
assess purity.
6.2 PCR Setup:
• Prepare the PCR master mix according to the kit instructions.
• Add the TCR gene rearrangement primers to the master mix.
Components of PCR mix per 25 µL reaction:
• 12.5 µL PCR master mix
• 0.5 µL forward primer (10 µM)
• 0.5 µL reverse primer (10 µM)
• 10.5 µL nuclease-free water
• 1.0 µL DNA template (50-100 ng)
Controls:
• Positive control: Known clonal TCR rearrangement DNA
• Negative control: Nuclease-free water
6.3 PCR Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes
• 35 cycles:
◦ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes
• Hold at 4°C
6.4 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
• Prepare a 2% agarose gel with TBE buffer.
• Load PCR products with loading dye into the wells of the agarose
gel.
• Include a DNA ladder in one of the wells for size comparison.
• Run the gel at 90-100V for approximately 1 hour or until the dye
front reaches two-thirds down the gel.
6.5 Visualization and Analysis:
• Stain the gel with ethidium bromide or an alternative DNA stain.
• Visualize bands using a UV transilluminator.
• Compare the band pattern with controls and DNA ladder to
determine the presence or absence of TCR gene rearrangement.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• A single dominant band indicates a clonal T-cell population,
suggestive of a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
• A polyclonal pattern (smear or multiple bands) suggests a reactive
or non-clonal T-cell population.
• Include observations about the quality of the PCR and any
technical issues in the analysis report.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay performance.
• Document all controls and any deviations in the quality control
log.
• Review the quality of DNA extraction and PCR amplifications
periodically.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the PCR kit and DNA extraction kit.
• Relevant scientific literature on TCR gene rearrangement and its
clinical significance.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect any
technological advancements or procedural changes.
