Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: T-Cell Receptor V-Beta Repertoire Analysis (Spectratyping)
- Blood
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for T-Cell Receptor (TCR) V-Beta repertoire analysis, using
spectratyping on blood samples.
2. Scope
This SOP is applicable to staff performing TCR V-Beta repertoire
analysis within the laboratory setting.
3. Responsibilities
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
TCR spectratyping assay, ensuring all procedural steps are followed
accurately, documenting results, and notifying a supervisor of any
discrepancies.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• PCR machine (thermocycler)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Imaging system (e.g., UV transilluminator)
• Spectratyping software
• Centrifuge
• V-bottom 96-well plate
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• DNA extraction kit
• RNA extraction kit
• Reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme
• Primers specific for TCR V-Beta subfamilies
• dNTP mix
• Taq polymerase
• Agarose gel
• Gel loading buffer
• Ethidium bromide (or safe alternative) for gel staining
5. Procedure
5.1 Specimen Collection and Preparation
• Use peripheral blood collected in an EDTA or heparinized tube.
• Store samples at 2-8°C and perform analysis within 48 hours of
collection.
• Extract RNA from the blood sample using a suitable RNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform reverse transcription to convert RNA to cDNA using
reverse transcriptase.
5.2 PCR Amplification
• Prepare PCR reactions using cDNA as a template.
• Include primers specific to different V-Beta subfamilies in separate
reactions.
• Perform PCR under the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-65°C for 30 seconds (depending on primer
melting temperature)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
5.3 Gel Electrophoresis
• Prepare a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (or safe
alternative) for visualization.
• Load PCR products into the gel along with a DNA ladder.
• Run electrophoresis at 100 volts for 45-60 minutes.
• Visualize bands under UV light using an imaging system.
5.4 Data Analysis
• Use spectratyping software to analyze band patterns.
• Determine the size and intensity of the bands corresponding to
different V-Beta subfamilies.
• Generate a spectratype profile for each sample.
5.5 Quality Control
• Include positive controls using known TCR V-Beta profiles.
• Include negative controls (no template) to check for
contamination.
• Ensure all reagent and primer expiry dates are checked and
within date.
6. Reporting Results
• Review spectratype profiles and ensure they are consistent with
expected patterns.
• Document any deviations or unexpected results, and perform
troubleshooting steps if necessary.
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Notify the requesting clinician of any critical or abnormal findings
immediately.

8. Appendix
8.1 Troubleshooting Guide
• Non-specific bands: Increase annealing temperature or optimize
primer concentrations.
• Smearing bands: Check gel concentration, running conditions,
and clean reagents.
• Weak amplification: Verify RNA quality, check cDNA synthesis
efficiency, and ensure primer specificity.
