Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for T-Cell Subsets, Naive, Memory, and
Activated, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for T-cell subsets,
including naive, memory, and activated T-cells, in blood
samples. This SOP ensures that all procedures provide
accurate, reproducible, and consistent results in compliance
with CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure accurately. It is also the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that all laboratory personnel are
adequately trained and proficient in this procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type:
▪ Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top) tubes.
◦ Specimen Volume:
▪ Minimum volume: 2 mL whole blood.
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Store and transport the specimens at room temperature
(15-25°C). Analyze within 24 hours of collection.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Specimens collected in other anticoagulants.
▪ Specimens stored at extreme temperatures or outside
the acceptable timeframe for analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II, BD FACSCalibur,
or equivalent).
◦ Cell markers panel for T-cell subsets (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8,
CD45RA, CCR7).
◦ Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific to the T-cell
markers.
◦ Cell staining buffer (e.g., PBS with 1% BSA).
◦ Lysing solution (e.g., BD FACS Lysing Solution).
◦ Flow cytometry tubes.
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips.
◦ Vortex mixer.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare staining buffer: PBS with 1% BSA.
◦ Thaw single-use aliquots of fluorochrome-conjugated
antibodies as needed.
B) Sample Preparation:
◦ Label flow cytometry tubes with sample identification
numbers.
◦ Add 100 µL of whole blood to each labeled tube.
◦ Add appropriate volumes of fluorochrome-conjugated
antibodies to each tube according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
▪ For example: CD3-FITC, CD4-PE, CD8-PerCP,
CD45RA-APC, and CCR7-PE-Cy7.
◦ Vortex briefly to mix.
C) Incubation:
◦ Incubate the tubes at room temperature in the dark for
15-30 minutes.
D) Red Blood Cell Lysis:
◦ Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube.
◦ Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
◦ Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
E) Washing:
◦ Carefully decant the supernatant, ensuring the cell pellet is
retained.
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of staining buffer.
◦ Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 300
µL of staining buffer.
F) Flow Cytometry Acquisition:
◦ Perform daily calibration and quality control checks on the
flow cytometer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run each sample on the flow cytometer, acquiring at least
10,000 events within the lymphocyte gate.
◦ Ensure positive and negative controls are included in each
run.
6. DATA ANALYSIS
◦ Use appropriate flow cytometry software (e.g., BD
FACSDiva, FlowJo) for analysis.
◦ Define lymphocyte population by forward and side scatter.
◦ Gate on CD3+ T-cells.
◦ Determine percentages of naive (CD45RA+CCR7+), central
memory (CD45RA-CCR7+), effector memory (CD45RA-
CCR7-), and activated T-cells (CD69+).
◦ Export and review data for consistency and accuracy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run controls (e.g., standardized T-cell subsets) with each
batch of samples to ensure the accuracy and precision of
the results.
◦ Document all quality control checks and any deviations from
expected results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results must be reviewed by a qualified technologist before
verification.
◦ Verified results should be entered into the laboratory
information system.
◦ Include percentages and absolute counts of each T-cell
subset.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Naive T-cells (CD45RA+CCR7+): ____
◦ Central Memory T-cells (CD45RA-CCR7+): ____
◦ Effector Memory T-cells (CD45RA-CCR7-): ____
◦ Activated T-cells (CD69+): ____
◦ Reference intervals should be determined based on healthy
adult population data or as provided by clinical guidelines.
10. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
◦ Specimen quality and handling can affect results.
◦ High levels of autofluorescence or improper gating can
impact result accuracy.
◦ Ensure timely analysis of samples to avoid degradation.
