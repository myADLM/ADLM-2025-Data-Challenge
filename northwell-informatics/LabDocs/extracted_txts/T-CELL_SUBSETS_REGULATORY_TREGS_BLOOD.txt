Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for T-Cell Subsets, Regulatory (Tregs), Blood
1. PURPOSE: To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis
of T-cell subsets, specifically regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in blood,
ensuring accuracy and consistency in the results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: The responsibility of performing the T-cell
subsets analysis rests with trained laboratory technologists. The
supervisor must ensure that the procedures are followed correctly,
and proper documentation is maintained.
3. DEFINITION: Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are a subpopulation of T
lymphocytes that play a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance
and preventing autoimmune diseases. The percentage and absolute
counts of Tregs in blood can be assessed using flow cytometry.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto, Beckman Coulter)
• Antibodies:
◦ Anti-CD3-FITC
◦ Anti-CD4-PE
◦ Anti-CD25-APC
◦ Anti-FoxP3-PerCP
• Lysing solution
• PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline)
• Fixation/Permeabilization Solution
• FACS tubes
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Laboratory coat, gloves, and other appropriate PPE
5. SPECIMEN: The specimen required is whole blood collected in
EDTA tubes. Ensure that the specimen is processed within 24 hours
of collection to maintain cell integrity.
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1 Specimen Preparation:
1. Collect whole blood in EDTA tubes and ensure proper mixing by
gentle inversion.
2. Record relevant patient information and accession number in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
6.2 Antibody Staining:
1. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into a new FACS tube.
2. Add the appropriate volume of each antibody to the respective
FACS tube following manufacturer’s recommendations.
◦ Anti-CD3-FITC
◦ Anti-CD4-PE
◦ Anti-CD25-APC
3. Vortex gently and incubate the samples at room temperature for
20 minutes in the dark.
6.3 Red Blood Cell Lysis:
1. Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube to lyse red blood cells.
2. Vortex briefly and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature
in the dark.
3. Centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes. Discard the
supernatant carefully.
6.4 Fixation/Permeabilization:
1. Add 1 mL of PBS to wash the cells, vortex, and centrifuge at
500 x g for 5 minutes. Discard the supernatant.
2. Add 500 µL of Fixation/Permeabilization Solution to the cell
pellet.
3. Vortex gently and incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature
in the dark.
6.5 Intracellular Staining:
1. Wash the cells with 1 mL of PBS, vortex, and centrifuge at 500
x g for 5 minutes. Discard the supernatant.
2. Add the recommended amount of Anti-FoxP3-PerCP antibody.
3. Vortex gently and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature
in the dark.
6.6 Final Wash:
1. Wash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS, centrifuging at 500 x g
for 5 minutes.
2. Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 µL of PBS for flow cytometry
analysis.
7. FLOW CYTOMETRY ANALYSIS:
1. Calibrate the flow cytometer and perform all necessary QC
checks as per the instrument's guidelines.
2. Run each sample on the flow cytometer, acquiring a minimum
of 10,000 lymphocyte events.
3. Collect data for CD3, CD4, CD25, and FoxP3 markers.
8. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION:
1. Analyze the acquired data using appropriate software (e.g.,
FlowJo, FACSDiva).
2. Gate on lymphocytes using forward scatter (FSC) and side
scatter (SSC) properties.
3. Sequentially gate on CD3+ (T cells), CD4+ (T-helper cells), then
CD25+FoxP3+ (Tregs).
4. Calculate the percentage and absolute counts of Tregs.
5. Review and verify results according to established criteria and
reference ranges.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run control samples with known Treg percentages at the
beginning, middle, and end of each batch to ensure assay
accuracy.
2. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
3. Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintained according
to manufacturer's recommendations.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Enter the results into the LIS.
2. Ensure results are reviewed by a second technologist or
supervisor before final verification and release.
3. Address any discrepancies or critical values following the
laboratory’s protocol.
11. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s guidelines and package inserts for antibodies.
• Flow cytometer user manual.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on T-cell subset analysis.
This protocol must be reviewed and updated annually or when new
guidelines and methodologies are introduced. Ensure that all staff are
trained and proficient in this procedure. Regular audits and
proficiency testing should be conducted to maintain high standards of
analytical performance.
