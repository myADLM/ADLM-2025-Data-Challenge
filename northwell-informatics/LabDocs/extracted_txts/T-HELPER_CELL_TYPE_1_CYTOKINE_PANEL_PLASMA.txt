STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
T-Helper Cell Type 1 (Th1) Cytokine Panel, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of results for
the Th1 Cytokine Panel in plasma samples, ensuring accuracy and
consistency in the analytical phase.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing Th1
cytokine panel tests on plasma samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Following the detailed steps outlined in this procedure.
• Ensuring proper calibration and maintenance of instruments used.
• Documenting all actions, observations, and results.
• Reporting any issues or abnormalities to the supervisor.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Plasma samples
• Th1 Cytokine Panel ELISA kits
• Plate reader capable of reading absorbance at the required
wavelength (e.g., 450 nm)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2–8°C)
• Microplate washer
• Calibration and Quality Control materials
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples
1. Collection and Storage
◦ Plasma samples must be collected using EDTA vacutainer
tubes.
◦ Store plasma samples immediately at 2–8°C if they will be
analyzed within 24 hours or freeze at -20°C for longer
storage.
2. Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples on ice or at 4°C.
◦ Vortex samples for 30 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for reconstituting and
preparing all reagents, standards, and controls provided in the
ELISA kit.
2. Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before
use.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Standards and Controls
◦ Prepare standard curve points as detailed in the kit insert.
◦ Include quality control samples at two levels (low and high)
alongside patient samples.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and prepared plasma
samples to designated wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Add 50 µL of assay buffer or diluent to each well if specified
in the kit insert.
◦ Add 50 µL of conjugate to each well.
3. Incubation
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive cover and incubate at 37°C for
1 hour.
◦ Wash plate 5 times using the automated plate washer or
manually, ensuring complete removal of residual liquid after
each wash.
4. Detection
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark.
5. Reading
◦ After incubation, add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to
halt the reaction.
◦ Read the plate using the microplate reader at the
appropriate wavelength as specified in the kit insert (e.g.,
450 nm).
D. Quality Control
1. Run QC samples alongside patient samples.
2. Ensure the QC results fall within the acceptable range defined
in the kit insert.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
6. ANALYSIS
1. Generate Results
◦ Use the standard curve to calculate the concentration of
cytokines in each plasma sample.
◦ Ensure the sample dilution factor is applied correctly.
2. Result Verification
◦ Verify results for consistency across replicate wells.
◦ Check for any unexpected results or anomalies.
3. Reporting
◦ Transfer results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure all results and any comments regarding sample
quality or issues are documented accurately.

• Manufacturer's instructions for the Th1 Cytokine Panel ELISA kit.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature on cytokine quantification and
interpretation.
8. DOCUMENTATION
This SOP must be reviewed annually and revised as necessary. All
personnel must be trained and familiar with the SOP before
performing the Th1 cytokine panel analysis.
APPENDIX
Include any additional information, troubleshooting tips, and specific
considerations for the assay, such as handling of specific cytokines
within the panel.
APPROVALS
This protocol should be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor and the quality assurance manager.
