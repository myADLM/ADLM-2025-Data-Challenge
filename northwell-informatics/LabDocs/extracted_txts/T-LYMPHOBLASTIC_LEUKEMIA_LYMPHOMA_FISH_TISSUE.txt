Standard Operating Procedure T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma, FISH, Tissue Analysis
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the analytical procedure for
detecting T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma using Fluorescence
In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on tissue specimens. The objective is to
ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of tissue specimens for T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma using FISH.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the lab personnel to
follow the procedure accurately and report any anomalies.
Supervisors must ensure compliance and provide training as
necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue sample preserved in formalin and embedded in paraffin
(FFPE)
• A minimum of 4-6 tissue sections, each 4-5 microns thick, on
positively charged slides
5. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
• Fluorescence microscope with filters appropriate for the
fluorophores used
• Thermocycler
• Hybridization chamber
• Dehydration reagents (ethanol series)
• Heat block or oven
• FISH buffer kit, including pre-treatment and post-hybridization
wash buffers
• DNA probes specific for T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
markers, labelled with fluorophores
• Detection reagents for signal amplification (if applicable)
• Mounting medium with DAPI counterstain
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Slides:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour.
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes, repeat once.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a series of ethanol washes (100%,
95%, 70%, for 3 minutes each) followed by a rinse in
distilled water.
2. Pre-treatment:
◦ Treat slides in pre-treatment solution at 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Enzyme Digestion:
◦ Immerse slides in enzyme digestion solution (e.g., pepsin)
as per manufacturer's instructions, typically at 37°C for 10
minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water and dehydrate through an
ethanol series (70%, 95%, 100%).
6.2 Hybridization:
1. Probe Preparation:
◦ Prepare the DNA probe cocktail according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Denature the probe mix at 75-80°C for 5 minutes and place
on ice.
2. Denaturation of Specimen DNA:
◦ Apply prepared DNA probe to sample on slide.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
◦ Denature the specimen-probe complex on a heat block at
75-80°C for 5 minutes.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Place slides in a humid chamber and incubate at 37°C for
12-16 hours (overnight).
6.3 Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Remove coverslip:
◦ Gently remove coverslips and immerse slides in post-
hybridization wash buffer at 72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in room temperature buffer for 1 minute.
2. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate through a series of ethanol washes (70%, 90%,
100%, for 1 minute each).
6.4 Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Apply DAPI counterstaining solution.
2. Mounting:
◦ Apply an anti-fade mounting medium.
◦ Place a coverslip and seal edges with clear nail polish.
6.5 Microscopy Analysis:
1. Examine Slides:
◦ Use a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate
filters.
◦ Scan slides for areas with good hybridization signals and
minimal background noise.
◦ Capture images of representative areas for documentation.
7. CONTROLS
• Positive control slides with known abnormalities must be
processed alongside patient specimens.
• Negative control slides without probe hybridization to ensure the
specificity of signal detection.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Interpret hybridization signals according to standardized criteria:
◦ Normal signals: 2 fusion signals in nucleus
◦ Abnormal signals: detect abnormal signal patterns indicative of
T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform instrument calibration and maintenance as per schedule.
• Use internal quality controls to verify reagent performance and
hybridization efficiency.
• Document all quality control measures taken and any deviations.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Provide a detailed report that includes images of signals and
interpretation.
• Refer critical or unexpected findings to a pathologist for review.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's guidelines for probe preparation and hybridization.
• Technical guidelines from laboratory accreditation bodies (e.g.,
CAP, CLIA).
12. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper disposal of
hazardous materials.
• Specific safety procedures for handling formalin-fixed tissue and
fluorescent dye reagents.
