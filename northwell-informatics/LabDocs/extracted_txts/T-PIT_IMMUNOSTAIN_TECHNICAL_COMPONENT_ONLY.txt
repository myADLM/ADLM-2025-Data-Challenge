Standard Operating Procedure
T-PIT Immunostain - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the laboratory procedures and responsibilities for performing
the technical component of T-PIT immunostaining.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the T-PIT
immunostain, adhering to all procedures outlined in this SOP, and
reporting any deficiencies or issues to the supervisory staff
immediately.
2. DEFINITION
T-PIT immunostaining is a technique used to detect the presence of
T-PIT protein in tissue samples. The procedure involves the
application of a specific antibody that binds to the T-PIT antigen
followed by the application of a secondary antibody to visualize the
binding.
Specimen Requirements:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections on
positively charged slides.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody specific for T-PIT
• Secondary antibody conjugated to a detection enzyme (e.g.,
Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP))
• Substrate-Chromogen solution (e.g., 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine
(DAB))
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Buffer solutions (e.g., Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS))
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Slides:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour.
◦ Deparaffinize in xylene for 10 minutes (two times).
◦ Rehydrate through a series of decreasing ethanol
concentrations (100%, 95%, 85%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a
microwave or steamer for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes (three times).
Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking solution on the slides to minimize non-
specific binding for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Drain excess blocking solution without washing.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply drops of primary T-PIT antibody on each section.
◦ Incubate slides in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C (refer to antibody datasheet
for optimal incubation time).
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes (three times).
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody conjugated to the detection
enzyme (HRP) on each section.
◦ Incubate slides in a humid chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes (three times).
4. Detection:
◦ Apply drops of substrate-chromogen solution (DAB) on each
section.
◦ Incubate until desired stain intensity is achieved (typically
5-15 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in Hematoxylin solution for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
◦ Rinse in tap water for 5 minutes.
Mounting:
1. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate through a series of increasing ethanol
concentrations (70%, 85%, 95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear slides in xylene for 5 minutes (two times).
2. Coverslipping:
◦ Apply a drop of mounting medium on each tissue section.
◦ Place coverslip gently to avoid air bubbles.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Include a tissue section known to express T-
PIT in each staining run.
• Negative Control: Include a tissue section without the primary
antibody to ensure specificity of staining.
• Documentation: Record all reagent lot numbers, equipment used
(e.g., specific microwave or steamer), and any deviations from
standard procedure.
6. REPORTING AND VERIFICATION
• Verify the staining results under the microscope by a qualified
technologist.
• Results for the technical component only do not include
interpretation of staining intensity or pattern. Documentation
should reflect completion of the technical process accurately and
timely.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak Staining: Increase the concentration or incubation time of
the primary antibody.
• Non-Specific Staining: Ensure blocking was sufficient; check for
adequate washing steps.
• No Staining: Verify the activity of primary and secondary
antibodies and ensure the antigen retrieval step was performed
correctly.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s datasheet and protocol for the T-PIT primary
antibody.
• Standard Immunohistochemistry protocol book by the laboratory.
9. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Follow institutional safety guidelines for handling chemicals and
biological specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Dispose of waste materials according to laboratory protocols.
