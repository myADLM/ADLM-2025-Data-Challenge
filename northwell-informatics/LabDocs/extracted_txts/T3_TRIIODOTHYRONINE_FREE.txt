Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of T3
(Triiodothyronine), Free Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of measuring Free T3 (Free Triiodothyronine) levels in serum
or plasma samples. This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and
consistent results.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing the Free T3 assay
are responsible for adhering to this procedure. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance, provide necessary
training, and address any technical issues that arise during the
testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a plain red-top or serum-
separator tube (SST). Acceptable specimen: Plasma collected in a
heparinized tube. Unacceptable specimens: Grossly hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric samples; specimens collected in sodium fluoride/
oxalate, EDTA, or citrate tubes.
Specimen Handling: Upon collection, specimens should be allowed
to clot completely at room temperature. Centrifuge samples at
1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to separate serum or plasma from
cells. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean, appropriately labeled
container. Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1. Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Refrigerator and freezer for specimen storage
3.2. Reagents:
• Free T3 reagent kit (commercially available)
• Calibrators and controls (provided with the reagent kit)
• Quality control materials
3.3. Supplies:
• Clean, labeled sample containers
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Biohazard disposal containers
1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparing for Testing:
• Ensure all equipment is properly maintained, calibrated, and in
working condition as per manufacturer instructions.
• Allow reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature.
• Prepare and label working reagents, calibrators, and controls as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
4.2. Running the Assay:
• Enter patient information and test orders into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) or directly into the analyzer’s software.
• Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the instrument
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure that sample identification corresponds with the test order.
• Follow the instrument-specific protocol to initiate the Free T3
assay.
• Monitor the assay run for any instrument alerts or errors and take
appropriate action if necessary.
• Upon completion, verify that all quality control results are within
acceptable ranges before releasing patient results.
4.3. Result Verification and Reporting:
• Review the result printout from the analyzer.
• Compare QC results against established quality control ranges. If
controls are out of range, investigate and resolve any issues
before releasing patient results.
• Validate the results in the LIS. Manually review the results for any
flags or errors indicated by the instrument.
• Approve and release the results for patient records, ensuring they
are appropriately documented.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
Include at least two levels of control (one within normal range and
one within abnormal range).
• Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges as specified by the control material manufacturer.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot potential
issues (e.g., reagent integrity, instrument calibration), rerun
controls, and document corrective actions taken.
• Participation in external quality assurance programs is
recommended to maintain assay accuracy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult the specific reagent kit insert for the reference interval
provided by the manufacturer. Adjustments may be required based
on patient population or laboratory validation studies.
• Typical reference interval for Free T3 (adults): 2.0 - 4.4 pg/mL.
Refer to site-specific reference intervals if applicable.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and bilirubinemia may interfere with the
assay. Avoid analysis of these specimens if possible.
• Method limitations and potential interferences should be reviewed
in the reagent kit insert.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow universal precautions and use personal protective
equipment (PPE) when handling patient specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of biohazardous materials according to laboratory
protocols and regulations.
• Follow manufacturer guidelines for safe handling and disposal of
reagents.

This SOP is intended to serve as a guideline for consistent and
reliable measurement of Free T3 levels in patient samples. It is
essential that all laboratory personnel comply with these procedures
to ensure the accuracy and validity of test results.
