Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for T3 (Triiodothyronine), Free, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the quantitative determination of
free triiodothyronine (Free T3) in human serum samples using a
validated assay method. The goal is to ensure accurate and
reproducible results while maintaining CLIA compliance.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing Free T3
assays in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis of Free T3 in serum samples as defined
in this procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
personnel adhere to this SOP and for addressing any deviations
or issues in the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood by standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (approximately 30
minutes).
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the serum to a secondary tube if necessary.
• Store samples at 2-8°C if analysis will occur within 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Free T3 Assay Kit (validated and approved for use in the
laboratory)
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents as specified by the assay
manufacturer
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Laboratory-specific equipment and consumables for sample
handling and processing
1. PROCEDURE
A) Assay Setup:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for reagent preparation,
calibration, and quality control.
2. Prepare calibrators and controls as per the kit instructions.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw any frozen samples at room temperature and mix
thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Centrifuge samples if needed to remove particulate matter
before testing.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
serum samples into designated wells of the microplate or
sample cups in the automated analyzer.
2. Add the assay reagent to each well or sample cup as specified
by the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Incubate the microplate or samples for the specified time and
temperature conditions according to the assay protocol.
4. Wash the wells with the provided wash buffer (if applicable) or
follow the washing procedure of the automated analyzer.
5. Add the detection reagent and incubate for the required time.
6. Measure the absorbance or signal using the microplate reader
or analyzer.
D) Calculation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve from the calibrators provided in the
assay kit.
2. Determine the concentration of Free T3 in patient samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
3. For automated analyzers, results will be calculated and
displayed by the instrument software.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run quality control samples at multiple levels (e.g., low,
medium, high) with each assay batch.
6. Verify that QC results fall within the acceptable range specified
by the manufacturer.
7. Document any deviations or unexpected QC results and take
appropriate corrective actions as needed.
8. Ensure regular calibration and maintenance of the assay
equipment according to laboratory protocols.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Validate and review the assay results for each patient sample.
11. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
following laboratory protocols.
12. Flag any critical or out-of-range results according to laboratory
policy for immediate review and follow-up.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Free T3 normal reference range: 2.3 - 4.2 pg/mL (note: reference
ranges may vary between assays; follow the specific assay insert
for exact ranges.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Interferences: Refer to the assay kit insert for any known
substances that may interfere with the test results.
3. The assay is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only.
