Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for T3 (Triiodothyronine), Reverse, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the standardized procedure for the analysis
of Reverse T3 (Triiodothyronine) in serum samples. It aims to ensure
accurate, consistent, and reliable results following the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel trained in Reverse T3
analysis using the designated immunoassay analyzer or LC-MS/MS
methodology. This SOP is to be followed once the specimen has
been collected, received, and accessioned.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis, quality control, and result validation as outlined in this SOP.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the process
and addressing any issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
Reverse T3 (rT3): An inactive form of the thyroid hormone
triiodothyronine.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer / LC-MS/MS
• Calibrators and Standards for Reverse T3
• Quality Control Materials (Low, Medium, High)
• Pipettes and Tips
• Serum Tubes
• Centrifuge
• Sample Storage Racks
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Preferred Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C after
collection. For long-term storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C or
below.
1. PROCEDURES
A) SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Ensure the specimen is properly labeled with patient
identification.
2. Centrifuge the serum sample at 1000-1500 x g for 10 minutes
to eliminate cellular components.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant serum into a clean, labeled
tube.
B) CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform the calibration procedure as per the analyzer or LC-
MS/MS manufacturer's instructions using provided
calibrators.
◦ Document calibration results for traceability.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentration) alongside patient specimens.
◦ Evaluate control results to ensure they fall within the
established acceptable range. Do not proceed with analysis
if controls are out of range; investigate and resolve issues
before proceeding.
C) ANALYSIS PROCEDURE USING IMMUNOASSAY ANALYZER
1. Load reagents, samples, calibrators, and quality controls into
the immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Program the analyzer for Reverse T3 analysis, including
sample identification and assay parameters.
3. Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer during sample
processing.
D) ANALYSIS PROCEDURE USING LC-MS/MS
1. Prepare the necessary reagents and mobile phases as per the
LC-MS/MS protocol.
2. Load samples, calibrators, and quality controls onto the LC-MS/
MS system.
3. Set the instrument parameters and analyst method specific for
Reverse T3.
4. Start the analysis and monitor for any signal interferences or
abnormalities.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
2. Review and Validate Results:
◦ Ensure all quality control samples are within acceptable
limits.
◦ Verify the calibration curve is valid.
◦ Compare patient results against reference ranges and
previous results for consistency.
3. Reporting:
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure any critical values are promptly communicated to the
responsible healthcare provider according to the laboratory’s
critical result policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
2. Participate in External Quality Assurance programs for Reverse
T3 analysis.
3. Perform proficiency testing as required.
4. Maintain documentation of all quality control activities,
calibrations, and instrument maintenance logs.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
2. Perform routine maintenance on the analyzers as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Document all maintenance activities and any troubleshooting
steps undertaken.
4. In case of repeated assay failures, consult the manufacturer's
technical support or the laboratory supervisor for further
assistance.
1. SAFETY AND HANDLING
2. Handle all biological specimens and chemicals according to the
laboratory’s safety protocols.
3. Wear appropriate PPE at all times during specimen handling
and analysis.
