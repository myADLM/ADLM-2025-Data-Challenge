Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of T3 (Triiodothyronine), Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for generating results for T3
(Triiodothyronine), Total in serum. This procedure ensures consistent,
accurate, and timely analytical results using established methods and
quality control measures.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible
for performing the analysis according to this protocol and monitoring
quality control. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence
to the SOP and addressing any deficiencies.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
• Acceptable: Plasma (Lithium heparin)
Specimen Handling:
1. Serum should be collected into SST (serum separator tubes) or
plain red-top tubes.
2. Allow blood to clot completely at room temperature (usually 30
minutes) before centrifugation.
3. Centrifuge at 1,500 - 2,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
4. Transfer serum to a labeled secondary tube if necessary.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days when stored at
2-8°C.
• For longer storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C for up to 3
months.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Incorrectly labeled samples
• Samples with insufficient volume (minimum 0.5 mL required)
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• Analytical instrument capable of T3 measurement (e.g.,
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Analyzer)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
Reagents:
• T3 reagent kit (calibrators, controls, and test reagents)
• Diluent and wash solution
• Primary and secondary antibody specific for T3
• Substrate solution for signal detection
Supplies:
• SST tubes or plain red-top tubes
• Secondary storage tubes (if applicable)
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PP
4. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Verify calibration status and run control samples prior to
every batch following the manufacturer’s specifications.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within expiration date and prepared
as specified in kit insert.
2. Analysis:
◦ Select and load test method on the analytical instrument.
◦ Load serum samples onto the instrument using the
designated sample trays.
◦ Enter patient and sample identification into the instrument’s
database.
◦ Initiate the assay run.
◦ Record initial time and date of run.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at designated intervals (e.g.,
start of run, mid-run, end of run) to ensure assay
consistency and accuracy.
◦ Verify QC results fall within predefined acceptable ranges.
Investigate and resolve any QC failures according to
standard laboratory protocols.
4. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC indicates an issue, halt testing and recalibrate
instrument.
◦ Repeat analysis for control samples until QC is acceptable.
◦ Document any issues and corrective actions in the QC log.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification:
• Technologists must review each patient's results for consistency
and potential errors.
• Flag any critical results and follow notification protocols.
Transmitting Results:
• Confirm results are within the reportable range defined by the
laboratory.
• Verified results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for automatic upload to patient records.
• Document any manual interventions or adjustments required
during the reporting process.
Critical Values:
• Critical results identified must be communicated as per laboratory
critical result protocols.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Ensure the continuous performance of QC material every batch.
• Maintain documentation on QC performance and corrective
actions in case of deviations.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in External Quality Assurance (EQA) programs
biannually.
• Compare inter-lab results and document findings for supervisory
review.

• Manufacturer's reagent kit insert and instructions for use.
• Laboratory QC policies and procedures.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
8. DOCUMENTATION
Logs:
• QC logs
• Maintenance logs
• Calibration logs
• Patient result logs
Forms:
• T3 result verification form
• Incident/Critical result reporting form
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a clear and structured
