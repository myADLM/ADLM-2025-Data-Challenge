Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase - T4,
Free, Direct Dialysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical procedures for the generation of
Free Thyroxine (T4) results using the Direct Dialysis method in the
laboratory. This ensures that all steps are consistently followed to
maintain accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of Free T4 test
results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel performing Free T4 testing using Direct
Dialysis are responsible for adhering to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with
this procedure.
2. DEFINITION
Free T4 determination refers to the quantification of the non-protein
bound fraction of thyroxine in patient serum. Direct Dialysis is a
specific method used to separate free T4 from the protein-bound
fraction before measuring its concentration using immunoassay
techniques.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Direct Dialysis set-up including microdialyzer units
• Immunoassay instrumentation (calibrated according to
manufacturer instructions)
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Free T4 assay kits (with specified reagents)
• Ultra-pure water
• Quality Control materials (bi-level: normal and abnormal)
• Calibrators
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Laboratory timer
• Refrigerated storage
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Stability: Serum specimens must be separated from cells within 2
hours of collection. Specimens are stable for up to 7 days if
refrigerated (2-8°C) and up to 1 month when frozen (-20°C or
colder).
5. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Checks
1. Confirm specimen integrity; ensure there is no hemolysis,
lipemia, or improper labeling.
2. Allow specimens to come to room temperature before starting
the assay.
B) Dialysis Preparation
1. Set up the microdialyzer unit according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Carefully pipette 500 µL of serum into the sample chamber of
the microdialyzer.
3. Add an equal volume (500 µL) of dialysis buffer to the buffer
chamber.
4. Seal the chambers and place the microdialyzer in the specified
apparatus.
5. Dialyze the sample for the time and at the temperature
recommended by the manufacturer (e.g., 2 hours at 37°C).
C) Immunoassay for Free T4 Quantification
1. After the dialysis is completed, carefully remove the sample
from the dialysis chamber using a pipette.
2. Follow the immunoassay kit instructions to prepare the assay.
Typically, this includes:
◦ Adding specified volumes of calibrators, quality control
materials, and dialyzed patient samples to the assay wells.
◦ Adding the immunoassay reagents (e.g., labeled antibodies,
enzyme conjugates).
◦ Incubation periods per manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Run the assay on the designated immunoassay analyzer.
4. Record the output data and ensure it aligns with expected
control values.
D) Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (both normal and high) with each
batch of patient assays.
2. Verify that quality control results fall within acceptable ranges
before releasing patient results.
3. Document any deviations and take corrective action if
necessary (e.g., re-calibration, repeating the assay).
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review generated results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Verify results that pass quality control requirements.
3. Report results promptly to the requesting healthcare providers.
4. Note any instances where sample integrity was compromised
and report as "sample condition compromised" if values fall
outside acceptable ranges and cannot be rectified by repeat
analysis.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or other interference can affect test results.
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines on assay limitations
described in the kit insert.
