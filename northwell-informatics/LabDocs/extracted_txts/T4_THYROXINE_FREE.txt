Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for T4 (Thyroxine), Free
1. Purpose The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized
guidelines for the analytical phase of generating results for T4
(Thyroxine), Free, ensuring accuracy, precision, and reliability of
results produced in the laboratory.
2. Scope This SOP applies to all staff involved in the analysis and
reporting of free T4 (Thyroxine) levels in the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis in accordance with this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and for validating the results.
4. Definitions
• Free T4 (Thyroxine): The unbound fraction of thyroxine hormone
circulating in the blood, which is biologically active and available
to tissues.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens Immulite,
etc.)
• Free T4 reagent kits (compatible with the immunoassay analyzer
used)
• Quality control (QC) materials with known concentrations of free
T4
• Calibrators for free T4
• Sample tubes (serum separator tubes or plain red-top tubes)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Handling: Centrifuge and separate serum from the clot within 2
hours of collection. Store serum at 2-8°C and analyze within 7
days. For longer storage, store serum at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
7. Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and
maintenance is up to date.
2. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Wear appropriate PPE.
B. Calibration
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using the provided
calibrators specifically for free T4 as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Document the calibration results.
3. Calibration should be performed:
◦ According to the manufacturer's recommendations.
◦ After major maintenance or repairs.
◦ When QC results indicate unacceptable performance.
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, after
calibration, and after major maintenance.
2. Use at least two levels of QC material (high and low).
3. Document QC results. QC results must fall within the
acceptable range. If QC results are out of range:
◦ Do not proceed with patient testing.
◦ Troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Recalibrate if necessary and re-run QC samples.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Verify that patient samples are properly labeled and suitable for
analysis (i.e., not hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric).
2. Load patient samples onto the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Perform the assay as per the analyzer’s operating instructions.
4. Record the results including the date, time, and initials of the
performing technologist.
5. Repeat analysis if flagged by the analyzer for any errors or out-
of-range results.
E. Result Validation and Reporting
1. Review the analyzer printouts for any error messages or flags.
Address any flagged results by re-running the analysis or
performing necessary troubleshooting.
2. Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before
reporting patient results.
3. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Results should be reported in pmol/L or ng/dL, as per laboratory
reporting standards and clinician preference.
5. Highlight and verify any critical results according to laboratory
guidelines.
F. Maintenance and Documentation
1. Perform routine maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer as
per manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Document all maintenance activities, calibration, QC results,
and any troubleshooting steps.
8. Reference Intervals
• Typical Reference Interval: 10-26 pmol/L or 0.8-2.0 ng/dL
(laboratory-specific; verify with local reference values).
9. Method Limitations
• Interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can invalidate
results.
• Medications or other binding protein alterations can affect free T4
measurement.
10. References
• Manufacturer's instructions for the immunoassay analyzer and
reagent kits.
• Internal laboratory manuals and guidelines.
11. Revision History
• Document any changes or updates made to this SOP with the
date of revision and a brief description of the changes.
This protocol is to be used as a guide to ensure proper handling and
processing of samples for T4 (Thyroxine), Free determination in the
laboratory, following all safety and quality standards.
