Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase: T4
(THYROXINE), FREE, DIALYSIS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the protocol for the
analysis of Free T4 (Thyroxine) in serum samples using dialysis
methodology. This ensures accurate and reliable results for clinical
interpretation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the Free T4 analysis according to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedure and addressing any issues that arise during the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube (no anticoagulant) or SST
(Serum Separator Tube).
2.2 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
heparin).
• Specimens with insufficient volume or improper labeling.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Free T4 Dialysis Kit
• Calibrators and controls specific for Free T4 analysis
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Dialysis membrane units
• Incubator (set to 37°C)
• Analytical balance
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C)
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum samples to equilibrate to room temperature before
analysis.
• Aliquot the serum if necessary, ensuring that the aliquots are free
from any particulate matter.
4.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples (QC)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibrate the dialysis system prior to sample analysis.
• Run the QC samples to ensure the system is within acceptable
limits. Document the results.
4.3 T4 (Thyroxine) Dialysis:
• Place the serum sample (generally 0.5 mL) into the dialysis
membrane unit according to the kit instructions.
• Dialyze at 37°C for the specified time (usually 16-24 hours) to
separate free T4 from protein-bound T4.
• After dialysis, retrieve the dialysate/free fraction for analysis.
4.4 Analytical Measurement:
• Analyze the dialysate using the respective immunoassay or liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
methodology following standard laboratory practices.
• Use the appropriate detection method (e.g., chemiluminescence,
radioimmunoassay) as per kit instructions.
4.5 Calculations:
• Calculate Free T4 concentration using the calibration curve
generated from the standards.
• Ensure all calculations are double-checked for accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
5.1 Verification:
• Review and verify the results according to laboratory protocols.
• Ensure that calibration and quality control results meet the
acceptable criteria before releasing patient results.
5.2 Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
record-keeping and reporting.
• Any discrepancies or issues identified during analysis should be
documented and reported to the supervisor.
5.3 Reference Intervals:
• Utilize the reference intervals provided by the assay manufacturer
or validated by the laboratory for the specific population being
tested.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Run QC samples at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end
of each batch of analyses.
• Document all QC results and take corrective action if QC results
fall outside acceptable limits.
6.2 External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of Free T4 analysis.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay manufacturer's instructions for specific
limitations.
• Interferences from other thyroid-related medications or conditions
should be taken into account.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any issues arise during the analysis process, refer to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
• Contact the technical support team if problems persist and cannot
be resolved internally.
