Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for T4 (Thyroxine), Free,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish the proper procedure for the analysis of Free T4
(Thyroxine) levels in serum samples, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the T4 (Thyroxine), Free, Serum assay according to
this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all technologists are
trained on this procedure and that the procedure is followed
correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or fluoride/
oxalate tubes; hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Volume: A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott
Architect)
• T4 (Thyroxine), Free reagent kit
• Calibrators, controls, and standards
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample cups or racks
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result entry and reporting
1. PROCEDURE
1. Pre-Analysis:
a) Collect the serum sample properly following standard blood
collection techniques. b) Centrifuge the collected sample at 1500 -
2000 g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
a) Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions using the provided calibrators. b) Run
quality control (QC) samples (low, medium, and high levels) at the
beginning of each shift or per manufacturer's recommendation. - If
QC results are within the specified range, proceed with patient
sample analysis. - If QC results are outside the specified range,
troubleshoot and resolve the issue before analyzing patient samples.
3. Sample Preparation and Analysis:
a) Allow frozen serum specimens to thaw completely and mix gently
before analysis. b) Load serum specimens, calibrators, and QC
samples onto the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. c) Program the analyzer to perform the Free T4
assay according to the reagent kit instructions.
4. Result Generation:
a) The immunoassay analyzer will automatically read and generate
Free T4 (Thyroxine) levels in serum. b) Review the automated results
for any flags or errors. - If flagged results are noted, investigate and
potentially re-run the sample. - Use backup methods or manual
techniques if necessary for confirmation.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the generated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for verification.
• Compare the results with reference intervals (typically 0.8 - 2.2
ng/dL, but confirm with specific laboratory ranges).
• Results outside the reference interval should be flagged and
reviewed by a designated laboratory technologist.
• Notify the requesting physician of critical results as per laboratory
policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Typically 0.8 - 2.2 ng/dL, but confirm with specific laboratory
reference ranges.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform QC checks with every batch of patient samples or per
shift as necessary.
• Document all QC results in accordance with laboratory policy.
• Address any QC failures by following troubleshooting guides
provided by the analyzer and reagent manufacturer.
• Validate reagent lot numbers and calibration as per the standard
practice.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific immunoassay analyzer
and T4 (Thyroxine), Free reagent kit.
• Laboratory internal quality control SOPs and reference
documents.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
9. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
• Ensure all personnel are trained and competent in performing the
T4 (Thyroxine), Free, Serum assay.
• Regularly review and update this SOP to reflect any changes in
laboratory procedures or manufacturer recommendations.
By rigorously following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accurate
and reliable determination of Free T4 (Thyroxine) levels in serum,
contributing to patient care and diagnostic accuracy.
