TITLE: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for T4 (Thyroxine), Total and Free, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the accurate and
precise measurement of Total and Free Thyroxine (T4) levels in
serum samples using immunoassay methods.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all staff members involved in the
analysis of serum samples for Total and Free T4 levels in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• The assigned technologist is responsible for performing the assay
according to this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor ensures that all personnel are trained
and that the assay is performed accurately and promptly.
• The Quality Control (QC) personnel validate, review, and ensure
the quality of the data generated.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Total T4: The total amount of thyroxine hormone in the blood,
including both bound and unbound fractions.
• Free T4: The unbound fraction of thyroxine hormone in the serum,
which is biologically active.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a Red Top Tube (RTT)
without anticoagulants or preservatives.
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
• Specimen stability: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 5 days. Specimens can be frozen at -20°C for
longer storage, up to 1 month.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Total T4 and Free T4 immunoassay kits (specific to the analyzer
used).
• Calibrators and control materials for immunoassay.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Sample tubes.
• Quality control materials.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Immunoassay analyzer (ensure that the specific immunoassay
analyzer used in the laboratory is mentioned, e.g., Roche Cobas
e411, Beckman Coulter Access).
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and Freezer (-20°C).
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
2. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature (if stored at
2-8°C).
3. Centrifuge the samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates or clots (if necessary).
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Perform calibrations using the provided calibrators according to
the specific manufacturer’s instructions for the immunoassay
analyzer used.
2. Prepare the quality control (QC) samples and ensure they are
within the accepted range before analyzing patient samples.
3. Program the analyzer with appropriate parameters for Total T4
and Free T4 assays.
4. Load serum samples into sample tubes and place them on the
analyzer.
5. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for running the assay on
the immunoassay analyzer.
6. Verify that all samples, controls, and calibrators have been
properly loaded and identified on the analyzer.
C) Post-Run:
1. After the run is complete, print and review the assay results.
2. Check if the QC results fall within the accepted ranges. If QC
fails, troubleshoot according to the instrument manual and re-
assay the samples.
3. If samples are flagged for rerun due to high or low results, rerun
those particular samples.
4. Validate that all results are accurate and complete.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily and weekly quality control checks using control
materials provided in the assay kits.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
• If QC results fall outside pre-defined limits, troubleshoot the issue,
reassay, and document all corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify patient results before reporting.
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
ensure that all results correspond correctly to the patient
identifiers.
• Mark critical results and notify the appropriate clinician or
healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Total T4: 4.5 to 12.0 µg/dL (58 to 154 nmol/L)
• Free T4: 0.8 to 1.8 ng/dL (10 to 23 pmol/L)
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric samples may interfere with results.
• Refer to the specific immunoassay kit inserts for detailed
limitations and interferences.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the immunoassay analyzer.
• Total and Free T4 assay kit package inserts.
• Laboratory quality assurance and control procedures manual.

update in consideration of new methodologies, advancements in
technology, and regulatory changes.
