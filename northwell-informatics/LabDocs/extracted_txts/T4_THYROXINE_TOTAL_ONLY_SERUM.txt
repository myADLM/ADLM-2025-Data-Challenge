STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) ANALYTICAL
PHASE FOR GENERATION OF TOTAL T4 (THYROXINE), SERUM
TEST RESULTS
1. PURPOSE To provide accurate and reliable measurements of total
T4 (thyroxine) levels in serum samples using standardized
procedures and to ensure that results are accurate, timely, and
consistent.
2. SCOPE This protocol is to be followed by all laboratory personnel
involved in the analysis of serum samples for total T4 levels at the
[Laboratory Name]. It outlines the steps and responsibilities involved
in the analytical phase after sample collection and accessioning.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing total T4 measurements and ensuring that
all procedural steps are followed. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and verifying compliance.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Total T4 (Thyroxine): The total amount of thyroxine, both bound
and unbound, present in the serum.
• Serum: The clear fluid part of the blood that remains after
coagulation, utilized in the measurement of total T4 levels.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• T4 Assay Kit
• Calibrators and controls provided by the kit manufacturer
• Appropriate centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or equivalent instrumentation
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sample tubes
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
1. Ensure that the serum samples have been collected, received,
and accessioned properly.
2. Verify the sample integrity and suitability for analysis. Samples
should be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
3. Centrifuge SST tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
obtain clear serum.
4. Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled sample tubes for
analysis.
Reagent and Instrument Preparation
1. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls as specified by the
manufacturer’s instructions included in the T4 assay kit.
2. Perform any necessary instrument calibration and quality
control (QC) testing.
3. Ensure the automated immunoassay analyzer or equivalent is
in proper working condition.
Analytical Measurement Procedure
1. Carefully load the calibrators, controls, and patient serum
samples onto the analyzer/sample rack.
2. Select the total T4 assay protocol on the analyzer.
3. Begin the assay run as per manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Monitor the assay run for any instrument errors or abnormal QC
results.
Quality Control (QC)
1. Perform QC testing at the beginning of each shift and with each
new lot of reagents or assay kits.
2. Utilize the provided calibrators and controls to ensure accuracy
and consistency.
3. Document all QC results in the laboratory QC log.
4. Any failed QC must be investigated, and the assay should not
proceed until QC results are within acceptable limits.
Reporting Results
1. Once the assay run is complete, review the results generated
by the analyzer.
2. Validate the results, ensuring that both internal QC results and
patient results fall within expected ranges.
3. Verify results and authorize them for release into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
7. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• The reference interval for total T4 will be specified in the assay kit
insert. Ensure to check the insert for specific intervals and update
the LIS accordingly.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with assay results;
such samples should be noted and possibly excluded.
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines on limitations and
interferences detailed in the assay kit insert.
9. CRITICAL RESULTS HANDLING
• Critical total T4 results should be reported immediately to the
requesting clinician. Document any critical values and the
individual notified per the laboratory’s critical result notification
policy.
10. REFERENCES
• T4 assay kit manufacturer’s insert
• Laboratory's internal QC procedures and documentation
guidelines
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of reagent preparation, QC results, patient
test results, and notifications/logs for internal and external audits.
