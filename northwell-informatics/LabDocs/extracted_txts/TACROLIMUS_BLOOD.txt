Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Tacrolimus, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the analytical process for
generating accurate and reliable results for tacrolimus levels in blood
specimens using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). This procedure ensures
precise measurement, quality control, and reporting protocols are
followed in compliance with regulatory guidelines.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff will perform the procedure and ensure all
steps are followed as detailed. The laboratory quality control
supervisor is responsible for overseeing this process and resolving
any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (Lavender top) tube.
Specimen Stability and Storage:
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 7 days.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis or clotted samples.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate or heparin tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• Micropipettes and tips
• Tacrolimus calibration standards
• Quality control samples (negative and positive controls)
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Internal standard for tacrolimus
• Water, HPLC grade
• Extraction solvents and other necessary chemicals
• Sample tubes and labels
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Calibrate HPLC and MS/MS instruments before use according to
standard procedures.
Sample Preparation:
1. Vortex or mix the whole blood sample adequately.
2. Aliquot 500 µL of whole blood into a labeled sample tube.
3. Add 50 µL of internal standard solution to the sample.
4. Vortex the sample for 30 seconds.
5. Add 1 mL of the extraction solvent.
6. Mix by vortexing for 1 minute.
7. Centrifuge at 14,000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C.
8. Transfer the supernatant to another labeled tube.
9. Evaporate the solvent under a nitrogen stream or in a
centrifugal evaporator.
10. Reconstitute the residue in 200 µL of mobile phase solution.
HPLC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system with the appropriate column and
mobile phase.
2. Equilibrate the system as per the standard operating conditions.
3. Inject 20 µL of reconstituted sample into the HPLC system.
4. The sample will pass through the HPLC system and enter the
MS/MS for detection and quantification.
5. Detect and record the retention time and peak area for
tacrolimus according to the instrument settings.
6. Ensure the system records internal standard parameters for
accuracy.
Quality Control:
1. Run external and internal quality controls (both high and low
concentrations) with each batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure controls are within the predefined acceptable range.
3. If quality control results are out of range, recalibrate and
troubleshoot as necessary before repeating the batch analysis.
4. CALCULATIONS AND VALIDATION
• Use the instrument software to calculate tacrolimus concentration
in patient samples by comparing sample peak areas to the
calibration curve created from known standards.
• Validate each run by confirming that quality control samples are
within acceptable limits and that patient results are consistent and
reproducible.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all patient results against QC standards.
• Results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified laboratory
scientist before being reported.
• Report the tacrolimus blood concentration in ng/mL.
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic: 5-15 ng/mL
• Reference intervals may be adjusted according to physician’s
prescription or specific patient conditions.
Critical Results:
• Any unexpected high or low levels must be communicated
immediately to the requesting physician as per laboratory critical
result notification policy.
1. CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
• Clean the HPLC and MS/MS system as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines at the end of each batch.
• Ensure that all waste is disposed of following hazardous waste
protocols.

• Manufacturer’s guidelines for HPLC and MS/MS systems.
