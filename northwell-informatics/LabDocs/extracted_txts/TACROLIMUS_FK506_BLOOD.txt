Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Tacrolimus (FK506)
Analysis in Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and efficient measurement
of Tacrolimus (FK506) levels in a blood sample, ensuring the
generation of reliable results for clinical decision-making.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of Tacrolimus (FK506) in whole blood samples using appropriate
methodologies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the
adherence to this protocol and addressing any deviations or issues
that arise during the analytical process.
4. DEFINITIONS
Tacrolimus (FK506): An immunosuppressive drug commonly used
post-transplant to reduce organ rejection risk.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Tacrolimus analytical system (LC-MS/MS, immunoassay, or
equivalent analyzer)
• Calibrators and controls specific for Tacrolimus
• Whole blood collection tubes containing EDTA
• Appropriate diluent and reagents for sample preparation
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Sample cups or vials
• Calibrator and control material
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Collection and Preparation
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Minimum volume: 2 mL.
2. Specimen Stability:
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. Handling:
◦ Mix specimens by gentle inversion before aliquotting.
◦ Ensure no hemolysis; discard if hemolysis is present.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Preparation for Analysis:
◦ Thaw frozen samples completely and bring them to room
temperature.
◦ Vortex mix the sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate plasma from blood cells.
◦ Pipette the required volume of the plasma portion into a new
labeled sample cup or vial.
2. Refer to analyzer’s method insert:
◦ Prepare samples as per analyzer-specific instructions.
◦ Include calibrators, controls, and patient samples in the
preparation sequence
3. Dilutions:
◦ Perform any necessary dilutions as specified by the method
or system instructions.
C. Analysis on Analytical System
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration using the appropriate Tacrolimus
calibration set following the system manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Verify calibration efficacy using quality control materials.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load calibrators, controls, and prepared samples onto the
analyzer.
◦ Ensure proper sequence and identify positions for each
sample.
3. Start Analysis:
◦ Initiate the analytical run as per the system’s operational
procedure.
◦ Monitor the system for errors or alerts throughout the run.
D. Quality Control
1. Run quality controls at least:
◦ Once per analytical batch.
◦ At the beginning and end of each run.
2. Assess the control results
◦ Control results must fall within the established ranges.
◦ Troubleshoot and resolve any out-of-range control results
before proceeding with patient samples.
E. Result Verification and Reporting
1. Review Results:
◦ Verify the analyte’s quantitative results by comparing to
historical data and expected ranges.
◦ If results are atypical or unexpected, review sample quality
and pre-analytical conditions.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Promptly report critical results to the appropriate medical
personnel following the laboratory’s critical result policy.
3. Document and Report:
◦ Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure all pertinent data, including control results,
calibration data, and patient results, are correctly entered.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific analytical system’s documentation and
manufacturer’s instructions for limitations of the Tacrolimus assay.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the analytical system used.
• Internal laboratory policies and procedures.
• Regulatory guidelines and accepted clinical practice standards.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Maintain all records of calibrations, controls, patient results, and
maintenance activities in accordance with laboratory and regulatory
requirements.
This SOP outlines the standardized procedure for the analysis of
Tacrolimus (FK506) in blood, ensuring quality and consistency in
generating reliable results to aid clinical decisions.
