SOP: Analytical Phase for Tacrolimus, PEAK, Blood
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the steps required for the accurate and precise analysis of
tacrolimus concentration in blood specimens during the peak period
using the approved methodology and instrumentation.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis,
ensuring proper calibration and maintenance of equipment, and
documenting all procedures and results according to this protocol.
• All staff must report any deviations or issues affecting results to a
supervisor immediately.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and taking corrective actions when needed.
1. DEFINITION:
Tacrolimus (FK506) is an immunosuppressive drug commonly used
in organ transplantation to reduce the activity of the patient's immune
system to lower the risk of organ rejection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
Preferred/acceptable:
• Whole blood collected in an EDTA tube.
• Ideal volume for testing: 4-6 mL.
• Specimens must be collected during the peak period (typically
0.5-2 hours post-dose).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or clotting.
• Specimens not stored or transported in appropriate conditions
(see stability).
Stability:
• Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7 days.
• Specimens may be stored at -20°C for up to 30 days for longer
storage but must be thawed and well-mixed prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Whole blood controls for quality control: low, medium, high
concentrations
• Tacrolimus calibration standards
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, buffers)
• Sample preparation supplies (e.g., protein precipitation reagents,
centrifuge)
• Clean glass vials or tubes
• Instrument-specific consumables (e.g., HPLC columns, LC-MS/
MS MS supplies)
1. PROCEDURE:
Pre-analytical:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintenance checks are
performed.
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples as per
manufacturer instructions.
• Allow tacrolimus control and patient samples to reach room
temperature before processing.
Sample Preparation:
• Add an appropriate volume of whole blood sample to a clean vial.
• Perform protein precipitation or any other required sample
preparation step (e.g., addition of methanol, vortexing,
centrifugation).
• Transfer the clear supernatant to a new clean vial for analysis.
Instrument Setup and Calibration:
• Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform a system suitability test by running a calibration standard.
• Perform the calibration curve by injecting calibration standards of
known concentration.
• Verify calibration with Quality Control samples (low, medium, high
controls).
Analytical:
• Inject an aliquot of the prepared sample into the HPLC or LC-MS/
MS system.
• Run the analysis according to the specified method (parameters
to include: flow rate, mobile phase composition, column
temperature, detection wavelength/mass range).
• Record retention times and peak areas.
• Calculate the concentration of tacrolimus in the sample using the
calibration curve.
Post-analytical:
• Review the generated data for each sample.
• Retain run data and chromatograms for review and
troubleshooting.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) or
appropriate logbook.
• Initial and date the documentation after verifying the results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Analyze quality control samples at the start, mid, and end of each
analytical run.
• Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
• If QC results are out of range, do not release any patient results
until the issue is investigated and resolved.
• Perform reagent and instrument maintenance validations as per
prescribed schedules.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If the calibration curve does not meet acceptance criteria,
recalibrate the instrument.
• Check for any instrument errors or maintenance alerts.
• Review sample preparation steps for completeness and accuracy.
• Consult with a supervisor to determine corrective actions and
repeat the analysis if required.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Verify and validate results before releasing them to the physician.
• Document any discussion with the physician or other medical staff
regarding atypical results.
• Ensure results are accurately reported in LIS with appropriate
units (usually ng/mL).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Tacrolimus therapeutic range for peak blood: 5-20 ng/mL (specific
ranges may vary depending on the institution and patient
protocol).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to specific manufacturer's instructions for the limitations of
the HPLC or LC-MS/MS method used in this protocol.
• Potential interferences from other drugs or metabolites should be
considered and reported if suspected.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s Official Operating Manual for HPLC or LC-MS/MS
instrument.
• Calibration standards and control inserts for tacrolimus.
• Relevant institutional guidelines and protocols for
immunosuppressive drug monitoring.
This protocol will be reviewed and updated annually or as required
for compliance with the latest clinical and regulatory standards.
