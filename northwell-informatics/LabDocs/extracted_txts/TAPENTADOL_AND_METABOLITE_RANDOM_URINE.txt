STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the analytical procedure
for generating results for Tapentadol and its metabolite, random,
urine in the laboratory. This SOP ensures accuracy and consistency
in the analysis and results reporting.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of Tapentadol and its
metabolite in urine samples received by the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis according to this SOP and to log all necessary
data. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with this procedure.
1. SAFETY AND HANDLING
Ensure that all laboratory personnel wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE) including lab coats, gloves, and safety
eyewear while performing this analysis. Handle all urine specimens
as if they are potentially infectious.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Urine, random collection
• Specimen container: Sterile, properly labeled urine collection
container
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers
• Specimens with significant contamination or hemolysis
• Insufficient volume for testing
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient ID, date of collection)
Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C) within 48 hours of collection.
• Frozen samples can be stored up to 6 months at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Liquid Chromatography coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Internal standard solution (deuterated Tapentadol)
• Mobile phases (e.g., Ammonium formate buffer, Acetonitrile)
• Water (LC-MS grade)
• Methanol (LC-MS grade)
• Urine hydrolysis reagents (if applicable)
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control (QC)
Samples:
• Prepare calibration standards by diluting stock solutions of
Tapentadol and its metabolite with LC-MS grade water or urine
matrix.
• Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations using control urine matrix.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify the integrity and labeling of the urine
specimens.
2. Aliquot 1 mL of urine into a clean labeled tube.
3. Add internal standard solution (e.g., deuterated Tapentadol) to
each sample.
4. Vortex mix the sample for 30 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the supernatant to an autosampler vial for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
C. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the calibration standards, QC samples, and patient
specimens onto the autosampler.
3. Initiate the analysis sequence.
4. During the run, monitor system performance and calibration
curve integrity.
5. Review chromatograms and mass spectra for each sample to
ensure proper integration and identification.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Compare the retention times and mass spectra of the patient
samples to those of the calibration standards.
2. Quantify the concentrations of Tapentadol and its metabolite
using the established calibration curve.
3. Evaluate the quality control samples to ensure the accuracy
and precision of the assay.
E. Troubleshooting:
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, investigate potential
causes (e.g., instrument performance, reagent quality).
• Re-calibrate the instrument if necessary and repeat the analysis
of affected samples.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch, and after every 10 specimens.
• Follow the laboratory's specific guidelines for handling and
documenting QC data.
• If QC results do not meet acceptance criteria, take corrective
actions before proceeding.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in ng/mL.
• Critical values or unexpected results must be reviewed by the
laboratory supervisor before reporting.
• Document all findings and ensure reviewed results are accurately
entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. REFERENCES
• LC-MS/MS instrument's operation manual
• Manufacturer's instructions for reagents and materials used
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards and guidelines
This protocol shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to ensure compliance with current best practices and regulatory
requirements.
