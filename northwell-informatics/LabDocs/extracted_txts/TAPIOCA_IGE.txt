Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TAPIOCA IGE Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and reproducible
measurement of total IgE levels in serum using the TAPIOCA IGE
assay method.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
TAPIOCA IGE assay, documenting results, and notifying relevant
parties of any discrepancies or issues. Supervisors are responsible
for monitoring adherence to this SOP.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• TAPIOCA IGE assay kit
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Plate reader capable of reading at specified wavelengths
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Test tubes and racks
• Laboratory timer
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in SST (Serum Separator
Tube) and stored at -20°C until analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. Samples stored at incorrect temperatures or conditions.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC with each assay run using manufacturer-provided
controls. Ensure the results are within the acceptable range
before proceeding with sample analysis. Document control results
in the QC log.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are brought to room
temperature before beginning the assay.
2. Wear appropriate PPE.
3. Prepare all necessary reagents as outlined in the TAPIOCA IGE
kit insert.
Sample Analysis
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute serum samples and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Label microplate wells according to the assay layout plan.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of diluted samples, controls,
and standards to the designated wells.
◦ Add reagents as per the TAPIOCA IGE kit instructions,
ensuring all steps are timed accurately.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate according to the specified conditions in
the kit insert.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as instructed, ensuring efficient removal of
unbound reagents. Inadequate washing can affect results.
5. Addition of Detection Reagents:
◦ Add detection antibodies and substrates per the kit
instructions.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a plate
reader at the specified wavelengths.
◦ Ensure all readings fall within the linear range of the
standard curve.
7. RESULTS REPORTING
• Use the software provided or follow manual calculation
instructions to derive IgE concentrations from OD readings.
• Verify results for accuracy and consistency.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly. All results must be reviewed and validated by the
technologist.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls are out of range, do not proceed with sample analysis.
Identify and rectify the issue before re-running the assay.
• Any discrepancies or equipment errors should be logged, and the
supervisor notified immediately.
• Follow kit instructions for troubleshooting common issues such as
unexpected OD readings or reagent contamination.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all assay details, including reagent lot numbers, controls,
and sample IDs, are documented.
• Record all results and any observations in the appropriate
logbook.
• Document any corrective actions taken during the analysis
process.
10. REFERENCES
Refer to the TAPIOCA IGE kit insert for detailed reagent handling,
specific timings, incubation conditions, and any limitations associated
with the assay.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all safety protocols for handling biological specimens and
chemical reagents.
• Dispose of sharps and biohazard waste according to laboratory
policies.
12. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
• Ensure all equipment used in the assay is regularly calibrated and
maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications.
• Perform routine checks and maintenance of the plate reader and
micropipettes immediately before and after use.
This SOP ensures the accurate analysis of total IgE levels in serum,
which is essential for diagnosing and monitoring allergic conditions in
patients. Adherence to this SOP is crucial for maintaining consistency
and reliability in results.
