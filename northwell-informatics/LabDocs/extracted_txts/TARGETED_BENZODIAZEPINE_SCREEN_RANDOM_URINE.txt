Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Targeted
Benzodiazepine Screen, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
benzodiazepines in random urine samples using chromatographic
and spectrometric techniques. The objective is to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible test results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff trained in chromatographic and spectrometric
analysis techniques are responsible for performing this procedure. It
is the responsibility of all staff members to identify and report any
deviations or issues that arise during analysis.
2. DEFINITION
Targeted Benzodiazepine Screen: This test detects the presence of
specific benzodiazepines and their metabolites in a random urine
sample using chromatographic and spectrometric methods.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Volumetric flasks
• Calibrated pipettes
• Sample vials with caps
• Benzodiazepine standards and internal standards
• Mobile phase solvents
• Sample preparation reagents (e.g., hydrolysis enzymes, organic
solvents)
• Control materials
4. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Preparation
1. Specimen Collection and Handling:
◦ Collect random urine samples in a clean, dry container.
◦ Ensure samples are labeled appropriately with patient
information, collection date, and time.
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C if not analyzed within 2 hours. If
stored longer than 24 hours, freeze at -20°C.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Thaw samples (if frozen) and bring them to room
temperature.
◦ Vortex mix each urine sample for at least 30 seconds.
◦ Pipette an aliquot (e.g., 5 mL) of the urine sample into a
sample vial.
◦ Add internal standard to each aliquot according to validated
method requirements.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards in urine matrix at various
concentration levels.
◦ Plot calibration curves and ensure linearity (R² > 0.995)
before running samples.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative control materials in each batch
of analysis.
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and
end of each batch.
◦ Verify control results fall within predefined acceptance
ranges before processing patient samples.
C) Chromatography/MS Analysis
1. Sample Injection:
◦ Set up GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system according to
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Inject prepared sample aliquots into the system as per
validated method.
2. Chromatographic Conditions:
◦ Utilize appropriate column, temperature, and gradient
conditions as specified in the method.
◦ Ensure separation of benzodiazepines and their metabolites
is achieved for accurate identification.
3. Mass Spectrometric Detection:
◦ Use selected ion monitoring (SIM) or multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) modes for targeted detection.
◦ Record retention times and ion ratios of analytes and
internal standards.
D) Data Analysis and Result Reporting
1. Data Acquisition:
◦ Collect chromatographic and spectrometric data from each
sample run.
◦ Use software to integrate chromatographic peaks and
identify analytes.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Compare chromatographic retention times and ion ratios
against those of calibration standards.
◦ Calculate analyte concentrations using calibration curves.
3. Result Validation:
◦ Review all data for quality control and peak integration
accuracy.
◦ Validate each result by confirming control sample
acceptability and calibration curve linearity.
4. Reporting Results:
◦ Record the final concentrations of benzodiazepines and
their metabolites in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Report the results as "Detected" or "Not Detected" for each
targeted benzodiazepine.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This method may not detect all benzodiazepines available or
those present in extremely low concentrations.
• Interference from other substances in the urine may affect the
accuracy of results. Follow-up confirmatory testing may be
needed for certain cases.
