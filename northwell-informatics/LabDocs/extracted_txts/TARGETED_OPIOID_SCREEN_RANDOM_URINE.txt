TARGETED OPIOID SCREEN, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To perform a targeted opioid screen on a random urine specimen,
ensuring accurate and timely results for clinical diagnosis and
treatment.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the targeted opioid screen following this procedure. All staff must
ensure quality control measures are implemented and notify the
supervisor of any issues impacting test quality.
1. DEFINITION
Targeted opioid screen involves selective detection of specific opioid
compounds in a random urine sample using analytical techniques
such as immunoassay and confirmatory tests like gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements: Preferred: - 30 mL of freshly voided
random urine. Acceptable: - Urine sample collected in a clean, sterile
container without preservatives. Unacceptable: - Specimens
contaminated with feces, menstrual blood, or other foreign
substances. - Specimens received >24 hours after collection without
proper storage (may be accepted if refrigerated immediately after
collection).
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies: - Immunoassay analyzers - GC-
MS or LC-MS/MS instruments - Urine specimen cups - Calibrators
and controls specific to opioid compounds - Sample preparation
materials like pipettes, centrifuges, and extraction solvents
Procedure Steps:
1. Specimen Handling:
a. Upon receipt of the urine sample, check for proper labeling (patient name, date and time of collection).
b. Assign an accession number and log it into the laboratory information system (LIS).
c. Inspect the sample for any signs of contamination or improper storage.
2. Initial Screening:
a. Perform opioid screening using the immunoassay analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions.
b. Prepare and run positive and negative controls to ensure assay performance.
c. Document results in the LIS.
3. Confirmatory Testing (if initial screen is positive):
a. Prepare the urine sample for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS analysis following the specific sample preparation protocols (e.g., solid-phase extraction, liquid-liquid extraction).
b. Calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS instrument using opioid-specific calibrators.
c. Perform the analysis according to standardized operating conditions and instrument settings.
d. Analyze the chromatograms and mass spectra to identify specific opioid compounds.
e. Compare the detected compounds against established reference standards and retention times.
4. Data Interpretation and Result Reporting:
a. Interpret the results according to the targeted opioid compounds' cut-off concentrations.
b. Verify screening and confirmatory test results.
c. Document any discrepancies and address them through reanalysis if necessary.
d. Report results in LIS, ensuring all data is accurate before verification.
e. Flag any critical values and notify the healthcare provider according to laboratory protocol.
Quality Control:
- Run internal quality controls for each batch of specimens.
- Verify calibration and performance of instruments before testing.
- Participate in external proficiency testing programs to validate accuracy.
Method Limitations:
- Refer to the instrument manufacturer’s instructions for specific limitations regarding detection limits, cross-reactivity, and potential interferences.
References: - Manufacturer's guidelines for immunoassay analyzers
used in opioid screening. - Standard operating procedures for GC-
MS or LC-MS/MS instrumentation. - Clinical guidelines for opioid
testing in urine.
Reporting Results:
- Results are to be automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed by the technologist.
- Follow site-specific guidelines for result reporting and documentation.
Sample Integrity:
- Centrifuge a small aliquot if there are concerns regarding sample integrity (e.g., hemolysis).
- Use professional judgment in reporting any compromised samples.
Critical Results:
- Critical results should be communicated to the healthcare provider following site-specific protocols for timely intervention.
Review and Approval:
The SOP must be reviewed annually or whenever a major change in
the procedure occurs, ensuring compliance with regulations and best
practices.
