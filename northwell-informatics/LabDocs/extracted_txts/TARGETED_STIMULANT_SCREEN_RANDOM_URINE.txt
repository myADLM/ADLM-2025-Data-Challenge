Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Targeted Stimulant Screen,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for
generating results for the targeted stimulant screen in randomly
collected urine samples.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for performing the
targeted stimulant screen according to this procedure. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring the
accuracy and precision of test results.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP is applicable to all staff members who perform targeted
stimulant screening tests on urine samples in the forensic or clinical
toxicology laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS:
• Targeted Stimulant Screen: A set of tests designed to detect
specific stimulants, such as amphetamines, methamphetamines,
MDMA (ecstasy), methylphenidate, and their metabolites, in urine.
• Random Urine Sample: A urine sample collected at an
unscheduled time without prior notice to the patient.
4. SPECIMEN:
Accepted Specimen: 10 mL randomly collected urine sample that is
received in an appropriate urine collection container within 24 hours
of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are less than 10 mL.
• Specimens that have been stored for more than 24 hours without
refrigeration.
• Specimens that have no collection date/time indicated on the
sample container or requisition.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Calibrators and quality control materials (QC)
• Methanol, acetonitrile, formic acid, and mobile phase solvents as
specified by the instrumentation requirements
• Urine drug test panel for stimulants
• Test tubes, pipettes, and vials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE including gloves and lab coat.
2. Record the specimen receipt date, time, and condition in the
laboratory information management system (LIMS).
3. Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 x g for 5 minutes to
remove any particulates.
Calibration and QC:
1. Prepare and run calibrators and quality control materials as
instructed by the manufacturer’s guidelines and the instrument
manual.
2. Analyze QC samples at the beginning and end of each batch
and after every 15 samples.
3. QC results must fall within established acceptance criteria. If
QC results are out of range, recalibrate the instrument and
reanalyze the batch.
Analysis:
1. Aliquot 1 mL of the centrifuged urine sample into a clean vial.
2. Add appropriate reagents and internal standards as per the
instrument-specific targeted stimulant panel.
3. Mix the sample thoroughly and load it onto the GC-MS or LC-
MS/MS system.
4. Perform the analysis according to the instrument’s operating
procedures.
5. Annotate the sequence of sample analysis carefully to ensure
sample tracking.
Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Review the chromatograms and mass spectra generated by the
instrument software for each sample.
2. Identify and quantitate the targeted stimulant compounds based
on their retention times and mass-to-charge ratios (m/z).
3. Verify the results against calibrators and QC standards to
ensure their validity.
4. Enter the results into the LIMS and interpret them according to
clinically or legally established thresholds.
7. RESULTS VALIDATION:
1. Review the batch run, ensuring that calibrators, controls, and
patient samples all meet quality control parameters.
2. If any sample shows abnormal results, repeat the analysis for
that specific sample to confirm the results.
3. Any repeat analyses should be thoroughly documented, and
deviations from standard protocols should be reported and
explained.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Record the final validated results in the LIMS.
2. Generate patient reports and verify them for accuracy before
releasing results.
3. Communicate any critical or unexpected results to the referring
physician or as per hospital/clinic procedure.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. All analytical runs must include appropriate calibrators and
control samples.
2. Verify the functionality of the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system by
regular maintenance and performance checks according to the
instrument's maintenance schedule.
3. Maintain a log of all QC data and instrument performance
records.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
As per the instrument and reagent manufacturers' guidelines, refer to
the specific insert provided with the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS reagents
for known limitations regarding sensitivity, specificity, and potential
interferences.
11. REFERENCES:
• Instrument operation manual for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
• Reagent and control product inserts
• Laboratory’s validation studies and performance criteria
12. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
Maintain detailed records of all specimen results, quality control data,
calibrator data, and maintenance logs as required by laboratory
policies and regulatory guidelines.
Note: This SOP must be reviewed and updated at least annually
or if there are significant changes to instrumentation,
methodology, or regulations.
