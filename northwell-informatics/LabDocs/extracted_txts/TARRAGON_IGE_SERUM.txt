Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TARRAGON, IgE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for TARRAGON-specific IgE in serum
samples, ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely results.
Responsibility: This procedure should be followed by all designated
laboratory personnel trained in immunoassay testing and are familiar
with the instrument and reagents used for this specific test.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable:
• 1-2 mL of serum.
• Collected in serum separator tubes (SST) and centrifuged within 2
hours of collection.
• Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately and are stable for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, specimens should be frozen at ≤ -20°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
• Specimens with insufficient volume for analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoanalyzer (refer to manufacturer’s model, e.g., Phadia
250/500).
• Specific IgE reagent kit for TARRAGON.
• Controls and calibrators recommended by the reagent
manufacturer.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Disposable gloves and lab coat.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL Calibration:
• Perform calibration as per the manufacturer's instructions when
starting a new lot of reagents or after maintenance of the
instrument.
• Use the calibration curve to ensure all results fall within the
validated range.
Quality Control:
• Analyze negative and positive control sera with each batch of
patient samples.
• Ensure control results are within the established ranges before
reporting patient results. Repeat control testing or troubleshoot
per protocol if controls fail.
1. PROCEDURE 5.1 Specimen Preparation
• Allow the serum samples and controls to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) before analysis.
• Mix the specimens gently by inversion or using a vortex mixer.
5.2 Setting up the Instrument
• Turn on the immunoanalyzer and allow it to perform self-checks.
• Ensure that the instrument has been cleaned and is in proper
working condition, as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
5.3 Loading Reagents
• Load the TARRAGON-specific IgE reagent kit onto the analyzer
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure there are enough reagents for the entire batch of samples
to be tested.
5.4 Running the Samples
• Load samples, calibrators, and quality control materials onto the
sample rack.
• Program the analyzer for the specific test, including sample
identification and test parameters.
• Start the analysis per the instrument's operational manual.
5.5 Generating Test Results
• Upon completion of the run, review the output from the
immunoanalyzer.
• Validate all results, ensuring all control levels are within
acceptable ranges.
• Investigate any outliers or anomalous results according to
established troubleshooting steps.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If calibration fails, repeat the calibration process. If it fails again,
refer to manufacturer’s technical support.
• For control failures, re-analyze the control. If the issue persists,
prepare fresh control material and/or reagents before reanalysis.
Contact technical support if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Apply appropriate comments for samples that could not be
accurately analyzed (e.g., due to hemolysis).
• Review and approve results for release to physicians.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of calibration, quality control results, specimen
identification, results, and any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure documentation is retrievable for auditing and review.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instruction Manual for the Immunoanalyzer and
the reagent kit.
• CLSI Guidelines for Immunoassay Procedures.
• Internal Quality Management Systems.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Track revisions to the procedure with date, changes made, and
personnel responsible for changes.
