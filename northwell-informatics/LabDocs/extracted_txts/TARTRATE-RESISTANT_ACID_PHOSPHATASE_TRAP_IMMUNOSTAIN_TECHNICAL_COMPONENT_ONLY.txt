Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TARTRATE-RESISTANT
ACID PHOSPHATASE (TRAP) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing the Tartrate-
Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) immunostain for the detection of
TRAP enzyme activity in bone marrow and other tissue sections. This
procedure is used primarily in the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia.
2. DEFINITIONS
• TRAP: An enzyme that is resistant to inhibition by tartrate and
typically found in certain leukocytes, notably the hairy cells in
hairy cell leukemia.
• Immunostaining: A laboratory method that uses antibodies to
detect specific antigens in prepared tissue sections.
3. SPECIMEN
• Type: Bone marrow biopsy sections or other formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Preparation: Sections should be cut at 4-5 micrometers, and
mounted on positively charged slides to ensure adequate
adhesion.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• TRAP Staining Kit
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol
• Distilled Water
• Hematoxylin
• Eosin (optional, for counterstaining)
• Coverslips
• Mounting medium
• Positively charged slides
5. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Staining jars
• Light microscope
• Timer
• Water bath
6. PROCEDURE
Preliminary Steps:
1. Cutting Sections: Cut FFPE tissue at 4-5 micrometers and
mount sections on positively charged slides.
2. Baking Slides: Place slides in a 60°C oven for at least one
hour or overnight at 37°C to ensure proper adherence.
Deparaffinization and Hydration:
1. Deparaffinize: Place slides in xylene for 5 minutes, repeat in
fresh xylene for another 5 minutes.
2. Rehydration: Pass slides through the following graded ethanol
series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
Staining Procedure:
1. Stain with TRAP Solution:
◦ Incubate sections in TRAP staining solution according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Generally, immerse slides in
pre-warmed TRAP solution at 37°C for 30-60 minutes.
◦ Check periodically for adequate color development.
2. Rinsing:
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes to remove
excess staining solution.
3. Counterstaining (optional):
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse in distilled water until clear.
◦ If eosin counterstaining is desired, dip slides briefly in eosin
for 30 seconds, followed by rinsing in distilled water.
Dehydration and Clearing:
1. Rinse slides in the following graded ethanol series:
◦ 70% ethanol for 1 minute
◦ 95% ethanol for 1 minute
◦ 100% ethanol for 1 minute
◦ Repeat in fresh 100% ethanol for another 1 minute
2. Clear in xylene for 5 minutes, repeat in fresh xylene for another
5 minutes.
Mounting:
1. Apply coverslip with appropriate mounting medium.
2. Allow slides to dry completely before microscopy examination.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Include one positive control slide with each
staining batch to ensure the staining procedure is working
properly.
• Negative Control: Include one negative control slide (without the
primary antibody) to ensure specificity.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Evaluation: Examine slides under a light microscope. TRAP-
positive cells will show a distinct, red or purplish granular staining.
• Documentation: Record the presence or absence of TRAP-
positive cells in the report while the pathologist makes the final
diagnostic interpretation.
9. REFERENCES
Include references to TRAP staining kit manufacturer's instructions
and relevant scientific literature on TRAP immunostaining.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Incomplete Staining: Verify that all reagents are prepared and
used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Ensure that
slides are adequately deparaffinized and hydrated.
• Excessive Background Staining: Ensure proper rinsing steps
are followed and that sections are adequately counterstained and
washed.
• Lack of Staining: Check reagent expiration dates and proper
slide preparation and adherence.
This protocol outlines the steps for performing the TRAP
immunostain procedure, focusing on the technical aspects of staining
and preparation. Ensure all staff are trained and follow laboratory
safety and quality control procedures according to our laboratory
standards.
