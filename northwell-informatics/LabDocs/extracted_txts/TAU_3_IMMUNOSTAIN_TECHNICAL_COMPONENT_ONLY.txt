TAU 3 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY SOP
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for performing the technical component
of the TAU 3 immunostain for immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing in
the laboratory.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
responsible for performing TAU 3 immunostaining. It outlines all steps
from specimen preparation to tracking and documentation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere strictly to
this protocol to ensure reliable and reproducible results. Supervisors
must ensure compliance with all steps and provide necessary
training.

• Chromogen: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine)
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline)
• Blocking solution
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Humidified chamber
• Slide rack
• Incubator at 37°C
• Water bath
• Immunostaining incubator
• Timer
• Microtome
• Microcentrifuge
• Fume hood
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Cutting and Mounting Sections:
◦ Using a microtome, section the paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks at 4-5 micrometers thick.
◦ Mount sections onto positively charged microscope slides
and dry overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C if needed
urgently.
B. Dewaxing and Rehydration
1. Dewaxing:
◦ Deparaffinize slides by incubating them in xylene for 2 x 5
minutes.
2. Rehydration:
◦ Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols: 100%, 95%, and
70% ethanol for 2 minutes each, followed by rinsing in
distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in a pre-heated antigen retrieval solution
suitable for TAU 3 (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0) and incubate
at 95-99°C for 20 minutes in a water bath or microwave.
◦ Allow slides to cool in buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
D. Staining Protocol
1. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Rinse in
PBS.
2. Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
◦ Incubate slides in blocking solution (e.g., 10% normal
serum) for 1 hour at room temperature in a humidified
chamber.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with diluted TAU 3 primary antibody (dilution
per manufacturer’s instructions) for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C. Rinse with PBS.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply biotinylated secondary antibody and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature. Rinse with PBS.
5. Application of ABC Complex:
◦ Apply the HRP-conjugated avidin-biotin complex (ABC) and
incubate for 30 minutes. Rinse with PBS.
6. Visualization:
◦ Apply DAB solution and incubate until the desired stain
intensity develops (typically 1-10 minutes). Rinse with
distilled water to stop the reaction.
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. Rinse
in tap water.
8. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and
100%) and clear in xylene.
◦ Mount coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
E. Quality Control
1. Quality Control:
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls with each
batch of slides stained.
◦ Document any deviations from the standard procedure and
report to the supervisor.
2. RESULT REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Results are reviewed microscopically and documented by the
pathologist.
• Technical documentation should include slide identification,
staining protocol details, and any observed issues or deviations.
• Record initial observations and hand over to pathologist for final
diagnosis and reporting.
