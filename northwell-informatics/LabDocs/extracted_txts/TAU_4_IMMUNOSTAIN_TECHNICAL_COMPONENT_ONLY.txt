Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Tau 4 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures and
responsibilities involved in the analytical phase of generating results
for the Tau 4 immunostain, focusing on the technical component only.
This procedure ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the
immunostaining results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform all steps of the Tau 4 immunostain procedure accurately and
efficiently, ensuring that all documentation is completed. The
supervising technologist is responsible for verifying and validating
results.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
3.1 Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Oven
• Coplin jars or staining racks
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Microscope
3.2 Reagents:
• Tau 4 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (appropriate for the primary)
• Detection kit (e.g., DAB or equivalent)
• Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS)
• Mounting medium (e.g., DPX or equivalent)
• Xylene
• Ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Deionized water
4. SPECIMEN PREPARATION
4.1 Specimen Type: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
4.2 Sectioning:
1. Embed tissue in paraffin if not already done.
2. Section paraffin blocks at 4-5 micrometers using a
microtome.
3. Transfer sections onto adhesive-coated microscope slides.
4. Dry slides on a warming tray or in an oven at 60°C for at least
1 hour or overnight.
5. DEPARAFFINIZATION AND REHYDRATION
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2x3 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 3 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 3 minutes
3. Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
6. ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable method (e.g., heat-
induced epitope retrieval using a citrate buffer, pH 6.0):
◦ Place slides in Coplin jars containing retrieval buffer.
◦ Heat in a water bath at 95-100°C for 20-30 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool down to room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 2x5 minutes.
7. IMMUNOSTAINING
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in PBS for 2x5 minutes.
3. Apply blocking solution (e.g., 5% normal serum in PBS) to
prevent non-specific binding, and incubate 20 minutes.
4. Drain excess blocking solution from slides without washing.
5. Apply primary antibody (Tau 4) diluted in PBS according to
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature for
1-2 hours, or overnight at 4°C.
6. Wash slides in PBS for 3x5 minutes.
7. Apply secondary antibody (matched to the primary antibody)
and incubate as per manufacturer's instructions.
8. Wash slides in PBS for 3x5 minutes.
9. Apply detection reagent (DAB substrate) and monitor the
development of color under the microscope for 2-10 minutes.
10. Rinse with deionized water to stop the reaction.
8. COUNTERSTAINING AND MOUNTING
1. Counterstain slides with Harris hematoxylin for 30 seconds to
1 minute.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 3-5 minutes.
3. Blue the hematoxylin by dipping slides in a weak ammonia
water solution for 10 seconds.
4. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%,
95%, 100%) for 3 minutes each.
5. Clear slides with xylene for 2x5 minutes.
6. Mount slides with a suitable mounting medium (e.g., DPX) and
place coverslips.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls with each staining run.
2. Ensure that the staining quality of controls meets the expected
results before interpreting patient slides.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure and notify the supervisor.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• The technical component results shall be provided to the
pathologist or requesting clinician for interpretation.
• Ensure that all slides and documentation are accurately labeled
and logged into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
