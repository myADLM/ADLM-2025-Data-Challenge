Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
TAU Immunostain – Technical Component Only
1. Purpose: To outline the procedures for the technical processing
and generation of results for TAU immunostaining in the
laboratory.
Responsibility: The laboratory technologists are responsible for
ensuring that the TAU immunostain is prepared, performed, and
reviewed accurately and that the results are documented
appropriately.
1. Specimen:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
• Unstained slides cut at 3-5 μm thickness from paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks.
Unacceptable:
• Frozen tissue sections.
• Tissue blocks or slides that are inadequately fixed or improperly
stored.
1. Reagents and Supplies:
• Primary antibody specific for TAU (validated for
immunohistochemistry).
• Secondary antibody conjugated to a detection system (e.g., HRP
or AP).
• DAB chromogen or other appropriate substrate/chromogen
system.
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining.
• Positive control tissue.
• Negative control tissue.
• Reagent solutions: Buffer solutions, peroxide block, protein block,
etc.
• Automated staining system (if available) or manual staining
supplies.
• Microscope slides, cover slips, mounting media.
1. Procedure:
A) Preparation of Reagents and Solutions:
• Prepare all reagents according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Check expiration dates and ensure proper storage of all reagents.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides using xylene or an equivalent clearing
agent (two changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded alcohols (100%,
95%, 70%, 50%) to distilled water (2-3 minutes each).
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate retrieval solution
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA, pH 8.0).
2. Heat the slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or retrieval
system for the recommended time (typically 15-30 minutes).
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes and rinse in distilled water
followed by buffer solution (PBS or TBS).
D) Blocking Endogenous Peroxidases:
1. Incubate slides with peroxide block solution for 5-10 minutes to
block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in buffer solution.
E) Protein Blocking:
1. Apply protein block (serum or commercially available protein
block) to the slides for 20 minutes to reduce non-specific
binding.
2. Blot off excess solution.
F) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply primary antibody specific for TAU to the slides.
2. Incubate in a moist chamber at an appropriate temperature
(usually 37°C or room temperature) for the recommended time
(typically 1-2 hours or overnight).
3. Rinse slides in buffer solution.
G) Secondary Antibody and Detection System:
1. Apply secondary antibody conjugated to the detection system
to the slides.
2. Incubate slides for 30 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in buffer solution.
H) Chromogen/Substrate Development:
1. Apply DAB chromogen or another appropriate substrate/
chromogen system.
2. Monitor and develop color according to manufacturer’s
recommendations (typically 5-10 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
I) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in tap water and blue the nuclei by immersing slides in
ammonium water or by rinsing in running tap water.
J) Dehydration, Clearing, and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through a graded series of alcohols, clear in
xylene.
2. Coverslip slides with mounting media.
3. Quality Control:
• Use a positive control slide to ensure the staining procedure
worked correctly.
• Use a negative control slide (omit the primary antibody) to check
for non-specific binding of secondary antibody.
• Document reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and any
deviations from the protocol.
• Ensure that staining is consistent and specific to TAU protein in
control and test slides.
1. Result Documentation:
• Review and evaluate the slides under the microscope.
• Record the presence, absence, and level of TAU staining.
• Ensure that the technical data is accurately recorded and
reviewed by a qualified technologist.
1. Reporting Results:
• All stained slides will be provided to the pathologist for
interpretation.
• Ensure that the slides and staining results are appropriately
labeled and documented for pathologist review.
• Report any discrepancies or issues encountered during the
staining process to the supervisor immediately.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions and guidelines for TAU primary
antibody and detection system.
• Laboratory-specific quality control protocols and guidelines.
• Relevant literature on immunohistochemistry and TAU protein
analysis.
This protocol ensures that the technical steps involved in TAU
immunostaining are performed accurately and reproducibly, resulting
in reliable staining for pathologist interpretation.
