Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) TITLE: Analytical Phase for
Tay-Sachs Disease, HEXA Gene, Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE: To outline the analytical procedures for performing full
gene analysis of the HEXA gene to diagnose Tay-Sachs Disease.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing the HEXA gene analysis using the procedures outlined
in this document. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that the staff is adequately trained and that
quality control measures are implemented consistently.
3. SPECIMEN: Type: Whole blood (3-5 mL in EDTA tube) Stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours.
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): Not recommended due to potential DNA
degradation.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• DNA Extraction kits appropriate for blood samples
• PCR Thermocycler
• PCR reagents (primers specific for HEXA gene, Taq polymerase,
dNTPs, buffer, MgCl2)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus and reagents
• DNA sequencing equipment and reagents
• Laboratory incubator
• Nucleic acid quantification device (NanoDrop or equivalent)
• Sequencing analysis software
5. PROCEDURE:
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Use a validated DNA extraction protocol suitable for blood
samples (according to the manufacturer's instructions).
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a NanoDrop or equivalent
device. Document the yield and quality ratio (A260/A280).
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Design primers specific to the HEXA gene covering all exons
and intronic boundaries to ensure full gene analysis.
2. Prepare the PCR reaction mixture according to the following
components:
◦ DNA template: 50-100 ng
◦ Forward Primer: 0.5 µM
◦ Reverse Primer: 0.5 µM
◦ dNTPs: 0.2 mM each
◦ Taq polymerase: 1 unit
◦ MgCl2: 1.5-2.0 mM (optimized concentration)
◦ Buffer: as provided with the Taq polymerase
◦ Nuclease-free water: to final volume of 25-50 µL
3. Perform PCR under the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-65°C (optimized for primers) for 30
seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute (adjust according to
amplicon size)
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
4. Validate the PCR product by running a gel electrophoresis (2%
agarose gel).
C. Purification of PCR Products:
1. PCR products should be purified using a column-based
purification kit or equivalent method according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify purified PCR product concentration using NanoDrop or
equivalent device and document the result.
D. Sequencing:
1. Using the purified PCR products, perform sequencing reactions
according to the protocol provided by the sequencing kit
manufacturer.
2. Load samples into the sequencing instrument and run the
protocol as specified by the manufacturer.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Download raw sequencing data and analyze using sequencing
analysis software.
2. Align sequences to the reference HEXA gene sequence to
identify variants.
3. Interpret the variants according to established guidelines such
as ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics) criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE: A. Quality
Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in every batch of PCR
amplification and sequencing runs.
2. Re-run samples or the entire process if controls do not yield
expected results.
3. Review and document all quality control results.
B. Quality Assurance:
1. Ensure all equipment and reagents are calibrated and within
their expiration dates.
2. Conduct periodic proficiency testing and compliance with CLIA
requirements.
3. Maintain detailed records of all procedures and results in LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Document all findings in the patient’s file and in the LIS.
2. Generate a detailed report indicating any detected mutations,
their clinical significance, and possible implications for Tay-
Sachs Disease. Provide interpretation and recommendations
consistent with current clinical guidelines.
3. Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified geneticist
or pathologist before release to the clinician.
8. REFERENCES:
1. Diagnostic method guides and manufacturer’s protocols for
DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing.
2. ACMG Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of
Sequence Variants.
3. Relevant scientific literature on the HEXA gene and Tay-Sachs
Disease.
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL: This SOP will be reviewed annually
and updated as necessary. This SOP must be approved by the
laboratory director or designate before implementation.
