Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Total
Eosinophil Count (TEA), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum
Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Total Eosinophil Count (TEA),
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and the analysis of serum samples in the
clinical laboratory. These guidelines ensure accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of the results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this
protocol and ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly to
maintain the integrity of the results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any issues that may arise
during analysis.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Type:
• Blood samples (for TEA and IgE)
• Serum samples
Specimen Collection:
• Blood samples should be collected in EDTA tubes for TEA and in
serum separator tubes (SST) for IgE and other serum analyses.
• Collect a minimum of 5 mL of blood for each test.
• Ensure all specimens are properly labeled with patient
identification, date, and time of collection.
Specimen Storage:
• Blood samples for TEA should be analyzed within 24 hours and
should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Serum samples should be separated from the clot within 2 hours
of collection. The serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
For long-term storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated hematology analyzer (for TEA)
• Immunoassay analyzer (for IgE)
• Centrifuge (for serum sample preparation)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Refrigerators and freezers
Reagents:
• Specific reagents and controls for hematology and immunoassay
analyzers
Supplies:
• EDTA tubes, SST tubes
• Gloves, lab coats
• Sterile specimen containers
• Labels for identification
4. PROCEDURE
A) Total Eosinophil Count (TEA) Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure that EDTA blood samples are well mixed by gentle
inversion.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the sample onto the automated hematology analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate program for total eosinophil count.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality controls (IQC) before sample analysis
as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Accept or reject the results based on QC performance.
4. Reporting:
◦ Review and verify the results.
◦ Document any out-of-range values and follow up as per
laboratory policy.
B) Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow the serum to clot.
◦ Centrifuge the serum separator tube at 1500 x g for 10
minutes.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the serum samples onto the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate program for IgE determination.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Document and address any QC failures.
4. Reporting:
◦ Review and verify the results.
◦ Enter all results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
C) Serum Sample Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Follow the same preparation procedure as for IgE analysis.
2. Analysis:
◦ Perform specific tests as requested using appropriate
analyzers.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run appropriate controls for each test.
◦ Validate results according to the established quality control
guidelines.
4. Reporting:
◦ Validate and report results through LIS.
◦ Flag and document any critical values and notify relevant
healthcare providers as per laboratory policy.
5. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL
• Ensure all equipment maintenance and calibration are up to date.
• Follow the guidelines for internal and external quality control.
• Perform regular proficiency testing and maintain documentation.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results are outside the expected ranges, perform
troubleshooting steps as per instrument guidelines.
• Re-run samples if necessary and consult with a supervisor for
persistent issues.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for the hematology analyzer
and immunoassay analyzer.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance and Control Manuals.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all samples, results, quality control, and
maintenance logs as per laboratory policy.
• Ensure all documentation is accurate, complete, and readily
accessible for review.
By following these procedures, the laboratory will ensure the
accurate and reliable generation of results for Total Eosinophil Count,
Immunoglobulin E, and other serum sample analyses.
