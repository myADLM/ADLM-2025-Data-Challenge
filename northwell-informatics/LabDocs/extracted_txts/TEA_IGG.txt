TEA IgG Protocol (Analytical Phase)
1. PURPOSE
To provide the steps and guidelines for analyzing and generating TEA
IgG results in the laboratory, ensuring accuracy, precision, and
adherence to established standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to carry out
and document the analysis of TEA IgG, including any corrective
actions taken when necessary.
1. DEFINITION
TEA IgG is a test used to measure the presence and quantity of
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against TEA in a patient's sample.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen:
• Acceptable:
◦ Serum collected in a clot activator tube (e.g., SST - Serum
Separator Tube).
◦ Ideally, follow standard blood collection techniques to avoid
hemolysis and other pre-analytical errors.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
◦ Specimens without appropriate labeling or with collection/
requisition discrepancies.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA kit specific for TEA IgG quantification.
◦ Store according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Do not use past the expiry date.
• Micropipettes and tips.
◦ Calibrate micropipettes before use.
• Plate reader capable of reading at the manufacturer's specified
wavelength for the assay.
• Wash buffer, distilled water, laboratory-grade disposables (e.g.,
gloves, pipette tips).
1. ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow specimens to clot fully, then centrifuge to separate
serum.
◦ Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled tubes for testing
and storage.
3. ELISA Test Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the ELISA kit.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
beginning the assay.
◦ Dilute patient serum samples as required by the kit protocol.
4. Plate Setup:
◦ Add appropriate controls (positive, negative, and blank) and
samples to designated wells.
◦ Add diluted patient serum samples to designated wells.
◦ Follow the washing steps precisely to remove any unbound
components.
5. Incubation and Detection:
◦ Incubate plates as per kit protocol (typically at room
temperature for a specific time).
◦ Add enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate.
◦ Wash wells thoroughly after incubation periods.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate to allow the color to
develop.
◦ Stop the reaction with the stop solution provided.
6. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Read the absorbance value of each well at the
recommended wavelength using a plate reader.
◦ Ensure the plate reader is calibrated and functioning
correctly.
◦ Calculate the TEA IgG concentrations by interpolating the
absorbance values from the standard curve provided in the
kit.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Use manufacturer-provided calibrators and controls.
• Include quality control samples in each assay run to ensure
validity of test results.
Storage:
• Store controls and calibrators at 2-8°C (or as specified by
manufacturer) and use within the expiration date.
To Use:
• Follow the specific reconstitution and handling instructions
provided for the control materials.
• Allow the materials to equilibrate to room temperature before use.
Procedure:
• Document the quality control results in the logbook.
• If control results fall outside of the acceptable range, review and
troubleshoot the procedure before releasing any patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transcribe the quantitative results from the plate reader to the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
• Unusual findings and recommended actions should be
documented appropriately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Less than the established cut-off value (varies by kit).
• Positive: Equal to or greater than the established cut-off value.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific ELISA kit instructions for detailed information
on potential interferences, limitations, and troubleshooting.
