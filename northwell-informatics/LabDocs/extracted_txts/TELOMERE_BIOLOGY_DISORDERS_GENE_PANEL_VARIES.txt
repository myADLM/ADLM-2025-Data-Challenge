Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Telomere Biology
Disorders Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analysis and generation
of results for the Telomere Biology Disorders Gene Panel. This
includes the steps following specimen accessioning up to the
reporting of generated results. The aim is to ensure accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility in the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) to
follow the outlined procedures for the analysis.
• It is the responsibility of the Supervisors to ensure that all aspects
of the protocol are followed accurately.
2. DEFINITIONS
Telomere Biology Disorders Gene Panel: A genetic test analyzing
multiple genes associated with telomere biology disorders, typically
involving next-generation sequencing (NGS).
NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): A high-throughput
methodology that enables rapid sequencing of the base pairs in DNA
or RNA samples.
3. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Approved specimen types: Whole blood, buccal swabs,
saliva.
◦ Minimum DNA concentration: 20 ng/µl.
◦ Minimum purity: A260/A280 ratio between 1.8-2.0.
2. Extraction Protocol:
◦ Use a validated commercial DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Quantify DNA using a fluorometer and assess purity using a
spectrophotometer.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for library
preparation.
B) Library Preparation:
1. DNA Shearing:
◦ Shear genomic DNA to appropriate fragment sizes
(approximately 200-300 base pairs) using a sonicator.
2. End-Repair, A-Tailing and Adapter Ligation:
◦ Perform end-repair and A-tailing of sheared DNA fragments.
◦ Ligate barcoded sequencing adapters to the A-tailed DNA
fragments.
3. Library Amplification and Purification:
◦ Amplify adapter-ligated DNA with appropriate primers.
◦ Purify the library using magnetic beads following
manufacturer’s protocol.
C) Library Quality Control:
1. Quantification and Size Assessment:
◦ Use a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation to assess the size
distribution of the library.
◦ Quantify libraries using qPCR or fluorometry.
D) Sequencing:
1. Loading Libraries onto Sequencer:
◦ Pool libraries at equimolar concentrations.
◦ Load pooled libraries onto the NGS sequencer following
manufacturer's protocols.
◦ Initiate the sequencing run.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Base Calling and Alignment:
◦ Convert raw sequencing data (BCL files) to FASTQ files.
◦ Align sequences to the human reference genome (hg19 or
hg38) using a suitable aligner (e.g., BWA).
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Use a variant caller (e.g., GATK or DeepVariant) to identify
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions
(indels).
◦ Filter variants based on quality scores and read depth.
3. Annotation:
◦ Annotate variants using databases like dbSNP, ClinVar, and
HGMD.
◦ Determine the clinical significance of variants using
available guidelines.
F) Reviewing and Reporting Results:
1. Interpretation:
◦ Cross-reference variants with patient history and clinical
data.
◦ Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines.
2. Review Process:
◦ Independent review by at least two molecular geneticists or
certified MLS.
◦ Clinical validation as necessary.
3. Reporting:
◦ Compile a comprehensive report summarizing the findings.
◦ Include information on detected variants, their clinical
significance, and any relevant recommendations.
◦ The report should be reviewed and signed off by a certified
genomic pathologist or laboratory director.
G) Quality Control and Assurance:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Include internal controls at each stage (DNA extraction,
library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis).
2. External Quality Assessment:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs annually.
