Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for TEMAZEPAM (RESTORIL), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
measuring Temazepam (Restoril) levels in serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis as per the defined procedure and ensure accurate and
reliable results. It is also their responsibility to identify any deviations
or operational issues and report them to the supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube without
gel.
• Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum.
• Specimen Handling: After collection, let the blood clot at room
temperature for 30 minutes and then centrifuge for 15 minutes at
approximately 1000-1300 x g. Transfer serum to a plastic
transport tube and cap securely.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 3-5 days
◦ Frozen (≤-20°C): Long-term storage
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
or Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
• Calibrators and Quality Control materials
• Serum separating tubes and transport tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Chemical standards of temazepam and suitable internal standard
(e.g., diazepam or stable isotope-labeled temazepam)
• Laboratory centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibrate the instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and laboratory protocol.
• Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentration levels with every analytical batch to ensure assay
performance.
• Ensure quality control results are within acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Samples and Standards:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls from certified
reference materials according to laboratory guidelines.
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature if necessary. Mix
thoroughly by gently inverting the tubes several times.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Protein Precipitation/Extraction:
◦ Add 200 µL of serum to a clean test tube.
◦ Add 50 µL of internal standard solution (e.g., diazepam).
◦ Add 500 µL of cold acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
◦ Vortex for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 14000 x g for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer and Dilution:
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and evaporate under
nitrogen at 40°C.
◦ Reconstitute the residue with 200 µL of mobile phase or
appropriate solvent.
C) LC-MS/MS or GC-MS Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Prepare the instrument based on specific method
parameters detailed in laboratory protocols.
◦ Ensure columns and detection systems are properly
equilibrated and maintained.
2. Injection and Analysis:
◦ Inject the reconstituted sample, calibrators, and quality
controls into the LC-MS/MS or GC-MS system.
◦ Run the samples according to the established method
parameters.
3. Data Acquisition and Quantitation:
◦ Acquire data and process chromatograms using appropriate
software.
◦ Quantitate Temazepam concentration by comparing sample
peaks to the calibration curve.
◦ Verify internal standard performance to ensure analytical
integrity.
7. RESULTS REVIEW AND REPORTING
• Verify that all quality control results are within acceptable limits
before reporting patient results.
• Cross check any unexpected results with technical replicates or
repeat analyses if necessary.
• Document and review analytical data, ensuring any flags or errors
have been addressed, and add critical comments regarding
results as needed.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review by the supervising technologist.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The method is sensitive to matrix effects; ensure consistent
sample preparation techniques.
• Interpreter should be aware of potential interference from other
benzodiazepines or metabolites.
• Highlight any limitations in the result report if high variability or low
recovery is observed.
9. REFERENCES
• Analytical method guidelines for Temazepam (Restoril) by
relevant health authorities (e.g., CLIA, CAP).
• Instrument manufacturer’s manuals.
• Published peer-reviewed literature on LC-MS/MS and GC-MS
protocols for Temazepam analysis.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records of calibration, quality controls, sample
preparation, instrument performance, and results accordance with
laboratory policy.
• Ensure records are readily available for audits and reviews.
