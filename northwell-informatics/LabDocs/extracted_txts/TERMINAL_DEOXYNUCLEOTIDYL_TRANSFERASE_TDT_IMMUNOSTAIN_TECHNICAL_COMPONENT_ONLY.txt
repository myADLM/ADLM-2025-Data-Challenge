Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Terminal
Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the technical procedure necessary to perform Terminal
Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) immunostaining on histologic or
cytologic specimens in a laboratory setting. This SOP ensures
consistency, reliability, and accuracy in the preparation and staining
of specimens for subsequent immunohistochemical evaluation.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing TdT immunostaining for diagnostic purposes. The
technical component includes all steps from sample preparation to
the completion of immunostaining, excluding the interpretation of
results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory staff performing TdT immunostaining must adhere to
this SOP to ensure high-quality results. Supervisors are responsible
for training staff on this protocol and for ensuring compliance.
4. DEFINITIONS
TdT: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, a nuclear enzyme
commonly used as a marker in immunostaining for specific types of
leukemias and lymphomas. Immunostain: A staining technique used
to detect specific antigens in cells or tissue sections using antibodies.
5. SAFETY AND EQUIPMENT
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Lab coat, gloves, and safety
goggles must be worn at all times. Equipment:
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
• Microscope
• Humidity chamber
• Bench timer
Reagents and Supplies:
• TdT primary antibody (validated for diagnostic use)
• Secondary antibody conjugate
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
• Buffered formaldehyde (10%)
• Xylene
• Ethanol
• Distilled water
• Coverslips
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration (if using formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissues):
◦ Place slides in a xylene bath for 5 minutes (repeat twice).
◦ Sequentially rehydrate in 100%, 95%, 70% ethanol for 3
minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in a pre-warmed antigen retrieval solution
(citrate buffer, pH 6.0) within a microwave oven.
◦ Heat for 10-20 minutes (consult specific antibody datasheet
for optimal time).
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.2 Immunostaining Protocol
1. Endogenous Peroxidase Blocking (if required):
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply TdT primary antibody to each slide.
◦ Incubate slides in a humidity chamber at room temperature
for 60 minutes (or according to the antibody datasheet).
◦ Rinse slides with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) three times for 5 minutes each.
3. Secondary Antibody Conjugate:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody conjugate.
◦ Incubate slides in a humidity chamber at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with TBS or PBS three times for 5 minutes
each.
4. Detection:
◦ Apply chromogen solution (e.g., DAB) and incubate for the
recommended time (typically 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water extensively.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 3 minutes.
◦ Differentiate in acid alcohol if required, and rinse again in
tap water.
◦ Blue in ammonia water or in Scott’s tap water substitute for
30 seconds.
6. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Sequentially dehydrate slides in graded ethanol solutions
(70%, 95%, 100%) for 1 minute each.
◦ Clear slides in xylene for 2-3 minutes.
◦ Apply coverslip using a suitable mounting medium.
6.3 Quality Control
1. Controls:
◦ A positive control (e.g., known TdT-positive tissue) must be
included with each run.
◦ A negative control (primary antibody omitted) must also be
included with each batch.
2. Slide Review:
◦ Review stained slides microscopically to ensure proper
staining quality (clear nuclear staining for TdT without
excessive background).
◦ Document any deviations, artifacts, or quality issues and
take corrective actions.
6.4 Troubleshooting
• If expected staining is weak or absent, verify the antibody and
reagent quality and check for appropriate antigen retrieval
settings.
• If background staining is high, optimize blocking steps, antibody
dilutions, or washing times.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be documented according to the laboratory's
guidelines. Only qualified pathologists or trained experts should
interpret and report TdT immunostaining results.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
All records of TdT immunostaining procedures, including lot numbers
of reagents and dates of use, should be maintained. Ensure that all
QC logs and maintenance records are up-to-date.
9. REFERENCES
• TdT antibody datasheet and manufacturer's instructions.
• Relevant academic and clinical literature on TdT immunostaining.
• Laboratory safety guidelines and MSDS for chemicals used.
10. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as required to
maintain compliance with CLIA and other regulatory standards.
