TERT Promoter Mutation Analysis via Droplet Digital
PCR (ddPCR) – Tumor DNA
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the analytical phase of detecting TERT promoter
mutations (specifically C228T and C250T) in tumor DNA using
Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR). The procedure ensures reliable and
reproducible results vital for cancer diagnostics and therapeutic
decisions.
2. Responsibility
• Laboratory staff trained in ddPCR techniques will perform the
analysis.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure staff
members adhere to this SOP.
• The personnel performing the analysis are responsible for
properly handling clinical samples, ensuring the integrity and
quality of reagents, performing the assay, analyzing data, and
documenting results.
3. Specimen
• Specimen type: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor
tissue or fresh frozen tumor tissue.
• DNA extraction: Use a validated extraction kit appropriate for
FFPE or fresh frozen tissues to obtain high-quality DNA. Quantify
DNA using a fluorometric method (e.g., Qubit) and ensure a
concentration of at least 5 ng/µL with a total of 20 ng required per
assay.

Assay)
• ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP)
• DNAase/RNAase-free water
• Positive control DNA (harboring TERT promoter mutations)
• No Template Control (NTC, only DNAse/RNAse-free water)
• Droplet Generation Oil
Supplies:
• 96-well PCR plates
• Droplet generation cartridges
• Droplet reading plates
• Pipettes and pipette tips

5. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction and Quantification:
1. Extract DNA from tumor tissue using a validated kit.
2. Quantify DNA using a fluorometric method and adjust
concentration to the required levels.
B. Reaction Setup:
1. Prepare the master mix as follows:
◦ ddPCR Supermix for Probes: 10 µL
◦ TERT Assay (C228T or C250T): 1 µL
◦ DNA template (20 ng): up to 8 µL
◦ DNAse/RNAse-free water: to bring the final volume to 20 µL
2. Include positive control and NTC in each run.
C. Droplet Generation:
1. Load 20 µL of the reaction mix into the sample wells of the
droplet generation cartridge.
2. Add 70 µL of droplet generation oil to the oil wells.
3. Place the cartridge in the droplet generator to form droplets.
D. PCR Amplification:
1. Transfer droplets to a 96-well PCR plate.
2. Seal the plate with pierceable foil or heat seal.
3. Load the plate into the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 55°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 98°C for 10 minutes
E. Droplet Reading:
1. After PCR, load the plate into the droplet reader.
2. Read and analyze droplets using the ddPCR software to
determine the presence of TERT promoter mutations.
F. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze data using the droplet reader software.
2. Confirm mutation status (positive or negative) based on
fluorescence signals:
◦ Positive control: Expected positive fluorescence signals
◦ NTC: No fluorescence signal
◦ Patient samples: Compare the fluorescence signals to
control samples to determine mutation status.
3. Report the mutation status (C228T, C250T, or none) of each
sample.
6. Quality Control
• Use positive controls and NTC in every run to validate assays and
ensure there is no contamination.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment according to
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document and review QC results to identify any deviations or
trends.
7. Reporting Results
• Review and verify results and note any anomalies in the sample
or control results.
• Document results in the laboratory's information system (LIS).
• Ensure that critical results are confirmed and communicated to
the responsible clinician promptly.
8. References
• Manufacturer's instructions for the ddPCR system and reagents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on TERT promoter
mutation analysis.

equipment.
