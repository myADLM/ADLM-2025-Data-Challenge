Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Testing of
Total Testosterone
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Total Testosterone in
serum/plasma samples ensuring accurate and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained Medical Laboratory Scientist to
ensure that all procedures outlined in this SOP are followed.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any issues that arise during the procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Type: Serum or Li Heparin Plasma
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 3 months
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instrument (e.g., Immunoassay analyzer, LC-MS/MS)
• Testosterone Total Reagent Kit
• Control Materials (Low, Medium, High)
• Calibrators
• Micropipettes
• Sample tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Timer
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
2. Prepare the workspace by cleaning the workbench and
ensuring all equipment is properly calibrated and functioning.
B. Calibration
1. Conduct a full calibration of the analyzer using the testosterone
calibrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Document the calibration process in the instrument log
including the date, time, and initials of the performing
personnel.
C. Quality Control
1. Run control materials (low, medium, and high) to verify the
calibration before analyzing patient samples.
2. Document the results of the quality control in the QC log.
Ensure the results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
D. Sample Preparation
1. Allow all frozen samples to thaw at room temperature and mix
gently by inversion.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 3000-3500 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma.
3. Aliquot 0.5 mL of clear serum/plasma into labeled sample tubes
if necessary.
E. Analysis
1. Load the serum/plasma samples, calibrators, and controls onto
the analyzer.
2. Input the necessary information into the analyzer system:
sample ID, test name, etc.
3. Start the analysis by following the specific instrument
instructions.
4. Upon completion, review and document the results generated
by the instrument to ensure they meet the established criteria.
F. Results Interpretation and Reporting
1. Verify and validate results through the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Compare patient results against established reference ranges:
◦ Men: 240–950 ng/dL
◦ Women: 8–60 ng/dL
3. For results outside the reference ranges, consult with a
supervisor and consider the need for repeat testing or further
investigation.
4. Document any corrective actions taken.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
If quality control results are outside the acceptable range:
• Recheck calibration.
• Re-run the controls and retest patient samples.
• If the issue persists, consult the analyzer manual and supervisor
for troubleshooting steps.
7. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including proper disposal
of biohazardous waste.
• Handle all reagents and samples with care to avoid contamination
or exposure.
