Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Testosterone, Total and Bioavailable, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely analysis of total and bioavailable
testosterone in serum samples using the appropriate analytical
methods and adhering to quality control procedures.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis of testosterone, total and bioavailable, in serum
samples as defined in this procedure.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Testosterone assay kit (e.g., ELISA, LC-MS/MS)
• Reagents for the method of choice (e.g., buffer solutions,
enzymes, standards, and controls)
• Incubator (if required by the assay)
• Analyzer/instrument capable of measuring testosterone
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred Specimen: Serum separated from a blood sample
collected using an SST.
• Acceptable Volume: At least 1 mL of serum.
• Specimen Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 24
hours at room temperature, 7 days when refrigerated at 2-8°C,
and up to 6 months when frozen at -20°C or lower.
Specimen Unacceptable Conditions:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Lipaemic samples causing interference
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation
• Specimens in tubes other than SST
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Initial Processing:
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen integrity. Ensure it meets the
criteria outlined above.
2. Let the sample clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10-15 minutes to separate the
serum.
4. Aliquot the serum into a clean, appropriately labeled
microcentrifuge tube.
5. Store aliquot at the appropriate temperature until analysis.
B. Testing with ELISA:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the Testosterone ELISA
kit. Briefly: a. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room
temperature before starting the assay. b. Prepare standards,
controls, and samples as per the kit instructions. c. Add the
appropriate volume of each standard, control, and sample to
the designated wells. d. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well
and incubate at a specified temperature and duration. e. Wash
wells thoroughly as per instructions. f. Add substrate solution
and incubate for the required time. g. Add stop solution and
measure absorbance at the wavelength specified by the
manufacturer (commonly 450 nm).
C. Testing with LC-MS/MS:
1. Follow laboratory SOP for LC-MS/MS sample preparation. a.
Extract serum by precipitation or appropriate extraction method.
b. Dilute and prepare calibration standards in the same matrix
as patient samples. c. Run samples on LC-MS/MS based on
validated method parameters. d. Analyze the chromatograms to
quantify total and bioavailable testosterone.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) procedures at every run.
• Use commercially available control materials of known values.
Run controls similarly as patient samples.
• Always include both low- and high-level controls in each batch.
• Document and evaluate QC results according to laboratory
guidelines. If QC results are not within acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot the assay and rerun samples as necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and validated by the technologist.
• Report total and bioavailable testosterone concentration
according to laboratory-specific reporting guidelines.
• Critical values must be communicated immediately to the
requesting healthcare provider following proper documentation
procedures.
8. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for the ELISA kit or specific LC-
MS/MS method validation documents for detailed instructions.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines and procedure manuals.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric samples may interfere with
results.
• Ensure no cross-contamination during sample preparation and
processing.
• Results must be interpreted in the context of patient’s clinical and
other laboratory findings.
