Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TESTOSTERONE, TOTAL AND FREE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standardized procedure for the analysis of total
and free testosterone in serum samples. The aim is to ensure
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of the results, adhering to CLIA
standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to follow this SOP
for the analytical phase of total and free testosterone testing. The
Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any deviations or issues.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens not labeled properly
• Specimens not stored or transported as per guidelines
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 6 months
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411)
• Testosterone reagent kits
• Controls: high, normal, low
• Calibration material
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample cups
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Specimen Handling: - Verify patient identification and properly
label the specimen. - Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes to obtain clear serum. - Store specimens at the
appropriate temperature until analysis.
2. Reagent Preparation: - Reagents should be prepared
according to manufacturer instructions provided in the kit insert.
- Calibrate the analyzer as per the calibration schedule or
whenever new reagent lots are introduced.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Loading the Analyzer: - Turn on the automated immunoassay
analyzer and allow it to perform self-checks. - Load calibration
material, controls, and patient samples into designated
positions on the analyzer. - Program the analyzer for
testosterone testing, ensuring both total and free testosterone
assays are selected.
2. Running the Assay: - Follow manufacturer-specific
instructions for the assay protocol. - Begin the testing process
and monitor the first few samples to ensure the analyzer is
operating correctly.
3. Quality Control: - Run quality control materials (high, normal,
low) at the beginning of each run, after reagent changes, or as
required by laboratory protocol. - Record QC results and ensure
they are within acceptable ranges before reporting patient
results. - If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat
the QC testing before patient samples are tested.
C. Post-Analytical Procedure
1. Result Verification: - Review all patient results for consistency
and accuracy. - Compare results with quality control data and
reference ranges. - Validate results through the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Result Reporting: - Report results in the LIS. - For critical or
abnormal values, follow the lab’s protocol for result verification
and communication to the ordering physician.
3. Clean-up and Maintenance: - Dispose of used test materials
according to biohazard and laboratory safety protocols. -
Perform routine maintenance on the analyzer as required.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Total Testosterone:
• Adult Males: 270-1070 ng/dL
• Adult Females: 15-70 ng/dL
Free Testosterone:
• Adult Males: 50-210 pg/mL
• Adult Females: 0.3-1.9 pg/mL
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal quality control material should be analyzed daily.
• Records of QC results should be maintained and reviewed
regularly.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with assay accuracy.
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the analyzer for
reliable results.
