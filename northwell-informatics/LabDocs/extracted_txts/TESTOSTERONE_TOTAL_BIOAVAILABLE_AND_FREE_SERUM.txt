Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for TESTOSTERONE,
TOTAL, BIOAVAILABLE, AND FREE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required for the accurate
measurement of total, bioavailable, and free testosterone levels in
serum. It ensures reliable and reproducible test results for clinical
diagnosis and patient management.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of serum testosterone levels using standardized analytical
methodologies.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated Clinical Laboratory Scientists (CLS) and laboratory
personnel are responsible for performing the analysis, maintaining
equipment, and ensuring all quality control (QC) measures are met.
All staff must adhere to this SOP to ensure accurate and precise
results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Total Testosterone: The total amount of testosterone in the
serum, including both bound and free fractions.
• Bioavailable Testosterone: The fraction of testosterone that is
not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and is
bioavailable for tissues.
• Free Testosterone: The fraction of testosterone that is not bound
to any proteins and is available for biological activity.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection. Store at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours or freeze at
-20°C for up to 6 months.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Testosterone assay kit (e.g., ELISA or Chemiluminescence
Immunoassay)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator/shaker
• Calibrators and controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. REAGENTS AND CALIBRATORS
• Testosterone standards and calibrators
• Control materials (low, medium, and high)
• Sample diluent
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution (if applicable)
8. PROCEDURE
A) PRE-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure all specimens are properly labeled.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
◦ Transfer serum into labeled aliquot tubes if not analyzed
immediately. Store appropriately.
B) ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Quality Control:
◦ Run controls (low, medium, high) before each batch of
patient samples.
◦ Verify that control results fall within the established ranges
before proceeding.
2. Assay Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, specimens, and controls to reach room
temperature.
◦ Thoroughly mix all reagents before use.
◦ Set up the assay according to the kit manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Performance of the Assay:
◦ Label appropriate number of wells/strips for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Pipette standard, control, and patient serum samples into
respective wells.
◦ Add the assay reagent to each well as per the kit
instructions.
◦ Mix the plate on a plate shaker to ensure even distribution.
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time at the required
temperature.
◦ Wash the wells with wash buffer several times to remove
unbound reagents.
◦ Add the detection reagent or substrate solution and incubate
for the specified time in the dark.
◦ Add stop solution (if applicable) to terminate the reaction.
4. Reading the Results:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
using a microplate reader.
◦ Calculate the concentration of testosterone using the
standard curve generated from calibrators.
◦ Analyze data and ensure results meet QC criteria.
C) POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Review results and QC metrics. Repeat assay if control
results are out of range.
◦ Verify and document all patient results.
◦ Report results according to the laboratory's reporting
guidelines.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Total Testosterone: Report in ng/dL or nmol/L.
◦ Bioavailable Testosterone: Report in ng/dL or nmol/L.
◦ Free Testosterone: Report in pg/mL or pmol/L.
3. Sample Retention:
◦ Retain tested serum samples at 2-8°C for at least 7 days
post-analysis for any required retesting.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Run three levels of control material with each assay.
• Perform calibrator verification before each assay.
• Document all QC activities and corrective actions in the QC log.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect results.
• Improper storage or handling may degrade the sample and affect
testosterone levels.
