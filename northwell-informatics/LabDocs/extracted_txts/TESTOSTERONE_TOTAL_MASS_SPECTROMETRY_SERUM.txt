1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide standardized
procedures for the analysis of total testosterone in serum by
mass spectrometry. This protocol ensures accurate, consistent,
and reliable results that adhere to laboratory guidelines and
regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow
these procedures accurately and to document all relevant
information. Any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure must be reported to the supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a standard red-top or serum separator
tube (SST).
Stability:
◦ Serum should be separated from the cells as soon as
possible.
◦ Specimens can be stored at room temperature for up to 8
hours; refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 7 days; or frozen (at or
below -20°C) for extended storage.
Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens.
◦ Specimens stored at improper temperatures or beyond the
stability limits.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Mobile phase reagents
◦ Testosterone standard and quality control materials
◦ Calibrators and internal standards
◦ Sample vials and caps
◦ Syringes and filters for sample preparation
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum specimen to come to room temperature if
refrigerated or frozen.
2. Mix the specimen thoroughly by gently inverting the tube
several times.
3. Transfer a defined volume of the serum specimen to a
sample vial.
4. Add the internal standard to the sample vial.
5. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds to ensure proper
mixing.
6. Centrifuge the sample vial at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
7. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean sample vial for
mass spectrometric analysis.
B) Analytical Procedure:
1. Start the mass spectrometry system and ensure that it is
calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Prepare the mobile phase and flush the LC system.
3. Load the calibrators, quality control samples, and
prepared specimens into the sample tray.
4. Run the mass spectrometry analysis according to the
method optimized for testosterone detection, ensuring
proper separation and identification of the peaks.
5. Monitor the internal standard peak to ensure consistency
and accuracy of the analysis.
6. Allow sufficient time for the analysis of each sample,
maintaining proper system monitoring during the run.
C) Calculations and Result Interpretation:
1. Utilize the instrument software to generate a calibration
curve using the calibrator samples.
2. Calculate the concentration of total testosterone in each
patient sample by comparing the peak area ratio of
testosterone to that of the internal standard, referencing
the calibration curve.
3. Ensure that all quality control samples fall within the
acceptable range.
4. Review the chromatograms for any sample anomalies or
interferences.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) at
the beginning, throughout, and at the end of each batch of
specimens.
2. Ensure that quality control results are within the
acceptable limits.
3. Document any deviations from acceptable quality control
ranges and take corrective actions as necessary.
4. Perform routine instrument maintenance and calibration
checks as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results will be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Report total testosterone results in ng/dL or nmol/L, as
stipulated by laboratory procedures.
3. Document any notes or comments related to sample
integrity or analysis.
4. Adhere to site-specific reporting guidelines for result entry
into the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Male (general guidelines, may vary by age):
◦ 300–1000 ng/dL (10.4–34.7 nmol/L)
Female (general guidelines, may vary by age):
◦ 15–70 ng/dL (0.5–2.4 nmol/L)
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in specimens may interfere
with accurate testosterone measurement.
2. Refer to the mass spectrometry instrument user manual
and associated method protocol for specific limitations
regarding the detection and quantification of testosterone.
