1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed and standardized procedures for performing the
Tetanus Toxoid IgG Antibody, Serum assay in a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the assay, ensuring quality control, and reporting the
results. Supervisors must ensure adherence to the procedure and
address any deviations or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a SST (serum separator tube) or red-top tube.
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
• Specimen should be free from hemolysis and lipemia.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens that do not meet the minimum volume requirement.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Reagent kit for Tetanus Toxoid IgG Antibody ELISA
1. REAGENTS
• Tetanus Toxoid IgG Antibody ELISA kit (including standards,
controls, wash buffer, conjugate, substrate, and stop solution)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Controls: Negative control, low positive control, and high positive
control must be run with each batch of patient samples.
• Perform quality control testing with each assay run to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the results.
• Document all control results and take corrective actions if controls
are out of the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
sample analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum samples, standards, and controls to reach
room temperature.
2. Label the microplate wells according to the assay layout:
standards, controls, and samples in duplicate.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to the
respective wells.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Aspirate the contents of each well and wash the plate 5 times
with wash buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Aspirate the contents of each well and wash the plate 5 times
with wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15 minutes in the
dark.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
C. Reading the Plate:
1. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an ELISA
plate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
2. Record the optical density (OD) values.
3. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
4. Plot the standard curve by graphing the OD values of the
standards versus their concentrations.
5. Calculate the concentration of Tetanus Toxoid IgG antibody in
patient samples using the standard curve.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Interval: Refer to the assay kit insert for the reference
range for Tetanus Toxoid IgG concentrations.
• Results Interpretation:
◦ < 0.1 IU/mL: Non-immune
◦ 0.1 - 0.5 IU/mL: Low immunity
◦ ≥ 0.5 IU/mL: Immune
• Document and verify the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). Ensure that results are properly reviewed and
validated by a technologist before release.
1. SAMPLE RETENTION
• Retain serum samples for 7 days post-analysis in the event
reanalysis or further testing is required.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all assay runs, quality control results,
standard curves, and patient results in accordance with laboratory
regulatory requirements for a minimum of 2 years.
