Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4) and Neopterin (N) Profile Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and
Neopterin (N) profile in patient specimens. This ensures that results
are accurate, reproducible, and reliable, contributing to effective
patient diagnosis and treatment monitoring.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to adhere strictly
to this SOP to ensure the reliability of BH4 and Neopterin profiles. It
is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure compliance with this
procedure and to address any issues that may arise during the
analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type:
▪ Preferred: 2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma,
collected in a heparinized tube.
▪ Acceptable: 2 mL of urine collected in a sterile container.
◦ Specimen Handling:
▪ After collection, specimens should be kept on ice and
delivered to the laboratory immediately.
▪ If there is a delay in processing, the specimens should
be stored at -20°C for up to 72 hours.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or exhibiting signs of
contamination.
▪ Specimens not kept cold or left at room temperature for
extended periods before processing.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
system with fluorescence detector.
▪ Centrifuge (capable of 4°C to -20°C).
▪ -20°C freezer.
▪ Vortex mixer.
◦ Reagents:
▪ HPLC-grade water and acetonitrile.
▪ Potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.5).
▪ BH4 and neopterin standard solutions.
▪ Internal standard solution (e.g., pterin-6-carboxylic acid).
◦ Supplies:
▪ Heparinized tubes for specimen collection.
▪ Sterile urine collection containers.
▪ HPLC columns specific for pterin analysis.
▪ Sample vials.
3. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
4. CSF and Plasma Samples: - Centrifuge samples at 2000 x g
for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma and remove any
particulate matter. - Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial. - If
analysis cannot occur immediately, store at -20°C.
5. Urine Samples: - Centrifuge urine samples at 2000 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C. - Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial. - If
analysis cannot occur immediately, store at -20°C.
B) HPLC Analysis:
6. Mobile Phase Preparation: - Prepare mobile phase as a
mixture of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) and acetonitrile
(90:10 v/v).
7. Column Equilibration: - Equilibrate the HPLC column with the
mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for 30 minutes.
8. Sample Injection: - Add 100 µL of the sample to an HPLC vial.
- Add 10 µL of the internal standard solution to the vial and mix
by vortexing. - Inject 20-50 µL of the prepared mixture into the
HPLC system.
9. HPLC Run Conditions: - Set the temperature of the column
oven to 25°C. - Set the detection wavelength to 360 nm
(excitation) and 450 nm (emission) for the fluorescence
detector. - Inject the sample and run the analysis under the
programmed gradient conditions specific for pterin analysis.
C) Data Analysis:
10. Integration and Calibration: - Integrate the peaks
corresponding to BH4 and neopterin. - Use the internal
standard to normalize the retention times and peak areas. -
Compare the sample’s peak areas to the standard calibration
curve to quantify BH4 and neopterin levels.
11. Quality Control: - Analyze quality control samples alongside
patient specimens to ensure accuracy and precision. -
Acceptable control limits should be established based on
historical data.
12. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Quantified results should be reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
◦ Any critical results or significant deviations from expected
values should be immediately brought to the supervisor’s
attention.
◦ Results should be reported with appropriate reference
intervals and any necessary interpretative comments.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals can vary depending on the source and
should be established based on method validation. Typical
ranges may fall into:
▪ BH4: 1-5 nmol/L
▪ Neopterin: 5-50 nmol/L
14. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure samples are cold during collection and processing to
prevent degradation of BH4.
◦ Cross-reactivity of other pterins should be checked and
addressed during method validation.
◦ Refer to the HPLC manufacturer’s guidelines and product
inserts for additional details on reagent and instrument
limitations.
15. REFERENCES
◦ Include references to relevant method validation studies,
instrument manuals, and reagent package inserts used in
the procedure.
By following this SOP, laboratory technologists can ensure high
accuracy and reliability in the analysis of Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
and Neopterin (N) profiles in patient specimens.
