Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): TGFBR3 (1P22), OGA
(10Q24) Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE:
To detail the procedure for detecting TGFBR3 (1P22) and OGA
(10Q24) rearrangements using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) in tissue samples.
2. SCOPE:
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel trained in FISH
techniques and applies to tissue specimens collected for the
detection of TGFBR3 and OGA gene rearrangements.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
FISH procedure, documenting results, and alerting the supervisor in
the event of any discrepancies or QC failures. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing and ensuring the quality and accuracy of
the test results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
4.1. TYPE:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
4.2. SPECIMEN STORAGE:
• Store at room temperature until analysis.
4.3. UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS:
• Specimens that are not fixed in formalin.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled.
• Specimens that appear macerated or severely necrotic.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
5.1. REAGENTS:
• Hybridization buffer
• Wash buffer (stringency buffer)
• Fluorescently-labeled TGFBR3 (1P22) probe
• Fluorescently-labeled OGA (10Q24) probe
• DAPI or other nuclear counterstains
5.2. SUPPLIES:
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol
• Distilled water
• Pretreatment kit (if required, for certain tissue types)
• Humidified hybridization chamber
• Coverslips
6. EQUIPMENT:
6.1. Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters
6.2. Incubator
6.3. Water bath
6.4. Microtome
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1. PREPARATION:
1. Deparaffinize 4-5 µm FFPE tissue sections by immersing in xylene for 10 minutes.
2. Rehydrate tissues through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 90%, 70%) and distilled water, 5 minutes each.
3. Apply pretreatment solution as required by the kit's instructions to permeabilize the tissue sections.
4. Rinse slides with distilled water.
7.2. PROTEIN DIGESTION (if required by tissue type):
1. Immerse slides in a protease solution (e.g., proteinase K) for 10-30 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS followed by distilled water to remove protease.
7.3. DENATURATION AND HYBRIDIZATION:
1. Place slides in a denaturation solution (70% formamide, 2X SSC) at 72°C for 5 minutes.
2. Dehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) for 1 minute each.
3. Apply 10 µL of the hybridization mixture containing fluorescent probes specific for TGFBR3 (1P22) and OGA (10Q24) to each tissue section.
4. Cover the tissue with coverslips and place slides in a humidified hybridization chamber.
5. Overnight hybridization at 37°C in the dark.
7.4. POST-HYBRIDIZATION WASH:
1. Remove coverslips and immerse slides in 2X SSC at RT to remove excess probe.
2. Wash slides in 0.4X SSC at 72°C for 2 minutes.
3. Rinse in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1 minute.
7.5. COUNTERSTAINING:
1. Apply DAPI or appropriate nuclear counterstain to the tissue sections.
2. Cover with coverslips and allow to dry in the dark.
8. ANALYSIS:
8.1. Examine stained slides under a fluorescence microscope using proper filter sets for each fluorescent probe.
8.2. Capture images and record the number of signals for TGFBR3 (1P22) and OGA (10Q24).
8.3. A minimum of 200 interphase nuclei should be counted per sample.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
9.1. The hybridization efficiency should be verified using a known positive and negative control.
9.2. Internal quality control results must meet the predefined standards for the batch to be accepted.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
10.1. Document the findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
10.2. Include information about signal pattern and number in the final report.
10.3. Critical results should be promptly communicated to the referring physician.
11. LIMITATIONS:
11.1. FISH results are dependent on tissue quality and fixation.
11.2. High levels of tissue autofluorescence can interfere with signal interpretation.
11.3. Results must be correlated with clinical and other laboratory findings.
12. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's probe insert and hybridization kit instructions.
• Standard texts and protocols in cytogenetic laboratory techniques.
13. REVIEW AND RECORD MAINTENANCE:
13.1. Review this SOP annually or as necessary.
13.2. Document revisions and staff retrainings.
This SOP outlines the standardized procedure for conducting FISH
analysis of TGFBR3 (1P22) and OGA (10Q24) rearrangements in
tissue samples and ensures consistency and reliability in test results.
