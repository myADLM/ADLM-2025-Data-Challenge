Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title Thalassemia and
Hemoglobinopathy Evaluation: Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the necessary
steps and procedures involved in the analytical phase of
generating results for thalassemia and hemoglobinopathy
evaluation using blood and serum samples.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the clinical laboratory scientists/
technologists to perform the procedure as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for providing training and ensuring
compliance with the SOPs.
1. DEFINITION Thalassemia and hemoglobinopathy evaluations
involve a series of laboratory tests designed to identify and
characterize abnormal forms of hemoglobin produced in various
genetic conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Blood:
• Specimen Type: Whole blood
• Volume: Minimum of 3 mL
• Collection Container: EDTA (lavender top) tubes
• Stability: Must be analyzed within 48 hours of collection if kept at
room temperature. For prolonged storage, whole blood should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to one week.
Serum:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL
• Collection Container: Serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top
tube
• Processing: Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes, then centrifuge
at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.
• Stability: Refrigerated serum at 2-8°C is stable for up to 5 days.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Hemoglobin Analysis: Objective: To separate and identify
hemoglobins present in the blood sample.
1. Prepare Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Ensure hemoglobin electrophoresis equipment is fully
operational.
◦ Calibrate equipment per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare buffers and staining reagents according to the
reagent specifications.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the EDTA whole blood sample by gentle inversion.
◦ Lyse red blood cells with hemolysate preparation buffer as
directed.
3. Electrophoresis Procedure:
◦ Load hemolysate into the appropriate gel slots.
◦ Run the electrophoresis according to the protocol defined by
the test kit manufacturer.
◦ Apply a staining protocol to visualize hemoglobin bands.
4. Interpretation:
◦ Compare migration patterns with known controls.
◦ Document the types of hemoglobins present (e.g., HbA,
HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC).
◦ Capture and record images of the gels.
B. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): Objective:
To quantify different hemoglobin fractions including HbA2 and HbF.
1. Equipment Preparation:
◦ Initialize the HPLC system following manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Ensure all reagents and columns are within expiry and
perform system suitability checks.
2. Sample Injection:
◦ Dilute the hemolysate as required.
◦ Run the sample through the HPLC.
◦ Use the appropriate software for peak identification and
quantification.
3. Analysis and Data Recording:
◦ Identify and integrate peaks corresponding to different
hemoglobin fractions.
◦ Calculate percentages of hemoglobin fractions.
C. Serum Ferritin and Iron Studies: Objective: To evaluate serum
iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin levels.
1. Specimen Processing:
◦ Centrifuge serum upon arrival if not already done.
◦ Aliquot serum for iron, TIBC, and ferritin assays.
2. Iron and TIBC Analysis:
◦ Use colorimetric or automated methods to quantify serum
iron and TIBC.
◦ Calculate serum transferrin saturation (%).
3. Ferritin Assay:
◦ Employ immunoassay methodologies to determine ferritin
concentrations.
◦ Compare values against reference ranges.
4. Documentation and Interpretation:
◦ Record results in the LIS.
◦ Analyze results in the context of clinical presentation for
thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls and calibrators according to the daily QC program
for each instrument.
• Document all QC activities and review for shifts, trends, and
outliers.
• Any failed QC must be investigated, corrected, and reanalyzed
before releasing patient results.
Analyte-Specific QC Measures:
• Hemoglobin Electrophoresis: Use known normal and abnormal
hemoglobin controls.
• HPLC: Analyze standard calibration mixture.
• Serum Ferritin and Iron Studies: Use multi-level controls.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified clinical
laboratory scientist.
• Critical values and abnormal findings must be reported
immediately to the ordering physician as per laboratory protocol.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• HbA: 95-98%
• HbA2: 1.5-3.5%
• HbF: <2%
• Serum Ferritin: Gender and age-specific ranges
• Serum Iron: 60-170 µg/dL
• TIBC: 240-450 µg/dL
• Transferrin Saturation: 20-50%
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemoglobin variants co-migrating in electrophoresis may not be
distinguishable without further testing.
• Interference due to abnormal hemoglobin levels or post-
transfusion status.
• Serum-based iron status indicators may be influenced by
inflammatory conditions.
