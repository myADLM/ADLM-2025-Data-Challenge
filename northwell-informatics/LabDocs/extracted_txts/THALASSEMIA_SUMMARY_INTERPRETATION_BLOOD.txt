Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Thalassemia Summary
Interpretation, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the accurate analysis and
interpretation of thalassemia screening results from blood samples.
The procedure aims to ensure high-quality and reliable results that
can be used for diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
analyzing, interpreting, and reporting thalassemia summary results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP. The designated supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance and addressing any procedural issues that may arise.
4. DEFINITIONS
Thalassemia: A genetic blood disorder characterized by the
production of abnormal hemoglobin.
Complete Blood Count (CBC): A test used to evaluate overall health
and detect a variety of disorders, including anemia, infection, and
many other diseases.
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): A technique used
to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture.
Molecular Diagnostic Techniques: Methods used to analyze biological
markers in the genome and proteome.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Whole blood Volume: 3-5 mL Collection Container:
EDTA (purple top) tube Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
6. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• HPLC machine
• Automated CBC analyzer
• Molecular diagnostic equipment (if applicable)
• Reagents and controls for HPLC and CBC
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• EDTA (purple top) tubes
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials should be analyzed daily for both the CBC
and HPLC procedures to ensure accurate and reliable patient results.
Control Materials:
• CBC controls (normal and abnormal levels)
• Hemoglobin variant controls
Procedure:
• Run control samples at the beginning of the day and after any
major maintenance or recalibration of equipment.
• Document all QC results and take corrective action if results fall
outside the established acceptable range.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Complete Blood Count (CBC):
1. Load the EDTA blood sample into the automated CBC analyzer.
2. Perform the CBC test following the analyzer's SOP and
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify that the hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume
(MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and red cell
distribution width (RDW) are within acceptable ranges for the
patient's demographic.
4. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
B. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC):
1. Prepare the HPLC machine by running the startup and
calibration procedures as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load the EDTA blood sample into the HPLC machine.
3. Perform the hemoglobin variant analysis following the
machine's SOP.
4. Compare the chromatogram with known standards to identify
and quantify hemoglobin variants (e.g., HbA, HbF, HbA2, HbS,
HbC).
5. Document and interpret the results in the LIS.
C. Molecular Diagnostic Techniques (if required):
1. Extract DNA from the EDTA blood sample using a suitable DNA
extraction kit.
2. Amplify and sequence relevant genes associated with
thalassemia (e.g., HBB and HBA genes) following established
protocols.
3. Analyze the genetic sequences to identify mutations that
correspond to thalassemia.
4. Document findings in the LIS.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Combine data from the CBC, HPLC, and molecular diagnostic
tests.
2. Interpret the results in the context of the patient's clinical history
and any relevant genetic information.
3. Prepare a summary report that includes:
◦ CBC findings
◦ Hemoglobin variant analysis
◦ Molecular findings (if applicable)
◦ Interpretation of results indicating possible thalassemia
genotypes (e.g., beta-thalassemia, alpha-thalassemia).
4. Include recommendations for further testing or genetic
counseling if required.
5. Review and verify the report with a pathologist or designated
supervisor before releasing the final report to the healthcare
provider.
