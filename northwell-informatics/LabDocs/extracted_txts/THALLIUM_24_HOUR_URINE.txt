Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating
Results for Thallium, 24-Hour Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides the procedure for the analysis of thallium in a 24-
hour urine sample, ensuring accurate and reliable results which
support diagnosis and monitoring of thallium exposure.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow this SOP
accurately to ensure specimen integrity, proper instrument function,
and correct data reporting. Staff are expected to identify and report
any issues to the supervisor.
2. SCOPE AND APPLICATION
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory assays used for
determining thallium concentration in 24-hour urine samples.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• A 24-hour urine sample collected in a clean, acid-washed
container.
• No preservatives are used.
• Collection is to follow proper urine collection instructions to avoid
contamination.
Specimen Storage:
• Store the urine sample at 2-8°C during the collection period.
• After completion of collection, mix and aliquot into plastic tubes
within 6 hours.
• Aliquots may be frozen at -20°C until analysis if delay is
unavoidable.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected for more than 24 hours.
• Improperly labeled or unlabeled specimens.
• Contaminated or insufficient volume specimens.
• Specimens left at room temperature for more than 6 hours after
collection.
4. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (if needed)
• Pipettes and micropipettes
• Liquid Nitrogen (if required)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Reagents:
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Deionized water
• Thallium Standards
• Quality control materials
• Calibration blank (2% nitric acid)
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Calibrating ICP-MS:
◦ Daily calibration of the ICP-MS is required using certified
thallium standards.
◦ Prepare at least five calibration standards covering the
expected range of thallium concentrations in urine.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run Low, Medium, and High Concentration quality control
samples at the beginning and end of each batch.
◦ Ensure results fall within the established limits before
proceeding with sample analysis.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thoroughly mix the 24-hour urine sample.
◦ Aliquot 1.0-2.0 mL of urine into a clean, acid-washed plastic
tube.
◦ If necessary, dilute the sample with deionized water to
ensure the analysis falls within the calibrated range.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ In ICP-MS, set up the prepared samples, calibration
standards, and quality control samples.
◦ Follow the instrument software’s instructions for setting up
the run sequence.
◦ Ensure results display accurate concentration units (e.g.,
µg/L).
5. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the total amount of thallium excreted over 24
hours using urine total concentration and total volume
collected:
Total Thallium (µg/24hr) = [Thallium concentration (µg/L) x Total Volume (L)]
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verification:
◦ Review results ensuring each falls within calibration curves.
◦ Verify QC sample results. Invalid QC results necessitate
repeating sample analysis and possibly recalibrating
instruments.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all pertinent information, including sample IDs,
collection dates and times, analysis dates and times,
calibrations, QC results, and observations.
◦ Ensure differences between duplicate preparations are
minimal. If excessive, investigate and re-analyze.
3. Integration to LIS:
◦ Manually or automatically enter verified results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS), ensuring accuracy and
consistency.
◦ Include comments for any abnormal results or complications
during procedure.
4. Critical Values:
◦ Report critical results immediately to the referring physician,
per the laboratory's protocol for critical result reporting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform routine maintenances and regular instrument validation.
• Ensure staff competency through periodic training and proficiency
testing.

and thallium analysis.
NOTE: Procedural deviations must be documented and reported to
the laboratory supervisor. Always adhere to safety protocols and use
PPE when handling biological specimens.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accuracy in
the analysis of thallium in urine specimens, providing reliable results
for clinical diagnosis and monitoring.
