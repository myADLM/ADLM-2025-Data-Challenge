Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thallium in Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the accurate and precise analysis
of thallium in blood samples to ensure reliable and reproducible test
results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform the
analysis of thallium in blood samples using the Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) method.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to adhere strictly
to this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and for providing appropriate training to laboratory staff.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Whole blood collected in certified trace element-free tubes
(royal blue-top EDTA tube).
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Blood collected in tubes with any additives that may
interfere with ICP-MS analysis.
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Clotted samples.
◦ Samples not stored under specified conditions.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
◦ Certified trace element-free tubes (royal blue-top EDTA
tube)
◦ Calibrators and quality control materials specific for thallium
analysis
◦ Trace metal grade acids (Nitric Acid, Hydrochloric Acid)
◦ Ultrapure water
◦ Laboratory paraphernalia (pipettes, volumetric flasks,
sample vials, etc.)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation i. Identify and prepare the blood sample,
ensuring proper labeling. ii. Mix the whole blood sample thoroughly
by gently inverting the tube. iii. Aliquot 0.5 mL of the whole blood
sample into a clean, trace element-free sample vial. iv. Add 1.5 mL of
trace metal grade nitric acid to the sample vial. v. Cap the sample vial
and vortex or shake gently to ensure complete mixing. vi. Digest the
sample at 90 °C for 2 hours or until the solution is clear, indicating
complete digestion. vii. Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
viii. Dilute the digested sample to a final volume of 10 mL with
ultrapure water.
B. Instrument Calibration i. Prepare a series of at least five calibration
standards covering the expected range of thallium concentrations. ii.
Run the calibration standards on ICP-MS to generate the calibration
curve. iii. Ensure that the calibration curve has a correlation
coefficient (R2) of at least 0.995.
C. Sample Analysis i. Set up the ICP-MS according to the
manufacturer's instructions and laboratory guidelines. ii. Run blank
samples to ensure no contamination. iii. Introduce the prepared
sample solution into the ICP-MS. iv. Record the readings for thallium
concentration. v. Analyze quality control samples concurrently to
verify the accuracy and precision of the measurements.
D. Data Handling i. Calculate the final concentration of thallium in the
blood sample using the calibration curve. ii. Review the results and
ensure they fall within the acceptable ranges. iii. Document all
results, ensuring proper logging in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Perform quality control checks at the beginning of each
analytical run. B. Ensure the quality control samples fall within
the established control limits. C. Investigate and resolve any
quality control failures before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Review and approve all results. B. Record the results
accurately in the LIS. C. Notify the relevant healthcare provider
of any critical values immediately.
Reference Intervals:
◦ Thallium, Blood: Typically less than 2 ng/mL (refer to site-
specific reference intervals).
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
A. The presence of high concentrations of other metals may
interfere with the detection of thallium. B. Ensure proper sample
collection and handling to avoid contamination that may affect
the accuracy of results.
4. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
A. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses. B. Follow all
safety guidelines for handling chemicals and bloodborne
pathogens. C. Dispose of all reagents and samples in
accordance with laboratory safety protocols.
