Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for THALLIUM/CREATININE RATIO, RANDOM,
URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and precise
measurement of Thallium and Creatinine in random urine samples
and calculation of the Thallium/Creatinine ratio.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff is responsible for
performing the analysis as outlined in this SOP and ensuring quality
control measures are followed.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of random urine samples for
the determination of Thallium/Creatinine ratio in the clinical laboratory
setting.
1. DEFINITIONS
Thallium (Tl): A heavy metal potentially harmful even at low
concentrations. Creatinine (Cr): A breakdown product of creatine
phosphate in muscle, usually produced at a fairly constant rate.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) for Thallium determination
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer for Creatinine determination
• Urine centrifuge
• Disposable pipettes
• Calibrated volumetric flasks
• Certified reference materials for Thallium and Creatinine
• Analytical grade reagents and solvents
• Thallium standard solutions
• Creatinine assay reagent kits
• Control samples with known Thallium and Creatinine
concentrations
• Quality control materials
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND REJECTION CRITERIA
Preferred/acceptable:
• Random urine sample collected in a sterile container
• Minimum volume: 10 mL
Unacceptable:
• Sample volume less than 10 mL
• Samples contaminated with blood or other foreign materials
• Samples not properly labeled with patient identification and
collection time/date
• Samples arriving more than 24 hours after collection without
appropriate refrigeration
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-analysis Checks
• Verify sample identification and ensure correct labeling.
• Inspect sample for any signs of contamination or inadequacy.
• Document and log the sample details in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6.2 Sample Preparation
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
• If sediment is present, centrifuge the sample at 1,500 rpm for 5
minutes and use the supernatant for analysis.
6.3 Thallium Analysis using ICP-MS/AAS
• Set up and calibrate the ICP-MS/AAS instrument using Thallium
standard solutions.
• Run quality control samples and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
• Pipette an appropriate aliquot of the urine sample into the
instrument's sample intake vial.
• Perform the Thallium analysis as per the instrument’s operating
manual.
• Record the Thallium concentration results.
6.4 Creatinine Analysis using Automated Chemistry Analyzer
• Set up and calibrate the Chemistry Analyzer using Creatinine
assay reagent kits and standard solutions.
• Run quality control samples and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
• Load the urine sample onto the automated analyzer following the
specific loading instructions.
• Perform the Creatinine analysis as per the Chemistry Analyzer’s
protocol.
• Record the Creatinine concentration results.
6.5 Calculation of Thallium/Creatinine Ratio
• Calculate the Thallium/Creatinine ratio (µg/g) using the formula: [
\text{Thallium/Creatinine ratio} = \frac{\text{Thallium
Concentration (µg/L)}}{\text{Creatinine Concentration (g/L)}} ]
• Document the calculated ratio in the LIS.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform analysis on high and low control samples with each batch
of patient samples.
• Document all quality control results and corrective actions for any
out-of-range results.
• Ensure all equipment is properly maintained and calibrated
following manufacturer recommendations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the accuracy of all results before entering them into the LIS.
• Report results as Thallium concentration (µg/L), Creatinine
concentration (g/L), and Thallium/Creatinine ratio (µg/g).
• Include any comments or notes regarding sample integrity or
analytical issues.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hematuria, proteinuria, or other interfering substances may affect
the accuracy of the analysis.
• Ensure careful sample preparation and verification of analytical
methods to minimize interferences.
