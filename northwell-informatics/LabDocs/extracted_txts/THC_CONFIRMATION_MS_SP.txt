Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for THC Confirmation by
Mass Spectrometry (MS) - Serum/Plasma (SP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the confirmation of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in serum/plasma samples using Mass
Spectrometry (MS).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical testing phase for serum/
plasma samples received by the laboratory for THC confirmation. It
assumes that samples have been properly collected, received, and
accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedure in accordance with this SOP and document
all results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedure and taking appropriate action when necessary.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
coupled with Mass Spectrometer (MS)
• THC standards and internal controls
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Clean polypropylene tubes
• Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Extraction solvents (e.g., hexane, ethyl acetate)
• Water bath, vortex mixer
• Nitrogen evaporator (N-Evap)
4.2 SPECIMEN
• Type: Serum or plasma (SP)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Storage: Store at 2-8°C until analysis. For long-term storage,
samples should be frozen at -20°C or below.
4.3 CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• All equipment must be calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Include a calibration curve with a minimum of five points spanning
the range of expected concentrations.
• Use positive and negative quality control (QC) samples to assess
accuracy and precision.
• Run an internal standard alongside each batch of samples for
quantification.
4.4 SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Thawing and Mixing:
◦ If frozen, thaw serum/plasma samples at room temperature.
Vortex to mix thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
any particulates.
2. Extraction:
◦ Pipette 1 mL of serum/plasma into a polypropylene tube.
◦ Add an internal standard to each sample.
◦ Add 2 mL of extraction solvent (e.g., hexane:ethyl acetate,
3:1) to the sample.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to separate phases.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
3. Evaporation and Reconstitution:
◦ Evaporate the solvent under nitrogen at 37°C using the N-
Evap.
◦ Reconstitute the dried residue in 100 μL of mobile phase
(e.g., methanol:water, 1:1).
◦ Vortex and transfer to an HPLC vial for analysis.
4.5 HPLC-MS ANALYSIS
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Configure the HPLC-MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Set the appropriate column and mobile phase parameters.
◦ Calibrate the mass spectrometer using the prepared
standards.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject 10 μL of each sample, standard, and QC onto the
HPLC system.
◦ Ensure the system is operating within the validated range
and check all system suitability parameters.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Monitor specific ion transitions for THC and the internal
standard.
◦ Use the appropriate software for peak identification and
quantification.
4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Quality Control:
◦ Review the results of QC samples to ensure they fall within
the acceptable range.
◦ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the issue before
continuing with the sample analysis.
2. Quantification:
◦ Calculate THC concentrations in samples using the
calibration curve.
◦ Verify that internal standards are within acceptable limits.
3. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Document all results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Report findings as per laboratory protocol, including
concentrations and any deviations.

specimens.
6. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment.
• Dispose of waste solvents and samples according to hazardous
waste regulations.
• Refer to material safety data sheets (MSDS) for hazards
associated with chemicals and reagents used.
This SOP ensures the reliable and accurate confirmation of THC
levels in serum/plasma samples using Mass Spectrometry, in
compliance with regulatory standards and laboratory best practices.
