STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
THC Analysis by Mass Spectrometry in Whole Blood or Serum/
Plasma Samples
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to analyze the presence
and concentration of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolites
in whole blood (WB) or serum/plasma (SP) samples using mass
spectrometry (MS). This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and
reliability in testing procedures and reporting.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the laboratory staff responsible for performing
mass spectrometric analysis of THC in whole blood or serum/plasma
samples for clinical and forensic purposes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Ensuring all reagents, equipment, and supplies are available and
in good condition.
• Following the SOP as outlined to maintain accuracy and
reproducibility.
• Accurately documenting all steps, results, and any deviations or
issues encountered.
• Reporting any irregularities or equipment malfunctions
immediately to the supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Mass spectrometer (with appropriate software for THC analysis)
• Liquid Chromatograph (LC)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sample preparation kits (e.g., solid-phase extraction (SPE)
cartridges or liquid-liquid extraction materials)
• Certified THC and metabolite standards
• Calibrators and quality control samples
• Solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile, deionized water)
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., test tubes, sample vials)
• Protective equipment (e.g., gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types: Whole blood (WB) or serum/plasma (SP)
• Storage: Samples should be stored at -20°C or below, if not
processed immediately.
• Stability: THC is stable in WB/SP at -20°C for up to 12 months.
Once thawed, samples should not be refrozen.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
a) Thaw Samples: Thaw frozen WB/SP samples at room
temperature. Vortex each sample for 30 seconds to ensure
homogeneity.
b) Aliquoting: Aliquot 1 mL of the WB/SP sample into a pre-labeled
test tube.
c) Internal Standard: Add 50 µL of internal standard solution (e.g.,
deuterated THC) to each sample.
d) Extraction:
• Liquid-Liquid Extraction:
1. Add 3 mL of acetonitrile to each sample.
2. Vortex for 2 minutes.
3. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube.
5. Evaporate the supernatant under nitrogen at 40°C.
6. Reconstitute the residue in 200 µL of mobile phase (e.g.,
water:acetonitrile, 50:50).
• Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE):
1. Condition SPE cartridges with 2 mL methanol followed by 2
mL deionized water.
2. Load the sample onto the SPE cartridge.
3. Wash the cartridge with 2 mL deionized water.
4. Elute THC with 2 mL methanol.
5. Evaporate the eluate under nitrogen at 40°C.
6. Reconstitute the residue in 200 µL of mobile phase.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis:
a) LC-MS/MS Setup:
• Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Prepare the mobile phase (e.g., water with 0.1% formic acid and
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid).
• Configure the LC gradient method suitable for THC analysis.
• Calibrate the mass spectrometer using certified THC standards.
b) Injection:
• Inject 10 µL of the reconstituted sample into the LC-MS/MS.
c) Data Acquisition:
• Acquire data using Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode.
• Monitor the specific m/z transitions for THC and its metabolites.
d) Data Analysis and Interpretation:
• Quantify THC levels using calibration curves obtained from known
standards.
• Ensure quality control samples fall within the acceptable range.
Quality Control:
a) Calibration Standards: Use certified THC standards to prepare
calibration curves covering the expected concentration range in the
samples.
b) Quality Control Samples: Include high, medium, and low
concentration controls in each batch of samples analyzed.
c) Blanks: Run a blank solvent sample between batches to check for
carryover.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Report THC concentrations in the units appropriate to your LIS
(e.g., ng/mL).
• Any critical or unexpected findings should be communicated to
the supervising pathologist immediately.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Document all steps, including sample preparation, instrument
settings, and any deviations.
• Maintain records of calibration curves, quality control results, and
sample analysis results.
• Adhere to the laboratory’s data retention policies.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to the instrument and reagent manufacturers' manuals for
detailed procedures and troubleshooting tips.
• Adhere to pertinent regulatory guidelines and standards for mass
spectrometry analyses.
1. REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually, or as needed,
by the laboratory quality assurance team.
NOTE: Adherence to this SOP ensures consistency and accuracy in
generating results for THC analysis in whole blood or serum/plasma
samples using mass spectrometry.
