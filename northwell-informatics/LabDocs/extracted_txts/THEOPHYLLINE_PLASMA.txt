Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Theophylline Analysis
in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the proper procedure for the quantitative analysis
of theophylline levels in plasma samples using an immunoassay
method. The goal is to ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate
results that are critical for therapeutic drug monitoring and patient
management.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel conducting the
theophylline test to follow this SOP. Supervisors must ensure
compliance and address any deviations or issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION
Theophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat symptoms of asthma,
chronic bronchitis, and other lung diseases. Plasma theophylline
concentration measurement is essential for dosage adjustment and
toxicity prevention.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Beckman Coulter DxC 700 AU)
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• Theophylline reagent kits specific to the immunoassay analyzer
• Theophylline calibrators (traceable to international standards)
• Theophylline controls (low, medium, and high)
• Plasma separator tubes (PST) containing lithium heparin
Supplies:
• Sample tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Collection and Preparation:
1. Collect blood samples in PST tubes containing lithium heparin.
2. Centrifuge the blood samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma from blood cells.
3. Inspect the plasma for hemolysis; reject hemolyzed specimens
as they may interfere with results.
Calibration:
1. Prepare theophylline calibrators according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run calibrators on the immunoassay analyzer as per the
calibration procedure in the user manual.
3. Ensure that calibration curves meet the acceptance criteria
before running patient samples.
Quality Control:
1. Run theophylline controls at low, medium, and high
concentrations at the start of each analytical run.
2. Verify that control values fall within the acceptable range
specified by the manufacturer.
3. Document control results in the QC log.
Sample Analysis:
1. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer for sample analysis as per
the user manual.
2. Load plasma samples into the analyzer.
3. Initiate the analysis, ensuring that each sample is correctly
identified and matched with its respective patient record.
4. The analyzer will automatically measure the theophylline
concentration in each sample and generate results.
Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify the results generated by the analyzer for
accuracy.
2. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Ensure results are interpreted within the therapeutic reference
range (10-20 µg/mL).
4. Flag critical values (e.g., levels greater than 20 µg/mL) and
notify the relevant medical personnel immediately as per the
laboratory’s critical value policy.
Sample Integrity:
• If sample integrity is questioned (e.g., if the sample is hemolyzed
or has been stored improperly), document and investigate the
issue.
• Repeat the analysis with a new sample if possible.
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic range: 10-20 µg/mL
• Toxic level: >20 µg/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples may interfere with the
assay.
• Incorrect sample handling and prolonged storage times may lead
to degradation of theophylline.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure all analyzers are routinely maintained and calibrated as
per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all quality control and maintenance activities in the
respective logs.
• Review QC logs regularly to identify and address any trends or
anomalies.

• Manufacturer's instructions for the immunoassay analyzer and
theophylline reagent kits.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant textbooks and peer-reviewed journals on theophylline
analysis and therapeutic drug monitoring.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the reliable and
accurate measurement of theophylline levels in plasma, providing
vital information for patient care and therapeutic monitoring.
