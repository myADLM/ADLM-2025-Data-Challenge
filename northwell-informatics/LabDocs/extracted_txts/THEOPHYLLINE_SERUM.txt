Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Theophylline, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantification of
theophylline levels in serum samples using High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC). This SOP aims to ensure accurate,
reproducible, and timely results to support therapeutic drug
monitoring.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
certified to perform theophylline serum analysis in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform and
document the analysis of theophylline in serum according to this
SOP. Supervisors must ensure compliance with this procedure and
handle any deviations or issues reported by the technologists.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC system with a suitable detection unit (UV detector
recommended)
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Theophylline standard
• Mobile phase: Methanol: Water (70:30) with 0.1% formic acid
• Calibration standards (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µg/mL)
• Quality control samples (low, medium, and high concentration)
• Sample vials with caps
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Waste disposal containers
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Use a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 2 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
• Allow serum samples to clot at room temperature for at least 30
minutes.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Aliquot the required amount of serum into a clean sample vial.
6.2. Standard and Quality Control Preparation
• Prepare calibration standards using theophylline stock solution
and dilute to desired concentrations.
• Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
• Store standards and controls according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
6.3. HPLC System Preparation
• Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase for at least 30
minutes.
• Inject a calibration standard to check system suitability.
6.4. Analysis
• Inject 20 µL of the calibration standards, quality control samples,
and patient serum samples into the HPLC system.
• Run the HPLC sequence according to the pre-established method
parameters.
• Record the retention time and peak area for theophylline.
6.5. Calibration and Quantification
• Generate a calibration curve by plotting peak area against
theophylline concentration for the standards.
• Calculate the concentration of theophylline in the serum samples
using the calibration curve.
• Verify calibration curve with quality control samples before
reporting patient results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch.
• Quality control results must fall within the pre-established limits. If
QC fails, do not report patient results and re-run the batch.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and reviewed.
• Verify results for accuracy and consistency before release.
• Critical results that fall outside therapeutic ranges must be verified
and communicated to the physician immediately following
laboratory policies.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay and lead to inaccurate results.
• Only serum samples are acceptable for this method.
• The stability of theophylline in the sample is crucial; adhere to
storage guidelines strictly.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for HPLC system and reagents
• CLSI Guidelines for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring
• Current literature on theophylline pharmacokinetics and
therapeutic ranges
11. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs of all calibration, quality control, sample analysis,
and any deviations from the SOP.
• Ensure all records are up-to-date and retained as per laboratory
policy.
12. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed when there are
changes in the procedure, regulatory requirements, or equipment.
