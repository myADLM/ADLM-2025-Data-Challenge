Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Thiamine (Vitamin B1) Measurement in
Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures and responsibilities for the precise and accurate
measurement of Thiamine (Vitamin B1) levels in whole blood
specimens. This ensures the delivery of reliable, reproducible,
and clinically relevant results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All personnel operating the instrumentation
and performing the tests are responsible for adhering to the
procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
staff to identify any issues that may affect test outcomes and
alert a supervisor.
3. DEFINITION Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin
essential for metabolic processes. In the clinical laboratory,
whole blood levels of thiamine are measured to assess
deficiency or monitor therapeutic levels.
4. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: - Whole blood collected in EDTA or heparinized
tubes.
Acceptable Specimens: - SST tubes are acceptable but not preferred
for Vitamin B1 analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed samples. - Specimens
collected in tubes with anticoagulants other than EDTA or heparin. -
Specimens with a significant proportion (> 10%) of air bubbles.
Stability: - Whole blood samples stored at 2-8°C are stable for up to
48 hours. - Specimens must be kept refrigerated and analyzed as
soon as possible.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) system
equipped with fluorescence detection.
◦ EDTA or heparinized blood collection tubes.
◦ Thiamine standard solutions.
◦ Internal standard (e.g., Thiamine diphosphate).
◦ Mobile phase reagents (typically a mixture of acetonitrile
and phosphate buffer).
◦ Sample preparation supplies (centrifuges, pipettes, filtration
devices).
2. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation - Thoroughly mix the whole blood specimen
by gentle inversion. - Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 RPM for
10 minutes to separate plasma. - Aspirate the plasma layer carefully
to avoid disturbing the cellular components. - Add internal standard to
the plasma for accurate quantification. - Deproteinize the sample
using a suitable agent such as perchloric acid. - Centrifuge the
deproteinized sample and filter supernatant through a 0.45 μm filter. -
Store filtered supernatant at 4°C until analysis.
6.2 Instrument Setup - Ensure HPLC system is calibrated and
running smoothly before sample analysis. - Prepare mobile phase
using acetonitrile and phosphate buffer. - Load prepared samples and
standards onto the HPLC system in the appropriate sample tray. - Set
fluorescence detector to measure thiamine.
6.3 HPLC Analysis - Inject appropriate volume of sample (20-50 μL)
into HPLC system. - Run the analysis following standard HPLC
protocol optimized for thiamine detection. - Record the
chromatographic data and integrate peaks corresponding to thiamine
and internal standard.
6.4 Data Analysis - Compare sample peak area to standard curve to
quantify thiamine concentration in the samples. - Ensure quality
controls are within acceptable range before confirming results. - If
any sample fails to meet QC criteria or shows irregularity, perform
reanalysis.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include thiamine standard samples to verify instrument
accuracy.
◦ Use internal standard for precision and reproducibility.
◦ Perform quality control checks at the start of the day and
with each batch of samples processed.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results transmitted to LIS must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
◦ Include limits of detection and quantification on report.
◦ For critical low or high thiamine levels, follow proper
documentation procedures and notify appropriate clinical
staff as per SOP guidelines on reporting critical values.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Optimal Thiamine Concentration: 2-7 μg/L.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimen is properly centrifuged and deproteinized to
avoid interference.
• Refer to HPLC manufacturer's guidelines for specific detector and
chromatographic limitations.
