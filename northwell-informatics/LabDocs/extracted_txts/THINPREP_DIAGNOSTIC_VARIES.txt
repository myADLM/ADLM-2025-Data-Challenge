Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ThinPrep
Diagnostic
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure is to outline the
analytical process for generating results using the ThinPrep
diagnostic system. This includes preparation, staining, and
microscopic examination of cytology samples. The goal is to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated staff, including cytotechnologists and pathologists, are
responsible for following this procedure. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that the procedure is adhered to and
to address any deviations or issues that arise during the process.
3. DEFINITIONS
• ThinPrep Diagnostic System: A liquid-based cytology system
used for preparing cytology samples for microscopic examination.
• Cytotechnologist: A laboratory professional trained to prepare
and examine cytology slides.
• Pathologist: A medical doctor specialized in interpreting medical
laboratory tests to diagnose diseases.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimens: Specimens must be collected in ThinPrep
PreservCyt solution and adequately labeled with patient
identification.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens arriving without adequate
labeling, contaminated, or improperly preserved.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ThinPrep Processor
• ThinPrep Staining Solution
• Microscope
• Coverslips and slides
• Labeling materials
• PreservCyt solution
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Verification: Ensure the specimen is correctly labeled and has
arrived within an appropriate timeframe.
• Mixing: Vigorously mix the specimen in the PreservCyt solution to
ensure uniform distribution of cells.
• Aliquoting: Aliquot an appropriate volume of the specimen into
the ThinPrep processor vial.
6.2 Processing
• ThinPrep Processor: Place the vial into the ThinPrep processor
following the manufacturer's instructions.
• Cell Transfer: Allow the processor to transfer the cells onto a
glass slide.
• Fixation: The processor will automatically fix the slide. Upon
completion, retrieve the slide.
6.3 Staining
• Staining Protocol: Follow the ThinPrep staining protocol.
Immerse the slide into the ThinPrep staining solutions using a
defined sequence.
• Quality Check: Ensure slides are stain-free from artifacts and
adequately stained for microscopic examination.
6.4 Microscopic Examination
• Cytotechnologist Review: A cytotechnologist will examine the
slides under a microscope for preliminary analysis.
• Pathologist Review: If necessary, suspicious or unclear findings
will be reviewed and confirmed by a pathologist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Quality Control Samples: Run positive and negative control
samples with each batch of specimens to ensure the staining
process is functioning correctly.
• Equipment Maintenance: Regularly check and calibrate the
ThinPrep processor as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
Document equipment checks in the logbook.
• QA Review: Periodically audit the process to ensure compliance
and to identify areas for improvement.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Documentation: Record findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Verification: The pathologist will confirm results in the LIS.
• Communication: Results will be communicated to the requesting
physician following laboratory protocols.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Staining Issues: Re-stain the slide if the initial staining did not
meet quality standards. Document any re-stains done.
• Equipment Malfunction: If the ThinPrep processor malfunctions,
follow the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide and notify the
supervisor immediately.
• Specimen Issues: In cases where a specimen is inadequate,
notify the requesting physician to collect a new sample.
10. REFERENCES
• ThinPrep Processor Manual and Staining Protocol.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures.
• Local, State, and Federal Regulations governing cytology testing.
11. REVISION HISTORY
Document any revisions made to the procedure, including the date
and description of the change.
Note: This protocol is a general guideline and might need specific
adjustments based on local laboratory settings, equipment types, and
regulatory requirements.
