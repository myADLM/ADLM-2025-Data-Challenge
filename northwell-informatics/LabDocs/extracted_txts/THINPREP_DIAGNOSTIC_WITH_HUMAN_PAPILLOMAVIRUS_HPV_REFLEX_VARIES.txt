Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ThinPrep Diagnostic with Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) Reflex
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
processing ThinPrep Diagnostic specimens with HPV Reflex testing.
It ensures that all tests are performed consistently, accurately, and
according to established guidelines.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
All designated laboratory personnel involved in the analytical phase
of ThinPrep Diagnostic and HPV Reflex testing must adhere to this
SOP. It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure that
staff are properly trained and that all procedures are followed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred specimens: Cervical samples collected in ThinPrep
vials.
• Specimens must be labeled correctly and accompanied by a
completed requisition form indicating ThinPrep Diagnostic with
HPV Reflex.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• ThinPrep Processor
• PreservCyt Solution
• Liquid-based cytology containers
• HPV Test Kit (e.g., Roche cobas HPV Test)
• Automated DNA/RNA extraction system
• PCR amplification instrument
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for recording and verifying
results
1. PROCEDURE:
A. ThinPrep Cytology Processing:
1. Prepare Specimen:
◦ Verify specimen identity and labeling. Ensure specimens
meet acceptance criteria (i.e., appropriate volume, no
leakage).
◦ Record receipt in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Specimen Transfer to ThinPrep Processor:
◦ Transfer ThinPrep vial to the ThinPrep Processor following
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Prepare ThinPrep slides according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
3. Staining and Screening:
◦ Stain slides using the appropriate Pap stain protocol.
◦ Screen slides microscopically for cytological evaluation.
Record results in LIS.
B. HPV Reflex Testing
1. Specimen Preparation for HPV Test:
◦ If the ThinPrep Diagnostic results indicate an abnormality
requiring reflex HPV testing, proceed with reflex testing.
◦ Transfer a sample aliquot from the ThinPrep vial to the HPV
test kit vial according to manufacturer instructions.
2. DNA/RNA Extraction:
◦ Process the sample using an automated DNA/RNA
extraction system.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines and ensure all control
measures are in place.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Prepare the sample for PCR amplification using the
reagents and protocols specified in the HPV test kit’s
instructions.
◦ Run the PCR amplification on a PCR instrument as per
manufacturer's directions.
4. HPV Detection:
◦ Analyze the amplified samples for HPV DNA using the
specified HPV test kit.
◦ Record the results in the LIS.
C. Quality Control:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Run appropriate positive and negative controls with each
batch of tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
results.
◦ Record all QC results in the QC log and ensure they fall
within the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
samples.
2. System Maintenance:
◦ Perform daily maintenance and calibration of all instruments
used as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Verification:
◦ Verify and review all test results in the LIS. Ensure results
are consistent with QC evaluations.
◦ Supervisor or designated reviewer must approve all results
before release.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter or confirm results in the LIS ensuring accuracy related
to patient identifiers, including ThinPrep findings and HPV
status.
◦ Annotate any issues related to test performance or
specimen integrity in the LIS.
3. Results Release:
◦ Release verified results to the appropriate healthcare
provider.
◦ For critical or abnormal results, follow the laboratory's
protocol for immediate notification.
4. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for ThinPrep Processor.
• Manufacturer's instructions for the HPV test kit.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance policies and procedures.
• CLSI guidelines for molecular diagnostics.
1. REVIEW/REVISION HISTORY:
Document any changes made to this SOP including date, nature of
change, and approved by.
By following these procedures, the laboratory ensures consistent,
reliable, and timely processing of ThinPrep Diagnostic samples with
HPV Reflex, leading to accurate diagnostic outcomes.
