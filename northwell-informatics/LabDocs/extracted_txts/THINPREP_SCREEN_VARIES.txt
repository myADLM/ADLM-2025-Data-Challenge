Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
THINPREP SCREEN, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardized process for
generating results for THINPREP SCREEN, VARIES, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the THINPREP SCREEN, following the procedures outlined in this
document. All staff must ensure the validity and integrity of the results
generated and identify any deficiencies that may affect laboratory test
outcomes.
1. SPECIMENS
Acceptable:
◦ ThinPrep vials containing cytological specimens (e.g.,
cervical cells, pelvic washings, fine needle aspirates).
Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens that are improperly labeled, received in
containers other than ThinPrep vials, or that exhibit leakage
or visible contamination.
2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ ThinPrep 2000/5000 Processor
◦ Microscope
◦ Cytyc ThinPrep Pap Test Kit
◦ Slides and cover slips
◦ Staining reagents
◦ PPE (personal protective equipment)
◦ Relevant documentation forms and logs
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Inspect the specimen for proper labeling and container integrity.
Reject any unacceptable specimens as defined above.
2. Vortex the ThinPrep vial for 10 seconds to ensure homogeneity
of the sample.
B. ThinPrep Processing
1. Load the ThinPrep vial onto the ThinPrep 2000/5000 Processor.
2. Set the processor parameters according to the ThinPrep Pap
Test Kit instructions.
3. Run the ThinPrep Processor to transfer the cellular material
from the vial onto a glass slide, ensuring even distribution and
avoiding cellular clumps.
4. Allow the slide to air dry completely.
C. Staining and Mounting
1. Fix the air-dried slide in 95% ethyl alcohol for a minimum of 15
minutes.
2. Stain the fixed slides using the Papanicolaou stain procedure.
3. Rinse and dehydrate the slides through graded alcohols and
xylene.
4. Mount the slides with coverslips using a suitable mounting
medium.
D. Microscopic Examination
1. Perform a thorough microscopic examination of the stained
slides to identify cellular abnormalities.
2. Record findings on the appropriate forms and logs.
E. Reporting Results
1. Based on the microscopic findings, classify the results
according to the Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical
Cytology.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify accuracy.
3. Ensure that all critical results are promptly communicated to the
responsible physician.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Verify the functionality of the ThinPrep Processor using
process controls as recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Perform regular maintenance of the ThinPrep Processor and
document it.
◦ Include negative and positive control slides in each run to
ensure staining quality and slide integrity.
◦ Document and troubleshoot any deviations from expected
results and notify the supervisor/manager immediately.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.
◦ Specimen adequacy must meet the criteria outlined in the
Bethesda System.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Cellularity: Insufficient cellular material may result in non-
diagnostic slides.
◦ Proper fixation: Inadequate fixation may lead to poor
staining and morphology.
◦ Specimen quality: Specimen quality relies heavily on
appropriate collection and handling.
7. REFERENCES
◦ ThinPrep Pap Test Package Insert.
◦ Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical Cytology.
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for ThinPrep 2000/5000
Processor.
8. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• All records pertaining to specimen processing, results, equipment
maintenance, and quality control must be retained as per
laboratory policy and regulatory requirements.
• Ensure all updates to the SOP are documented, reviewed, and
approved by laboratory management.
This document establishes a systematic procedure to ensure reliable
and accurate test results. All laboratory personnel must be trained on
these procedures and comply with them at all times.
