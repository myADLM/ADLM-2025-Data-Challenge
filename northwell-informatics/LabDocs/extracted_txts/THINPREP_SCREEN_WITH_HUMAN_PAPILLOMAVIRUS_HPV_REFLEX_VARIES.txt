THINPREP SCREEN WITH HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV)
REFLEX, VARIES - SOP
1. PURPOSE: To establish a standardized protocol for the
analysis and reporting of ThinPrep Pap tests with HPV reflex
testing, ensuring accurate and reliable results that support
clinical decision-making.
2. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION: The
specimens received for ThinPrep Pap tests and HPV reflex
testing should conform to the following criteria:
• Collection medium: PreservCyt solution (ThinPrep vial).
• Specimen should be labeled with patient information and
collection date/time.
• Specimen must be adequate with cellularity conforming to the
adequacy criteria.
Specimens that do not meet these criteria should be rejected, and
the clinician must be notified for recollection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ThinPrep 2000 Processor
• Cytology slides
• Cytology Stains and Fixatives (Papanicolaou stain)
• HPV mRNA or DNA assay reagents and testing platform (e.g.,
PCR, Hybrid Capture 2)
• Microscope for cytology examination
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Specimen rejection containers (Biohazard)
1. PROCEDURE FOR PROCESSING ThinPrep: A. Configuration
and Preparation:
• Ensure that all equipment is properly maintained and calibrated.
• Validate and document temperature for equipment including
refrigerators and incubators following Example SOP 1
procedures.
B. ThinPrep Processing:
1. Vortex samples for 15 seconds to mix cells.
2. Prepare slides using ThinPrep 2000 Processor: a. Load
ThinPrep vial and process. b. Transfer specimens onto cytology
slides and allow to dry.
3. Fix slides immediately using cytology fixative.
4. Stain slides using Papanicolaou staining method: a. Engage
stainer. b. Dip slides sequentially in the required series of stains
and rinses. c. Dry slides.
C. Microscopic Evaluation:
1. Examine stained slides under the microscope: a. Assess
sample adequacy. b. Screen for abnormal cells and categorize
findings (e.g., ASC-US, LSIL, HSIL or negative).
2. Record observations following relevant diagnostic criteria.
3. If atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASC-US) or
higher grade abnormality observed, proceed with HPV reflex
testing.
4. PROCEDURE FOR HPV TESTING: A. HPV Assay Setup:
5. Confirm equipment validation and reagent preparation.
6. Use the aliquot from the ThinPrep specimen for HPV analysis.
a. Transfer appropriate volume to HPV assay-specific
processing.
B. HPV Reflex Testing:
1. Perform HPV reflex testing using standard protocols for the
assay platform: a. Set up PCR or Hybrid Capture 2 reactions as
needed. b. Ensure all controls are within limits.
2. Run assay and evaluates results according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform routine quality control for both cytology and HPV assays
as per manufacturer’s guidance and internal laboratory protocols.
• Document any quality control failures and corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS: A. ThinPrep Results:
• Record cytology findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Cytology results verified by the reviewing pathologist.
• If ASC-US or higher-grade lesions are observed, include HPV
reflex test results.
B. HPV Results:
• HPV results are reviewed and verified in the LIS.
• HPV positive results should be reported with the cytology findings.
• HPV negative results can be included in the final report ensuring
proper documentation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• ThinPrep: Negative or category according to diagnosis criteria.
• HPV: Positive/Negative result based on assay.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Incomplete specimen collection or improper preservation may
compromise the test results.
• HPV testing should be performed only on specimens with
abnormal cytology findings or as part of a reflex testing strategy.
