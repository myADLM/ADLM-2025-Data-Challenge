Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
THINPREP WITH HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) CO-TEST-
DIAGNOSTIC
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of ThinPrep Pap Test
specimens with co-testing for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of results reported.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedures outlined in this SOP. Lab supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP and addressing any
deviations or issues.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen: PreservCyt Solution (ThinPrep vial)
containing cervical cells collected via a broom-type or spatula and
cytobrush collection device.
Acceptance/Rejection Criteria:
• Acceptable: Specimens in PreservCyt Solution with appropriate
labeling (patient information, collection date/time).
• Unacceptable: Specimens leaking or without appropriate labeling,
specimens exceeding 21 days from collection to analysis.
4. REQUIRED MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
Materials and Reagents:
• PreservCyt Solution (ThinPrep vials)
• HPV test kit (manufacturer-specific)
• ThinPrep 2000 Processor
Equipment:
• Automated ThinPrep Processor
• Microscope
• PCR or other HPV testing platforms (as specified by
manufacturer)
5. PROCEDURE
A) ThinPrep Processing:
1. Specimen Preparation: a. Verify patient information on the
ThinPrep vial. b. Vortex the specimen to ensure cells are
suspended evenly in the PreservCyt Solution. c. Load the
ThinPrep vial into the ThinPrep 2000 Processor.
2. Slide Preparation: a. Prepare a labeled ThinPrep slide. b.
Process the ThinPrep vial according to the manufacturer's
instructions. c. Transfer cells to the slide using the automated
ThinPrep Processor. d. Fix and stain the cells on the slide (e.g.,
with Pap stain).
3. Microscopic Evaluation: a. Microscopically evaluate the slide
for cellular abnormalities. b. Document findings according to the
Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical Cytology.
B) HPV Testing:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Use the remaining PreservCyt solution
from the ThinPrep vial. b. Perform DNA extraction according to
the HPV test kit instructions.
2. HPV Assay: a. Prepare and set up the PCR or other HPV
testing platform following the manufacturer’s protocol. b. Add
extracted DNA to the test reagents. c. Run the test according to
the test kit instructions.
3. Result Interpretation: a. Analyze the HPV test results. b.
Document positive and negative HPV results, including
genotyping if applicable (e.g., high-risk HPV 16, 18).
4. Quality Control: a. Run appropriate positive and negative
controls with each batch of samples. b. Ensure controls fall
within specified ranges; if not, investigation and retesting are
required.
C) Result Reporting:
1. Set up Reporting Parameters: a. Combine ThinPrep cytology
findings with HPV results. b. Use LIS (Laboratory Information
System) to document and correlate results.
2. Review and Verification: a. Technologist must review all
results for accuracy. b. Supervisor must approve and verify final
reports.
3. Report Generation: a. Generate and print or electronically
submit the co-test report. b. Ensure results are accessible to
the appropriate medical personnel.
D) Corrective Actions:
1. Internal QC Failures: a. Investigate and document the cause.
b. Re-test affected specimens, if necessary.
2. External QC: a. Participate in periodic proficiency testing as
required by CLIA and other accrediting bodies.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• HPV: Positive/Negative
• ThinPrep cytology: As per the Bethesda System guidelines (e.g.
NILM, ASC-US, LSIL, HSIL)
7. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
• Maintain records of all test results, QC results, maintenance logs,
and corrective actions for at least two years.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
• Review QC data regularly to identify trends.
• Participate in continuing education and training to ensure
proficiency.
