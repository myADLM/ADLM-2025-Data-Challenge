Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for THINPREP WITH
HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) CO-TEST-SCREEN, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
the THINPREP with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) co-test screen in
the laboratory. This assay detects the presence of abnormal cervical
cells and identifies HPV infection, which may indicate an increased
risk for cervical cancer.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff trained in the use of the ThinPrep
and HPV testing platforms and processes involved.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists are responsible for preparing, processing, and
analyzing specimens.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that testing is done
according to the SOP and providing training.
• All staff are responsible for adhering to the procedure and noting
any deviations or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STORAGE
ThinPrep Pap Test:
• Specimen type: Cervical cells collected in ThinPrep PreservCyt
Solution.
• Storage: Store specimens at room temperature (15-30°C) before
processing.
HPV DNA Test:
• Specimen type: Cervical cells collected in ThinPrep PreservCyt
Solution.
• Storage: Store specimens at room temperature (15-30°C) before
processing.
• Note: Specimens should be tested within 3 weeks of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ThinPrep 2000 Processor
• Cobas 4800 HPV Test System or equivalent
• Automated Pap staining system
• Coverslipping device
• Microscope
• Prepared slides
• Appropriate control materials (positive and negative)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation for ThinPrep Pap Test:
1. Processing:
◦ Vortex PreservCyt vial for 30 seconds to disaggregate cells.
◦ Remove an aliquot of the specimen and transfer to the
ThinPrep processor.
◦ Follow the ThinPrep 2000 Processor instructions for slide
preparation.
2. Staining:
◦ Stain slides using the automated Pap staining system.
◦ Ensure uniform staining by following manufacturer
guidelines.
3. Coverslipping:
◦ Apply coverslips using the coverslipping device.
◦ Store slides at room temperature until analysis.
B. Specimen Preparation for HPV DNA Test Using Cobas 4800
System:
1. Pre-treatment:
◦ Aliquot a specific volume from the PreservCyt vial to a
labeled test tube.
◦ Follow the Cobas 4800 pre-treatment protocols for
preparing the specimen.
2. HPV DNA Extraction and Amplification:
◦ Load the prepared tubes onto the Cobas 4800 system.
◦ Follow the instrument’s procedure for HPV DNA extraction
and amplification.
◦ Ensure all procedures adhere to the assay’s QRG (Quick
Reference Guide).
3. HPV Detection and Reporting:
◦ Record results from the Cobas 4800 system.
◦ Report positive or negative HPV results based on the
manufacturer’s instructions.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
ThinPrep Pap Test:
• Use positive and negative control slides to ensure the staining
process is consistent.
• Document all the QC results in the designated QC log.
HPV DNA Test:
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to monitor
assay performance.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for acceptable control ranges.
• Document QC results daily and address any deviations.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
ThinPrep Pap Test:
1. Microscopic Evaluation:
◦ Examine slides under the microscope.
◦ Record cytological findings based on the Bethesda system.
2. Reporting:
◦ Report results in accordance with the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
HPV DNA Test:
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Refer to the Cobas 4800 testing guidelines for interpreting
positive, negative, or invalid results.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record and report findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
9. RECORDING AND REPORTING
• Document processes and results in the LIS.
• Ensure all fields such as patient information, test results, date,
technologist identification, and possible comments are complete.
• Report abnormal findings to the clinician promptly following
established reporting guidelines.
