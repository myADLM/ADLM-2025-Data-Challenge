Standard Operating Procedure: Thiocyanate, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the analytical method used to measure
thiocyanate levels in serum. Regular monitoring of thiocyanate is
essential for clinical toxicology and therapeutic drug monitoring,
particularly in cases of cyanide exposure and long-term
administration of certain medications.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting thiocyanate analysis as described in this SOP.
Laboratory supervisors must ensure adherence to these procedures
and address any discrepancies or issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Thiocyanate (SCN-): A chemical compound and an indicator of
cyanide exposure and medication metabolism in the serum.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Sample Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Samples are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated
at 2-8°C and up to 1 month when frozen at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Spectrophotometer (for specific thiocyanate measuring
wavelength)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and micropipettes
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Water bath (if a specific temperature is required)
• Reagents:
◦ Ferric nitrate solution
◦ Color reagent (if different from ferric nitrate)
◦ Calibration standards (commercially available thiocyanate
standards or prepared from ACS grade chemicals)
◦ Distilled water
• Supplies:
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Disposable pipette tips
◦ Cuvettes or microplates suitable for the spectrophotometer
◦ Labelled storage containers
◦ Protective gloves and lab coat
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum sample to clot in an SST for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant (serum) to a clean tube,
avoiding any cellular material.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare the ferric nitrate solution by diluting the stock solution
with distilled water to the required concentration.
2. Prepare calibration standards according to the manufacturer's
instructions or by serial dilution of a known thiocyanate
standard.
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Label cuvettes or microplate wells for calibrators, controls, and
patient samples.
2. Add 100 µL of the serum sample, calibrator, or control to the
corresponding well or cuvette.
3. Add an equal volume (typically 100 µL) of the ferric nitrate
solution to each well or cuvette.
4. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down or using a vortex
mixer.
5. Incubate the mixture as specified (to allow complete reaction
and color development). A water bath may be used if a
temperature-controlled incubation is required.
6. Measure the absorbance of each sample at the specified
wavelength (typically around 460-480 nm) using a
spectrophotometer.
7. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Generate a calibration curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the calibrators against their respective thiocyanate
concentrations.
• Calculate the thiocyanate concentration of the serum samples by
comparing their absorbance values to the calibration curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high range) with
each batch of patient samples to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the assay.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
QC results are outside acceptable limits.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the thiocyanate concentration results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist or laboratory supervisor before release.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range: <10 µmol/L (may vary slightly based on the method
and population)
• Critical value: >100 µmol/L (indicative of possible cyanide
exposure requiring immediate medical intervention)
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
colorimetric detection and must be avoided.
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the
spectrophotometer to obtain accurate results.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the spectrophotometer and
reagents.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
serum thiocyanate measurement.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps, from specimen receipt to final result entry, must be
documented accurately and dated.
• Maintain all records of calibrations, controls, and patient results
for regulatory compliance.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure reliable
and accurate results in the measurement of thiocyanate in serum,
contributing to effective patient care and safety.
