Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thiopurine Metabolites, Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the analytical phase procedures
for the accurate measurement of thiopurine metabolites in whole
blood specimens using standardized laboratory protocols.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
procedures outlined in this SOP and to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of test results. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing
the process and addressing any analytical issues that may arise.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Specimen Handling:
◦ Specimens should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C if they cannot
be analyzed immediately.
◦ Specimens should be stable for up to 7 days when
refrigerated.
◦ Avoid hemolysis and ensure prompt delivery of the specimen
to the laboratory.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Micropipettes and tips.
◦ Vortex mixer.
• Reagents:
◦ Mobile phase reagents for HPLC/LC-MS/MS.
◦ Internal standard solution.
◦ Calibration standards for thiopurine metabolites.
◦ Quality control materials (Low, Medium, and High
concentration).
• Supplies:
◦ EDTA collection tubes.
◦ Sample preparation tubes.
◦ Analytical-grade solvents.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the EDTA whole blood sample at 2,000-2,500 x g
for 10-15 minutes at 2-8°C to separate plasma from red
blood cells.
◦ Carefully aspirate plasma without disturbing the buffy coat or
red blood cell layer.
2. Red Blood Cell (RBC) Lysis:
◦ Transfer an aliquot of the packed red blood cells
(approximately 1 mL) to a new tube.
◦ Add an equal volume of deionized water to lyse the RBCs.
◦ Vortex the mixture thoroughly to ensure complete lysis.
3. Extraction:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of internal standard solution to
the lysed RBC mixture.
◦ Add extraction solvent to the lysed RBC mixture and vortex
for 30 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the supernatant.
4. Collection of Supernatant:
◦ Collect the supernatant into a clean tube without disturbing
the pellet.
5. Evaporation:
◦ Evaporate the collected supernatant under a stream of
nitrogen gas or using a vacuum centrifuge to dryness.
6. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the dried extract with the starting mobile phase
for HPLC/LC-MS/MS analysis.
B) Instrument Calibration and Setup:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards using known concentrations
of thiopurine metabolites.
◦ Perform a calibration curve prior to sample analysis.
◦ Ensure the calibration curve indicates acceptable linearity
(r^2 > 0.99).
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run Quality Control (QC) samples (Low, Medium, High)
before and after the batch of patient samples.
◦ Verify that QC results fall within the target range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. Instrument Setup:
◦ Set up the HPLC/LC-MS/MS parameters according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and method validation.
◦ Ensure all instrument settings, including the flow rate,
temperature, and detection wavelength, are optimized for
thiopurine metabolite analysis.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Injection:
◦ Inject enough reconstituted sample extract from the
preparation step into the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system.
2. Analysis:
◦ Analyze the patient samples using the validated HPLC/LC-
MS/MS method.
◦ Monitor the chromatograms for proper analyte separation
and peak integration.
3. Calculation:
◦ Quantify thiopurine metabolites using the calibration curve.
◦ Ensure accuracy checks and repeat analysis if necessary
based on QC findings.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and Verification:
◦ Review chromatograms and integration for all patient
samples and QC results.
◦ Verify that calibration standards and QC materials meet
acceptable criteria.
◦ Report results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Reference Intervals:
◦ Provide reference intervals for thiopurine metabolite
concentrations based on validated clinical guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. QC Material Verification:
◦ Use QC materials to verify the accuracy and precision of the
analytical process.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ Address any issues with chromatographic separation, peak
identification, or instrumentation according to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide and internal lab
protocols.
◦ Document all steps taken to resolve any problem.

disposal, and adherence to local, state, and federal regulations
governing clinical laboratory testing.
