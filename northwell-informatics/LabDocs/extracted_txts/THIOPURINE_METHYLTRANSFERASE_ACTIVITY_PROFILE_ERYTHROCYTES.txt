Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Thiopurine
Methyltransferase (TPMT) Activity Profile
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for accurately measuring the
activity of Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT) in erythrocytes.
2. SCOPE: This SOP applies to all designated staff performing TPMT
activity assays in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the designated staff to
ensure that all steps in the procedure are followed and that results
are accurately recorded and reported.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen type: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Minimum volume: 5 mL.
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 7 days if kept at 4°C. Do
not freeze whole blood samples.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Water bath at 37°C
• Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) assay kit
• 0.01M Phosphate buffer, pH 7.4
• Substrates and cofactors (S-adenosylmethionine and 6-
mercaptopurine)
• HPLC system with an appropriate detector (UV/Vis)
• Quartz cuvettes
• Tubes for collecting supernatant
• Calibrators and internal standards specific for TPMT activity assay
6. PROCEDURE:
A. SAMPLE PREPARATION:
1. Centrifuge the whole blood samples: a. Centrifuge 5 mL of
whole blood at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate plasma
from erythrocytes. b. Carefully remove and discard the plasma
without disturbing the erythrocyte layer.
2. Wash erythrocytes: a. Add an equal volume of cold 0.01M
phosphate buffer to the erythrocytes. b. Mix gently and
centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 5 minutes. c. Repeat the washing
step two more times.
3. Lyse erythrocytes: a. Resuspend the washed erythrocytes in a
small volume of 0.01M phosphate buffer to lyse the cells. b.
Vortex the mixture thoroughly until a homogenous solution is
obtained.
B. ENZYME ASSAY:
1. Prepare the reaction mixture: a. In a labeled reaction tube,
add: - 100 μL of lysed erythrocyte solution, - 100 μL of substrate
solution (contains S-adenosylmethionine and 6-
mercaptopurine), - 100 μL of 0.01M phosphate buffer.
2. Incubate the reaction: a. Mix the reaction mixture thoroughly
and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Stop the reaction: a. Immediately place the reaction tubes on
ice to stop the reaction. b. Centrifuge the reaction mixture at
10,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
4. Collect the supernatant: a. Carefully transfer the supernatant
to a clean labeled tube, avoiding any pellet.
C. HPLC ANALYSIS:
1. Prepare the HPLC system: a. Set up the HPLC system
according to manufacturer’s instructions. b. Equilibrate the
column with the appropriate mobile phase.
2. Inject the sample: a. Inject 20 μL of the supernatant into the
HPLC system. b. Include calibrators and internal standards to
ensure accuracy and precision.
3. Analyze the sample: a. Run the HPLC analysis under
predefined conditions suitable for detecting TPMT activity
products. b. Record the retention times and peak areas for
TPMT activity products.
D. CALCULATION OF TPMT ACTIVITY:
1. Quantification: a. Quantify the TPMT activity based on the
peak area ratios of the products and internal standards.
2. Calculate enzyme activity: a. Use the formula provided in the
assay kit to convert peak areas to enzyme activity (units/mL or
nmol/h/mL of erythrocytes).
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run internal standard and negative control samples with each
batch of patient samples.
• Include quality control materials with known TPMT activity levels
in each run.
• Ensure that all quality control results fall within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for reporting TPMT activity
results.
• Report results in nmol/h/mL of erythrocytes.
• Document any abnormal findings and include proper comments
as needed.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the TPMT assay kit.
• HPLC system operation manual.
10. RECORD RETENTION:
• Retain logs of all assay runs, QC data, and maintenance records
for a minimum of two years.
• Archive results in the laboratory information system (LIS) as per
institutional guidelines.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including wearing
appropriate PPE.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all waste materials in accordance with standard
biohazard disposal guidelines.
This procedure ensures accurate and reliable measurement of TPMT
activity in erythrocytes, which is critical for appropriate drug dosing
and patient management.
