Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for THIOPURINE
METHYLTRANSFERASE (TPMT) AND NUDIX HYDROLASE
(NUDT15) GENOTYPING, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping. The objective
is to ensure accurate and reliable identification of genetic
polymorphisms that influence the metabolism of thiopurines and to
predict individual risk for developing drug toxicity or therapy failure.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of DNA samples for TPMT and
NUDT15 genotyping in the molecular genetics laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to perform TPMT and
NUDT15 genotyping according to this SOP, and to ensure that results
are accurate and reviewed before reporting.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen type: Whole blood or buccal swab
- Whole blood: EDTA tube (lavender top)
- Buccal swab: Collected in DNA stabilization solution
Storage:
• Whole blood: Store at 2-8°C, stable for 7 days
• Buccal swab: Room temperature, stable for 30 days
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR thermal cycler
• Centrifuge
• Automated DNA extractor (optional)
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• Real-time PCR machine
• DNA Extraction Kit
• TPMT and NUDT15 Genotyping Assay Kit
• Nuclease-free water
• General laboratory consumables (e.g., pipettes, tips, tubes)
6. REAGENTS
• PCR Master Mix
• Specific primers and probes for TPMT and NUDT15
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• DNA ladder
• Ethidium bromide (if using ethidium bromide staining)
7. PROCEDURE
7a. DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from whole blood or buccal swab using the
recommended DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
3. Dilute DNA samples to the recommended concentration for
PCR.
7b. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
protocol, including specific primers and probes for TPMT and
NUDT15.
2. Pipette the master mix into PCR tubes or plates, followed by
the addition of DNA samples, positive control, and negative
control.
3. Centrifuge briefly to ensure contents are at the bottom of the
tube/plate.
4. Place tubes/plates into the thermal cycler and run the PCR
program as specified by the genotyping assay kit.
7c. Detection and Analysis
For Gel Electrophoresis Method:
1. Prepare an agarose gel.
2. Load PCR products and DNA ladder into the gel wells.
3. Run gel electrophoresis at the specified voltage until adequate
separation is achieved.
4. Visualize bands under UV light and document results.
For Real-time PCR Method:
1. Program the real-time PCR machine according to the
genotyping assay instructions.
2. Load the PCR plate into the machine and initiate the run.
3. Analyze data post-run using the software that accompanies the
real-time PCR machine.
7d. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the DNA samples' PCR product band sizes to the
positive control and DNA ladder (gel electrophoresis) or
threshold cycle (Ct) values (real-time PCR).
2. Identify specific genotypes based on band patterns or Ct values
corresponding to TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms.
3. Cross-reference results with known genotype interpretations to
predict enzyme activity levels and drug response.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each assay run to
ensure the validity of the results.
2. Ensure equipment calibration and maintenance are up-to-date.
3. Repeat any assays with ambiguous or unexpected results and
document discrepancies.
4. Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
verify by a second individual.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transcribe results into the LIS, ensuring genotype
interpretations are included.
2. Have results reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
professional.
3. Report findings according to site-specific guidelines, including
clinician notification of critical or actionable results.
