Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thiosulfate, Urine
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of thiosulfate in urine samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable results. This protocol outlines the steps for sample
preparation, instrumentation use, quality control, and result
reporting.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory staff are responsible for performing thiosulfate
urine analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP
and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
process.
1. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
◦ 24-hour urine collection in a container with hydrochloric acid
(HCl) preservative to maintain pH <4.
◦ Spot urine collection (10 mL) without preservative, requiring
immediate refrigeration and processing within 4 hours.
Unacceptable:
◦ Urine specimens without preservative not processed within
4 hours.
◦ Specimens with contamination, incorrect labeling, or without
collection date/time.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Ion Chromatography (IC) system or High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with appropriate
detection capabilities.
◦ Analytical balance.
◦ Volumetric flasks, pipettes, and other laboratory glassware.
◦ Reagents: thiosulfate standards (for calibration), HCl,
deionized water, and appropriate mobile phase solvents.
◦ Quality control materials: known concentration thiosulfate
standards for QC checks.
3. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
4. Thoroughly mix the 24-hour urine collection or spot urine
sample.
5. Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
collection.
6. Acidify the sample to a pH <2 using HCl if not done during
collection.
7. Aliquot a 10 mL sample for analysis.
8. Filter the aliquot through a 0.45 μm membrane filter to remove
particulates.
B. Calibration and System Setup:
1. Prepare a series of thiosulfate standard solutions for calibration,
covering the expected concentration range in urine samples.
2. Set up the IC or HPLC system according to manufacturer
instructions and ensure proper column and mobile phase
selection.
3. Calibrate the instrument using the prepared standard solutions,
ensuring linearity and accuracy.
4. Run system suitability tests to ensure proper function (e.g.,
retention time stability, peak shape).
C. Analysis:
1. Inject the prepared urine sample into the IC or HPLC system.
2. Record the chromatogram and identify the thiosulfate peak
based on retention time and/or spectral characteristics.
3. Quantify the thiosulfate concentration by comparing the sample
peak area to the calibration curve.
4. Repeat injections for reproducibility, analyzing each sample in
duplicate or triplicate.
D. Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and
end of each analytical batch.
2. Verify that QC results fall within acceptable limits. If QC results
are out of range, troubleshoot and rectify issues before
proceeding with sample analysis.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Calculate the concentration of thiosulfate in the original urine
sample accounting for any dilution factors.
2. For 24-hour urine collection, calculate the total thiosulfate
excretion by multiplying the concentration by the total urine
volume.
3. Record and review results for accuracy.
4. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
including any necessary comments or flags.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to instrument and reagent
manufacturer instructions for specific limitations related to the
detection of thiosulfate.
