STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
THIOTHIXENE (NAVANE) LEVELS IN SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for quantifying the concentration of
thiothixene (Navane) in serum specimens. It ensures accurate and
reproducible results consistent with laboratory quality standards and
CLIA certification requirements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to qualified laboratory personnel trained in the use
of the designated chromatographic equipment and analytical
techniques for the measurement of thiothixene levels.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP meticulously to ensure accuracy and consistency. Deviations
from this procedure must be approved by a supervisor and
documented appropriately.
4. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
• QC: Quality Control
• SD: Standard Deviation
• CV: Coefficient of Variation
• RSD: Relative Standard Deviation
5. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols and guidelines for handling
biological specimens and hazardous materials.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Dispose of waste materials following the laboratory’s biological
and chemical waste disposal procedures.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Serum separated from a 5 mL blood sample collected
in a red-top or gold-top tube.
• Stability: Serum should be analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
If not analyzed immediately, store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or at
-20°C for longer storage.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
7. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• C18 HPLC column (length 150 mm, inner diameter 4.6 mm,
particle size 5 µm)
• Thiothixene reference standard
• Internal standard (IS) solution
• Mobile phase: Water:acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) with 0.1% formic acid
• Laboratory glassware
• Micropipettes and tips
• HPLC vials and caps
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage
8. REAGENTS
• Thiothixene standard solution
• Internal standard (IS) working solution
• Mobile phase: Water:acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) with 0.1% formic acid
• Control serum samples (including negative and positive QC)
9. CALIBRATION
• Calibrate the HPLC system using thiothixene standard solutions
at known concentrations before running patient samples. A
calibration curve should include at least five points spanning the
expected range of thiothixene concentrations in patient samples.
• Verify the integrity and precision of the calibration curve using
quality control specimens.
10. PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to thaw at room temperature if frozen.
◦ Vortex mix the serum sample and centrifuge at 1500 x g for
10 minutes to remove particulates.
◦ Transfer 500 µL of clear serum supernatant to a clean tube.
◦ Add 50 µL of internal standard solution to the serum sample
and mix thoroughly.
◦ Add 1.0 mL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins, then vortex
for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to an HPLC vial and cap
securely.
2. HPLC Analysis:
◦ Set the HPLC system parameters:
▪ Column temperature: 40°C
▪ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
▪ Injection volume: 20 µL
▪ Detection wavelength: 254 nm
◦ Run the blank, calibration standards, and control samples to
ensure system performance.
◦ Inject the prepared patient serum sample into the HPLC
system.
◦ Record chromatograms and peak areas for thiothixene and
the internal standard.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of thiothixene in patient samples
using the calibration curve.
◦ Include internal standard correction to ensure precise
quantification.
◦ Verify results using quality control checks and ensure they
fall within acceptable limits.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative and positive quality controls with each batch of
patient samples.
• The relative standard deviation (RSD) of replicate QC samples
must be ≤15% to confirm assay precision.
• If QC results fall outside the expected range, troubleshoot and
reanalyze samples as needed.
12. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report thiothixene serum levels in ng/mL.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by two qualified
technologists or a supervisor before final reporting.
• Document and communicate critical results immediately as per
laboratory protocol.
13. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interference from structurally similar compounds should be
evaluated and accounted for.
• Confirm specimen integrity to avoid reporting errors due to
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
14. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: Typically 1-20 ng/mL, depending on clinical
context and individual patient treatment plans.
• Toxic range: >30 ng/mL (consult clinical guidelines).
15. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's guidelines for HPLC equipment.
• Relevant published literature on thiothixene quantification in
serum.
16. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all calibration, quality control, patient result validations
in the laboratory information management system (LIMS).
