Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Thrombin-Antithrombin Complex (TAT)
1. PURPOSE: This procedure outlines the methodology for the
analysis of Thrombin-Antithrombin Complex (TAT) levels in plasma to
monitor coagulation status and related disorders.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to laboratory personnel trained in
the analysis of TAT using the designated immunoassay method.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the TAT analysis according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the Senior Technologist to ensure that the
procedure is followed, results are accurate, and quality control
measures are maintained.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Accepted Specimens:
• 3 mL of citrated plasma collected in a blue top tube.
• The specimen must be centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at
4°C within 30 minutes of collection to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate anticoagulants.
• Specimens that have not been centrifuged properly.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
Equipment:
• Centrifuge (refrigerated)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Microtiter plates
• Incubator (37°C)
• Laboratory Timer
Reagents:
• Thrombin-Antithrombin Complex Detection Kit (Store as per
manufacturer’s instructions)
• Calibration standards and controls (provided with the kit)
• Washing buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
6. QUALITY CONTROL: a) Run appropriate controls:
• Include a high, low, and medium control with each batch of tests.
• Control results should be within the manufacturer's specified
ranges. b) Document and evaluate results:
• Record the results of the control samples.
• If control results are outside the acceptable range, the test run is
considered invalid, and the issue must be resolved before re-
analyzing patient samples.
7. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature prior to
testing.
2. Label each microtiter plate well according to the plate layout.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette 100 µL of the standards, controls, and plasma samples
into the designated wells.
◦ Ensure that each sample and control is tested in duplicate.
2. Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
3. Incubate the plate for 2 hours at 37°C.
4. Wash the plate 4 times with washing buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
7. Wash the plate 4 times with washing buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate for 15-20 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
Measurement:
1. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Calculate the TAT concentration of each sample by interpolating
the absorbance values from the calibration curve.
8. CALCULATION AND REPORTING RESULTS:
• Generate a standard curve using the calibration standards
provided in the kit.
• Calculate the TAT concentrations of the patient samples by
reference to the standard curve.
• Report the results in μg/L.
9. RESULTS VALIDATION:
• Verify that all controls fall within the acceptable range.
• Confirm that all calibration curves comply with the expected
linearity.
• If results fall outside the reference range or are incompatible with
clinical expectations, re-evaluation or re-testing of the sample
may be warranted.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference ranges for TAT levels should be established based on
the population served by the laboratory or refer to kit-specific
normal ranges provided by the manufacturer.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure that pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical variables
are controlled to prevent erroneous results.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens can affect assay results.
12. REFERENCES:
• Thrombin-Antithrombin Complex Detection Kit Insert.
• Current CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute)
guidelines for immunoassays.
13. DOCUMENTATION:
• Document all results including patient results, control data, and
any repeat tests performed.
• Maintain records of calibration and quality control data.
14. REVIEW AND REVISION: This SOP is to be reviewed annually
or as needed to accommodate new technologies, methods, and
procedures. Approved revisions are to be documented and
communicated promptly to all appropriate personnel.
