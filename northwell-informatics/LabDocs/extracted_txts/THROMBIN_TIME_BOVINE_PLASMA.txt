Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for performing and reporting Thrombin Time (TT) using bovine
thrombin in plasma. The procedure ensures accurate and precise
determination of TT to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of various
hemostatic disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
and document the Thrombin Time test accurately.
• Supervisors and laboratory managers are responsible for
ensuring all staff are properly trained and that the procedures are
followed consistently.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Sample:
• Freshly collected, citrated plasma (light blue-top tube containing
0.109M sodium citrate).
• Mix immediately by gentle inversion 8-10 times to ensure proper
anticoagulation.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Clotted or hemolyzed samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulants other than sodium citrate.
• Samples with improper fill volume.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• Plasma thawing device or water bath (maintained at 37°C)
• Thrombin Time reagent (bovine thrombin)
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL Top or equivalent)
• Test tubes, micropipettes, and tips
• Timer
• Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) control
• Calibrated pipettes and volumetric flasks
5. REAGENT PREPARATION AND
STORAGE
• Thrombin Time reagent should be prepared according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Store reagents as per the manufacturer's guidelines, typically at
2-8°C.
• Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly at 37°C using a plasma
thawing device or water bath. Do not exceed thawing time
recommendations to avoid degradation of coagulation factors.
6. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration using the standard calibration curves provided
by the thrombin reagent manufacturer.
• Run quality control samples (normal and abnormal controls) at the
beginning of each shift or as per laboratory protocol. Document
these controls to ensure the analyzer is functioning correctly.
Testing Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge citrated blood samples at 1500-2000 x g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP).
◦ Transfer supernatant PPP to a clean polypropylene tube
using a pipette. Avoid disturbing the buffy coat.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Reconstitute the bovine thrombin reagent as per
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Pre-warm the reagent to 37°C before use.
3. Analyzing the Specimen:
◦ Pre-warm the plasma sample(s) and control(s) to 37°C for at
least 5 minutes before testing.
◦ Pipette 200 µL of pre-warmed PPP into a pre-warmed test
cuvette or tube.
◦ Add 100 µL of pre-warmed thrombin reagent to the plasma
sample.
◦ Start the timer simultaneously with the addition of thrombin
reagent.
4. Recording and Analyzing Results:
◦ Measure the time taken for clot formation using the
coagulation analyzer or timer.
◦ Record the clotting time in seconds.
Quality Control:
• Ensure quality control results fall within the established range
before reporting patient results.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the system, and
repeat QC. Do not proceed with patient specimen analysis until
acceptable QC results are obtained.
Interpretation of Results:
• Normal Reference Range: Typically 14-18 seconds; refer to
specific reference ranges provided with each lot of reagent.
• Document any unexpected results and perform repeat testing if
necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in seconds to the nearest tenth of a second.
• Compare patient results to reference values and flag any
abnormal results.
• Verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) before
final reporting.
8. PROCEDURAL LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia in samples may interfere with test
results.
• Proper specimen collection and handling are critical for accurate
results.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
manufacturer guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Thrombin Time reagent.
• CLSI guidelines for coagulation testing.
• Internal laboratory quality control and procedural documentation.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all temperatures, reagent lot numbers, control results, and
any deviations in the appropriate logs.
• Ensure all patient and QC results are documented accurately in
the LIS.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the analyzer and reagent package insert for specific
troubleshooting steps.
• Consult the supervisor or designated technical lead for assistance
with persistent issues.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent, reliable,
and accurate Thrombin Time results for patient care and diagnostic
purposes.
