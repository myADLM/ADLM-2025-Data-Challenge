Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Thrombin Time, Plasma
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for measuring
Thrombin Time (TT) in plasma samples to evaluate the conversion of
fibrinogen to fibrin during the blood coagulation process. Proper and
consistent adherence to this protocol ensures the accuracy and
reliability of the results.
1. Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing TT
assays to follow the procedures outlined in this SOP. It is also the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all personnel
are adequately trained and comply with this SOP.
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Platelet-poor plasma prepared from venous blood collected in
a 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant tube (blue top vacutainer).
◦ The ratio of blood to anticoagulant must be 9:1.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted samples.
◦ Samples not properly labeled with patient information,
collection date, and time.
1. Specimen Handling:
• After blood collection, invert the tube gently 4-5 times to ensure
proper mixing of the blood with the anticoagulant.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 g for 15 minutes to obtain
platelet-poor plasma.
• Aliquot the plasma into properly labeled plastic tubes.
• Plasma specimen should be tested within 4 hours if kept at room
temperature (15-25°C), or within 24 hours if frozen at -20°C.
1. Equipment and Reagents:
• Thrombin reagent.
• Coagulation analyzer.
• Pipettes and tips.
• 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant tubes.
• Centrifuge.
• Timer.
• Disposable plastic tubes.
• Calibrated traceable thermometer.
1. Procedure:
6.1. Preparation of Reagents:
• Reconstitute the thrombin reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure the reagent is brought to the temperature specified by the
manufacturer (usually 37°C).
6.2. Calibration/Quality Control:
• Perform calibration and quality control procedures as per the
coagulation analyzer’s manufacturer instructions.
• Use normal and abnormal control plasma to ensure accuracy and
precision of the test.
6.3. Thrombin Time Test Procedure:
1. Pre-Analytical:
◦ Ensure the plasma sample is at room temperature.
◦ Mix the plasma gently without causing hemolysis.
2. Analytical:
◦ Step 1: Pre-warm the coagulation analyzer to 37°C.
◦ Step 2: Pipette and dispense 100 µL of plasma into a test
cuvette.
◦ Step 3: Pre-warm the plasma in the test cuvette for 2
minutes.
◦ Step 4: Add 100 µL of thrombin reagent pre-warmed to
37°C.
◦ Step 5: Start the timer or analyzer.
◦ Step 6: Record the time it takes for the plasma to clot; this
is the thrombin time.
3. Troubleshooting:
• If the result is unusually prolonged or abbreviated, recheck the
sample for clotting, hemolysis, and proper preparation.
• Ensure the reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored and handled correctly.
1. Reporting Results:
• Report the Thrombin Time in seconds.
• Compare patient results with established reference intervals.
• Document results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System) and
confirm that the values are within expected ranges before
reporting.
1. Reference Intervals:
• Normal Thrombin Time for platelet-poor plasma: typically 14-21
seconds (range may vary based on reagent).
1. Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples before analyzing patient samples.
• Ensure QCs are within the acceptable range; otherwise, do not
proceed with patient testing and troubleshoot the system.
1. Maintenance:
• Follow the analyzer’s maintenance manual for routine
maintenance and troubleshooting.

reagent.
