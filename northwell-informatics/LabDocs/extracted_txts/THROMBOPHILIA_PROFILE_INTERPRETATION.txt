SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Thrombophilia
Profile Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase in
generating results for thrombophilia profile interpretation. This
ensures the accuracy, precision, reproducibility, and traceability of all
analysis related to thrombophilia.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• EDTA plasma
• Citrate plasma
• Freshly collected within 4 hours of analysis.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens collected over 6 hours prior to analysis.
• Specimens with clotted plasma.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
• Samples that were not stored at the correct temperature (between
2-8°C if delayed).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer specific to thrombophilia testing (e.g., ACL
TOP, Stago STA, etc.)
• Reagents for assays (such as Protein C, Protein S, Antithrombin,
etc.)
• Control materials (perform at least two levels of control daily).
• Calibrators and standards.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge for plasma separation.
• Gloves and PPE.
• Specimen racks.
4. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation and Setup:
1. Verify that all equipment is calibrated and within the acceptable
calibration date.
2. Ensure all reagents and controls are stored properly, checked
for expiry, and brought to room temperature before use.
3. Daily perform and document start-up procedures as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Run and document quality control results for all assays prior to
initiating patient sample testing.
Thrombophilia Assay Procedure:
Antithrombin Activity Assay:
1. Centrifuge incoming specimens for plasma separation at 1500g
for 15 min.
2. Transfer the plasma to a secondary labeled tube.
3. Load specimens, controls, and reagents onto the coagulation
analyzer.
4. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for setting up and
running the antithrombin activity assay.
5. Document temperature and time of loading.
Protein C Activity Assay:
1. Follow steps for specimen preparation as above.
2. Load relevant reagents for Protein C assay onto the analyzer.
3. Define and initiate the test following manufacturer’s protocols.
4. Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Protein S Activity Assay:
1. Follow standardized preparation steps.
2. Employ appropriate reagents for the Protein S assay.
3. Execute Protein S assays according to analyzer specifications.
4. Verify results and preliminary interpretation.
Factor V Leiden Mutation Assay:
1. Extract genomic DNA using standardized protocols.
2. Perform real-time PCR or relevant molecular assay as per kit
instructions.
3. Note: Positive and negative controls must always be included
and recorded.
4. Analyze data and document findings in LIS.
Factor II Mutation Assay:
1. Extract DNA similarly as specified in the Factor V Leiden
Mutation Assay.
2. Conduct the prothrombin G20210A mutation analysis using
PCR.
3. Examine control consistency before accepting patient results.
4. Enter results and preliminary interpretation into LIS.
Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) Testing:
1. Run screening and confirmatory tests for LA as per ISTH
guidelines.
2. Utilize appropriate reagents and confirm normal control values.
3. Record any prolongations or corrections in the screen or mixing
phases.
4. Ensure all results are interpreted in the context of clinical and
other laboratory findings.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality controls should be run at least daily and with every new
reagent batch.
2. Document all control results in the QC log.
3. Investigate any deviations from expected control ranges,
resolve before proceeding with patient samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist overseeing the
process.
2. Interpret results based on predefined criteria and in accordance
with established reference ranges.
3. Document any critical values and refer to specific reporting
protocols.
4. Notify the responsible physician immediately for any results
requiring urgent attention.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with some
assays.
2. Inaccurate results may occur if samples are not correctly
handled or tested within the recommended timeframe.
3. Verify each assay’s specific limitations as noted by the
manufacturer’s instructions.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for each assay and equipment used.
• ISTH guidelines for Lupus Anticoagulant testing (latest available).
• Published literature on standard methodologies for thrombophilia
profile analysis.
9. REFERENCES: Provide references to the methodologies,
guidelines, and scientific literature followed within this SOP.

END OF SOP
All procedures should follow the latest standard practices and be
updated when new guidelines are released. Proper training and
competency must be ensured for all laboratory staff involved in
thrombophilia testing.
