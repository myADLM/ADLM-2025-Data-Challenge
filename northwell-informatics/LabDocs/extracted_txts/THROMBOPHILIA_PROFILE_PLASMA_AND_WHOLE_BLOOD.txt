Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thrombophilia Profile, Plasma and Whole
Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedures for the analysis
and reporting of the Thrombophilia Profile in both plasma and whole
blood specimens. This includes detailed guidelines on specimen
preparation, equipment calibration, assay procedures, quality control,
and result reporting.
Responsibilities:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform tests as outlined in this SOP.
• All laboratory personnel involved in the testing must fully comply
with this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to testing
protocols and resolving any issues that may arise during the
analytical phase.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Plasma: Citrated (3.2% sodium citrate) plasma collected in blue-
top tubes.
• Whole Blood: EDTA blood collected in purple-top tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• Plasma: At least 2 mL of plasma is required.
• Whole Blood: At least 5 mL of whole blood is needed.
Stability:
• Plasma specimens must be centrifuged and separated from cells
within 1 hour of collection.
• Plasma must be stored at -20°C or lower if analysis is not
performed within 4 hours.
• Whole Blood specimens must be kept at 4°C and tested within 24
hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Hemolyzed or clotted specimens.
• Specimen volume not meeting the above requirements.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without a collection date/time.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer (such as Stago STA-R Max or equivalent)
• Centrifuge capable of reaching 2500 x g
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
• Refrigerated storage facilities
Reagents:
• Thrombophilia Profile Assay Kits (appropriate kits depending on
specific factors being tested)
• Control materials for quality assurance
• Normal saline, buffer solutions, and other specific reagents as
required by the assay kits
Storage and Handling:
• All reagents should be stored and handled according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Handle control materials and patient samples with caution,
adhering to standard laboratory safety protocols.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge citrated plasma specimens at 2500 x g for 15
minutes.
2. Separate the plasma immediately and transfer to a labeled
cryovial.
3. For whole blood, ensure the specimen is mixed gently by
inversion before testing.
B. Equipment Calibration and Maintenance:
1. Perform daily calibration of the coagulation analyzer as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Record all calibration activities in the equipment logbook.
3. Ensure the instrument is within operational limits before
performing tests.
C. Assay Procedure:
Thrombophilia Profile (e.g., Protein C, Protein S, Antithrombin,
Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A):
1. Preparation: a. Thaw plasma specimens at 37°C in a water
bath with gentle mixing. b. Set up the coagulation analyzer
according to the specific assay procedure.
2. Assay Steps: a. Load appropriate assay reagents and controls
onto the analyzer. b. Pipette required volume of plasma into the
assay wells as directed by the kit instructions. c. Initiate the
assay run on the coagulation analyzer.
3. Control Material: a. Include appropriate quality control
samples with each assay run. b. Verify control results are within
acceptable range before releasing patient results.
4. Result Interpretation: a. Analyze assay results as per
reference ranges provided by the reagent manufacturer. b. Any
results outside the reference range should be verified by
repeating the assay using the backup sample.
5. Documentation: a. Record results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). b. Document any deviations or repeat
testing in the logbook.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze three levels of quality control material (low, normal, high)
for each batch of tests.
• Document QC results and take corrective action if any QC results
fall outside acceptable limits.
• Frequent review and validation of quality control data are
required.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure the
accuracy of laboratory results.
• Compare and document the external proficiency results with
internal results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification:
• Technologists must review results for accuracy and consistency
before releasing the results.
• Any result discrepancies should be followed up with repeat testing
or consultation with a supervisor.
• Results must be promptly entered into the LIS system for
reporting.
Critical Results:
• Any critical values or findings must be immediately communicated
to the ordering physician and documented in the patient’s
laboratory record.

8. DOCUMENT CONTROL
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required to accommodate
new methodologies or regulatory changes. All revisions will be
documented and approved by the Laboratory Director.
This SOP is designed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
Thrombophilia Profile results. All staff must adhere strictly to these
guidelines to maintain high standards of patient care and safety.
