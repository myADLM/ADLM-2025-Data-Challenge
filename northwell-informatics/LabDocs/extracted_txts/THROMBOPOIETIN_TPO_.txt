Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Thrombopoietin (TPO) Assays
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the specific protocol to be followed for the
analytical phase of thrombopoietin (TPO) assays. This includes the
preparation, operation, and maintenance of equipment, as well as the
processing and analysis of samples to ensure accurate and reliable
test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform TPO
assays following this procedure, document all activities, and report
any issues that may affect test results to the supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Serum or plasma specimens collected in appropriate
anticoagulant-free tubes or EDTA tubes.
◦ Specimens should be separated from the cells and stored at
-20°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
◦ Specimens kept at room temperature for more than 4 hours
before processing.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thrombopoietin (TPO) Assay Kit (e.g., ELISA kit specific for TPO)
• Microplate reader set to the appropriate wavelength (e.g., 450
nm)
• Precision pipettes and disposable tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Timer
• Refrigerator and freezer
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (22-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare the wash buffer, standard, and sample dilutions
according to the assay kit instructions.
3. Label all tubes and wells properly to ensure accurate tracking
and recording of samples.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Standard Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples and mix well.
◦ Prepare serial dilutions of the standards as per the kit
instructions.
◦ If necessary, dilute the samples to fall within the range of the
standards using the kit’s sample diluent.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add the appropriate amount of standards, controls, and
samples to the designated wells.
◦ Add the detection antibody to each well as specified.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at room temperature for the
time specified by the manufacturer.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as instructed, ensuring that each well is
washed thoroughly to remove unbound substances.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate the plate in
the dark as per the recommended time.
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the color reaction.
5. Reading and Analysis:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well on the microplate
reader at the appropriate wavelength.
◦ Calculate the concentration of TPO in the samples using the
calibration curve generated from the standards.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control (QC) samples (both high and low
concentration) along with patient samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range specified by
the kit manufacturer.
• If QC fails, do not report patient results and repeat the assay after
troubleshooting the issue.
6. DATA MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING
• Record all results, including the calibration curve, sample OD
readings, and calculated concentrations, in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before reporting.
Reference Range:
• The reference range for TPO concentration should be provided
with the assay kit and adjusted based on population-specific data.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the assay kit insert for common problems and solutions. If
issues persist, consult with the technical support provided by the kit
manufacturer.
