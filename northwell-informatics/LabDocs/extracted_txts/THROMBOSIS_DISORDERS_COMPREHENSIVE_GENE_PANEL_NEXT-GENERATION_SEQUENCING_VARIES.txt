Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Thrombosis Disorders, Comprehensive Gene Panel, Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedure for performing the
analytical phase of testing for the Thrombosis Disorders
Comprehensive Gene Panel using Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS). This procedure ensures that the sequencing and data
analysis are carried out accurately, efficiently, and reproducibly,
providing high-quality genetic analysis results.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform NGS-based testing in the laboratory. It covers the steps
from DNA extraction through data analysis, including sample
preparation, sequencing, and variant calling for the Thrombosis
Disorders Comprehensive Gene Panel.
3. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP and ensure that all analytical processes are conducted
according to the guidelines specified. The laboratory supervisor or
designated personnel must review and verify the results.

6. Procedures
6.1. DNA Extraction
1. Retrieve the specimen following the specimen accessioning
process.
2. Perform DNA extraction using the DNA Extraction Kit, following
the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of the DNA using a DNA
quantification instrument.
4. Record the concentration and purity values in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
6.2. Library Preparation
1. Fragment the purified DNA to the desired length using a
specific shearing method (e.g., sonication, enzymatic
digestion).
2. Perform end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation steps
according to the Library Preparation Kit instructions.
3. Purify the ligated products using magnetic beads.
4. PCR amplify the purified ligation products.
5. Perform a final purification of the PCR products.
6.3. Library Quantification and Quality Control
1. Quantify the prepared DNA libraries using a suitable
quantification method (e.g., Qubit, qPCR).
2. Assess the library quality by running a small aliquot on a
bioanalyzer.
3. Pool libraries at equimolar ratios for sequencing.
6.4. Sequencing
1. Load the pooled libraries onto the sequencing instrument
following the manufacturer's protocols.
2. Initiate the sequencing run, entering relevant run details into the
instrument’s interface.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality metrics.
6.5. Data Analysis
1. Raw sequence data (FASTQ files) will be generated by the
sequencing instrument.
2. Align the sequence reads to the human reference genome
(e.g., hg19, hg38) using a suitable alignment tool (e.g., BWA,
Bowtie).
3. Perform variant calling using a variant caller software (e.g.,
GATK, FreeBayes).
4. Annotate the identified variants using a variant annotation tool
(e.g., ANNOVAR, SnpEff).
5. Filter and prioritize variants based on clinical relevance and
pathogenicity evidence.
6.6. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the identified variants in the context of clinical
significance and relevance to thrombosis disorders.
2. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the identified
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain
significance.
3. Include information on each variant’s associated gene, zygosity,
and interpretation.
4. Ensure that the report undergoes a final review by a qualified
geneticist or laboratory director.
7. Quality Control
1. Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintained as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Use appropriate positive and negative controls in each
sequencing run.
3. Perform inter-run and intra-run quality checks to ensure
consistency.
4. Review and document any deviations or issues encountered
during the process.
8. Documentation and Record Keeping
1. Maintain all records of DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing runs, and data analysis.
2. Ensure that all reports are stored securely and are accessible
to authorized personnel only.
3. Document all quality control measures, including the results of
control samples and instrument performance checks.

10. Review and Approval
This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Director
and updated annually or as needed to reflect changes in technology
or laboratory practices.
