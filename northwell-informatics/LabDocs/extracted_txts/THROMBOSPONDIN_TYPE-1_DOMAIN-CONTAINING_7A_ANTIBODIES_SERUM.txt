Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Thrombospondin
Type-1 Domain-Containing 7A Antibodies, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and reliable analysis
of Thrombospondin Type-1 Domain-Containing 7A (THSD7A)
antibodies in serum samples using the designated assay method.
This procedure includes steps for reagent preparation, specimen
processing, performing the assay, and reporting results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to follow this procedure accurately. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure all procedures are followed correctly
and that quality control (QC) measures are maintained.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• The serum specimen should be centrifuged and separated from
the clot within 2 hours of collection.
• The sample should be stored and transported at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 72 hours. For long-term storage, serum should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples which may interfere with
the assay results.
• Specimens that are not processed within the specified time frame.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• THSD7A Antibody ELISA Kit (or equivalent)
• Microplate reader with a 450 nm filter and 570 nm reference filter
• Micropipettes and sterile tips (10 µL-1000 µL)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Plate washer
• Deionized water
• Timer
• Calibrated microtiter plate
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare washing buffer, substrate, and stop solution according
to the kit insert.
3. Follow the specific ELISA kit instructions for reconstituting and
diluting standard controls.
Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microtiter plate wells with patient sample identifiers.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples to
appropriate wells.
3. Securely cover the plate with an adhesive cover and incubate
for 1 hour at 37°C.
4. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of the prepared washing
buffer per well. Ensure no residual liquid remains by inverting
the plate and tapping it on absorbent paper or cloth.
5. Add 100 µL of anti-human IgG conjugate to each well. Cover
the plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Wash the plate 3 times as detailed in step 4.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.
8. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well and gently tap the plate
to mix the contents thoroughly.
9. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes.
Recording and Calculations:
1. Obtain the absorbance values from the microplate reader.
2. Plot the standard curve and determine the concentration of
THSD7A antibodies in patient samples based on their
absorbance values.
3. All results should be calculated according to the instructions in
the ELISA kit insert.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each set of tests to
ensure the integrity of the assay.
• A blank well (containing only substrate) should be included to
subtract background absorbance.
• Verify that the standard curve meets the expected range and
linearity.
• If QC results fall outside predetermined limits, investigate and
rectify any issues before proceeding with patient results.
• Document all QC activities and any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before being entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Critical values are to be reported to the requesting clinician
immediately.
1. REFERENCES
• Reference the ELISA kit manufacturer’s instructions for detailed
guidelines.
• CLSI document C24-A3—Statistical Quality Control for
Quantitative Measurement Procedures.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results may be influenced by improper sample collection,
handling, or storage.
• Lipemic, icteric, or hemolyzed samples may produce erroneous
results and should be avoided.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings
and other laboratory tests.
Approval and Revision History:
• This SOP is reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
ensure compliance with current standards and practices.
