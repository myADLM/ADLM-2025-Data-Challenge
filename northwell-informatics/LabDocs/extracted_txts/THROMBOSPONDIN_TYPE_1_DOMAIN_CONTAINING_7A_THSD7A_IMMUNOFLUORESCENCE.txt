THSD7A Immunofluorescence Analytical Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing immunofluorescence analysis
for THSD7A (Thrombospondin Type 1 Domain Containing 7A) in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results for patient diagnostics and research
purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory scientists are responsible for performing the
THSD7A immunofluorescence procedure, documenting results, and
ensuring all quality control measures are adhered to. The supervising
scientist is responsible for overseeing the process, troubleshooting
any issues, and validating the final results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections or appropriately frozen tissue sections (optimal for
cytoplasmic and membranous antigen detection).
• Specimen Handling: Sections must be cut at 4-5 micrometers
thickness. Ensure proper labeling and documentation for
traceability. Handle all specimens at room temperature unless
otherwise specified.
4. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Primary antibody for THSD7A.
• Secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent dye (e.g., Alexa
Fluor 488).
• Blocking buffer (e.g., 5% Bovine Serum Albumin in PBS).
• Mounting medium with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for
nuclear staining.
• Wash buffer (e.g., PBS with 0.1% Tween-20).
• Microscope slides and cover slips.
• Humidified chamber for incubation.
• Fluorescence microscope.
5. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE tissues.
• Fluorescence microscope for visualization.
• Incubation chamber with controlled temperature.
• Slide staining racks.
• Laboratory timer.
6. PROCEDURE
Section Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration (for FFPE sections):
◦ Place slides in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%, 50%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Apply appropriate antigen retrieval method (e.g., heat-
induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer pH 6.0 or Tris-
EDTA buffer pH 9.0) as per primary antibody data sheet.
Typically, heat sections in a microwave or pressure cooker
for 20 minutes at 95°C.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
Immunofluorescence Staining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate sections with blocking buffer in a humidified
chamber for 1 hour at room temperature to prevent non-
specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute primary antibody against THSD7A in appropriate
antibody dilution buffer.
◦ Incubate sections with diluted primary antibody overnight at
4°C in a humidified chamber.
3. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer (PBS-Tween) 3 times for 5
minutes each at room temperature.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent dye
in antibody dilution buffer.
◦ Incubate sections with diluted secondary antibody for 1 hour
at room temperature in a dark, humidified chamber to
protect from light.
5. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer (PBS-Tween) 3 times for 5
minutes each at room temperature.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain (Optional):
◦ Apply mounting medium containing DAPI to counterstain
nuclei (if required).
2. Mounting:
◦ Cover sections with cover slip and avoid air bubbles.
◦ Store slides in the dark at 4°C until ready for imaging.
7. IMAGING AND ANALYSIS
1. Microscopy:
◦ Examine stained sections using a fluorescence microscope
equipped with appropriate filters for the secondary antibody
and DAPI.
◦ Acquire representative images using image capture
software.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Evaluate staining patterns and intensity, noting cytoplasmic
and membranous localization of THSD7A.
◦ Record findings and images for further analysis and
reporting.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive Controls:
◦ Use known THSD7A-positive tissue sections to validate
staining protocol.
2. Negative Controls:
◦ Include sections incubated without primary antibody to
check for non-specific binding of secondary antibody.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and any
deviations from protocol.
◦ Monitor fluorescence intensity regularly to ensure
consistency.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record and document all observations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a supervising
scientist before releasing reports.
