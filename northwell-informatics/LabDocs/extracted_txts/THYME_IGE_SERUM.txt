Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for analyzing and generating
results for Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples. This
ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results for medical
diagnosis and treatment.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of serum samples for Total IgE
measurement using the specific immunoassay analyzer designated
for this purpose.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform sample analysis, quality
control, data entry, and verification of results.
• Supervisors: Oversee the analytical process, ensure compliance
with SOPs, and address any issues related to equipment,
reagents, or sample integrity.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Serum Separator Tube (SST) with clot activator
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Stability: Serum specimens should be separated from the clot
within 2 hours of collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours. For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer: Manufacturer's model (e.g., Siemens
ADVIA Centaur, Roche Cobas, etc.)
• Quality Control Material: Two levels (high and low) provided by
the manufacturer
• Calibration Standards: Provided by the manufacturer
• Reagents: Specific reagents for Total IgE analysis as supplied by
the manufacturer
• Additional Supplies: Micropipettes, disposable tips, gloves,
centrifuge, etc.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Pre-analytical Check:
◦ Verify that the sample is properly labeled and matches the
test requisition.
◦ Check for any signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or clots which
may interfere with the analysis.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the SST for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm.
◦ Ensure the serum is clear and free from particulates.
3. Aliquoting:
◦ Carefully transfer the serum into a labeled aliquot tube if
necessary.
◦ Store aliquoted samples at 2-8°C until analysis.
B) Analyzer Setup and Calibration
1. Switch on the immunoassay analyzer and allow the system to
perform self-diagnostic checks.
2. Load reagents, calibrators, and quality control materials into the
designated compartments of the analyzer.
3. Calibrate the analyzer using the calibration standards according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Ensure that the instrument records the calibration curve and
that it meets the acceptable criteria.
C) Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (high and low) at the beginning of
each shift and with each new reagent lot.
2. Verify that QC results fall within the acceptable range provided
by the manufacturer.
3. Document and review QC results. If out of range, troubleshoot,
and repeat the QC test. Do not proceed with patient samples
until QC is within range.
D) Sample Analysis
1. Load patient samples into the designated sample rack on the
analyzer.
2. Enter the sample identification numbers and test requests into
the system.
3. Initiate the analysis run.
4. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or warnings during
the run.
5. Ensure samples are processed sequentially and according to
the order entered.
E) Reviewing and Reporting Results
1. Once analysis is complete, review the results and confirm they
meet pre-determined criteria for acceptance.
2. If results are flagged or require further verification, repeat the
analysis, consult the supervisor, or use an alternate method for
confirmation.
3. Review results for consistency with clinical history and other
diagnostic information.
4. Enter and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
5. Report critical results immediately to the requesting clinician
following laboratory protocols.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Adhere to SOPs for maintenance, calibration, and troubleshooting
of analytical equipment.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as applicable.
• Engage in regular training and competency assessments for
laboratory personnel.
• Review and update SOPs as needed based on latest guidelines
and technological advancements.
