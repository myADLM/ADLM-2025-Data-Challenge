Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Thyroglobulin Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of Thyroglobulin
Antibody in serum samples to ensure accuracy and reliability of test
results.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory scientists (technologists) are responsible for
performing the test according to the outlined SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the adherence to SOPs
and handling any issues that may arise during the testing
process.
1. DEFINITION
Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb) is an autoantibody linked to
autoimmune thyroid conditions, including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and
Graves' disease.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Sample type: Serum.
• Preferred collection container: Serum separator tube (SST).
• Samples should be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus to be
considered acceptable for analysis.
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure all samples are properly labeled with a unique identifier.
2. Allow the serum sample to clot and then centrifuge it at 1500 x
g for 10 minutes to separate the serum from the clot.
3. Aliquot the serum into a secondary tube if necessary. Store at
2-8°C if analysis will be completed within 72 hours, or freeze at
-20°C or colder for longer storage.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Analyzer: Use a validated immunoassay analyzer such as the
Siemens Immulite 2000 or equivalent.
• Reagents: Thyroglobulin Antibody reagent kits provided by the
manufacturer, including calibrators and controls.
• Supplies: Pipettes, gloves, lab coats, and other personal
protective equipment (PPE).
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer using the manufacturer's
calibrators according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, after
a reagent change, and whenever there is an unexpected high
or low patient result, or after a major maintenance procedure.
3. Document all quality control activities and verify that control
results fall within acceptable ranges before proceeding with
sample testing.
D) Sample Analysis:
1. Program the immunoassay analyzer according to test-specific
instructions for Thyroglobulin Antibody.
2. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and quality
control material onto the analyzer.
3. Initiate the assay run as per the analyzer’s operating
instructions.
4. Ensure all steps are followed precisely to avoid any
discrepancies.
E) Data Review and Reporting Results:
1. Review the test results for quality control acceptability and
ensure all calibrator and control results are within the specified
range.
2. Verify the results of patient samples. Any flagged results or
those exceeding the limits of the assay must be repeated.
3. Report the final validated Thyroglobulin Antibody results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Include applicable reference intervals in the report:
◦ <20 IU/mL: Negative
◦ ≥20 IU/mL: Positive
F) Interpretation of Results:
1. < 20 IU/mL indicates a negative result for Thyroglobulin
Antibody.
2. ≥20 IU/mL indicates a positive result for Thyroglobulin Antibody,
which may suggest the presence of an autoimmune thyroid
condition.
3. Correlate results with clinical information and other thyroid
function test results.
G) Method Limitations:
Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for limitations related to
specific lot numbers and any interferences (e.g., rheumatoid factor).
