Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thyroglobulin Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standard procedure for the
technical component only of generating results for Thyroglobulin
Immunostain in patient tissue samples within a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
Responsibility:
The designated histotechnologist is responsible for accurately
executing the technical staining procedure. The supervisor must
ensure that reagents and equipment are properly maintained and that
quality controls for staining are met.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all tissue samples that require
Thyroglobulin Immunostain to ensure accurate and reproducible
staining results for diagnostic and research purposes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Formal-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or unstained
slides prepared from FFPE tissue. Specimens must be fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and processed within 24-48 hours of
collection. Unacceptable specimens: inadequately fixed tissue,
specimens with visible signs of degradation, or improperly labeled
samples.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
Primary Antibody: Anti-Thyroglobulin monoclonal antibody Secondary
Antibody: Link antibody conjugated to a detection enzyme (e.g.,
horseradish peroxidase) Detection Substrate: Chromogen (e.g.,
DAB) Positive Control: Known Thyroglobulin-positive tissue Negative
Control: Tissue processed with the omission of primary antibody
Equipment:
Microtome Water bath Slide warmer Staining jars or automated
staining machine Microscope
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation of Slides:
1. Section the FFPE tissue block at 4-5 microns using a
microtome.
2. Float the sections on a 40-45°C water bath and mount on
positively charged slides.
3. Dry the slides overnight at 37°C or for 2 hours at 60°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the slides by placing them in three changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate the slides through graded ethanol solutions (100%,
95%, 70%, and 50%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse the slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in a retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH
6.0) and heat in a microwave or pressure cooker according to
the laboratory protocol.
2. Allow the slides to cool at room temperature and rinse in
distilled water.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Place slides in a humid chamber and cover sections with a
blocking serum for 10 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
2. Incubate the slides with the primary anti-Thyroglobulin antibody
for the recommended duration (usually 30 minutes to 1 hour) at
room temperature or as specified by the antibody manufacturer.
3. Wash slides in PBS/TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20)
for 5 minutes, three times.
4. Apply the secondary antibody and incubate for the
recommended duration (usually 30 minutes).
5. Wash slides in PBS/TBST for 5 minutes, three times.
6. Apply chromogen solution and monitor the development of the
color reaction under a microscope for 5-15 minutes.
7. Rinse the slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water, then distilled water.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene.
4. Mount coverslips using a synthetic resin medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
A positive control (known Thyroglobulin-positive tissue) must be
included with each staining run. A negative control (omitting primary
antibody) must be included to check for non-specific staining.
Evaluate the control results before interpreting patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
Document the presence and intensity of staining, as well as the
pattern (e.g., cytoplasmic, membranous). Report findings to the
pathologist for further diagnostic interpretation.
