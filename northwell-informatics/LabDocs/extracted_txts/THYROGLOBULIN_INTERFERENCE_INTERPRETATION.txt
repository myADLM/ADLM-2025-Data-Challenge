TITLE: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Thyroglobulin and Interference Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This document details the standard operating procedures (SOP) for
the analytical phase of generating results for thyroglobulin (Tg)
testing and subsequent interpretation of potential interferences.
Thyroglobulin is used primarily as a tumor marker for patients with
differentiated thyroid cancer and for evaluating thyroid function. It is
essential to recognize and account for interferences that may affect
the accuracy of results.
Responsibility:
The protocol will be executed by trained clinical laboratory personnel
who are responsible for running the test, interpreting the results, and
taking corrective actions as necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Thyroglobulin is a glycoprotein produced by the thyroid gland,
detectable in serum, and is a critical marker for monitoring thyroid
cancer patients.
Common Interferences: - Heterophile antibodies - Human Anti-mouse
Antibodies (HAMA) - Autoantibodies against thyroglobulin - High
doses of biotin - Lipemia, hemolysis, and icterus
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirement and Handling
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube), red-top, or
yellow-top tubes.
◦ Plasma collected in EDTA (lavender-top) or heparinized
(green-top) tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens unless these issues
can be resolved.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants other
than EDTA or heparin.
Upon collection, invert the tubes gently 8-10 times (for plasma) to
ensure proper mixing with anticoagulants. Allow the serum tubes to
clot and centrifuge promptly for separation of serum. All specimens
should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed.
B. Reagent Preparation and Quality Control
• Reagent Storage:
◦ Store reagents at 2-8°C and bring to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
• Quality Control:
◦ Use appropriate quality control material (e.g., commercial
controls and pooled serum with low, medium, and high Tg
levels).
◦ Perform quality control checks at the beginning of each shift
and after every reagent lot change.
◦ Evaluate quality control data before releasing patient results.
Document actions taken for any out-of-range quality control
results.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure daily calibration and/or verification of analyzers
according to manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Check the expiration date and integrity of reagents and
control materials.
2. Running the Test:
◦ Load specimen, calibrators, and quality control samples on
the analyzer.
◦ Follow specific manufacturer instructions for setting up and
running the Tg assay.
3. Result Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Review results for each specimen and check for consistency
with quality control.
◦ Refer to these reference intervals for reporting:
▪ Normal: <1.0 - 55 ng/mL (variation may exist between
sexes and methods used)
▪ Abnormal: >55 ng/mL (high variability, context-specific)
D. Interference Interpretation
1. Heterophile Antibodies:
◦ Use heterophile antibody blocking reagents if clinically
significant interference is suspected.
◦ Confirm results using an alternative assay if interference
cannot be circumvented.
2. Humans Anti-mouse Antibodies (HAMA):
◦ Employ strategies to detect and neutralize HAMA effects,
e.g., using assays designed to minimize HAMA interference.
3. Autoantibodies against Thyroglobulin:
◦ If patient's clinical history suggests the presence of Tg
autoantibodies, consider additional testing or confirmatory
methods.
4. Other Interferences:
◦ Biotin: Recommend patient abstains from high biotin doses
48 hours before testing.
◦ Critical Results: Evaluate and repeat testing for abnormally
high or low results showing signs of hemolysis, icterus, or
lipemia.
E. Corrective Action
• If interferences are detected:
◦ Reanalyze the sample using heterophile blocking tubes (HBT)
or other mitigating solutions as appropriate.
◦ Consult with referring physicians for possible re-collection and
re-testing of patient specimens.
◦ Repeat testing with diluted samples or alternative assays to
verify speculative results.
◦ Notify the supervising technologist if persisting issues arise.
Document and communicate all steps taken during the
resolution process.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure that all procedures performed including test analysis, quality
control, troubleshooting, and corrective actions are appropriately
recorded in the laboratory information system (LIS) and on physical
logs as necessary.
