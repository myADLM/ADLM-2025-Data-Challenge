THYROGLOBULIN MASS SPECTROMETRY - SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps for the mass spectrometry analysis of
thyroglobulin in serum samples. The purpose of this procedure is to
provide accurate and reliable measurement of thyroglobulin for
clinical diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
procedures outlined herein. It is the duty of all staff to follow this SOP
and ensure the accurate execution of tasks to maintain quality
results.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain
tube.
• Specimens must be centrifuged and serum separated within 2
hours of collection.
• Store serum samples at -20°C if not analyzed within 48 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contain visible
particulates.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Mass spectrometer (e.g., LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips (free from contamination)
Reagents:
• Calibration standards for thyroglobulin
• Internal standards
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
• Sample preparation reagents (e.g., extraction buffer)
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• LC-MS compatible vials
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge serum separator tubes at 1,500 g for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
• Transfer the serum to clean microcentrifuge tubes.
• Vortex serum samples briefly.
• Prepare quality controls and calibration standards.
• Add internal standards to each serum sample.
Extraction Procedure:
• Add extraction buffer to the serum samples in microcentrifuge
tubes.
• Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
• Incubate samples at room temperature for 10 minutes.
• Centrifuge the samples at 12,000 g for 5 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant to LC-MS compatible vials.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis:
• Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
• Ensure proper calibration of the mass spectrometer with
thyroglobulin calibration standards.
• Load the samples into the LC-MS/MS.
• Run the samples using the established mass spectrometry
method for thyroid-related peptides.
• Perform data acquisition and analysis.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Analyze internal standards and quality control samples alongside
patient samples.
• QC materials should include low, medium, and high
concentrations of thyroglobulin.
• QC results must fall within the established acceptable range. If
QC fails, troubleshoot and repeat the analysis.
External QC:
• Participate in external quality assessment schemes periodically to
benchmark performance.
7. RECORDED DATA
• Document the date, time, and initials of the individual performing
the analysis.
• Maintain records of QC results, calibration standards, and sample
results.
• Store all raw data in the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Perform a validation check to ensure results accuracy.
• Enter any necessary comments based on sample integrity or QC
performance.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are stored properly to prevent degradation.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or particulate-laden samples are not suitable
for analysis.
• Accuracy may be affected by instrument maintenance and
calibration integrity.
