Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
THYROGLOBULIN, TUMOR MARKER, FINE-NEEDLE
ASPIRATION BIOPSY NEEDLE WASH
1. PURPOSE To ensure standardized and accurate measurement of
Thyroglobulin levels in fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) needle
washes for the assessment of thyroid nodules. This SOP outlines the
procedures for the preparation, processing, analysis, and reporting of
Thyroglobulin as a tumor marker in FNA needle washes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
staff to adhere to this protocol, ensuring accurate and consistent
results. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for monitoring
adherence to this SOP and addressing any deviations.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy Needle Wash
◦ Collect material from thyroid nodules using a fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) biopsy needle.
◦ The needle should be washed with a 5 mL saline or phosphate
buffer solution (PBS).
◦ Transfer the needle wash solution into a sterile tube.
• Storage:
◦ If analysis is not immediate, store the specimen at 2-8°C for
up to 24 hours. For long-term storage, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Sterile tubes
• Saline or Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS)
• Pipettes and tips
• Immunoassay analyzer compatible with Thyroglobulin testing
• Thyroglobulin reagent kit (validated for use with fine-needle
aspiration biopsy needle washes)
• Quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Preparation
1. Verify that centrifuge tubes and pipettes are appropriately
labeled.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate any cellular material from the needle wash solution.
3. Carefully pipette the supernatant into a new sterile tube,
avoiding any cellular debris.
B. Analysis
1. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer and ensure it is calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
2. Load the thyroglobulin reagent kit and quality control materials
onto the analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer with the necessary details for
thyroglobulin testing in FNA biopsy needle washes.
4. Load the prepared sample into the designated position on the
analyzer.
5. Initiate the analysis run according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for thyroglobulin quantification.
◦ Ensure the assay incubation times and temperatures are
meticulously followed, as specified by the reagent
manufacturer.
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) at the
beginning of each shift, with each new reagent lot, and
following any significant maintenance or calibration of the
analyzer.
2. Document the results of quality control materials.
3. If the control results are out of the acceptable range,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s guidelines before
proceeding with patient samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify the results generated by the analyzer against the quality
control data and ensure they fall within the expected ranges.
2. Report thyroglobulin levels in ng/mL.
3. Document any deviations or errors encountered during the
procedure and notify the laboratory supervisor.
4. Record and upload results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review and verification by the technologist.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Maintain records of all calibrations, controls, and specimen data.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs regularly.
• Continually review and update this SOP to meet regulatory
guidelines and technological advancements.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions and Recommendations for
Thyroglobulin Reagent Kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) documentation.
By adhering strictly to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the
accurate and reliable measurement of thyroglobulin levels in FNA
needle washes, thereby contributing to the effective evaluation of
thyroid nodules.
