Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Thyroglobulin, Tumor Marker Reflex, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
analytical process for the measurement of Thyroglobulin (Tg), a
tumor marker in serum samples. This SOP provides guidelines
to ensure accurate and reliable results to assist in the diagnosis
and monitoring of thyroid cancer.
2. DEFINITION Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a protein produced by the
thyroid gland and serves as a tumor marker for certain types of
thyroid cancer. This SOP applies to all serum samples received
in the laboratory for Tg analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Red top tube or serum separator tube
(SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL serum
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 6 months
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples; specimens received in heparinized tubes or other
anticoagulants.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thyroglobulin assay kits (validated by the laboratory)
• Calibrators and controls (high, medium, low)
• Automated or manual immunoassay analyzer compatible with Tg
assay
• Micro-pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory timer
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Upon receipt, check the specimen for proper labeling,
integrity, and volume.
◦ Centrifuge the received serum sample at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate the serum from cellular components.
◦ Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled sample tube if not
using SST.
2. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store the serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the assay reagents, calibrators, and controls
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
and mix thoroughly before use.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer with the provided
calibrators, following the assay kit instructions.
◦ Run quality control materials (high, medium, low) at the
beginning of each batch, at least once per day, and after any
assay interruption.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load the prepared reagents, calibrators, controls, and
patient serum samples onto the immunoassay analyzer,
ensuring proper placement.
◦ Follow the instrument and reagent kit instructions for
programming the assay and initiating the run.
◦ The analyzer will automatically process the samples and
generate results.
4. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Review the assay results for each sample. Ensure that
control results are within the acceptable range before
validating patient results.
◦ Report thyroglobulin concentrations in nanograms per
milliliter (ng/mL).
◦ For reflex testing, apply the specific criteria outlined in
laboratory protocols to determine if additional tests are
warranted.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and reviewed by the technologist.
• Ensure that the results are correctly entered and proper
comments are included for any deviations observed during
analysis.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
• Regularly review and document maintenance and calibration
activities for the immunoassay analyzer.
• Participate in external proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons as available.
• Maintain records of all reagent lot number validations and quality
control results.

By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accuracy and
reliability of thyroglobulin measurements, providing critical
information for patient diagnosis and monitoring.
