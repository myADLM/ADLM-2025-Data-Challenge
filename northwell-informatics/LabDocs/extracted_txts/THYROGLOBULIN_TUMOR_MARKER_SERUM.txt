THYROGLOBULIN, TUMOR MARKER, SERUM - Standard
Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Thyroglobulin as a tumor
marker in serum samples. This SOP ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable test results for the diagnosis and management of thyroid
cancer.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure to ensure accurate testing and reporting of Thyroglobulin
levels in serum samples.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Serum separation tube (SST) or plain red-
top tube.
• Preferred Volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
• Storage and Stability:
◦ Clotted specimen can be stored at room temperature for up to
8 hours.
◦ If not analyzed within 8 hours, serum should be separated and
stored at 2-8°C up to 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze aliquots at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter, etc.)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagent kit specific for Thyroglobulin (including calibrators,
controls, and reaction vessels/cuvettes)
• Quality control materials (commercially prepared low, medium,
and high control sera)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the blood specimen to clot at room temperature for 15-30
minutes.
2. Centrifuge the clotted specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
3. Transfer the serum aliquot into a clean, labeled sample tube.
B. Instrument Setup:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to power on the
immunoassay analyzer and check for any maintenance needs.
2. Ensure that Thyroglobulin reagent kits, calibrators, and quality
control materials are at the correct temperature as specified by
the manufacturer.
3. Load the reagent pack, calibrators, controls, and serum
samples onto the analyzer.
C. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration using the provided calibrators as instructed
by the manufacturer.
2. Record all calibration data and verify that the calibration curve
is within acceptable limits.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run low, medium, and high-quality controls before patient
samples to ensure assay accuracy.
2. Verify that quality control results fall within the predefined
acceptable range. If QC results are out-of-range, troubleshoot
and rectify the problem before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
3. Document QC results and any actions taken for out-of-range
controls.
E. Patient Sample Analysis:
1. Load the serum samples into the sample racks of the analyzer.
2. Select the Thyroglobulin test on the analyzer software and start
the run.
3. Ensure the analyzer correctly identifies and processes each
sample.
4. Allow the analyzer to perform the assay according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
5. After completion, review the raw data and ensure there are no
flags indicating potential issues.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted from the analyzer to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results in the LIS before final reporting.
• Report results in ng/mL.
• Apply any necessary comments or interpretations based on
clinical inputs if required.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for Thyroglobulin will be provided in the
reagent kit insert. Verify and record the reference ranges as per
the kit used.
• Typically, Thyroglobulin levels are considered:
◦ Normal: < 10 ng/mL
◦ Post-thyroidectomy (cancer management): <1-2 ng/mL
◦ Elevated levels may indicate residual or recurrent thyroid
tissue/tumor.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can influence the results. Visual
inspection and sample rejection criteria must be adhered to.
• Heterophile antibodies can cause interference; use heterophile
antibody blocking tubes if necessary.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If an error or unexpected result occurs, refer to the analyzer
manufacturer's instructions for troubleshooting.
• Document all errors, corrective actions taken, and outcome.
