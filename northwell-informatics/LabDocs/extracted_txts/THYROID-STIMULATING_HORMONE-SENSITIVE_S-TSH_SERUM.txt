Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generation
of Results for Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone-Sensitive (S-TSH) in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone-
Sensitive (S-TSH) in serum. The intended use of this SOP is to
ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure accurately and to ensure that appropriate corrective
actions are taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum
Preferred Collection Container:
• Red-top tube (no additive) or serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum: 1 mL of serum
• Acceptable: 0.5 mL of serum with caution of limited repeat testing.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 48 hours.
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): Stable for up to 3 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Icteric or lipemic samples
• Specimens with inappropriate handling or storage conditions
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Instruments: Automated immunoassay analyzer specific for
S-TSH measurement
Required Reagents: Immunoassay reagents specific for S-TSH
Required Supplies:
• Calibrators
• Quality controls (2 levels: Normal and Abnormal)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sample cups or tubes for the analyzer
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Check:
• Verify specimen integrity. Reject any unacceptable specimens.
• Centrifuge specimens that have been collected in SST after clot
formation (usually at 1500 x g for 10 minutes).
Analyzer Preparation:
• Power on the immunoassay analyzer and ensure it is in a ready
state.
• Perform any startup maintenance as recommended by the
manufacturer.
• Load appropriate S-TSH reagents, calibrators, and quality control
materials into the analyzer.
• Prime the analyzer and ensure that no error messages are
displayed.
Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the analyzer using S-TSH calibrators
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document calibration dates and results in the calibration log.
Quality Control:
• Run both levels of quality control (Normal and Abnormal) to
ensure the reliability of the test system.
• Record quality control results. Acceptable ranges for QC results
should be within ±2 SD of the target values provided by the
manufacturer.
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable ranges, take appropriate
corrective actions, such as recalibration, reagent replacement, or
repeating the assay.
Sample Analysis:
• Load the serum specimens onto the sample tray of the analyzer.
• Enter or scan sample identifiers into the analyzer as per
laboratory information system (LIS) protocol.
• Start the analysis by selecting appropriate assay protocol for S-
TSH measurement.
• Ensure sample cups or tubes are correctly positioned in the
analyzer.
Result Verification:
• Upon completion of test run, review results generated by the
analyzer.
• Verify that all results meet established quality criteria.
• Compare analytical results to established reference ranges:
◦ Reference Interval: 0.4 - 4.0 μIU/mL
• Assess and document any flagged results, and take necessary
actions such as repeat testing or additional sample collection if
required.
Post-Analytical Processing:
• Transmit verified results to the LIS.
• Store tested specimens at 2-8°C for up to 3 days in case of repeat
analysis.
• Document all maintenance and assay actions in the laboratory
records.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. Critical or significantly
abnormal results should be communicated promptly to the clinician or
requesting department as per established protocols.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Document and review all quality control and assurance activities as
part of continuous monitoring to maintain consistency in the
laboratory’s performance and ensure compliance with CLIA and other
relevant standards.

Manufacturer’s assay kit inserts and operator’s manuals for specific
details on the analyzer and reagents used.
1. REVISION AND DOCUMENTATION
This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly or when there
are changes in the procedure, equipment, or regulatory
requirements.
