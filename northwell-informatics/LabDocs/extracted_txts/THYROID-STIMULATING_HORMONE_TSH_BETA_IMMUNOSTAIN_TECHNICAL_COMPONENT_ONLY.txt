Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH),
Beta Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing Thyroid-Stimulating
Hormone (TSH) using Beta Immunostain solely for the technical
component. This ensures accurate and reliable results for the
diagnosis and monitoring of thyroid function.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing the analytical procedure as outlined. Any
deviations or deficiencies observed during the process must be
reported to a supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or lithium
heparin plasma tube.
• Specimen Volume: 1 mL minimum.
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
• Centrifuge the specimen within 2 hours of collection at 3,000 RPM
for 10 minutes to separate serum or plasma.
• Aliquot and store separated serum or plasma at 2-8°C if analysis
is to be performed within 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze at
-20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Abbott Architect, Siemens Advia Centaur)
• TSH/Beta Immunostain reagent kit
• Quality control materials (two levels: normal and high)
• Calibrators as provided by the reagent kit manufacturer
• Micro pipettes and appropriate tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and freezer for specimen and reagent storage
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
A. EQUIPMENT SETUP AND PRE-ANALYSIS CHECKS
1. Daily Instrument Check:
◦ Ensure the analyzer is powered on and properly initialized
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Check and document the instrument temperature, pressure,
and any other necessary parameters.
◦ Verify that reagents, controls, and calibrators are within
expiration dates and stored at appropriate temperatures.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the instrument using the provided TSH/Beta
Immunostain calibrators.
◦ Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Document the calibration process, including lot numbers,
date, time, and operator initials.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run and document the results of normal and high-level
quality controls before patient specimens.
◦ Ensure controls fall within the established ranges;
investigate and document any outliers and corrective
actions taken.
B. ANALYSIS OF PATIENT SAMPLES
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load prepared serum or plasma samples onto the analyzer
as per the instrument’s loading protocol.
◦ Ensure samples are properly identified and positioned on
the sample carousel or rack.
2. Initiation of Assay:
◦ Select the appropriate assay parameters and ensure the
instrument is set to measure TSH/Beta Immunostain.
◦ Start the analysis process.
◦ Monitor the analyzer during the run for any error messages
or alerts, addressing them immediately.
3. Result Generation:
◦ Upon completion of the run, retrieve the results from the
analyzer.
◦ Review results for flags or errors and re-run samples if
needed.
◦ Document patient sample results immediately, including
date, time, and operator initials.
6. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Result Verification:
◦ Verify that all results fall within acceptable limits.
◦ Compare control results to historical data to ensure
consistency.
2. Electronic and Manual Recording:
◦ Record verified results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Maintain a manual log of results as a backup, noting any
discrepancies or unusual findings.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Instrument Errors:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for initial troubleshooting
steps.
◦ Contact technical support if the issue persists.
◦ Document any malfunctions and steps taken to correct them.
• Out-of-Control Results:
◦ Review QC data and run additional controls if needed.
◦ Recalibrate the instrument if consistent errors are observed or
control results are repeatedly out of range.
◦ Document all troubleshooting and corrective action in the
instrument log.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Participate in proficiency testing programs and document results.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
calibration curves.
• Perform periodic peer reviews and audits to ensure continuous
compliance with SOP and regulatory standards.
