Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Thyroid-Stimulating
Immunoglobulin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI) in
serum to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff trained to perform the
TSI assay and involved in processing, analyzing, and validating
patient serum samples for TSI.
1. DEFINITIONS
Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI): An autoantibody found in
Graves' disease that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid
hormone. Serum: The component of blood obtained after coagulation
and separation from cells, devoid of clotting factors.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure precisely. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
that staff are trained and competent in performing the TSI assay.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred specimen: 1-2 mL of serum.
• Acceptable specimen collection: Blood drawn into a serum
separator tube (SST) or a plain red-top tube.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION
• Once the blood sample is collected, allow it to clot at room
temperature (20-25°C) for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
• Transfer the serum into a properly labeled secondary tube.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if the analysis will be performed within
48 hours. For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• TSI reagents kit (e.g., manufacturer-specific, such as Elecsys
Anti-TSH Receptor (TRAb) Assay)
• Calibrators and controls (provided with the assay kit)
• Quality control material
• Analytical instrumentation (e.g., automated immunoassay
analyzer, specific to TSI assay)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Laboratory centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Secondary labeled tubes for serum samples
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the analyzer using the calibrators provided with the
assay kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning of each shift
or batch. Levels of QC material must include at least one low,
one medium, and one high concentration.
3. Record the QC results in the appropriate log and ensure they
fall within the established acceptable range.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Prepare the analyzer for sample analysis following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load the patient serum samples onto the analyzer. Ensure the
samples are correctly labeled and matched with the assay
worksheet.
3. As the samples are processed, verify that each sample's
identification matches and cross-check with the results
generated.
C. Interpretation and Validation of Results
1. Review results to ensure no flags or error messages are
present. Troubleshoot any issues as per manufacturer's
guidelines if flags or errors occur.
2. Validate the results per the laboratory's standard reporting
protocol. If results fall outside the reference range, verify the
proper analytical technique has been used and repeat the test if
necessary.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Document and report results as per the reference interval
provided with the assay kit.
• Notify the attending physician or responsible healthcare provider
immediately if results are critical.
Reference Intervals:
• Consult the specific assay kit insert or manufacturer’s guidelines
for reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's assay kit insert for limitations related
to interference, sample integrity, and other factors influencing TSI
measurement.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert for the TSI assay kit used.
• Laboratory standard operating procedures for equipment
maintenance and calibration.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Calibration and QC logs.
• Sample analysis worksheets.
• Result validation and reporting logs.

Note: Ensure that all laboratory personnel are trained and proficient
before performing the TSI assay. Regular updates and reviews of the
SOP should be conducted to maintain compliance with CLIA
standards and manufacturer's recommendations.
