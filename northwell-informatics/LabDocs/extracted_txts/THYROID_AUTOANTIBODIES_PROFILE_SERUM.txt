Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Thyroid
Autoantibodies Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and reporting of thyroid
autoantibodies profile in serum, ensuring accurate, consistent results
and maintaining the integrity of the testing process.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated clinical laboratory staff to
ensure the appropriate handling, analysis, and documentation of
thyroid autoantibody tests. All staff must exercise due diligence in
identifying and addressing any issues that may compromise the
quality of the test results.
2. DEFINITION
Thyroid autoantibodies profile typically includes the following tests:
• Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody (Anti-TPO)
• Anti-Thyroglobulin Antibody (Anti-Tg)
• Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Antibody (TRAb)
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzers (e.g., Chemiluminescence
Immunoassay – CLIA)
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents specific to the analyzers and
tests being performed
• Serum separation tubes (SSTs) with clot activator and gel for
serum separation
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
4. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation and Handling
1. Ensure that serum samples are adequately collected in SSTs
and allowed to clot completely at room temperature for 30-60
minutes.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
3. Transfer the serum to appropriate labeled aliquot tubes.
◦ Preferred sample volume is 2-3 mL of serum.
◦ Store at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately. If delayed for
more than 72 hours, freeze samples at -20°C or below.
B) Set Up and Calibration
1. Turn on the analyzer and allow it to perform self-checks.
2. Load the necessary reagents, calibrators, and controls into the
analyzer following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Perform an initial calibration using the provided calibrators.
4. Verify the calibration by running quality control (QC) material at
low, medium, and high levels. Ensure results are within
acceptable limits before proceeding with patient samples.
C) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform regular calibrations as per manufacturer’s guidelines
and whenever a new lot of reagents is introduced.
2. Run QC samples at the beginning of each shift, after any major
maintenance, and at intervals recommended by the
manufacturer.
3. Investigate any QC measurements that fall outside of
acceptable ranges, troubleshoot, and document corrective
actions.
4. Log all QC results and ensure they are reviewed and signed off
by a supervisor.
D) Testing Procedure
1. Load the serum samples onto the analyzer.
2. Confirm the sample identification and ensure proper linkage to
the corresponding test orders.
3. Commence the analysis as per the analyzer’s operational
protocols.
4. Monitor the analyzer during the process to ensure continuous
operation and troubleshoot any errors as they occur.
E) Post-Analysis
1. Review preliminary results generated by the analyzer and
cross-check with QC results for accuracy.
2. Any flagged or out-of-range results should be reassessed and
rerun if necessary.
3. Transmit validated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Document results on the appropriate report forms or
electronically as per lab protocol.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Ensure that all patient results are reviewed, validated, and
electronically signed off by the designated technologist.
2. Any critical results that fall outside standard reference ranges
should be communicated to the patient's medical provider
following the laboratory's critical result notification policy.
3. Utilize site-specific guidelines for the proper reporting format of
thyroid autoantibodies results.
6. REFERENCE INTERVAL
The typical reference ranges may vary based on the specific assay
methodology; follow the manufacturer’s instructions or site-specific
guidelines for thyroid autoantibodies reference intervals.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific analyzer’s operator manual and reagent
package inserts for detailed limitations associated with thyroid
autoantibodies testing.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
1. Maintain thorough documentation of all procedures, including
date, time, personnel involved, and any corrective actions
taken.
2. Archive QC logs, calibration records, and maintenance records
in accordance with laboratory policy and regulatory
requirements.

By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
reliable generation of thyroid autoantibody profiles in serum,
contributing to the effective diagnosis and management of thyroid
disorders.
