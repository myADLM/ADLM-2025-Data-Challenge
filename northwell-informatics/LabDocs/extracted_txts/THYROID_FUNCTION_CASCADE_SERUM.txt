Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Thyroid Function Cascade,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to accurately generate
and report thyroid function cascade test results from serum samples.
The thyroid function panel typically includes tests for Thyroid
Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Free Thyroxine (FT4), and Free
Triiodothyronine (FT3). This procedure ensures that all
measurements are accurate and reproducible, thereby guaranteeing
the validity of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types:
◦ Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-
top tube.
• Preferred Specimen Condition:
◦ Blood should be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and then
centrifuged to separate serum.
• Stability:
◦ Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
◦ For prolonged storage, serum should be frozen at ≤ -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Samples with excessive lipemia
◦ Specimens collected in inappropriate containers (e.g., EDTA or
heparin tubes)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzers calibrated for thyroid function tests
• TSH, FT4, and FT3 assay kits compatible with the automated
analyzer
• Serum separators (centrifuge)
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tubes, gloves)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Assay Preparation:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify that the sample label matches the requisition form.
◦ Inspect the serum sample for quality; ensure there is no
hemolysis or excessive lipemia.
2. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Ensure that the automated analyzer is calibrated and
controls have been run and are within acceptable limits.
◦ Load assay kits for TSH, FT4, and FT3 following
manufacturer instructions.
B) Running the Assay:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load serum samples into the designated slots in the
automated analyzer.
◦ Enter patient and sample information into the analyzer
system.
2. Initiating the Assay:
◦ Select the appropriate thyroid function panel assay from the
instrument menu.
◦ Initiate the assay run following the analyzer’s operational
protocol.
3. Monitoring the Assay:
◦ Monitor the assay run to ensure the instrument is
functioning correctly.
◦ Record any instrument alerts or errors and take appropriate
corrective action.
C) Quality Control:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Run internal controls as defined by the assay kit and the
laboratory’s standard operating procedures.
◦ Ensure all controls fall within specified ranges; if any control
fails, troubleshoot according to the analyzer and assay kit
guidelines.
2. External Controls:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing for thyroid function
assays regularly.
D) Result Generation:
1. Data Review:
◦ Review the raw data generated by the analyzer for each
sample.
◦ Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable
limits before validating patient results.
2. Result Verification:
◦ Validate results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Apply any flagged notes or comments in the reporting as
needed (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Result Entry:
◦ Enter validated results into LIS according to standard
procedures.
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed for accuracy and integrity.
3. Notification of Critical Values:
◦ Notify the ordering physician or clinician immediately if
critical values are detected (Critical Values for TSH,
FT4, and FT3 as defined by the laboratory).
4. Result Documentation:
◦ Archive all raw data, control charts, and result logs as per
laboratory guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH): 0.4–4.0 mIU/L
• Free Thyroxine (FT4): 0.8–2.8 ng/dL
• Free Triiodothyronine (FT3): 2.3–4.2 pg/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Follow internal and external quality control procedures as outlined in
the general laboratory SOP. Regularly participate in proficiency
testing to ensure inter-laboratory comparative accuracy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer’s kit inserts for individual assay limitations. Be
aware of potential interferences such as:
• Hemolysis
• Lipemia
• Certain medications
