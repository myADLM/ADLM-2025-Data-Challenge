SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for THYROID
TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (TTF1) (SPT24) AND KERATIN 5
(KRT5) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Thyroid Transcription Factor 1 (TTF1, clone
SPT24) and Keratin 5 (KRT5) immunostain, ensuring accuracy,
reproducibility, and consistency of immunohistochemical staining.
Responsibility:
Designated staff (histotechnologists or examining technologists) are
responsible for performing immunohistochemical staining, monitoring
the quality of staining, and documenting results according to this
protocol.
1. DEFINITIONS
TTF1: Thyroid Transcription Factor 1, a protein expressed in the
epithelium of the thyroid gland and lung, used as a marker in the
diagnosis of various cancers.
KRT5: Keratin 5, a protein often used as a marker for identifying
squamous cell differentiation.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC): A method to detect specific antigens in
tissues using antibodies against those antigens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunohistochemistry Staining System (e.g., automated stainer)
• Microscope
• Positive control slides (for TTF1 and KRT5)
• Negative control slides
• Sample tissue slides
• Primary Antibodies:
◦ TTF1 (clone SPT24)
◦ KRT5
• Secondary antibodies
• Detection reagent
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure tissue samples are correctly positioned in paraffin
blocks and sections are adequately thin (3-5 microns).
2. Deparaffinize sections using xylene, followed by rehydration
through graded alcohols to water.
B) Immunostaining:
1. Place slides in the immunohistochemistry stainer. Program the
stainer settings as per manufacturer’s instructions for the
desired protocol.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
a. Apply TTF1 antibody (diluted as per manufacturer’s
recommendations). b. Incubate for the optimal time specified by
antibody manufacturer (typically 30-60 minutes). c. Repeat
steps a and b for KRT5 antibody.
3. Washing and Blocking: a. Wash slides thoroughly using buffer
solution to remove unbound antibodies. b. Apply blocking
solution (as specified by the reagent protocol) to prevent non-
specific binding.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation: a. Apply the appropriate
secondary antibody to bind primary antibodies. b. Incubate as
per manufacturer’s instructions (typically 20-30 minutes). c.
Wash slides with buffer solution.
5. Detection and Visualization: a. Apply detection reagent (e.g.,
HRP-conjugated secondary). b. Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB)
to achieve color reaction. c. Monitor under a microscope until
desired color intensity is achieved (typically within minutes). d.
Counterstain with hematoxylin to visualize tissue morphology. e.
Rinse slides in running water followed by graded alcohols to
dehydrate.
6. Mounting: a. Apply mounting medium and cover slips. b. Allow
slides to dry.
C) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides alongside patient
samples for each immunostaining run.
2. Ensure controls demonstrate expected staining patterns
(positive controls should show strong, specific immunoreactivity
in targeted cells; negative controls should show no staining).
3. Document all control results.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Evaluate stained slides under the microscope: a. Confirm
specific nuclear staining for TTF1 and cytoplasmic/membranous
staining for KRT5. b. Verify clarity and specificity of the stain.
2. Record observations and ensure that the staining intensity and
pattern match expected pathologic findings.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
pathologist review.
4. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
5. Record date, time, sample information, antibodies used, and
technologist initials.
6. Maintain records of control results and run identification.
7. Ensure proper documentation for instrument maintenance and
reagent use.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
9. If staining is excessively weak or strong, adjust antibody
concentration or incubation time.
10. If there is non-specific background staining, verify blocking
solutions and wash procedures.
11. If controls fail, review reagent viability, protocol adherence, and
instrument functionality.

(TTF1) and KRT5.
1. REVISIONS
Document any changes made to the protocol with the date and
rationale for amendment.
The above protocol ensures the technical aspects of generating TTF1
and KRT5 immunostain results are performed accurately and
consistently, with appropriate quality controls and documentation
practices in place.
