Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thyroid Transcription Factor (8G7G3/1)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for processing, staining, and analyzing
thyroid transcription factor (8G7G3/1) immunostains to ensure
accurate and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel responsible for performing and
documenting immunohistochemical staining procedures. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4-5 microns
thick).
• Tissue blocks with appropriate labeling including patient ID,
accession number, and block ID.
• Unstained slides must be prepared as needed.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath (37-40°C)
• Oven (60°C)
• Staining rack
• THYROID TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (8G7G3/1) antibody
• Detection system (e.g., HRP polymer or ABC system)
• DAB substrate kit
• Positive and negative control slides
• Xylene and graded alcohols
• Hematoxylin
• Coverslips and mounting medium
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. SLIDE PREPARATION
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ For each tissue section, use the following sequence:
▪ Xylene: 2-3 changes, 10 minutes each
▪ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 3 minutes each
▪ 95% ethanol: 2 changes, 3 minutes each
▪ 70% ethanol: 1 change, 3 minutes
▪ Rinse in distilled water: 10 minutes
5.2. ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL
1. Place slides in a suitable heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER)
solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat in a microwave, pressure cooker, or any other appropriate
heating device according to manufacturer's instructions
(typically 95-100°C for 20 minutes).
3. Allow to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.3. BLOCKING
1. Incubate slides with a peroxidase-blocking solution (e.g., 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol) for 10 minutes to quench
endogenous peroxide activity.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water and then wash with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) or TBS (Tris-buffered saline) for 5
minutes.
5.4. PRIMARY ANTIBODY INCUBATION
1. Apply the THYROID TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (8G7G3/1)
antibody to each slide and incubate in a humid chamber for
30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, based
on the recommendations provided in the antibody datasheet.
5.5. WASHING
1. Wash slides in PBS or TBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
5.6. DETECTION
1. Apply the secondary antibody or detection reagent as per the
manufacturer's instructions, typically for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Wash slides again in PBS or TBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Apply the DAB substrate to the tissues and incubate until the
desired stain intensity is observed (usually 5-10 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.7. COUNTERSTAINING
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2-5 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 10 minutes to blue.
5.8. DEHYDRATION AND MOUNTING
1. Dehydrate slides through the following alcohol series:
◦ 70% ethanol: 1 change, 1 minute
◦ 95% ethanol: 2 changes, 1 minute each
◦ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 1 minute each
2. Clear slides in xylene, 2 changes, 10 minutes each.
3. Mount with coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each staining run.
• Ensure consistent staining quality and troubleshoot any
deviations.
• Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Stained slides are examined by a pathologist.
• Pathologist will interpret the results and provide a full report based
on the technical performance of the stain.
8. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs for all performed staining runs including reagent lot
numbers, control results, and any deviations or corrective actions.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for Thyroid Transcription Factor
(8G7G3/1) antibody.
• Current immunohistochemistry textbooks and journals.
• Internal laboratory reference documents and past QC data.
10. NOTES
• Update the SOP as new guidelines, reagents or protocols become
available.
• Ensure all involved personnel are trained and proficient in the
procedure.
