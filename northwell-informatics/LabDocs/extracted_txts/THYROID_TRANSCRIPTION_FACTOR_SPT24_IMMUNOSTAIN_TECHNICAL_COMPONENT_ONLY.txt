Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Thyroid Transcription Factor (SPT24) Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for performing and
analyzing the Thyroid Transcription Factor (SPT24)
immunostain, ensuring accurate and reliable results for the
technical component of the assay.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this protocol, performing the stain, and analyzing the results.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying compliance with the SOP
and addressing any issues that arise during the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Acceptable Specimens:
• Tissue sections must be received within appropriate timeframe
post-fixation, properly labeled, and accompanied by requisition
forms. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly fixed, damaged, mislabeled, or
lack requisition forms will be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Positive control slides
• Negative control slides
• Tissue sections on glass slides
• Primary antibodies: Anti-Thyroid Transcription Factor (SPT24)
• Secondary antibodies: Appropriate detection system (EnVision™,
Biotin-Streptavidin)
• Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Wash buffers (PBS or TBS)
• Mounting medium
• Slide covers
• Microscopy supplies
• Automated immunostainer (if applicable)
• Incubator
• Water bath
1. PROCEDURE A. Slide Preparation:
2. Confirm patient identification and specimen details on slides.
3. Ensure slides are deparaffinized and rehydrated using standard
protocols.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using one of the
following methods:
◦ Microwave: Citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) at 98°C for 20
minutes.
◦ Pressure Cooker: Citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) at 120°C for 2
minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
C. Immunostaining:
1. Place slides in a humidity chamber or automated
immunostainer.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity using hydrogen peroxide
(0.3%) for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides with wash buffer.
4. Block nonspecific binding using protein blocker for 10 minutes.
5. Apply primary antibody (Anti-Thyroid Transcription Factor,
SPT24) to sections and incubate for 60 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Rinse slides with wash buffer.
7. Apply secondary antibody according to the detection system’s
instructions and incubate as specified (generally 30 minutes).
8. Rinse slides with wash buffer.
9. Apply chromogen substrate (DAB) and allow the color
development to occur for the appropriate duration (generally
5-10 minutes).
10. Rinse slides with distilled water.
11. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
12. Rinse and dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in
xylene.
13. Mount slides using an appropriate mounting medium and cover
with coverslips.
D. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each run.
2. Evaluate control slides for correct staining patterns.
3. Document any deviation from expected results on the Quality
Control log.
4. Repeat staining procedure if controls fail to meet quality
standards.
E. Microscopy:
1. Perform microscopic examination of stained slides.
2. Verify the integrity and distribution of staining for Thyroid
Transcription Factor (SPT24).
3. Document findings and note any anomalies or inconsistencies.
4. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record detailed observations, ensuring consistency and accuracy
of data.
• Ensure all results are verified and reviewed by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
• Report findings to the ordering physician or relevant departments,
following site-specific guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure awareness of limitations related to tissue quality, antigen
retrieval conditions, and antibody specificity.
• Refer to the manufacturer's product insert for specific reagent
limitations.
