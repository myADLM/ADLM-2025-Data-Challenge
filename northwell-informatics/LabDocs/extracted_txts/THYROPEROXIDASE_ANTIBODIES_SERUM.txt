Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for THYROPEROXIDASE
ANTIBODIES, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To outline procedures for the analysis and reporting of
Thyroperoxidase (TPO) Antibodies in serum to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis as outlined in this SOP and documenting all necessary
information. Laboratory supervisors will ensure staff compliance and
address any issues.
2. PRINCIPLE:
The presence of Thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies in serum is
indicative of autoimmune thyroiditis and other thyroid disorders. The
analysis is performed using an immunoassay method which involves
antigen-antibody reactions specific to TPO antibodies.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Stability and Storage:
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory within 2 hours
of collection to maintain stability.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, the serum should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, serum samples may be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• TPO antibody test kits (including reagent cartridges, calibrators,
and controls)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify patient identification and specimen labeling.
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
3. Transfer serum to a clean, labeled tube.
4. Inspect serum for any signs of hemolysis or lipemia.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Power on and log in to the Automated Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Load the TPO antibody test kit reagents, calibrators, and
controls into the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Perform daily calibration checks and run quality control samples
(both positive and negative controls) before analyzing patient
samples. a. If the controls fall outside the acceptable limits,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's instructions and
repeat the control tests. b. Document all QC results and
corrective actions.
4. Load patient serum samples into the analyzer.
5. Start the assay and allow the analyzer to process the samples
following the manufacturer's protocol.
6. Upon completion, review the results provided by the analyzer.
7. In case of any flagged or questionable results, repeat the
analysis, or perform additional troubleshooting as necessary.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify and document the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure that critical and significant results are communicated to
the ordering physician promptly.
3. Dispose of all biological and chemical waste as per laboratory
safety guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run internal quality controls with each batch of patient samples.
Controls should be stored and handled as per manufacturer's
guidelines.
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibration checks as
scheduled.
• Record and review QC data to ensure assay performance is
within the established limits.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Results should be reviewed and verified by trained laboratory
personnel.
2. Patients' results along with the reference intervals will be
reported in the LIS.
3. Critical results must be reported immediately to the healthcare
provider.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: <35 IU/mL
• Positive: ≥35 IU/mL
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly stored specimens may yield
inaccurate results.
• Cross-reactivity with other autoantibodies may occur, potentially
leading to false results.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the TPO antibody test kit.
• Laboratory Quality Management guidelines.
• CLIA regulations and standards.
10. DOCUMENTATION:
Ensure that all processes, calibrations, QC results, and patient
results are meticulously documented and archived as per laboratory
protocols.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate, reliable, and
timely results for Thyroperoxidase (TPO) Antibodies, aiding in the
proper diagnosis and management of thyroid disorders.
