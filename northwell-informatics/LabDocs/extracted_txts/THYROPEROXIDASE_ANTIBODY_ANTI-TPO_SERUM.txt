Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase: Thyroperoxidase
Antibody (Anti-TPO), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the measurement of Thyroperoxidase
Antibody (Anti-TPO) levels in serum using the designated analyzer.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the assay, ensure all quality control measures are
conducted, and document the results accurately.
3. DEFINITION
Thyroperoxidase Antibody (Anti-TPO) is an autoantibody associated
with autoimmune thyroid diseases. Elevated levels of Anti-TPO are
indicative of conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves’
disease.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: [Insert Model and Manufacturer Here]
• Anti-TPO reagent kit: [Insert Manufacturer and Catalog Number
Here]
• Calibrators and Controls: [Insert Details Here]
• Sample cups or tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Temperature monitoring device
• Log sheets
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a plain red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum volume of 1 mL serum.
• Storage: Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens may interfere with results.
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before the assay.
2. Thaw frozen samples completely and mix gently by inversion.
3. Centrifuge serum samples if required to remove any
particulates.
Instrument Setup
1. Turn on the analyzer and allow it to perform a self-check.
2. Load the Anti-TPO reagent kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Perform instrument calibration using the calibrators provided in
the kit.
Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (both normal and abnormal) at the
beginning of each testing day and whenever a new lot of
reagents is used.
2. Document QC results in the QC log. Ensure that QC results fall
within the established ranges before proceeding with patient
samples.
Sample Analysis
1. Label sample cups or tubes with patient identification.
2. Pipette the specified volume of serum (consult kit insert) into
each respective sample cup or tube.
3. Load samples into the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Initiate the test run and allow the analyzer to process the
samples.
7. CALCULATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
1. The analyzer will automatically calculate Anti-TPO
concentrations in IU/mL.
2. Review all results generated by the analyzer. Verify against the
reference ranges provided in the kit insert.
3. Any results flagged by the analyzer should be rechecked or
repeated as per laboratory protocol.
4. Enter or verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and ensure proper documentation within the patient's
record.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <35 IU/mL
• Borderline: 35-50 IU/mL
• Positive: >50 IU/mL (Note: Reference ranges may vary slightly
based on manufacturer; consult the kit insert for the specific
ranges.)
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interfering substances: Hemolysis, lipemia, and bilirubin can affect
the results. Contaminants could cause false positives or
negatives.
• High levels of heterophile antibodies or rheumatoid factor may
interfere with assay performance and cause erroneous results.
• Refer to the analyzer and reagent kit manufacturer's insert for
specific limitations.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results are out of range, do not proceed with patient testing.
Investigate and resolve QC failures.
• Ensure regular maintenance and calibration of the analyzer as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Document any troubleshooting steps taken in the appropriate
logbook.
