Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Generating Results for Thyrotropin Receptor Antibody,
Serum (TRAb)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized protocol for the accurate and
efficient analysis of Thyrotropin Receptor Antibody (TRAb) levels in
serum samples using the specified immunoassay method in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This protocol covers the handling, preparation, and analysis of TRAb
serum samples using an immunoassay technique. All personnel
performing the analysis must adhere to this SOP to ensure
consistency and reliability of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis as per this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible
for ensuring that all personnel are trained and that the equipment and
reagents are suitable for use.
4. DEFINITIONS
• TRAb: Thyrotropin Receptor Antibody
• PBS: Phosphate Buffered Saline
• QC: Quality Control
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer
• TRAb reagent kit (store as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top or serum-
separating tube.
• Stability: Serum must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection. Stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C for
longer periods.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Equipment Preparation
1. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform a system
check as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure that the calibration is up to date. If it is not, perform
calibration using the provided standards.
7.2 Reagent Preparation
1. Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before use.
2. Mix reagents gently by inversion; do not vortex.
7.3 Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative control samples at the beginning of
each analytical batch. Refer to site-specific guidelines for
acceptable control ranges.
2. Document QC results in the appropriate log. If QC results are
out of range, troubleshoot the assay as per manufacturer’s
instructions and do not proceed with patient samples until
resolved.
7.4 Sample Processing
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 2000-3000 RPM for 10-15
minutes if not already separated.
2. Aliquot serum into labeled test tubes if necessary.
3. Add the specified volume of serum sample, calibrator, or control
to the reaction well of the assay plate as instructed by the kit
protocol.
7.5 Assay Procedure
1. Follow the detailed steps for the TRAb immunoassay as per the
reagent kit insert which generally includes:
◦ Addition of serum samples and processing according to the
incubation and washing steps.
◦ Addition of conjugate reagent.
◦ Incubation period.
◦ Washing steps post-incubation.
◦ Addition of substrate solution.
◦ Final incubation period.
◦ Addition of stop solution.
7.6 Measurement
1. Place the assay plate into the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Measure the absorbance at the specific wavelength
recommended in the test kit instructions.
3. The analyzer will automatically generate the TRAb levels based
on the calibration curve.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results will be transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) directly from the analyzer.
2. Review the results for any flagged values or errors before
reporting.
3. For TRAb levels outside the normal reference range, repeat the
assay for confirmation.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal: <1.75 IU/L (Refer to the manufacturer’s insert or
laboratory guidelines for specific reference ranges)
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the immunoassay kit instructions for any limitations of the
assay.
11. QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Regularly maintain the immunoassay analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Conduct proficiency testing and participate in external quality
assessment (EQA) programs.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of all calibrations, Quality Control
results, and any deviations or troubleshooting activities.
