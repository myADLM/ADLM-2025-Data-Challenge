Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Thyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG), Serum
1. PURPOSE:
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for the analytical
phase of generating accurate and reliable results for Thyroxine-
Binding Globulin (TBG) levels in serum samples. It includes the
preparation of reagents, equipment, and materials, as well as the
steps to be followed for the assay, quality control, and result
reporting.
Responsibilities: Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assays according to this SOP and ensuring that results are
accurate and reliable. Supervisors are responsible for verifying that
this SOP is followed and for addressing problems that may arise
during the assay process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY:
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Acceptable Specimen:
• 2 mL of freshly collected serum.
• Serum should be separated from the cells within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or lipemic.
• Specimens collected in plasma separator tubes or other
inappropriate containers.
Specimen Storage:
• Stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, aliquots should be stored at -20°C or
lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Calibrated centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents:
• TBG ELISA kit.
• Deionized or distilled water for reagent preparation.
• Calibrators and controls as provided by the TBG ELISA kit
manufacturer.
Supplies:
• Microplate compatible with the ELISA reader.
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.
• Disposable gloves.
• Absorbent bench pads.
1. PROCEDURE:
Preparation: A. Prepare all reagents according to kit instructions.
Allow reagents to come to room temperature before use. B. Ensure
all equipment such as the microplate reader and pipettes are
calibrated and functioning properly.
Assay Procedure: A. Set up the microplate as per the ELISA kit insert
instructions. This includes allocation of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples in respective wells. B. Pipette the patient serum
samples, calibrators, and controls into designated wells. C. Add the
required reagent(s) (e.g., TBG-enzyme conjugates or antibodies)
according to the kit instructions and incubate as specified. D. Wash
wells to remove unbound materials using the wash buffer provided in
the kit. Repeat the wash steps as indicated. E. Add the substrate
solution to each well and incubate as specified. F. Stop the reaction
by adding the stop solution. G. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm
using the microplate reader.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
A. Include quality control samples (known TBG levels) provided with
the kit or external quality controls in each assay run. B. Ensure that
the control values fall within the expected range. If control values are
outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and repeat the assay as
required. C. Document quality control results.
1. CALCULATION OF RESULTS:
A. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
calibrators against their concentrations. B. Calculate the
concentration of TBG in patient samples by interpolating their
absorbance on the standard curve. C. Review results for any
discrepancies and confirm the calculation accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
A. Results are automatically and manually reviewed for accuracy
before being transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
B. Critical results should be communicated immediately to the
ordering physician or designated healthcare provider. C. Document
all relevant information related to the assay including specimen
condition and any deviations from the SOP.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
A. Understand the limitation of the assay, including potential
interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or incorrect specimen
collection. B. Reference the ELISA kit insert for any specific
limitations or considerations.
