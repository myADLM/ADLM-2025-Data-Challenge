Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for THYROXINE-BINDING
PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized
procedure for the analytical phase of generating results for
Thyroxine-Binding Protein Electrophoresis (TBE) from serum
samples in the laboratory.
2. PRINCIPLE: Thyroxine-binding protein electrophoresis is a
laboratory technique used to separate and quantify thyroxine-binding
proteins (such as TBG, albumin, prealbumin) in serum based on their
electrophoretic mobility. This separation helps in the assessment of
thyroxine-binding anomalies and related thyroid disorders.
3. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Collection: Serum should be collected using standard
venipuncture technique in a red-top tube (no anticoagulant).
• Volume: At least 1 mL
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 5 days. For long term storage,
keep frozen at -20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Electrophoresis unit
• Power supply
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Gloves and other PPE
• Epure water or deionized water
• Serum separation medium
• Electrophoresis buffer (pH 8.6)
• Protein fixative solution
• Protein stain (Coomassie Blue or alternative)
• Destaining solution
• Serum protein controls
5. PROCEDURE/ANALYTICAL PHASE:
A. Preparation of Samples:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples, if applicable, by placing them in a
37°C water bath until completely thawed. Do not use a
microwave to thaw.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
3. Pipette 50 µL serum into a labeled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
B. Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare electrophoresis buffer according to the manufacturer's
instructions and fill the electrophoresis unit's buffer reservoirs.
2. Load the serum samples onto the sample wells of the
electrophoresis medium.
3. Add protein controls to the designated control wells.
4. Connect the power supply to the electrophoresis unit, set the
voltage to 200V, and run for 1-2 hours or until the separation is
adequate.
C. Fixation and Staining:
1. After electrophoresis, immerse the gel into the fixative solution
for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Transfer the gel to the protein stain solution and stain for 1 hour
at room temperature, with gentle agitation.
3. Destain the gel using the destaining solution until the protein
bands are clearly visible and the background is clear.
D. Documentation and Interpretation:
1. Use a densitometer to scan the gel.
2. Quantify the separated thyroxine-binding protein bands (TBG,
albumin, and prealbumin).
3. Compare the protein band pattern with the protein controls and
reference ranges for interpretation.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Include serum protein controls in each run to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
2. Review control results before accepting patient results.
3. Perform and record regular maintenance on electrophoresis
equipment.
B. External Quality Control:
1. Participation in external quality control programs (e.g., CAP
proficiency testing) at least twice a year.
2. Review and document results and make necessary
adjustments if needed.
C. Troubleshooting:
1. If bands are faint or not visible, check all reagents for
expiration, ensure proper running and staining times, and
repeat the analysis with new aliquots.
2. If unexpected bands are observed, investigate potential
contamination of samples and reagents, and re-run with fresh
samples if necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Review and verify patient results.
2. Enter results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Notify the clinician of any critical values promptly.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS: As reference intervals may vary by
age, gender, and patient populations, verify with updated lab-specific
reference range guidelines or current literature for specific reference
intervals.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Variability in electrophoretic equipment and buffers can affect
results.
• Cross-reactivity with non-target proteins can occur.
• Abnormal sample handling and storage can affect protein integrity
and result accuracy.
10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow all standard laboratory safety guidelines, including the use
of appropriate PPE.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all waste materials per institutional biosafety protocols.
