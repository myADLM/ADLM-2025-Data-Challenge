Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Tiagabine (Gabitril), Serum
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
and generation of results for Tiagabine (Gabitril) levels in serum. This
ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for patient
diagnosis and monitoring.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of Tiagabine in serum samples in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory staff and supervisors are responsible for following this
SOP to ensure correct and consistent processing, analysis, and
reporting of Tiagabine serum levels. It is the responsibility of all staff
to identify any deficiencies in processing and bring them to the
attention of a supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred Specimen Type:
• Serum: 2 mL from a blood sample drawn in a red-stopper tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in EDTA, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or sodium
citrate tubes.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or lipemic.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV
detection.
• Standard reagents specific for Tiagabine analysis.
• Calibrators and quality control (QC) materials for Tiagabine.
• Laboratory consumables (pipettes, tubes, etc.)
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure the HPLC system is calibrated and the baseline is
stable.
2. Prepare calibration standards and QC materials according to
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify that all reagents are within their expiry dates and stored
properly.
B. Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes and
separate the serum layer.
2. Transfer 0.5 mL of serum into appropriately labeled tubes.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Ensure the HPLC system is set up correctly and parameters
such as column temperature, mobile phase flow rate, and UV
detection wavelength are as per the analyzer's operating
manual for Tiagabine analysis.
2. Inject calibration standards into the HPLC system and generate
a calibration curve.
3. Inject QC samples and verify that they fall within acceptable
ranges.
4. Inject serum samples into the HPLC system.
◦ Record retention time and peak area of Tiagabine.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run QC materials during each batch of tests.
2. Analyze QC results to verify that they are within the acceptable
range.
3. If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's
guidelines before proceeding with the patient samples.
E. Calculation and Reporting Results:
1. Compare the peak area of Tiagabine in patient serum samples
to the calibration curve to determine the concentration.
2. Document the patient results along with the date, time, and
initials of the technologist.
3. Report results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify them for accuracy.
4. Critical results should be communicated immediately to the
physician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for information on method
limitations, including potential interferences and lower/upper
detection limits.
8. REFERENCES: Manufacturer's instructions for Tiagabine (Gabitril)
HPLC analytical kit.
9. DOCUMENTATION: All steps, calibrations, QC results, and patient
results need to be appropriately documented in the laboratory
logbook and LIS system.
10. VERSION HISTORY: Version 1.0 - Initial draft Version 2.0 -
October 2023: Reviewed and updated for compliance with current
practices.
The protocol outlined ensures precision, accuracy, and reliability in
the determination of Tiagabine serum levels for clinical use.
