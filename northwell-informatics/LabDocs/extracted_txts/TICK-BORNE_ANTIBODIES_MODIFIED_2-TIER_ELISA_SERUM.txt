Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Tick-Borne Antibodies,
Modified 2-Tier, ELISA, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable detection of antibodies against
tick-borne pathogens using a modified 2-tier enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure on serum samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, analyzing the data, and documenting the results. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring adherence
to this SOP.
2. DEFINITIONS
Tick-borne diseases: Infectious diseases transmitted by tick bites,
commonly including Lyme disease, Anaplasmosis, Ehrlichiosis, and
Babesiosis. Modified 2-Tier Testing (MTTT): A testing algorithm
involving an initial ELISA screening followed by a second
confirmatory ELISA.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types and Stability:
• Preferred: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Processing: Centrifuge the SST within 2 hours of collection to
separate serum.
• Storage: Serum is stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-term
storage, serum may be frozen at -20°C or below for up to 6
months.
Acceptable Conditions:
• Clearly labeled specimens with patient information including
collection date.
• Sufficient quantity of serum (minimum 500 µL).
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
• Specimens not properly labeled or with missing collection dates.
• Specimens stored outside acceptable temperature or time frames.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Pipettes and Tips
• Microtiter Plates (96-well)
• Tick-borne Antibodies ELISA Kit (including all reagents and
controls)
• Plate sealers
• Laboratory Timer
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
2. Ensure the ELISA Reader, Washer, and incubator are set up
and functioning correctly.
B. Initial ELISA Screening:
1. Pipette 100 µL of each patient’s serum sample, calibrators, and
controls into designated wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Add 100 µL of diluted antigen conjugate solution to each well.
3. Seal the plate with an adhesive plate sealer and incubate at
37°C for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plates 5-6 times with wash buffer using the ELISA
Washer.
5. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
6. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
7. Read absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA Reader.
8. Record results, using calibrators and controls to generate a
standard curve.
C. Confirmatory ELISA:
1. Based on the initial ELISA results, interpret positive, equivocal,
and negative samples according to the kit instructions.
2. For initial positives and equivocal samples, proceed with the
second confirmatory ELISA using a different specific antigen
following the same steps as above.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Calculate the index (ratio of sample OD to cutoff OD) for both
assays.
2. Report results as Positive, Negative, or Equivocal based on the
manufacturer’s criteria.
3. Results must be reviewed and verified by a second trained
technologist and lab supervisor.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report findings per site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Include information on any deviations or unusual observations
made during testing.
• For equivocal or discrepant results, retesting or additional
confirmatory testing may be necessary.
• Communicate and document any critical or urgent findings
according to laboratory policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Ensure that control results are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
performed.
8. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly maintain and calibrate all equipment used in the testing
process as per manufacturer instructions.
• Record all maintenance activities and observe quality assurance
measures.
• Troubleshoot assay performance issues by following component-
specific guidance in the kit insert or consulting with kit
manufacturer technical support.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual and package insert for the
ELISA kit used.
• Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) for tick-borne disease testing.
• Laboratory quality management system documentation.
10. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Document all testing procedures, results, and quality control
measures in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Maintain correct logs for instrument calibration, maintenance, and
performance records.

specific tick-borne antibody ELISA kit's instructions, and any specific
state/local guidelines, CLIA accreditation requirements, and the
laboratory's internal quality control policies.
