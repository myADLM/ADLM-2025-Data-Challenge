Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Tick-Borne Disease Antibodies Panel,
Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a standard procedure for the analytical
phase of testing serum specimens for tick-borne disease
antibodies, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform this procedure accurately and efficiently.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this procedure and resolving any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum should be tested within 48 hours if stored at
2-8°C. If testing is delayed, serum can be stored at -20°C or lower
for up to 6 months.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader,
chemiluminescent immunoassay system)
• Calibrators and controls specific for tick-borne pathogen antibody
detection (e.g., B. burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum,
Babesia microti, Ehrlichia chaffeensis)
• Test kits as provided by the manufacturer, including necessary
reagents and specific antibody-coated plates
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Incubator
• Plate reader compatible with the test kit
• Deionized or distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and serum specimens to reach
room temperature (18-25°C) before testing.
2. Ensure all equipment (e.g., analyzers, incubators) is calibrated
and functioning properly.
3. Prepare and label all required samples, controls, and
calibrators as per the test kit instructions.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Perform a visual inspection of the serum sample for hemolysis
or contamination. Note any issues in the logbook and request a
new sample if necessary.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific tick-borne
disease antibody test kit being used. This typically includes the
following steps:
a. Pipette a specified volume of calibrators, controls, and serum
samples into designated wells of the antibody-coated plate.
b. Add the appropriate volumes of reagents in the order
specified by the kit insert (e.g., conjugate solution, substrate
buffer).
c. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration
to allow antigen-antibody binding.
d. Wash the plate thoroughly with the provided wash solution to
remove unbound substances.
e. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate to allow
color development.
f. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution, if indicated in the
test kit instructions.
g. Read the plate using a plate reader at the specified
wavelength (e.g., 450 nm for ELISA).
3. When using automated immunoassay analyzers, ensure the
settings and program parameters are appropriately configured
to match the test kit requirements.
C) Quality Control
1. Run internal quality control (QC) samples (positive and
negative controls) alongside patient specimens with each batch
of tests.
2. Verify that QC results fall within the manufacturer’s established
ranges before validating patient results. Investigate and resolve
any QC failures as per lab protocols.
3. Document all QC results on the QC log sheet.
4. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
5. Calculate the results according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For quantitative assays, generate a standard curve
and determine the antibody concentration in patient samples by
interpolation from the curve.
6. For qualitative assays, compare the absorbance or signal
strength of patient samples to control thresholds to determine
the presence of antibodies.
7. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Ensure proper review and validation by a qualified technologist.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS from the
analyzer. Technologists must review and verify results before
releasing.
10. Critical results must be immediately relayed to the ordering
clinician according to the laboratory’s critical result policy.
11. Any repeat testing due to invalid/improper initial results should
be documented and the clinician notified of any delays.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
13. If issues arise during the test run (e.g., equipment malfunction,
QC failure), refer to the troubleshooting section of the
manufacturer’s kit insert or contact technical support.
14. Document any troubleshooting actions taken and confirm
resolution before proceeding with further analyses.
15. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
16. Follow standard laboratory safety procedures, including the use
of personal protective equipment (PPE).
17. Handle all specimens and reagents as potentially infectious.
Dispose of waste as per biohazard regulations.
