Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Tick-Borne Panel,
Molecular Detection, PCR, Blood
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for the Molecular Detection of Tick-
Borne pathogens in blood via PCR analysis. This includes actions
from sample preparation to result documentation, ensuring accurate
and timely diagnostic results.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory scientists are responsible for conducting and
documenting all procedures as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring protocol adherence and
troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum required: 1 mL
• Preferred volume: 3-5 mL
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: up to 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): up to 5 days
• Frozen (-20°C or below): stable for prolonged periods; avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes
• Clotted or insufficient volume samples
• Samples with significant air bubbles or improper labeling
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kit
• Master Mix reagents for PCR
• Primers and Probes specific to tick-borne pathogens (e.g.,
Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Borrelia species)
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and Negative controls
• Consumables: Pipettes, pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE:
A) Pre-Analysis:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Verify the specimen is correctly labeled with patient
identifiers and ensure sample integrity.
◦ Store the sample at appropriate conditions until ready for
processing.
2. Documentation:
◦ Accession the specimen in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Log specimen details including date/time of collection and
receipt.
B) DNA Extraction:
1. Setup:
◦ Perform all procedures in a designated DNA extraction area
to avoid contamination.
◦ Utilize appropriate PPE.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the selected DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Include an extraction control to ensure the process is
working correctly.
3. Quantification and Quality Check:
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer as per laboratory protocol.
◦ Ensure sufficient quantity and quality for PCR; proceed if
sample meets criteria.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the protocol
provided by the kit manufacturer. This typically includes the
DNA template, primers, probes, dNTPs, buffer, and Taq
polymerase.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or wells of a PCR
plate.
2. Controls:
◦ Include Positive controls (known tick-borne pathogen DNA).
◦ Include Negative controls (nuclease-free water) to monitor
for contamination.
3. Amplification:
◦ Load the PCR tubes/plate into the thermal cycler.
◦ Select the appropriate PCR program which includes
denaturation, annealing, and extension cycles suited to
primers and probes used.
D) Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Detection:
◦ After amplification, evaluate the PCR products using gel
electrophoresis or fluorescence detection methods as
applicable.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Compare the patient samples with controls. Positive control
should show the expected bands or signals, negative
controls should show no amplification.
◦ Record findings for each tick-borne pathogen assessed.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run a quality control check for each new reagent batch and new
PCR run.
• Document control results to verify the acceptability of the run.
• Troubleshoot and repeat any run where controls do not meet
expected outcomes.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Transfer and validate results in the LIS.
• Flag any abnormal results and notify the ordering physician if
necessary.
• Include quantitative and qualitative information about detected
pathogens.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Provide interpretation based on Ct values: Generally, a lower Ct
value indicates a higher amount of pathogen DNA in the sample.
• Negative result does not rule out the presence of tick-borne
pathogens situational evaluation is necessary.
8. REFERENCES:
Include references to pertinent guidelines, scientific literature, and
manufacturer’s manuals and inserts for the extraction kits, PCR
reagents, and equipment used.
9. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL:
• Follow biosafety guidelines for handling and disposing of
potentially infectious materials.
• Use biohazard containers for disposing of all non-reusable
materials.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Inconsistent results: Check equipment calibration, reagents'
expiration dates, and repeating the procedure with fresh controls.
• Positive control failure: Repeat the process including checking the
integrity of control reagents.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory scientists can ensure accurate
and reliable PCR results for the detection of tick-borne pathogens in
blood samples.
