Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Generating Results for Tickborne Bacterial PCR and
Sequencing, Blood
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical
procedures for generating results for the tickborne bacterial
PCR and sequencing test using blood specimens. This ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability in detecting tickborne
bacterial pathogens.
Responsibility: Laboratory scientists trained in molecular diagnostics
and sequencing techniques are responsible for performing and
documenting all analytical steps according to this procedure.
It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
procedure that may affect test results and bring them to the attention
of a supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the SOP
and addressing any issues or corrective actions.
1. DEFINITION Tickborne bacterial PCR and sequencing tests
involve the amplification and subsequent sequencing of
tickborne bacterial DNA from blood specimens. This test is used
for the identification of bacterial pathogens that are vectored by
ticks, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma
phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia spp., and Rickettsia spp.
2. PROCEDURE
A) PCR Amplification
1. Reagents and Supplies:
◦ DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen or similar)
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ Tickborne bacterial primers
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive and negative controls
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Retrieve blood specimens from storage. Ensure the
specimens are properly labeled and have been
accessioned.
◦ Perform DNA extraction according to the DNA extraction kit
manual. Use appropriate controls to monitor the extraction
process.
▪ Note the sample conditions (e.g., hemolysis, clots) and
report any issues.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C or proceed directly to PCR
amplification.
3. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the
manufacturer's specifications and add tickborne bacterial
primers.
◦ Aliquot the PCR Master Mix into PCR tubes or plates.
◦ Add the extracted DNA sample to the PCR tubes or plates.
Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Seal tubes or plates to prevent contamination.
4. PCR Cycling:
◦ Load the tubes or plates into the PCR machine.
◦ Program the PCR machine with the following cycle
parameters:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
▪ 30-40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (depending on
primer optimal conditions)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Ensure the PCR machine completes the cycles and store
the amplified products at 4°C until further analysis.
B) Sequencing
1. Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Sequencing kit (e.g., Illumina or similar)
◦ Sequencing primers
◦ Nucleotides
◦ Sequencing buffer
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Clean amplified PCR products using a purification kit to
remove residual primers and nucleotides.
◦ Quantify purified PCR products using a spectrophotometer
or similar quantification device.
3. Sequencing Setup:
◦ Prepare the sequencing Master Mix according to the
sequencing kit manual.
◦ Add the purified PCR products and sequencing primers to
the sequencing Master Mix.
◦ Load the samples into the sequencing instrument (follow the
manufacturer protocol).
4. Sequencing Run:
◦ Program the sequencing instrument with the appropriate
settings for microbial sequencing.
◦ Monitor the run for quality metrics and completion.
C) Data Analysis
1. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure the sequencing data passes quality control checks.
If data quality is insufficient, repeat sequencing or PCR
amplification steps.
◦ Check positive and negative controls for expected results.
2. Sequence Alignment:
◦ Align the sequenced data against reference bacterial
genomes using bioinformatics software (e.g., BLAST, BWA).
3. Identification:
◦ Identify tickborne bacterial pathogens by comparing aligned
sequences to a database of known tickborne bacterial
sequences.
4. Reporting Results:
◦ Document identified bacteria and associated quality metrics.
◦ Review results and verify for accuracy.
◦ Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and prepare patient reports, including information on
detected pathogens.
D) Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Controls:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch to
validate the test rigorously.
◦ Implement corrective actions if controls do not exhibit
expected results.
2. Troubleshooting Steps:
◦ Repeat the PCR amplification step with fresh reagents if
amplification fails.
◦ Re-purify PCR products if sequencing data quality is low.
◦ Consult with a supervisor and follow additional
troubleshooting procedures if repeated issues occur.
