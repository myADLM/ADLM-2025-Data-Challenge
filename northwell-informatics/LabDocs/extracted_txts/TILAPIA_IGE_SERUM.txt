Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TILAPIA, IgE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the proper procedures for the analysis, quality control, and
result documentation for Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) from serum
samples using the TILAPIA analytical platform in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to carry out the
following procedures to ensure that the analysis of serum IgE is
accurate, precise, and adheres to regulatory standards.
1. DEFINITIONS
• IgE (Immunoglobulin E): A class of antibodies associated with
allergic reactions.
• Serum: The clear fluid part of blood that remains after
coagulation, used for various diagnostic tests.
• TILAPIA: The automated platform used for analyzing IgE levels in
serum samples.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirement:
• Serum sample collected in a plain red-top or SST (serum-
separating tube).
• Minimum volume for analysis: 1 mL of serum.
• Properly labelled with patient information (patient name,
identification number, collection date, and time).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens with no identification or improper labelling.
• Specimens not stored or transported under suitable conditions
(4-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours, -20°C for longer storage).
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• TILAPIA automated analyzer.
• IgE reagent kits specific to TILAPIA.
• Quality control (QC) materials - two levels (high and low).
• Calibrators for the IgE assay.
• Necessary consumables such as pipettes, vials, and tubes.
Preparation and Calibration:
• Ensure the TILAPIA analyzer is powered on and all components
are functional.
• Perform routine maintenance according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Load appropriate reagents, QC materials, and calibrators into the
analyzer.
• Calibrate the assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Calibration is required:
▪ With each new batch of reagents.
▪ Following significant maintenance or software updates.
Sample Analysis:
1. Specimen Loading:
◦ Thaw any frozen serum samples to room temperature and
mix gently but thoroughly.
◦ Load serum samples into the designated sample rack of the
TILAPIA analyzer.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the IgE protocol on the TILAPIA analyzer.
◦ Assign sample identification in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and TILAPIA analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis and follow on-screen prompts.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples at the start of each shift and with every
batch of patient samples.
◦ Document QC results. Verify that they are within the
established control ranges.
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s instructions before
proceeding with patient samples.
Result Verification and Documentation:
• Review results generated by the TILAPIA analyzer.
• Verify results for any flagged or abnormal values.
• Confirm accurate specimen identification and match results in the
LIS.
• Document results according to facility-specific guidelines and
prepare the final report.
Reporting Results:
• Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by a technologist or
supervisor.
• Transmit verified results to the electronic medical record (EMR)
system.
• Critical results should be reported immediately to the requesting
physician and appropriately documented.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference ranges for IgE levels in serum should be referred to in
the specific package insert of the IgE reagent kit used.
Quality Control:
• Run internal controls as per routine schedule.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs periodically.
Troubleshooting:
• Refer to the TILAPIA user manual for detailed troubleshooting
procedures.
• Log all issues, corrective actions, and outcomes.
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for any limitations
associated with the IgE assay used on the TILAPIA platform.
Safety Considerations:
• Always follow laboratory biosafety regulations, wear appropriate
PPE, and handle all biological specimens using standard
precautions.
