Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
TIMOTHY GRASS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis, quality control, and
reporting of Timothy Grass-specific IgE in serum specimens using an
immunoassay method to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable
test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the test according to this SOP and adhere to all quality
control measures to ensure the integrity and accuracy of test results.
Supervisors must verify adherence to procedures and correct any
deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
◦ Specimen Type: Serum.
◦ Collection: Blood should be collected in an SST tube
(serum separator tube).
◦ Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum.
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ After centrifugation, serum must be separated from cells
within 2 hours of collection.
▪ Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days if testing
is delayed.
▪ For long-term storage, serum should be aliquoted and
stored at -20°C or colder.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia
ImmunoCAP or equivalent)
◦ Specific Timothy Grass, IgE assay kits and reagents
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to the assay
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerators and freezers with temperature logs
◦ PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are brought
to room temperature and properly mixed before use.
2. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions using the provided calibrators.
3. Perform daily maintenance checks on the immunoassay
analyzer, including verifying the status of reagents and
consumables.
B. QC and Calibration
1. Run quality control samples at two levels (high and low) at
the beginning of each shift or batch.
2. Verify that QC results are within the manufacturer’s
acceptable range before running patient samples.
3. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot, and correct
any issues before proceeding.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 1500 g for 10 minutes to
ensure clear separation of serum.
2. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
appropriate positions in the analyzer.
3. Select the assay for Timothy Grass, IgE, and initiate the
run.
4. Review the initial results for any flagged samples that may
indicate the need for repeat analysis.
4. RESULTS REPORTING
◦ Results are automatically transferred from the analyzer to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before final approval and release.
◦ Ensure any critical values are promptly communicated to the
requesting physician.
◦ Document all steps and observations in the laboratory
logbook or electronic system.
5. REFERENCE RANGES
◦ The reference range for Timothy Grass-specific IgE may
vary by age group and methodology.
◦ Refer to the specific assay kit insert for interpretation
guidelines regarding levels of specific IgE.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform and document routine calibration checks as
mandated.
◦ Utilize manufacturer-provided or laboratory-prepared
controls to ensure assay performance.
◦ Any deviations in QC must be addressed and documented
with corrective actions taken.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If QC or patient samples yield unexpected results, refer to
the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide.
◦ Common issues may include reagent expiration, equipment
malfunction, or sample integrity.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain logs of daily QC, calibrations, and maintenance
performed.
• Ensure all reports and data are appropriately stored in the LIS.
• Adhere to regulatory and laboratory standards for documentation.

This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated according to the
latest scientific guidelines and advancements in analytical
techniques. Any changes must be approved by the laboratory
supervisor before implementation.
