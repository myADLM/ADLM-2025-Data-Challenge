Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analysis and Reporting of TIN, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the analysis and reporting of TIN (Total
Iron Number) in blood samples using the appropriate equipment and
methodology in order to ensure consistent, accurate, and timely
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff responsible for performing TIN
analysis in blood samples in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis and documenting the results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff comply with this
procedure and for resolving any issues that arise during the
process.
• Quality control personnel are responsible for maintaining the
integrity of test results through routine QC procedures.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Pipette tips
• Assay reagent kits specific for Total Iron (commercially available)
• Distilled water
• Calibrators and controls provided by the assay reagent
manufacturer
• Laboratory glassware such as test tubes, beakers, and volumetric
flasks
• Protective equipment including gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation and Calibration
1. Ensure the spectrophotometer or AAS is properly calibrated as
per the manufacturer's instructions. Calibration should be
performed using the standards provided in the assay kit.
2. Set up the equipment according to the specific assay method
being used (refer to manufacturer’s manual).
5.2 Specimen Requirements
1. Collection of Specimen:
◦ Collect blood in a plain (no anticoagulant) red-top tube.
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled plastic tube for analysis.
2. Handling and Storage:
◦ Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
◦ Ensure specimens are free of hemolysis as it can interfere
with the analysis.
5.3 Assay Procedure
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Mix all reagents gently but thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Follow the assay reagent kit instructions for preparing sample
and calibration standards.
4. Pipette the serum samples, standards, and controls into the
corresponding wells of the microplate (if using an ELISA reader)
or into cuvettes (if using a spectrophotometer).
5. Add the appropriate volumes of reagents as specified by the
assay kit instructions.
6. Incubate the reaction mixture as instructed, commonly at 37°C
for a defined period.
7. Measure the absorbance or emission of each sample using the
spectrophotometer or AAS at the specified wavelength.
5.4 Quality Control
1. Run controls at the beginning and end of each batch of
samples to ensure accuracy.
2. Document all control results in the laboratory QC log.
3. If controls do not fall within the acceptable range:
◦ Recalibrate the instrument.
◦ Prepare new controls.
◦ Repeat the analysis for the affected batch.
5.5 Calculation and Reporting of Results
1. Using the standard curve generated with the calibration
standards, calculate the concentration of Total Iron in the serum
samples.
2. Convert the readings into appropriate units (µg/dL or mol/L).
3. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
5.6 Interpretation of Results
• Reference intervals for TIN (Total Iron Number) in serum:
◦ Men: 65-175 µg/dL
◦ Women: 50-170 µg/dL
• Results outside the reference intervals should be flagged and
reviewed for potential clinical significance.
• Critical values should be reported immediately to the requesting
physician according to the laboratory’s critical value policy.
6. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all data and observations are accurately recorded.
• Maintain electronic or paper records of all tests, including unique
patient identifiers, test dates, results, and technologist’s initials.
• Store QC logs, instrument calibration logs, and maintenance
records in compliance with laboratory policy.
7. REFERENCES
• Assay reagent manufacturer’s instructions (specific to the kit
used)
• Laboratory's internal Quality Management System (QMS)
documentation
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure that the
analysis of Total Iron Number (TIN) in blood samples is performed
consistently and accurately, in compliance with regulatory standards.
