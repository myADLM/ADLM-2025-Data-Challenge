Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Total Iron (TIN) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the
measurement of total iron (TIN) in serum samples using appropriate
analytical techniques to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting results as per the procedure.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed correctly, troubleshooting any issues, and validating the
results.
1. DEFINITION
Total Iron (TIN): Total iron refers to the measure of all the iron present
in the serum sample, including iron bound to proteins such as
transferrin.
Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid part of blood that remains after
coagulation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or chemistry analyzer
• Calibrated pipettes
• Test tubes or sample cups
• Reagents for iron determination (e.g., ferrozine-based reagent)
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high)
• Serum samples
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
1. PROCEDURE
Collection and Preparation of Specimens:
• Ensure specimens are collected in vacutainer tubes specifically
designed for serum collection (no anticoagulants).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge at 1500-2000 g for 10-15 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Aliquot serum immediately after centrifugation into labeled tubes if
not performing analysis immediately. Store at 2-8°C.
Equipment Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration of spectrophotometer or analyzer using
manufacturer-specific standards and procedures.
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) and ensure
values are within acceptable ranges. Document results.
Analysis Procedure:
• Prepare reagents as specified by the manufacturer.
• Allow serum samples and reagents to come to room temperature.
• Pipette specified volume of reagent and serum into appropriate
test tubes or sample cups.
• Mix gently and incubate as specified in the reagent protocol.
• Measure absorbance or concentration using the
spectrophotometer or analyzer.
• Document absorbance values and convert to iron concentration
using calibration curve or analyzer software.
Troubleshooting Steps:
• If controls fall outside acceptable range, recalibrate the instrument
and rerun controls.
• If sample results fall outside expected range, verify reagent
preparation and sample integrity.
• If persistent issues are found, notify the supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results from analyzer or manual calculation.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accuracy.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for critical values and additional
action required.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Typical reference intervals for serum iron in adults:
• Male: 65-176 µg/dL
• Female: 50-170 µg/dL
Note: Reference intervals may vary by population and must be
verified with your laboratory's established ranges.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
• Perform quality control checks for each batch of tests.
• Validate new reagent lots against established control samples.
• Document all quality control and validation activities in the
equipment logbook.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with results.
• Storage beyond recommended periods may lead to degradation
or changes in iron concentration.
• Align results with clinical context and other laboratory findings.
