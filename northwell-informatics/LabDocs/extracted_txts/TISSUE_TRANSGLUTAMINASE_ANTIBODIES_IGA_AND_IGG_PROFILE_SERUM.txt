Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Tissue Transglutaminase Antibodies,
IgA, and IgG Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and consistent analysis of Tissue
Transglutaminase Antibodies (tTG), IgA and IgG profile, in serum
samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP covers the procedures for analyzing serum samples for the
presence of tTG antibodies (IgA and IgG) in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
procedures accurately and adhere to the guidelines set forth in this
SOP. Any deviations or issues encountered during analysis should be
reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Serum samples.
• ELISA kits for Tissue Transglutaminase Antibodies (IgA and IgG).
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm.
• Micropipettes with disposable tips.
• Wash buffer.
• Diluent provided by the ELISA kit.
• TMB Substrate.
• Stop Solution.
• Calibrators and controls.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
◦ Calibrate micropipettes.
◦ Set up and calibrate the microplate reader to the appropriate
wavelength (450 nm).
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Use serum samples that have been properly centrifuged
and stored at the appropriate temperature. If frozen, thaw
samples at room temperature and mix thoroughly before
analysis.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Label the microplate according to the layout plan, ensuring
that each sample, calibrator, and control is appropriately
identified.
2. Sample and Calibrator Addition:
◦ Dilute the serum samples, calibrators, and controls
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Add the required volume of diluted samples, calibrators, and
controls to the corresponding wells on the microplate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at the recommended temperature
and for the specified time as per the ELISA kit instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly with the provided wash buffer.
Follow the washing instructions to ensure all unbound
components are removed.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the detection reagent (e.g., conjugate antibody) to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate as specified in the kit instructions.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the TMB substrate to each well and incubate for the
specified time without exposing the plate to direct light.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well using the microplate
reader set at 450 nm.
◦ Record the results.
C. Quality Control
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Ensure that both positive and negative controls provided in
the ELISA kit are included in each run.
◦ Verify that the control results fall within the established
acceptance criteria before reporting patient results.
2. Validation:
◦ Validate new reagent lots and new batches of calibrators
and controls with established QC materials before routine
use.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If control results fall outside the specified range, review the
procedure, reagents, and equipment. Investigate, document,
and repeat the analysis as necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Use the calibrators to create a standard curve.
• Determine the concentration of tTG antibodies in the patient
samples by comparing the absorbance values to the standard
curve.
• Report results in U/mL as suggested by the ELISA kit instructions.
• Flag results that fall outside the reference range and note any
potential abnormalities.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgA tTG: Typically <20 U/mL is considered negative, 20-30 U/mL
equivocal, and >30 U/mL positive.
• IgG tTG: Typically <20 U/mL is considered negative, 20-30 U/mL
equivocal, and >30 U/mL positive. *Note: Reference intervals may
vary based on specific kit instructions. Always refer to the
manufacturer's guidelines for interpretation.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples may interfere
with test results.
• Patients with IgA deficiency should be tested with IgG tTG assays
since a negative IgA result cannot rule out celiac disease in these
patients.
• Cross-reactivity with other autoantibodies may also occur.

• Manufacturer's instructions for the ELISA kit used.

10. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps of the procedure are recorded accurately in the
laboratory information system.
• Maintain records of all quality control and calibration data for
validation and audit purposes.
