Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Tissue Transglutaminase Antibody, IgA,
Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of testing Tissue Transglutaminase Antibody,
IgA, Serum that ensures accurate and reliable generation of
results to assist in the diagnosis of celiac disease.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
assay following this SOP, ensuring accurate documentation and
timely reporting of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Preferred/Acceptable: Serum specimen collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or standard red-top tube.
◦ Stability:
▪ Room Temperature: 1 day
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 3 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
heparin).
• Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens without clear identification, including patient name,
date, and time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA Reader or similar automated immunoassay analyzer
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Reagent kits specific for Tissue Transglutaminase Antibody,
IgA (approved commercial source)
◦ Quality control material
◦ Calibrators
◦ Deionized water
◦ Sample tubes and appropriate labels
2. PROCEDURE A) Preparation:
1. Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature.
2. Set up the ELISA Reader or automated immunoassay
analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and quality control
materials as per kit instructions.
B) Assay:
1. Calibrate the instrument using provided calibrators.
2. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and
serum samples into the appropriate wells of assay plates.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for performing the
assay, including incubation times and washing steps.
4. Develop the assay as outlined in the kit’s protocol.
5. Read the plates using the ELISA Reader or automated
immunoassay analyzer.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality control materials with each batch of
samples tested.
2. Ensure results fall within established quality control range.
3. Document quality control results in the appropriate log
and address any out-of-range values according to
corrective action procedures.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Transmit results from the analyzer to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify all results before reporting.
◦ Ensure any repeat critical values and their documentation
follow laboratory policy.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal: Negative
◦ Positive: Indication of possible celiac disease; values will be
quantitatively reported as per kit’s reference range.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Interference may arise from high levels of lipids,
hemoglobin, or bilirubin in samples.
◦ Other cross-reacting antibodies may affect the assay’s
specificity. Refer to the kit’s package insert for specific
limitations.
