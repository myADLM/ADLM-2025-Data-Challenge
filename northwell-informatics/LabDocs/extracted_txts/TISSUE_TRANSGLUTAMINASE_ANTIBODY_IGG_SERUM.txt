Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Tissue Transglutaminase
Antibody, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for tissue transglutaminase antibody, IgG, serum to
assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory scientists are instructed and
responsible for performing and documenting the tissue
transglutaminase antibody IgG serum analysis according to the
procedures outlined below.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Collection Container: Gold-top serum
separator tube (SST) or plain red-top tube Volume: Minimum of 0.5
mL of serum Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 30 days Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Supplies
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ELISA or
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay system)
• Calibrators and controls specific for the tissue transglutaminase
antibody IgG assay
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Timer
B. Reagent Preparation
• Prepare reagents according to manufacturer’s instructions
included in the reagent kit.
• Allow reagents to reach room temperature prior to use, if required.
• Ensure the reagents are within their expiration dates and store
appropriately as specified by the manufacturer.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Pre-analytical Preparation
◦ Centrifuge the serum specimen at 1500 g for 10 minutes to
obtain a clear supernatant.
◦ Transfer the serum to a clean tube if necessary, avoiding
any hemolysis.
2. Calibration and Quality Control
◦ Load the calibrators and controls onto the immunoassay
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform calibration verification before running patient
samples.
◦ Ensure that quality control materials are analyzed, and
results fall within the acceptable ranges prior to proceeding
with the analysis of patient samples.
3. Sample Processing
◦ Program the assay parameters into the analyzer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load the prepared serum samples onto the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the assay run on the analyzer.
4. Result Generation
◦ The analyzer will automatically process the samples and
generate results for tissue transglutaminase antibody IgG
levels in the serum.
◦ Review the generated results for any errors or flags.
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
D. Post-analytical Actions
1. Result Verification
◦ Verify results by cross-checking with quality control
outcomes and ensuring calibration is acceptable.
◦ Investigate and take corrective actions for any flagged or
abnormal results according to troubleshooting protocols
specified by the manufacturer.
2. Data Documentation
◦ Document all generated results appropriately including date,
time, analyst initials, and any corrective actions taken in the
results verification log.
◦ Confirm transmission of results to the LIS and patient record
system.
E. Reporting Results
1. Transmission
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS once
verified.
◦ Ensure proper documentation in the LIS for final reporting.
2. Review and Verification
◦ Confirm that all results generated have been reviewed,
documented, and verified before final reporting.
◦ Check for any discrepancies or required follow-up regarding
flagged results.
◦ If necessary, repeat analysis or perform additional testing
according to standard lab procedures.
3. Critical Values
◦ Communicate any critical results according to the
laboratory’s critical value reporting policy.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of communication of critical
values.
4. Result Reporting
◦ Reference intervals and interpretation guidelines are noted
in the report according to standard lab protocols.
◦ Results and interpretations are reviewed and signed off by
the responsible laboratory personnel before releasing to the
clinician.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
• External quality control materials are analyzed at specific intervals
to ensure assay precision and accuracy.
• Validate new lots of reagents, calibrators, and controls with
comparison and acceptance criteria.
• Maintain compliance with CLIA standards and manufacturer
guidelines for assay performance.
