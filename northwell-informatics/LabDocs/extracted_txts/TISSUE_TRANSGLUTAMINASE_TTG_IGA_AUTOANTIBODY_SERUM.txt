Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Tissue Transglutaminase (TTG), IgA,
Autoantibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable analysis of Tissue Transglutaminase
(TTG) IgA autoantibodies in serum specimens, following
standardized procedures for the detection of antibodies associated
with Celiac Disease.
2. SCOPE
This protocol covers the analytical steps to be performed by
laboratory personnel for the analysis of TTG IgA autoantibodies in
serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the assay, document
observations and results, and follow all quality control and
assurance procedures.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to SOPs and manage corrective
actions as needed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
• Storage/Transport Conditions: Store/transport the serum
specimens refrigerated at 2-8°C. If the assay will not be
performed within 72 hours, store specimens frozen at -20°C or
colder.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) reader
• ELISA washing system
• TTG IgA ELISA kit
• Micropipettes and tips (various sizes)
• Reagent reservoirs
• Calibrators and controls
• Plate shaker
• Timer
• Laboratory glassware and disposable materials
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparing Reagents and Controls
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents to come to room temperature before use.
2. Calibrators and Controls:
◦ Prepare the calibrators and controls as per the TTG IgA
ELISA kit instructions.
◦ Ensure the use of high, medium, low, and negative controls
for each assay run.
B) Sample Preparation
1. Handling Serum Specimens:
◦ Thaw frozen serum specimens at room temperature.
◦ Mix each specimen gently by inversion.
◦ Centrifuge samples if any particulates are visible.
C) Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Determine the number of wells needed for samples,
calibrators, controls, and blanks.
◦ Set up the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Loading the Plate:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and serum
specimens into appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate three times with prepared wash buffer,
ensuring complete removal of liquid each time to prevent
cross-contamination.
4. Adding Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate into each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate five times with prepared wash buffer.
6. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 10-15 minutes in
the dark, monitoring for color development.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 30 minutes of adding stop solution.
D) Quality Control
1. Intra-Assay QC:
◦ Include both positive and negative controls in each assay
run.
◦ Compare the absorbance values with expected control
ranges; repeat the assay if controls fall outside specified
limits.
2. Inter-Assay QC:
◦ Perform proficiency testing as scheduled, and consistently
track QC trends.
E) Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Results Calculation:
◦ Calculate the sample results based on the calibration curve.
◦ Use software associated with the ELISA reader for data
analysis and interpret the units (U/mL) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Reference Intervals:
◦ Reference ranges for TTG IgA levels should be provided by
the kit insert and adjusted if necessary based on laboratory
standards.
F) Documentation and Reporting
1. Record Keeping:
◦ Document all observations, temperature logs, assay
conditions, and any deviations.
◦ Enter results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System) and
review for accuracy.
2. Reporting:
◦ Only verify and report results that meet QC criteria.
◦ Report critical values immediately to the requesting
physician.
G) Troubleshooting
1. Out-of-range results:
◦ Verify specimen integrity and repeat the assay if necessary.
◦ Record any troubleshooting steps taken and corrective
actions performed.
H) References
1. Manufacturer’s Instructions:
◦ Follow detailed instructions provided by the ELISA kit
manufacturer for assay components, limitations, and
precautions.
2. QC Guidelines:
◦ Adhere to specific laboratory quality control guidelines and
protocols.
