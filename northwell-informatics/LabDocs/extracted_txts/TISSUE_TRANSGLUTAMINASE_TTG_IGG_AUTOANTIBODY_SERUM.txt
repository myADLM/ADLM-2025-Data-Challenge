Standard Operating Procedure for Tissue
Transglutaminase (tTG) IgG Autoantibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to perform and generate
results for Tissue Transglutaminase (tTG) IgG autoantibody testing in
serum samples. It ensures standardized laboratory practices, thereby
providing accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory staff in the Immunology
department who are trained to perform the tTG IgG autoantibody test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the tTG IgG autoantibody testing in accordance with this
SOP, to document all necessary data, and to report the results
accurately.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL of serum.
• Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 7 days of
collection. For long-term storage, specimens must be frozen at
-20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 24 hours.
• Specimens received in incorrect containers (e.g., EDTA, citrate, or
heparin tubes).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader and Washer.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Microplates and microwell strips specific to the assay.
• Reagents specific to the tTG IgG ELISA kit, including:
◦ Coated microwell plates.
◦ Conjugate reagent.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Wash buffer.
◦ Standards and controls (positive and negative).
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before beginning the assay.
2. Prepare the wash buffer as per kit instructions.
3. Label the microplate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples.
Assay Procedure:
1. Dilution of Samples:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:101 by adding 10 µL of
serum to 1 mL of diluent provided in the kit.
◦ Mix well.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted standards, controls, and patient
samples to the designated wells.
◦ Use separate pipette tips for each sample to prevent cross-
contamination.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 4 times with the prepared wash buffer,
ensuring complete removal of liquid after each wash cycle.
5. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Second Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 4 times with the prepared wash buffer.
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the
dark (avoid direct light).
8. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of the stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
9. Reading the Results:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
Calculation of Results:
1. Calculate the mean OD for each standard, control, and patient
sample.
2. Plot a standard curve using the mean OD values of the
standards.
3. Determine the IgG tTG concentration of the patient samples by
comparing their OD values to the standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls with every assay run to
ensure test validity.
2. Verify that control values fall within the established ranges. If
controls are out of range, investigate and troubleshoot before
reporting patient results.
3. Document all controls, standards, and patient sample readings
in the logbook or LIMS.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed and validated by the technologist.
• Report the tTG IgG concentrations in U/mL (units per milliliter).
• If results are outside the reportable range, repeat the assay or
request a new sample as necessary.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for entering results into the LIS.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <20 U/mL
• Weak Positive: 20-30 U/mL
• Positive: >30 U/mL
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
results.
• Environmental conditions or improper sample handling may also
affect assay performance.
11. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS
• Personnel must be trained and competent in performing ELISA
techniques and interpreting results.
12. REFERENCES
• Package insert of the tTG IgG ELISA kit.
• Laboratory-specific manuals and quality control guidelines.
13. REVISION HISTORY
• Document the history of all SOP revisions including dates and
changes made.
14. APPROVAL
• This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
director or designated authority.
