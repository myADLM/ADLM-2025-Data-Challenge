Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TITANIUM, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Titanium in 24-hour urine specimens. This
includes specimen preparation, instrument calibration, analysis,
quality control, and result reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
this test within the stipulated guidelines to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• 24-hour urine collection properly labeled with the total urine
volume and collection time clearly indicated.
• No preservatives should be added to the urine collection
container.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine specimens without volume or time of collection information.
• Urine specimens collected for longer than 24 hours.
• Specimens contaminated with feces.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Clean polypropylene tubes and containers for sample handling.
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS).
• Temperature controlled centrifuge.
Reagents:
• High-purity nitric acid.
• High-purity deionized water.
• Titanium standard solutions for calibration.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Sample Handling and Preparation:
◦ Mix the entire 24-hour urine collection well and measure the
total volume.
◦ Aliquot 10 mL of well-mixed urine into a clean polypropylene
tube.
◦ Record the 24-hour urine volume and aliquot volume on the
requisition form.
◦ In case of delay, store samples refrigerated at 2-8°C and
bring to room temperature before analysis.
2. Preparation of Standards:
◦ Prepare a series of calibration standards by diluting a high
concentration Titanium stock standard solution with high-
purity deionized water to the desired concentration range
covering the expected levels in urine.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Calibration:
◦ Turn on the ICP-MS or AAS and allow it to warm up
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Calibrate the instrument using the prepared Titanium
standards.
◦ Run a blank after each standard to ensure no carryover
occurs.
◦ Document calibration details in the instrument logbook.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of quality control (QC) samples (low and high
concentration) before analyzing patient samples.
◦ QC samples must be within the established range. If not,
recalibrate the instrument and repeat with QC samples.
◦ Document all QC results in the Quality Control log.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Sample Analysis Using ICP-MS or AAS:
◦ Analyze the urine samples following the instrument’s user
manual.
◦ Dilute samples as necessary if they fall outside the
calibration curve.
◦ Ensure samples analyzed are within the calibration range
for accurate results.
2. Data Acquisition:
◦ Record the analytical results of the Titanium concentration
from the instrument.
◦ Document sample processing details (volume, dilution
factor) and initial results for traceability.
6. POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
Reporting Results:
1. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Titanium in the 24-hour urine
sample by factoring in the total volume collection.
◦ Results should be reported in micrograms per 24 hours (µg/
24h).
2. Verification and Validation:
◦ Review all results for accuracy.
◦ Compare the QC results with patient results to ensure
validity.
◦ Validate results schematically and update the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) with the patient’s Titanium results.
3. Critical Results Handling:
◦ Notify the supervising laboratory technologist or pathologist
if results exceed the established critical range.
◦ Follow protocol for documenting and communicating critical
results to the appropriate healthcare provider.
Sample Storage and Disposal:
1. Retention:
◦ Retain samples at 2-8°C for a period of at least one week
after reporting results to allow for any necessary reanalysis.
2. Disposal:
◦ Dispose of urine specimens and any hazardous chemical
waste according to laboratory safety and biohazard
regulations.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ICP-MS or AAS.
• Laboratory safety guidelines.
• Standard medical laboratory practices and regulatory
requirements.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Maintain all records of sample handling, instrument calibration,
quality control, and patient results according to the laboratory’s
protocol and CLIA guidelines.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
Follow the instrument manual for troubleshooting steps for any errors
encountered during analysis. Keep a log of encountered issues and
steps taken for resolution.
