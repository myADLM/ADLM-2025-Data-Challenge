Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TITANIUM, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the accurate and efficient
analysis of Titanium levels in blood samples collected for clinical
diagnosis and research studies.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff will perform the titanium analysis as defined in
this procedure.
• All staff are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the testing
process, identifying any deficiencies, and informing a supervisor if
an issue arises.
• Supervisors must ensure that proper training and regular
assessments of staff are conducted to maintain adherence to this
protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top tube) or heparinized
tubes (green-top tube) maintained at room temperature.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Clotted samples
• Specimens stored at temperatures exceeding acceptable limits
(2-8°C for short-term storage up to 48 hours).
Specimen Handling:
• A minimum of 3 mL of whole blood is required for the analysis.
• Ensure specimens are mixed thoroughly but gently to prevent
hemolysis and clot formation.
• All samples must be clearly labeled with the patient’s identification
and the time and date of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• EDTA or heparinized blood collection tubes
• Lab-specific software for data collection and result interpretation
• Traceable control materials for quality assurance
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibration standards for titanium
1. REAGENTS
• Deionized water
• Nitric acid for sample digestion
• Calibration standards for titanium solution
• Internal standard solution (e.g., scandium or yttrium)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify and document the identity of each blood sample.
2. Aliquot a specified volume of the blood sample into a centrifuge
tube.
3. Add an appropriate amount of nitric acid to digest the blood
sample. Follow the safety procedures while handling the acid.
4. Perform a digest in a microwave digestion system, if
prescribed, to ensure complete dissolution of blood
components.
5. Allow digested samples to cool, then dilute with deionized water
to a final volume that fits the working range of the ICP-MS
instrument.
B. Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Ensure the ICP-MS instrument is clean and free from
contamination.
2. Load the calibration standards into the instrument, starting with
the blank.
3. Calibrate the instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring a linear calibration curve for titanium
detection.
4. Use an internal standard to correct potential drift and matrix
effects during the analysis.
C. Analysis:
1. Load prepared sample tubes into the autosampler.
2. Follow the ICP-MS software protocol to initiate the analysis.
3. Review real-time data and ensure internal standard recovery
falls within acceptable limits.
4. Perform sample analysis in sequence, ensuring proper quality
controls are run alongside patient samples.
D. Data Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Use lab-specific software to collect and interpret the raw data.
2. Verify that all quality control results are within acceptable limits
before validating patient results.
3. Examine the concentration values of titanium, converting to the
required units (e.g., µg/L or ng/mL).
4. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and final verification.
5. Report any critical results following standard guidelines and
inform appropriate healthcare personnel immediately.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
run, as well as periodically throughout the batch.
• Document and review all quality control results to ensure integrity
and accuracy.
• If any quality control sample is outside the acceptable range, do
not release patient results until the issue is resolved.
• Employ proficiency testing and participate in external quality
assessment programs to routinely evaluate the method's
performance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences from other metal ions in the blood may affect the
accuracy of titanium measurement.
• Hemolysis may falsely elevate titanium levels, thus hemolyzed
samples must be rejected.
• Instrument maintenance and calibration must be conducted
regularly to prevent contamination and ensure consistent results.
