Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Titanium/Creatinine Ratio, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To ensure a standardized and reliable method for the analysis and
reporting of Titanium/Creatinine Ratio in random urine samples.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting results, and taking corrective actions when
necessary. Supervisors are responsible for oversight and ensuring
adherence to this procedure.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Creatinine analyzer (e.g., Jaffe reaction method or enzymatic
method)
• Reagent grade nitric acid (HNO3)
• Deionized water
• Certified reference materials for titanium and creatinine
• Laboratory glassware (volumetric flasks, graduated cylinders,
pipettes, etc.)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Urine collection containers
• Quality control materials (high and low levels)
• Calibrated traceable thermometers
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• Random urine samples collected in clean, sterile containers.
Sample volume should be at least 10 mL.
• Specimens should be sent to the laboratory within 6 hours of
collection. If samples are refrigerated, they should be brought to
room temperature prior to analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 6 hours after
collection.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens contaminated or visibly damaged.
• Specimens in non-standard containers.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Label all urine samples with patient identification and collection
time/date.
• If the sample was refrigerated, bring it to room temperature prior
to analysis.
B) Titanium Analysis:
• Prepare samples by diluting urine with 1% nitric acid solution in a
ratio of 1:10 (1 part urine to 9 parts nitric acid solution).
• Calibrate the ICP-MS with certified titanium standards to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
• Run quality control samples before analyzing patient samples to
validate instrument performance.
• Aspirate the prepared samples into the ICP-MS and measure
titanium concentration.
• Record the titanium concentration in ng/mL from the spectral
output.
C) Creatinine Analysis:
• Set up the creatinine analyzer and calibrate using certified
creatinine standards.
• Use either the Jaffe reaction method or enzymatic method based
on the specific instrument's instructions.
• Run quality control samples to ensure accuracy and reliability.
• Measure the creatinine concentration in urine following the
instrument’s standard operating procedures.
• Record the creatinine concentration in mg/dL.
D) Calculating Titanium/Creatinine Ratio:
• Calculate the Titanium/Creatinine ratio by dividing the measured
titanium concentration (ng/mL) by the measured creatinine
concentration (mg/dL).
• Multiply by 1000 to normalize the ratio (ng/mg).
E) Documentation:
• Enter the Titanium/Creatinine ratio into the laboratory information
system (LIS) along with the raw data for both titanium and
creatinine.
• Document the date, time, and initials of the staff member
performing the analysis.
F) Reporting Results:
• Verify the results for accuracy and completeness.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines, including any
comments related to sample integrity or analytical anomalies.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples
analyzed, using high and low concentration materials.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
• If QC fails, do not report results until cause is identified and
corrected.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s inserts for the ICP-MS and creatinine
analyzer for method-specific limitations and interferences. The
accuracy may be impacted by the presence of other metals or
substances in the urine.
