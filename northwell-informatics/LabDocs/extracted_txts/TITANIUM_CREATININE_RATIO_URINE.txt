Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Procedure for
Titanium/Creatinine Ratio, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the determination of the Titanium/
Creatinine Ratio in urine samples, ensuring accurate and reliable test
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel performing the Titanium/
Creatinine Ratio test in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Conduct analysis and ensure all steps
are followed accurately.
• Supervisors: Ensure technologists are properly trained and the
procedure is followed correctly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Random urine sample, preferably the
second morning void.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 10 mL of urine.
• Handling:
◦ Urine samples must be collected in a clean, dry container.
◦ Samples should be refrigerated if there is a delay in testing
exceeding 2 hours.
◦ Ensure specimens are clearly labeled with patient information
and collection time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Balance
• Centrifuge
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
• Reagents:
◦ Standard Titanium Solution
◦ Standard Creatinine Solution
◦ Urine Diluent
• Disposable pipettes
• Sample tubes and vials
• Calibrated measuring instruments
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal quality control samples (one normal and one high) must
be prepared and run with each batch of patient specimens.
• Quality control samples should be prepared according to the
manufacturer's instructions and stored as recommended.
• Results for quality control must fall within the specified range
before proceeding with patient samples.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the urine sample well before use.
◦ If the sample contains precipitates, centrifuge at 3,000 RPM
for 10 minutes and decant the supernatant for analysis.
B. Analytical Steps
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS)
or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-
MS) with Titanium and Creatinine standards according to
the instrument manual.
◦ Prepare a calibration curve with the standards to ensure
linearity.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Dilute the urine sample with the urine diluent in a ratio
appropriate for the instrument used (typically 1:10 for AAS
and 1:20 for ICP-MS).
◦ Analyze the diluted sample for Titanium concentration using
AAS or ICP-MS.
◦ Analyze the same diluted sample for Creatinine
concentration using a creatinine specific assay, typically an
enzymatic or colorimetric method.
3. Calculations:
◦ Record the Titanium concentration (in µg/L) and the
Creatinine concentration (in mg/dL) from the instrument
outputs.
◦ Calculate the Titanium/Creatinine ratio with the formula: [
\text{Titanium/Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{\text{Titanium
concentration (µg/L)}}{\text{Creatinine concentration (mg/
dL)}} ]
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the calculated Titanium/Creatinine ratio for each patient
sample.
• Cross-check results with quality control samples to ensure
accuracy.
• Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
with results verified by a qualified technologist.
• Note any abnormalities or significant findings and refer them to a
supervisor for further review.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Titanium/Creatinine Ratio normal range: To be determined based
on laboratory validation studies or referenced from relevant
medical literature.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of analytical
instruments to avoid deviation in results.
• Contaminated or improperly handled specimens may lead to
inaccurate results.
• This procedure is accurate for Titanium concentrations within the
dynamic range of the calibrated instruments.
