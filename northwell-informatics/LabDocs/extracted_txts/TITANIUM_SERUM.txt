Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Titanium in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear, step-by-step instructions for the determination of
Titanium levels in serum in order to ensure the accuracy, precision,
and reliability of test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
titanium analysis according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring that all necessary training is completed and that the
protocol is followed correctly.
1. DEFINITIONS
Titanium: A chemical element, atomic number 22, tested here in
serum samples to assess exposure or for other clinical reasons.
1. PRINCIPLE
Serum titanium levels are determined using Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). This technique allows for
accurate detection of trace elements by ionizing the sample with an
inductively coupled plasma and measuring the mass-to-charge ratio
of the ions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a trace element-free
(royal blue-top) tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Handling: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C. If analysis is delayed beyond 48
hours, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat,
gloves, and safety goggles when handling specimens and
reagents.
• Follow all safety guidelines for handling and disposing of
biological and chemical wastes.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Certified titanium standards
• Trace element-free calibrators and controls
• Ultrapure water
• Laboratory-grade nitric acid and hydrochloric acid
1. PROCEDURE
8.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare calibration standards using certified titanium standards at
concentrations appropriate for the expected range in patient
samples.
• Include a blank and at least three levels of quality control samples
with each run.
• Calibrate the ICP-MS following the manufacturer’s instructions,
ensuring all calibration checks are within acceptable limits.
8.2 Sample Preparation
• Thaw frozen samples as needed and bring all samples to room
temperature.
• Vortex each serum sample gently to mix.
• Transfer an aliquot of serum (~0.5 mL) to a clean trace element-
free tube for analysis.
• Prepare and include a matrix-matched calibration blank and
quality control samples.
8.3 Analysis
• Load the prepared serum samples, calibration standards, quality
control samples, and blanks onto the ICP-MS autosampler.
• Initiate the ICP-MS run, ensuring that the instrument is
appropriately set up to detect titanium using the manufacturer’s
specified conditions.
• Monitor the run for acceptable instrument performance,
addressing any alarms or warnings as they arise.
8.4 Data Analysis
• Upon completion of the run, verify that the calibration curve
performance meets acceptance criteria (generally, correlation
coefficient ≥ 0.995).
• Confirm the quality control samples are within ±15% of the target
value.
• Review the sample data for any outliers or anomalies. If any are
found, repeat the analysis for those samples.
• Calculate the titanium concentration in the patient serum samples
from the calibration curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the titanium concentrations in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Validate and release results according to the laboratory’s standard
practices for review and reporting.
• Document any procedural deviations or issues encountered
during analysis.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in patient samples can potentially
interfere with titanium measurement.
• Proper sample handling and preparation are crucial to minimize
contamination risks.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manual and guidelines for the ICP-MS.
• Certified reference materials documentation.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards from CLIA, CAP, and other
accrediting bodies.
