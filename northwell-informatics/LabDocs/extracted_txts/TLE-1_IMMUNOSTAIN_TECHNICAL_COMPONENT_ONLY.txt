Standard Operating Procedure
Title: TLE-1 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the technical component
of TLE-1 immunostaining in the laboratory. It provides detailed
instructions for handling, processing, staining, and analyzing
tissue samples using the TLE-1 immunostain to ensure
accurate and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel who perform immunohistochemical
staining are responsible for following this SOP. Supervisors and
senior technologists are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this procedure and addressing any issues that arise during
its execution.
3. DEFINITION
TLE-1 (Transducing-like enhancer of split 1) is an
immunohistochemical marker used primarily for the diagnosis of
synovial sarcoma. This protocol refers to the technical
component only, including tissue preparation, staining, and
initial analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Positive and negative control tissues
◦ TLE-1 primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody reagent (HRP-conjugated)
◦ DAB substrate kit
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Coverslips
◦ Slides and slide holder
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
◦ Humidified chamber
◦ Incubator set to 37ºC
◦ Xylene
◦ Graded Alcohol series (100%, 95%, 70% alcohol)
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Eosin
◦ Digital microscope/scanner
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Tissue Preparation
1. Embed the tissue samples in paraffin.
2. Section the tissue into 4-5 µm thick slices using a microtome.
3. Float the sections on a water bath (approximately 40ºC) and
pick up with pre-labeled glass slides.
4. Allow the slides to air dry, then incubate at 60ºC for 1 hour to
adhere the tissue sections firmly.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place the slides in xylene for 5 minutes, repeat this step two
additional times.
2. Rehydrate the slides through a series of graded alcohols:
◦ 100% alcohol for 2 minutes, two times.
◦ 95% alcohol for 2 minutes.
◦ 70% alcohol for 2 minutes.
3. Rinse the slides in running tap water for 2 minutes.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Place the slides in a preheated citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0).
2. Heat the buffer solution in a microwave for 10-20 minutes until
the solution begins to boil.
3. Allow the slides to cool in the buffer solution at room
temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse the slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
5.4 Blocking Steps
1. Encircle the tissue sections on the slides with a hydrophobic
pen.
2. Incubate the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
3. Wash the slides in PBS for 5 minutes, three times.
5.5 Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the TLE-1 primary antibody to each section
(approximately 50-100 µL per section).
2. Place the slides in a humidified chamber and incubate for 1
hour at room temperature or overnight at 4ºC.
3. Wash the slides with PBS for 5 minutes, three times.
5.6 Secondary Antibody Incubation and Detection
1. Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody reagent to each
slide.
2. Incubate the slides in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
3. Wash the slides with PBS for 5 minutes, three times.
4. Prepare the DAB substrate solution according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
5. Apply the DAB substrate to each tissue section and monitor the
development of the stain under a light microscope.
6. Once the desired staining is achieved (usually 1-5 minutes),
rinse the slides in running tap water to stop the reaction.
5.7 Counterstaining
1. Dip the slides in hematoxylin for 30 seconds to counterstain.
2. Rinse the slides in running tap water for 2 minutes.
3. For differentiation, dip the slides briefly in 1% acid alcohol (1%
HCl in 70% alcohol) for 1-2 quick dips.
4. Rinse the slides in running tap water until the sections turn a
blue hue.
5. Dip the slides in 95% alcohol, then 100% alcohol, and finally
xylene to clear.
5.8 Mounting
1. Apply a mounting medium to each slide.
2. Place a coverslip over the tissue sections, ensuring there are
no air bubbles.
3. Allow the sections to dry at room temperature.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use positive and negative control tissues with each batch of
TLE-1 staining to ensure staining specificity and sensitivity.
◦ Document the use and results of control tissues in a
logbook.
◦ Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment.
5. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
Technicians review stained slides under the microscope or use
a digital slide scanner for virtual diagnostics. Ensure all areas of
interest are well-stained, and compare tissue staining intensity
with control tissues. Report findings to pathologists for
diagnostic interpretation.
