Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Tobramycin, Peak, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To ensure precise and accurate analysis of Tobramycin, Peak,
Plasma levels in patient samples, utilizing standardized procedures
to generate clinical results.
Responsibility: Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing this analysis as outlined in this procedure. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing any
deviations.
1. DEFINITIONS
Tobramycin: An aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat various types
of bacterial infections. Peak Level: The highest concentration of the
drug in the patient's bloodstream, typically measured shortly after
administering the dose. Plasma: The clear, yellowish fluid portion of
blood from which the red and white blood cells and platelets are
removed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detection or equivalent (e.g., LC-MS/MS)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated plasma samples
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Calibration standards for Tobramycin
• Mobile phase solvents (HPLC-grade)
• Sample vials and caps
• Volumetric flasks
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma collected from whole blood
centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection and stored at -20°C if
not immediately analyzed.
• Specimen Volume: 2 mL of plasma.
1. SPECIMEN PREPARATION
2. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature.
3. Vortex the samples for 30 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
4. Centrifuge the samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any potential particulates.
5. CALIBRATION AND QC
6. Prepare calibration standards according to manufacturer’s
instructions and perform a calibration curve with each analytical
run.
7. Prepare and analyze quality control samples (low, medium, and
high concentration) at the beginning, middle, and end of the
analysis batch.
8. PROCEDURE
9. Set up and calibrate the HPLC system according to the
instrument’s operating manual.
10. Prepare the mobile phase and flush the HPLC system to
equilibrate the column.
11. Inject calibration standards and QCs to validate the system
performance.
12. Once validated, load the prepared plasma samples into the
HPLC autosampler.
13. Inject each sample and record the respective chromatograms.
14. Determine the concentration of Tobramycin by comparing the
sample's peak area to the calibration curve.
15. Verify the results to ensure all QC criteria are met. Re-run any
samples not meeting the established criteria.
16. REPORTING RESULTS
17. Confirm that the QC samples are within the acceptable range
before reporting any patient results.
18. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
19. The results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before transmission to the healthcare provider.
20. QUALITY CONTROL
21. All calibration standards and QC samples must be within the
established ranges. If not, troubleshooting steps should be
taken to resolve the issues before patient results are reported.
22. Use internal controls to monitor daily performance and external
proficiency tests as recommended by relevant guidelines.
23. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
24. Regularly maintain all instrumentation per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
25. Document any troubleshooting measures and corrective actions
taken for instrument errors or QC failures.

• Manufacturer’s instrument operation manual.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of
Tobramycin.
• Laboratory’s internal documented procedures.
1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
2. Ensure all logs, including calibration curves, QC values,
maintenance logs, and deviation reports, are kept updated.
3. Follow all safety and waste disposal guidelines as per
laboratory protocols and regulatory requirements.
