Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Tobramycin, Peak, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analysis of Tobramycin levels
at peak concentrations in serum samples. This protocol ensures
accurate, precise, and timely results essential for clinical decision-
making.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to clinical laboratory personnel responsible for
the analytical testing of Tobramycin peak serum levels using
appropriate immunoassay or chromatographic techniques.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the tests as
outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
updating the protocol as necessary and ensuring compliance.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube (no anticoagulants or serum-
separating agents)
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood samples 30-60 minutes after the end of an
intravenous dose of Tobramycin to assess peak levels.
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for 30-45 minutes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples
• Samples not correctly labeled with patient identification and
collection time
• Samples greater than 48 hours old without proper storage
Stability:
• At room temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or below): 1 month
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or HPLC system
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• Tobramycin calibrators (stored per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Tobramycin control material (two levels, e.g., low and high)
• Appropriate reagents for chosen method (immunoassay kit or
HPLC solvents and supplies)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Start by reviewing the instrument’s user manual and reagent
package inserts.
2. Verify that all reagents and calibrators are within their expiration
date and have been stored per manufacturer instructions.
3. Program the analyzer following the manufacturer’s instructions
for tobramycin peak level analysis.
Pre-analytical Steps:
1. Centrifuge the clotted blood specimen at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes.
2. Carefully transfer the serum to a secondary labeled tube using
a pipette. Avoid transferring any cells or clot material.
Analytical Steps:
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
2. Ensure the instrument and reagents are correctly set up and
run the specified tobramycin methodology (immunoassay or
HPLC).
3. Perform the assay according to the analyzer's operating
procedures.
◦ For immunoassay: Follow steps as per the reagent kit
instructions.
◦ For HPLC: Ensure the appropriate mobile phase, flow rate,
and detection parameters are set.
Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control materials (low and high levels) with each
batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure results of controls fall within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
3. Document QC results in the appropriate log.
Reporting Results:
1. Review all results for accuracy and precision.
2. If QC results are within acceptable limits, validate patient
results.
3. Record and report results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
Reference Intervals:
• Typical therapeutic peak range: 5–10 µg/mL
• Critical values: Adjust as per institutional guidelines.
7. PROCEDURE LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored samples can lead to inaccurate
results.
• Ensure the linearity of the method to cover all clinically relevant
concentration ranges.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC fails, repeat the control run. If the problem persists,
investigate potential causes including reagent issues, instrument
malfunction, or sample issues.
• Refer to the instrument troubleshooting guide or contact technical
support for persistent issues.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Log all results, QC data, and maintenance activities.
• Record any deviations or anomalies in the analytical process and
report to the supervisor.
