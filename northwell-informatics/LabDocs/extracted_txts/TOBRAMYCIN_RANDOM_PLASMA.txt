Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results of
TOBRAMYCIN, RANDOM, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to analyze and generate results for
tobramycin concentrations in random plasma specimens. This
ensures accurate and timely results for clinical decision-making.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis and reporting of tobramycin
levels in random plasma specimens by designated staff in the clinical
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in the analytical procedures and quality
control measures for tobramycin testing are responsible for
performing this analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
4.1. Specimen Type: - Plasma collected in lithium heparin or EDTA
tubes.
4.2. Specimen Volume: - Minimum volume: 1 mL.
4.3. Specimen Handling: - Centrifuge the sample at 1,500 - 2,000 x
g for 10 minutes to separate plasma from cells. - Transfer the plasma
into a labeled, aliquot tube. - Store the plasma at 2-8°C if analysis is
performed within 48 hours. - For storage beyond 48 hours, store the
plasma at -20°C or colder.
4.4. Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed specimens. -
Specimens not appropriately labeled or without collection date/time. -
Specimens collected in incorrect tubes (e.g., sodium fluoride/oxalate,
citrate, heparin other than lithium).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1. Equipment: - Centrifuge - Pipettes and tips - Freezers (2-8°C
and -20°C) - Refrigerated racks - Analytical Instrument (e.g., HPLC,
immunoassay analyzer) - Calibrated volumetric glassware - Water
bath or heating block (if needed)
5.2. Reagents: - Calibration standards for tobramycin - Quality
control materials (QC) - Reagent kits specific to the analytical
platform - Mobile phase solutions (if using HPLC)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Calibration and Quality Control Preparation: - Follow
manufacturer instructions for the preparation of calibration standards.
- Prepare and run quality control samples (low, medium, high)
alongside patient specimens to ensure the instrument is working
within acceptable ranges.
6.2. Instrument Setup and Calibration: - Perform daily
maintenance and calibration of the instrument as per the
manufacturer's instructions. - Ensure the instrument is properly
calibrated using certified calibration standards for tobramycin. -
Document calibration and QC results.
6.3. Sample Analysis: - Label testing tubes with the appropriate
patient identifiers. - Pipette the required volume of plasma into
labeled testing tubes. - Add any required reagent or buffer to the
testing tubes as per manufacturer instructions. - Load the samples,
calibrators, and QC samples into the analytical instrument. - Initiate
the test run according to the instrument’s operating procedure. -
Monitor the run to ensure no errors occur (e.g., flagged results,
alerts).
6.4. Result Reporting: - Review the generated results for calibration
standards and QC materials. - Accept the patient results if all
calibrators and QC materials fall within the acceptable range: - If
calibrators/QC are out of range, investigate and re-run if necessary. -
Transmit or manually document the results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). - Release results to the clinician once
verified.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION
7.1. Quality Control: - QC samples should be analyzed with each
batch of patient specimens. - Document QC results and take
corrective action if results fall outside established limits.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals should be based on clinical guidelines and
instrument-specific manuals. Update these intervals as
necessary against the latest clinical recommendations and
manufacturer instructions.
2. REPORTING AND INTERPRETATION
9.1. Reference Intervals and Critical Values: - Therapeutic range:
typically 5-10 µg/mL for peak levels and <2 µg/mL for trough levels
for tobramycin should be incorporated as per specific reference or
clinical guidelines. - Report critical values immediately to the
responsible clinician.
9.2. Documentation: - Maintain records of all calibrations, QC, and
patient results. - Ensure all logs are signed and reviewed regularly for
completeness.
1. REFERENCES
Maintain and refer to the manufacturer’s package inserts, calibration
standards data sheets, and relevant clinical guidelines to ensure up-
to-date practices.
Note: The referenced intervals, equipment, and specific steps should
be verified against the manufacturer’s recommendations to ensure
precise laboratory operations.
