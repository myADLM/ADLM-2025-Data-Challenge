Standard Operating Procedure TOBRAMYCIN, RANDOM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the accurate and
precise measurement of random serum tobramycin levels to aid
in therapeutic drug monitoring.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to laboratory staff responsible for
analyzing serum tobramycin levels using the automated
analyzer.
3. DEFINITIONS Tobramycin: An aminoglycoside antibiotic used
to treat various types of bacterial infections, especially those
caused by Gram-negative organisms.
4. RESPONSIBILITIES It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to
ensure:
• Samples are properly identified, prepared, and analyzed
according to this SOP.
• All instruments and reagents are maintained and used as
specified.
• Quality control checks are performed and documented
appropriately.
• Deviations and discrepancies are reported to the supervisor.
• All results are reviewed and validated by a licensed technologist.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red top or serum separator tube.
• A minimum volume of 1 mL is required.
• Specimen should be allowed to clot completely and then
centrifuged for at least 10 minutes at a speed of 1300-2000 x g.
Specimen Stability:
• Up to 8 hours at room temperature (15-25°C).
• Up to 7 days when refrigerated (2-8°C).
• Up to 30 days when frozen (-20°C or lower).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Equipment:
• Automated analyzer capable of performing tobramycin assays
(e.g., Abbott Architect, Siemens Dimension).
• Centrifuge capable of operating at 1300-2000 x g.
Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific for tobramycin.
• Tobramycin reagent kit.
Supplies:
• Serum separator or red top tubes.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Appropriate storage containers for specimens and reagents.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation a. Verify that the patient specimen is clearly
labeled with two unique identifiers (e.g., patient name and date
of birth). b. Ensure the specimen is within the acceptable
stability range and confirm no hemolysis or contamination. c.
Allow refrigerated or frozen specimens to reach room
temperature and mix thoroughly before analysis.
3. Instrument Setup a. Turn on the analyzer and perform any
required start-up procedures as per the manufacturer's
guidelines. b. Ensure all calibrators, controls, and reagents are
loaded properly, and verify that the reagent kit and calibrators
are within the expiration date. c. Perform any necessary quality
control checks to verify the instrument's performance.
4. Assay Procedure a. Create a test run in the analyzer’s
software, ensuring the patient ID is correctly logged. b. Using a
precise pipette, load a required volume of serum (as per the
manufacturer's instructions, typically around 100-200 µL) onto
the analyzer. c. Start the assay run, ensuring all samples,
calibrators, and controls are accounted for and properly
programmed.
5. Monitoring and Completing the Assay a. Monitor the assay
run for any alerts or issues that may arise (e.g., equipment
malfunctions, reaction errors). b. Once the analysis is complete,
review the assay results for each patient sample. c. Compare
calibrator and control results with expected values to ensure
accuracy. If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines before retesting patient samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS a. Results should be automatically
transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS). b.
Manually verify and review results against patient history and
current clinical status. c. Validate results in the LIS, ensuring
any critical values are relayed to the attending physician in
accordance with laboratory policy.
7. RECORD KEEPING Maintain comprehensive records of each
test run, including:
• Date and time of analysis.
• Identification of the technologist performing the assay.
• Instrument maintenance logs.
• Quality control results and any corrective actions taken.
• Patient test results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL a. Run quality control samples at the start
of each shift or batch and whenever a new reagent kit is
loaded. b. Document any deviations or errors, and take the
necessary corrective actions.
2. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS a. Use appropriate Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection. b. Dispose of biohazardous waste in accordance
with laboratory safety protocols. c. Handle all specimens and
reagents according to biohazard precautions.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interference may occur if the specimen is grossly hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric.
• Ensure proper specimen collection, handling, and storage to
avoid inaccurate results.
