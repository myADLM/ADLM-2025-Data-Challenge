Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Tobramycin, Trough,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise measurement of Tobramycin
levels in plasma samples, specifically trough levels, which are used
to monitor therapeutic drug levels for patient management.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the analytical
phase of testing Tobramycin, Trough, Plasma using dedicated
equipment and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for training new staff, ensuring
compliance with the SOP, and troubleshooting any issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Tube: Lithium heparin, EDTA, or Sodium heparin tube
• Volume: Minimum required 0.5 mL plasma
• Collection Time: Draw just before the next dose (trough level).
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Dimension, or equivalent)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Calibrated analytical balance
◦ Specimen storage racks
• Reagents:
◦ Tobramycin assay reagent kit specific to the analyzer being
used (store as per manufacturer’s instructions)
◦ Quality control (QC) materials (low, medium, and high levels)
◦ Calibrators specific to the Tobramycin assay
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run two levels of QC (low and high) at the beginning of each
shift, after reagent changes, after calibration, and after any
maintenance procedure.
• The acceptable range for QC values is specified in the insert
provided with the QC materials.
• Document all QC results in the QC logbook immediately after
analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Pre-analytical Phase:
◦ Verify the specimen identity and label with lab requisition.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma.
◦ Visually inspect plasma for hemolysis or lipemia, and note
any issues.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the Tobramycin calibrators.
◦ Calibration should be performed as per manufacturer
recommendations or when indicated by QC failures.
Analytical Phase:
1. Analysis:
◦ Load the plasma specimen into the designated sample area
of the analyzer.
◦ Select the Tobramycin assay protocol on the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that all reagents and calibrators are loaded and that
sufficient volumes are available for the assay run.
◦ Start the analysis.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Result Verification:
◦ Once the analysis is complete, review the results generated
by the analyzer.
◦ Compare results with the reference range provided in the
standard clinical guidelines (typically, therapeutic trough
levels for Tobramycin are 1-2 μg/mL, but always verify
against local guidelines).
◦ Any results that fall outside the acceptable range should be
reviewed and verified. Repeat the analysis if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer the verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Critical values (e.g., >2 μg/mL for trough levels) should be
reported immediately to the requesting clinician following lab-
specific critical value policies.
• Document all actions in the patient’s laboratory report.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens may interfere with the
assay results.
• Ensure all equipment is within calibration status, and reagents are
within expiry.
• Follow all specific limitations and interferences as noted in the
assay manufacturer’s documentation.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instruction Manuals: Refer to the specific
analyzer and Tobramycin reagent kit manuals for detailed
operation and troubleshooting guidelines.
• Clinical Guidelines: Refer to up-to-date therapeutic drug
monitoring guidelines for aminoglycosides.
11. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of calibration, QC, patient results, maintenance
logs, and any significant events or deviations in compliance with
laboratory policy.
12. REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in procedure, equipment, or new guidelines are released.
