Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Procedure for
Tobramycin, Trough, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps necessary to accurately measure the trough
concentration of Tobramycin in serum. This procedure is critical for
monitoring therapeutic drug levels to ensure efficacy while minimizing
toxicity.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to staff members who are trained and
responsible for performing therapeutic drug monitoring of Tobramycin
in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out this
procedure in accordance with this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
personnel to ensure proper calibration of equipment, accurate
performance of the procedure, and timely reporting of results.
4. DEFINITIONS
Tobramycin: An aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat various types
of bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative
organisms.
Trough Level: The lowest concentration of a drug in the patient's
bloodstream, typically measured just before the next dose is
administered.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or
immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Chemiluminescent Microparticle
Immunoassay - CMIA)
• Calibrators and control materials
• Tobramycin reagent kit
• Sample cups or vials
• Micropipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Types and Collection:
◦ Acceptable: Serum samples collected in gold-top (SST) or
red-top tubes.
◦ Unacceptable: Samples collected in EDTA, citrate, heparin
tubes, or lipemic, icteric, and hemolyzed samples.
◦ Collect blood immediately before the next dose, ensuring
the sample represents the trough level.
◦ Centrifuge the collected sample within 2 hours of collection
to separate the serum from the clot.
◦ Store the serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 7 days, or store frozen at -20°C if analysis will be
delayed beyond 7 days.
2. Calibrators and Controls:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to equilibrate to
room temperature before use.
B. Analytical Setup
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration according to the instrument
manufacturer’s guidelines and reagent kit instructions.
◦ Ensure that the calibration curve covers the expected range
of values for the trough level.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift,
after calibration, and after every 20 samples.
◦ Ensure results fall within the established QC range before
continuing with patient samples.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Procedure for HPLC System:
◦ Inject the prepared serum sample into the HPLC system.
◦ Follow the instrument and reagent kit instructions for the
run.
◦ The system will detect and quantify Tobramycin levels;
ensure proper peak integration and quantification
methodology.
OR
Procedure for Immunoassay Analyzer:
◦ Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and control
materials into the analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument setup
and sample run.
◦ Review the analyzer output for Tobramycin concentration.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly after verification.
2. Reference Ranges:
◦ Typical reference range for Tobramycin trough: <2 µg/mL
3. Critical Values:
◦ Notify the healthcare provider if the Tobramycin level is >2
µg/mL, as this may indicate potential toxicity.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Quality Control Failures:
◦ If QC results are out of range, do not release patient results.
◦ Troubleshoot the issue by reviewing the reagent, calibration,
and instrument performance.
◦ Re-run the control and, if necessary, recalibrate the
instrument.
2. Instrument Maintenance:
◦ Perform regular maintenance as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Document all maintenance activities in the instrument
logbook.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. PPE: Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment.
2. Waste Disposal: Dispose of all biohazard waste in compliance
with laboratory safety protocols.
