Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Toluene as Hippuric Acid, Occupational Exposure, Urine
1. PURPOSE To provide an accurate and consistent protocol for
the quantification of toluene exposure by analyzing hippuric
acid concentration in urine samples. This protocol will ensure
standardized methods for sample preparation, analysis, quality
control, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists and supervisors to
adhere to this protocol, ensuring accurate and consistent results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: 10 mL of midstream urine collected in a
clean, sterile container.
• Acceptable: 5 mL of urine if the total volume is less than 10 mL.
• Urine samples must be refrigerated at 2-8°C immediately after
collection and during transport to the laboratory.
• Samples must be analyzed within 7 days of collection if stored at
2-8°C.
• Unacceptable: Samples collected more than 7 days prior,
improperly labeled, or received at incorrect temperatures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) instrument.
• Standard solutions of hippuric acid.
• Internal standards (e.g., deuterated hippuric acid).
• Urine sample containers and syringes.
• Reagents: suitable organic solvents such as methanol,
acetonitrile, and a derivatizing agent (if GC is used).
• Calibration curves constructed from known concentrations of
hippuric acid standards.
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
2. Thaw refrigerated urine samples at room temperature
(~20-25°C) if previously stored.
3. Centrifuge urine samples at 1800-2000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
5. If derivatization is required (for GC-MS analysis), add the
derivatizing reagent according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Mix well.
6. Add the internal standard to the sample and mix thoroughly.
B) Instrumentation and Analysis:
1. Calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS instrument according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using the standard solutions of
hippuric acid.
2. Inject a defined volume of the prepared urine sample into the
chromatograph (typically between 1-10 µL depending on the
instrument).
3. Run the sample through the chromatography system under
optimized conditions (details of the column type, temperature
gradient, flow rate, and detection parameters should be
specified based on the instrument and lab preferences).
4. Identify and quantify hippuric acid using established retention
times and mass-to-charge ratios (m/z).
C) Quality control:
1. Run quality control samples containing known concentrations of
hippuric acid alongside each batch of unknown samples.
2. Ensure that control samples are within predetermined
acceptance ranges (mean ± 2 SD).
3. If QC samples fall outside acceptance ranges, troubleshoot and
recalibrate the instrument before processing further samples.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Calculate the concentration of hippuric acid in the urine
samples using the calibration curve.
6. Results should be expressed as mg/g creatinine to account for
urine dilution.
7. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and review all data for consistency and accuracy.
8. Verify results according to standard laboratory protocols before
reporting.
9. Results exceeding occupational exposure limits should be
flagged and relevant personnel notified immediately.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges for hippuric acid in urine should be used
according to the latest occupational health guidelines or literature
values, typically:
◦ Acceptable: Less than 2 g/g creatinine.
◦ Elevated: 2 g/g creatinine or more (indicative of potential
overexposure to toluene).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Ensure to refer to the instrument and
reagent manufacturer’s instructions for possible limitations of
the method. Variability in matrix effects and sample handling
can influence the reliability of results. Regular maintenance and
calibration of the analytical instruments are essential for
accurate measurements.

settings. Any discrepancies or issues during the procedure should be
documented and addressed by laboratory supervisory staff.
