Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Toluene, Occupational Exposure, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for toluene, occupational exposure, in
blood specimens. This includes steps from specimen preparation
through analysis, quality control, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis of blood specimens for toluene exposure and ensuring that
quality control measures are met. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process, resolving issues, and ensuring compliance
with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in a lavender-top (EDTA) tube, gray-top
(potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride) tube, or specially designated
blood collection tubes for volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
• Specimen should be refrigerated immediately after collection and
transported to the laboratory within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in tubes other than those specified.
• Specimens that have been exposed to air or extreme
temperatures.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without
refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Headspace Gas Chromatograph (GC) with Flame Ionization
Detector (FID) or Mass Spectrometer Detector (MS)
• Headspace Autosampler
• Toluene Standard (CAS Number: 108-88-3)
• Internal Standard (e.g., Benzene-d6 or similar)
• Quality Control (QC) Material
• Analytical Grade Solvents (e.g., Methanol, Water)
• Vials with Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) Fibers
• Refrigerated Centrifuge
• Temperature Monitors for Refrigeration Units
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify specimen integrity upon receipt. Record specimen details
in the laboratory information management system (LIMS).
2. Centrifuge the blood specimen at 1000-2000 x g for 10 minutes
at 4°C to separate plasma.
3. Transfer 500 µL plasma to a headspace vial. Add 10 µL of an
internal standard solution. Seal the vial with a septum cap.
B. Instrument Preparation:
1. Ensure the GC-FID or GC-MS is calibrated and operational.
2. Perform a system suitability test and calibration check using
calibration standards and controls.
3. Load the prepared vials into the headspace autosampler.
C. Analysis:
1. Set the headspace autosampler parameters for temperature,
agitation, and equilibrium time according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
2. Initiate the analytical run using the established method for the
detection of toluene.
3. Monitor chromatographic peaks to ensure the proper elution
and identification of toluene.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Analyze chromatograms for the presence of the toluene peak.
Quantify toluene concentration using calibration curves
prepared with standards.
2. Confirm the identification by comparing retention times and
peak areas with the internal standard and control samples.
3. Calculate the concentration of toluene in the blood specimen.
E. Quality Control:
1. Include at least one blank, one low-level QC, and one high-level
QC sample with each analytical batch.
2. Review QC results to ensure they fall within established limits.
Take corrective action if QC results are out of range.
3. Document all QC procedures and outcomes.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Enter the quantified results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Verify and approve results according to laboratory protocols.
3. Report results indicating toluene concentration in μg/L or ng/mL
of blood.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure all equipment and glassware are free of toluene
contamination to prevent false positive results.
• Only trained personnel should operate the GC-FID or GC-MS.
• Toluene levels could be influenced by sample handling and
storage conditions. Ensure adherence to specimen requirements
to maintain sample integrity.
