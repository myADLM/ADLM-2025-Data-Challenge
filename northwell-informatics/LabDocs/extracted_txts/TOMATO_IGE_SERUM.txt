Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Tomato IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the measurement of
Tomato-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples using
immunoassay techniques in a clinical laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
as per the SOP and documenting all results and observations.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure
adherence and verifying results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen Types:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow the
blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature before
centrifugation for 10 minutes at approximately 1,000-2,000 x g.
Isolate the serum immediately after centrifugation.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Heparinized plasma, lipemic, hemolyzed, or icteric specimens are
not recommended as they can interfere with the assay.
3. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Specimens should be analyzed promptly. If immediate analysis is
not possible, store serum at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, serum specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader
• Calibrators and controls specific to Tomato IgE
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubators and water baths as needed
• Specific assay kit for Tomato IgE detection (e.g., Thermo Fisher
Scientific Phadia ImmunoCAP system)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure that all equipment, reagents, and samples have
reached room temperature before starting the assay.
2. Label all tubes and microtiter wells appropriately.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibrators and quality controls at the beginning of the
assay according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure all control results fall within the established
acceptable ranges before proceeding with the test samples.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Dilute serum samples as required by the specific assay kit
instructions.
3. Loading the Analyzer/Plate:
◦ Add the required volume of calibrators, controls, and serum
samples to the designated wells or tubes.
◦ Follow the specific assay procedure for the automated
immunoassay analyzer or manual ELISA as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Incubation and Washing:
◦ Incubate the samples with the assay-specific reagents as
instructed.
◦ Perform wash steps meticulously to minimize background
noise and ensure assay accuracy.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the detection reagent and incubate as per the assay
requirements.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) using the ELISA reader
set at the appropriate wavelength if performing a manual
assay or follow the automated protocol.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• After the assay is complete, ensure all results are reviewed and
verified by a trained technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
retain records as per laboratory policies.
Reference Ranges:
To be provided based on assay-specific performance, typically
provided in the assay kit insert.
Critical Results:
• Any results that fall significantly outside the reference range must
be flagged for urgent review and reported to the requesting
physician immediately.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Routine QC Procedures:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Record all QC results and take corrective actions if controls are
out of range.
B) Troubleshooting:
• If the assay fails or produces inconsistent results, recheck all
steps, confirm reagent integrity, and validate the calibration curve.
• Perform repeat testing if required and document discrepancies
and corrective actions taken.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric samples can interfere with the
assay.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens can potentially affect the
specificity of the Tomato IgE results.
9. REFERENCES
• Assay Kit Manufacturer’s Insert and Guidelines
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) documents
• Relevant research articles and guidelines for Imunoglobulin E
testing in serum.
10. SAFETY
• All laboratory personnel must wear appropriate PPE, including
gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles.
• Handle all specimens and reagents according to biosafety levels
and guidelines to prevent contamination and exposure.
By following this SOP, the consistency and reliability of Tomato IgE
measurements in serum samples can be ensured, thereby aiding in
accurate diagnosis and management of tomato allergy.
