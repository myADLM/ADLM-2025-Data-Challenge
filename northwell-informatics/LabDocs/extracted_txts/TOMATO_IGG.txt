SOP for Analytical Phase of TOMATO IGG Testing
1. PURPOSE:
To establish a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Tomato IgG (T-IgG) testing in order to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
1. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/acceptable:
• 3-5 mL of serum or plasma (collected in a non-heparinized tube,
e.g., SST or EDTA tube).
• Specimens should be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection and
stored at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed immediately.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in heparin.
• Samples stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours or
refrigerated for more than 48 hours without being frozen (-20°C or
colder).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA reader
• Microplate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Tomato IgG ELISA kit including:
◦ Coated microplates
◦ Standards and controls
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Set up the ELISA reader and microplate washer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare the wash buffer and dilute as directed by the kit
instructions.
4. Label the microplate with patient identifiers for standards,
controls, and test samples.
B) Sample and Reagent Preparation:
1. Dilute patient samples (typically 1:100) using the sample diluent
provided in the ELISA kit.
2. Prepare standards and controls according to the kit instructions.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted patient samples
to the appropriate wells of the microplate.
2. Incubate the microplate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the plate 3-5 times
with wash buffer using the microplate washer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the microplate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the plate 3-5 times
with wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the microplate at room temperature for 10-15 minutes,
protected from light.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well and gently mix the plate
to ensure thorough mixing.
D) Measurement and Analysis:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at the
appropriate wavelength specified by the kit (often 450 nm)
using the ELISA reader.
2. Record the readings and construct a standard curve using the
OD values of the standards.
3. Calculate the concentration of Tomato IgG in patient samples
using the standard curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to ensure assay validity.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of instrumentation
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• If the control values do not fall within the established acceptable
range, do not report patient results until the issue is resolved, and
the assay is repeated with new controls.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report results as IU/mL (International Units per milliliter) based on
the standard curve.
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following the site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Flag results outside of the reference interval and notify the
requesting physician or clinician as per lab protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may cause interference
with test results.
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies in the specimen may affect
the accuracy of results.
• Storage and handling conditions can impact specimen integrity
and test outcomes.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Establish reference intervals for Tomato IgG based on the
population served or as provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer.

new guidelines or technological advancements in Tomato IgG testing.
