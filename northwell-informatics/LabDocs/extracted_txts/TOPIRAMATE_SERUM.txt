Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Topiramate, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical phase for the generation of
accurate and reliable results for the concentration of Topiramate in
serum samples. It ensures the integrity and consistency of the results
and defines corrective actions in case of any deviations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologists to
perform and document the analysis of Topiramate levels in serum
samples as per this procedure. Any deviations or issues encountered
during the process must be immediately reported to the supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
Topiramate: An anticonvulsant drug used for the treatment of epilepsy
and the prevention of migraines.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in tubes with gel separators (SST).
• Poorly labeled or unlabeled specimens.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Serum samples received in the laboratory more than 24 hours
after collection without refrigeration.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System or
equivalent analytical instrument.
• Topiramate calibrators and quality control materials.
• Reagents for protein precipitation (e.g., Acetonitrile).
• Mobile phase for HPLC (e.g., acetonitrile and water with 0.1%
formic acid).
• Analytical columns suitable for Topiramate analysis.
• Micropipettes and disposable pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
2. Centrifuge the serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
clarify the serum.
3. Transfer the required volume (typically 200 µL) of serum to a
clean microcentrifuge tube.
B. Protein Precipitation
1. Add 500 µL of the protein precipitation reagent (e.g.,
Acetonitrile) to the serum sample.
2. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute to ensure thorough mixing.
3. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet the
precipitated proteins.
4. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for HPLC
analysis.
C. HPLC Analysis
1. Prepare the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Ensure the column is equilibrated with the mobile phase.
◦ Set the flow rate, column temperature, and detector
wavelength suitable for Topiramate detection (e.g., 254 nm).
2. Inject an appropriate volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the prepared
sample into the HPLC system.
3. Run the HPLC analysis.
4. Analyze the data using the calibration curve prepared with
known concentrations of Topiramate.
D. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare a calibration curve using Topiramate standards
covering the expected range of patient samples (e.g., 0.5 - 20
µg/mL).
2. Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each
batch of patient samples.
3. Ensure that QC results are within acceptable limits before
accepting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the HPLC data and ensure all quality control samples
are within acceptable limits.
2. Calculate the Topiramate concentration in the serum samples
using the calibration curve.
3. Report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
as follows:
◦ Units: µg/mL
◦ Reference Range: 5-20 µg/mL (Therapeutic Range)
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls and participate in proficiency testing programs.
• Document and review quality control results regularly.
• Investigate and resolve any deviations or out-of-range results.
9. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC runs, and patient results.
• Document any corrective actions taken in response to deviations
or issues encountered.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions and User Manuals for the HPLC
System.
• Relevant Clinical Guidelines and Published Literature on
Topiramate Analysis.
11. REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or when there is a significant
change in the methodology or instrumentation.
By following this procedure, the laboratory ensures consistent,
accurate, and reliable analysis of Topiramate levels in serum
samples, adhering to high standards of quality and regulatory
compliance.
