Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TORCH Profile IgG,
Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for performing the TORCH Profile
IgG test on serum samples, including the detection of IgG antibodies
for Toxoplasma gondii, Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) types 1 and 2. This test is performed to
assess past infections and immune status against these pathogens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and personnel trained in serological testing
are responsible for performing the test, interpreting results, and
documenting findings. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
validating the results.
3. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques into a
serum separator tube (SST) or a red-top tube.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate serum from cells.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately labeled tube.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if testing within 72 hours. For longer
storage, keep sample frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens with gross labeling errors.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Water bath or heat block (37°C)
• Microplate reader with appropriate wavelength filters (450 nm and
620 nm)
Reagents:
• Commercially available ELISA kits for Toxoplasma gondii IgG,
Rubella IgG, CMV IgG, and HSV 1&2 IgG.
• Calibrators, controls, and substrates as provided by the kit
manufacturer.
• Wash buffer and sample diluent.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Follow the instructions provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
• Prepare working solutions of wash buffer and substrate according
to the manufacturer's specifications.
Assay Steps:
1. Label a 96-well microtiter plate according to the test layout.
2. Pipette the required amount of sample diluent into each well.
3. Add the appropriate volume of serum sample, calibrators, and
controls into the designated wells.
4. Mix gently and incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified
in the kit insert.
5. Wash wells to remove unbound material using the wash buffer.
6. Add the conjugate reagent to each well and incubate again at
37°C for the specified time.
7. Wash wells thoroughly.
8. Add substrate solution to each well. Incubate in the dark for the
time recommended by the manufacturer.
9. Add stop solution to each well.
10. Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620 nm using the microplate reader.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
Interpretation:
• Compare the OD values of the samples to those of the calibrators
and controls.
• Calculate sample concentrations based on the standard curve
provided by the kit manufacturer.
• Follow the manufacturer's criteria for determining positive,
negative, and equivocal results.
Reporting:
• Record all results, including the OD readings, calculated IgG
concentrations, and interpretation, in the laboratory information
system.
• Utilize site-specific reporting guidelines for formatting and
transmitting reports to the appropriate healthcare provider.
Reference Ranges:
• Negative: Below the specified cutoff value.
• Positive: Above the specified cutoff value.
• Equivocal: Falls within the gray zone as defined by the
manufacturer. Repeat testing may be necessary.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run internal controls (negative and positive) with each batch of
tests.
• Document QC results and take corrective actions if controls are
out of range.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability of results.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens can affect test
outcomes.
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may occur. Confirmatory
testing may be required.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic procedures.
