Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Total Iron Binding
Capacity (TIBC), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, precise, and reliable test results for Total Iron
Binding Capacity (TIBC) in serum samples by following standardized
testing procedures, monitoring equipment, and maintaining quality
control.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to perform
TIBC testing according to this SOP. This includes maintaining the
equipment, performing quality control, and troubleshooting any
problems that arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Specimen Type
• Serum
3.2 Collection Container
• Preferred: Serum separator tube (SST, gold or tiger-top).
• Acceptable: Red-top tube without anticoagulant.
3.3 Specimen Volume
• Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL serum.
• Preferred Volume: 1 mL serum.
3.4 Handling and Stability
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection
to prevent hemolysis and degradation.
• Serum is stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C and up to 2 months at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of performing TIBC
assays (e.g., Beckman Coulter AU5800, Roche Cobas 6000).
• Refrigerator and Freezer (for reagent and sample storage).
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge for separating serum.
4.2 Reagents
• TIBC reagent set, including iron-binding reagent and colorimetric
indicator, compatible with the chemistry analyzer.
• Calibrators and controls specific to TIBC assay.
4.3 Supplies
• Sample cups.
• Labeling materials.
• Logbooks and documentation forms.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
5.1.1 Check the expiration dates and storage conditions of all
reagents and controls. 5.1.2 Allow reagents and controls to reach
room temperature before use. 5.1.3 Perform daily maintenance and
calibration of the chemistry analyzer as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
5.2 Assay Protocol
5.2.1 Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge blood sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
• Carefully pipette serum into a labeled sample cup.
5.2.2 Calibration:
• Run the calibrator materials following the manufacturer’s
guidelines to ensure the accuracy of the analyzer.
• Document calibration results and ensure they are within
acceptable limits.
5.2.3 Quality Control:
• Analyze two levels of quality control (QC) material at the
beginning of each shift, after calibrations, or after any major
maintenance/service.
• Acceptable ranges for QC must be recorded and monitored. If QC
results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot the issue
before proceeding with patient samples.
5.2.4 Sample Analysis:
• Load the sample cups on the chemistry analyzer as per the
machine’s instructions.
• Enter or scan the patient/sample identification number.
• Select the TIBC assay protocol on the chemistry analyzer.
• Start the analysis process.
5.3 Post-Analysis
5.3.1 After the assay is completed, review and verify the results. 5.3.2
If results are flagged or fall outside critical values, re-run the sample if
necessary. 5.3.3 Document the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and notify the requesting clinician of any critical results
immediately.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Reference Intervals:
• Adult reference range for TIBC: 240-450 µg/dL (may vary slightly
based on specific lab standards and methodology).
6.2 Critical Values:
• TIBC values outside the typical clinical reference range should be
flagged and reviewed by a supervisor or senior technologist
before reporting.
6.3 Documentation:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and require
review and verification by the technologist.
• Ensure all results, calibration, and QC data are properly logged.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
7.1 Daily Maintenance:
• Perform and document routine maintenance of the chemistry
analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
7.2 Weekly/Monthly Maintenance:
• Detailed cleaning, reagent checks, and calibration verification to
maintain assay accuracy and precision.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
8.1 Handling Out of Range QC Results:
• Repeat QC to confirm the error.
• If QC fails again, recalibrate the analyzer and document the
intervention.
• If the problem persists, notify the supervisor and refer to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
8.2 Other Issues:
• Equipment malfunction: Refer to the manual or contact technical
support.
• Reagent issues: Check for proper storage, expiration date, and
preparation.

1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as needed to
incorporate any new analytical methods, regulatory requirements, or
changes in the test protocol.
