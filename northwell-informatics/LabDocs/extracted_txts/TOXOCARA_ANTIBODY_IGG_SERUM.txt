Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for TOXOCARA ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The objective of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for Toxocara
antibody, IgG, in human serum. This includes the steps for
assay setup, calibration, sample processing, quality control,
and interpretation of results. Adherence to this procedure
ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who
perform the Toxocara antibody, IgG, serum assay in the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for performing the Toxocara
antibody, IgG assay in accordance with this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring that laboratory
personnel are trained and competent in the procedure, and
reviewing quality control data and test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Collection: Draw blood into a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature and
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000-2000 x g.
• Storage: Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days or frozen at -20°C for longer periods. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA kit for Toxocara Antibody, IgG
• Calibrators and controls provided with the ELISA kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate reader
• Incubator (set to appropriate temperature as specified by the kit
insert)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Timer
• Laboratory bench with appropriate biohazard safety measures
1. PROCEDURE Step-by-Step Instructions:
6.1. Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature before
starting the assay.
• Prepare the wash buffer, substrate solution, and any other
reagents as specified in the ELISA kit insert.
• Label the microplate wells for calibrators, controls, and patient
samples.
6.2. Assay Setup
• Add the specified volume of calibrator, control, and patient serum
to the appropriate wells.
• Add the enzyme-conjugated antibody to each well according to
the kit protocol.
• Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time as per
the kit instructions.
6.3. Wash Steps
• Carefully remove the liquid from the wells.
• Wash each well multiple times with the prepared wash buffer
using an automated plate washer or manually.
6.4. Substrate Addition
• Add the specified amount of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate the plate for the recommended time in a dark room or as
per the kit instructions to develop color.
6.5. Stop Reaction
• Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic reaction.
6.6. Reading Results
• Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a microplate
reader set to the wavelength specified in the kit insert.
• Record the OD values.
6.7. Quality Control
• Verify that control samples fall within the specified range provided
by the manufacturer.
• Review data for calibrators, ensuring that the calibration curve
meets acceptable criteria for accuracy and precision.
1. CALCULATIONS
• Generate a standard curve from the calibrator's OD values.
• Calculate the concentration of Toxocara antibody, IgG, in patient
samples by comparing their OD values to the standard curve.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive result: Concentration equal to or greater than the cutoff
value specified in the kit insert, indicating the presence of
Toxocara antibody, IgG.
• Negative result: Concentration less than the cutoff value,
indicating a lack of detectable Toxocara antibody, IgG.
• Indeterminate result: Values close to the cutoff should be
interpreted with caution, and repeat testing or additional
confirmatory testing may be recommended.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results by a qualified laboratory supervisor
before releasing the final report.
• Report critical results immediately to the requesting physician.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal controls with each assay to ensure the validity of the
results.
• Document all QC data and review trends to identify any shifts or
trends that indicate potential problems.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The accuracy of the test may be affected by improper sample
handling or storage.
• Cross-reactivity with other parasitic infections may occur, leading
to false-positive results.
• Negative results do not rule out recent infection; repeat testing or
an alternative method may be necessary if clinical suspicion
remains high.
