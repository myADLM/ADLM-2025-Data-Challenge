Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TOXOCARA CANIS
ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Toxocara canis antibody (serum) assay.
This test is performed to detect antibodies against Toxocara canis in
serum, aiding in the diagnosis of toxocariasis.
Responsibility:
All trained and authorized laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the Toxocara canis antibody assay according to this SOP
and ensuring results are accurate and reliable.
1. DEFINITION
The Toxocara canis antibody test is an immunoassay used to detect
the presence of antibodies against Toxocara canis, a parasitic
nematode, in a patient's serum sample.
1. PROTOCOL
A. Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
◦ Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample, separate the serum and transfer it to a
clean, labeled sample tube.
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if the analysis is to be done within 48
hours or freeze at -20°C for long-term storage.
B. Reagents and Supplies:
• Toxocara canis antibody immunoassay kit (ELISA method
recommended)
• Calibrators and controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
• Washing buffer, incubation, and substrate solutions provided in
the kit
• Laboratory-grade water
C. Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C for long-term storage)
• Microplate washer (optional)
• Incubator (37°C)
D. Quality Control:
• Use positive and negative controls with each set of samples.
• Ensure calibrators, controls, and patient samples are brought to
room temperature before analysis.
• Follow kit instructions for setting up calibration curves.
E. Procedure:
1. Initial Setup:
◦ Confirm the microplate reader and washer (if used) are
functioning correctly.
◦ Prepare the work area, ensuring it is clean and free from
potential contamination sources.
2. Assay Preparation:
◦ Follow the assay kit instructions to prepare the microplate,
adding specified volumes of samples, controls, and
calibrators to designated wells.
◦ Include blank wells as per kit instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and
duration (often 37°C for 30 minutes to 1 hour).
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate wells according to the kit instructions
(manual or automated washing).
5. Detection:
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate and substrate as instructed,
incubate for the recommended time.
◦ Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm within the
specified timeframe.
◦ Generate a standard curve using calibrator values and
interpret sample OD values against this curve to determine
the concentration of Toxocara canis antibodies.
F. Interpreting Results:
• Compare sample results to the provided reference ranges:
◦ Negative: Below the cut-off value
◦ Borderline: Near the cut-off value (specific range indicated by
kit instructions)
◦ Positive: Above the cut-off value
G. Troubleshooting:
• If controls or calibrators do not fall within the expected ranges, do
not report patient results. Identify and correct the issue, repeating
the assay if necessary.
• Ensure all reagents are within the expiration date and stored
correctly.
H. Reporting Results:
• Report results according to laboratory and regulatory guidelines.
• Include interpretations where necessary (e.g., negative, positive,
borderline).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all results, including control and patient sample data, in
laboratory information systems (LIS).
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
quality control data.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Provided by the assay kit manufacturer and verified periodically
against established laboratory procedures.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• As per the manufacturer’s insert, note any conditions or factors
that might affect the accuracy or interpretation of the test results.
