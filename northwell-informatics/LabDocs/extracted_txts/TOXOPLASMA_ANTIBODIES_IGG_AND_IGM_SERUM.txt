** SOP Protocol for Analysis of Toxoplasma Antibodies, IgG and IgM,
Serum**
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standardized procedure
for the analysis of Toxoplasma antibodies (IgG and IgM) in serum
samples. This ensures accurate, consistent, and timely results for
clinical and diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol precisely to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test
results. The designated supervisor must verify that all procedures are
performed according to this protocol and take appropriate corrective
actions when necessary.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader
• Toxoplasma IgG and IgM reagent kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or appropriate blood collection
tubes
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if required by the kit's protocol)
• Laboratory timer
• Gloves and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Calibration controls and quality control samples (negative and
positive controls)
• Logbook for temperature and equipment monitoring
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood is collected in SST or plain collection tubes
• Volume: Minimum 1ml of serum
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Long-term storage
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling
1. Centrifuge collected blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum.
2. Carefully pipette the serum into a clean, labeled secondary
tube.
3. Store serum samples at appropriate temperatures until
analysis.
B. Test Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and serum samples are at room
temperature before starting the test.
2. Prepare the reagent kit and load the automated immunoassay
analyzer or set up the ELISA plate according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Program the analyzer with the required test parameters or
prepare the manual ELISA plates according to the kit’s protocol.
C. Analysis
1. Pipette appropriate volumes of serum sample, calibrators, and
controls into the wells or designated areas on the analyzer.
2. Add required volumes of reagents (e.g., conjugate, wash
buffers, substrate solutions) as specified in the kit’s protocol.
3. Incubate for specified times at appropriate temperatures.
4. Wash wells as specified to remove unbound reagents.
Note: Follow the incubation and washing steps carefully to ensure no
cross-contamination occurs.
D. Read Results
1. After the final incubation step, read the absorbance or signal
using the ELISA reader or analyzer.
2. Record the results. Ensure that all controls are within the
acceptable range to validate the run.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Test each new lot of reagents and a new test run with a minimum
of one positive control and one negative control.
• Record QC results. Do not report patient results unless the QC is
within acceptable limits.
• Perform additional QC as recommended by the kit manufacturer
or regulatory guidelines.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Negative: Absorbance or signal below the cut-off value.
• Positive: Absorbance or signal above the cut-off value.
• Equivocal: Absorbance or signal around the cut-off value; retest
sample or consider additional testing.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review.
• Any critical or unexpected results should be communicated to the
healthcare provider immediately according to the laboratory's
critical result policy.
• Ensure all results are verified by the designated supervisor before
final reporting.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer's insert for
specific limitations of the reagents and assay procedure. Factors
such as hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination may affect test results.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Toxoplasma IgG: Negative (varies by manufacturer)
• Toxoplasma IgM: Negative (varies by manufacturer)
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for the specific reference intervals
used in reporting.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs of temperature, instrument settings, QC results, and
corrective actions.
• Ensure all records are complete, legible, and stored securely for
auditing and reference.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s reagent kits inserts for Toxoplasma IgG and IgM.

• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
By adhering to this protocol, the laboratory ensures that the analysis
of Toxoplasma antibodies (IgG and IgM) in serum samples is reliable,
reproducible, and compliant with quality standards.
