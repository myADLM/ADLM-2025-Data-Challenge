Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Toxoplasma Gondii Antibodies (IgG, IgM), ELISA, CSF
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedure for the determination of Toxoplasma Gondii
IgG and IgM antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the authorized and trained laboratory
personnel to perform the ELISA assay for Toxoplasma Gondii IgG
and IgM antibodies in accordance with this SOP. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring all personnel are trained and
proficiency-tested.
2. DEFINITION:
Toxoplasma Gondii is a protozoan parasite that can cause serious
infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and
fetuses. Detection of Toxoplasma antibodies (IgG and IgM) in CSF
can aid in diagnosing active or past infection.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• Specimen Type: CSF collected by lumbar puncture
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL
• Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours,
otherwise, store frozen at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with visible contamination
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
◦ Specimens received in improper containers or with insufficient
volume
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA reader with filters for appropriate wavelengths (e.g., 450
nm, reference 630 nm)
• ELISA washer or manual washing supplies
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Toxoplasma Gondii IgG/IgM ELISA kits (specific manufacturer’s
kits)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Calibrators/Standards and Controls (Negative and Positive)
• Quality control material: Provided with the kit or as recommended
by the manufacturer
5. REAGENT STORAGE AND HANDLING:
• Reagents: Store all reagents as per the manufacturer’s
instructions, usually at 2-8°C. Do not use reagents past their
expiration date.
• Handling: Follow reagent preparation instructions carefully. Bring
reagents to room temperature before use.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run quality control samples (positive and negative controls) with
each batch of tests performed.
• Control results must meet the acceptable criteria before
proceeding with patient sample result interpretation.
• Record all quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature.
2. Label the microplate wells according to the assay layout.
B. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
1. Dilute CSF samples and controls as instructed by the kit insert
(usually 1:100 dilution in sample diluent, check manufacturer
guidelines).
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Addition to Wells:
◦ Add diluted patient specimens, controls, and standards/
calibrators to the respective microplate wells (typically 100
µL per well).
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the specified duration
(usually 30-60 minutes).
◦ Wash the microplate wells thoroughly according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (three to five washes with
buffer).
3. Secondary Antibody and Incubation:
◦ Add enzyme-conjugate to each well (typically per kit
instructions, e.g., 100 µL per well).
◦ Incubate again at 37°C for the specified duration.
◦ Wash the microplate wells thoroughly.
4. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add substrate solution (e.g., TMB) to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for the specified
duration (generally 15-30 minutes).
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution (typically 100 µL of acid stop reagent) to
each well.
D. Reading and Interpretation:
1. Read the absorbance values at 450 nm with a 630 nm
reference filter using the ELISA reader.
2. Calculate the results using the absorbance values and compare
with the cut-off values provided by the kit.
3. Interpret the results according to the manufacturer’s criteria:
◦ Negative: Absorbance value below the cut-off.
◦ Positive: Absorbance value above the cut-off.
◦ Equivocal: Absorbance value close to the cut-off (follow
specific procedures for equivocal results as per kit
instructions).
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Transfer the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
interpretation and reporting.
• Positive and equivocal results should be verified by a supervisor
before reporting.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• IgG and IgM antibody results will be interpreted based on the
standards/calibrators provided in the kit and the manufacturer’s
cut-off values.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• This ELISA method is intended for qualitative and semi-
quantitative detection of Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies in
CSF.
• False positives/negatives can occur due to cross-reactivity or
interference.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic tests.
11. PROCEDURE NOTES:
• Strict adherence to timing, incubation, and washing steps is
critical for assay performance.
• Ensure proper calibration of equipment before use.
12. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s Instruction Manual/Package insert for Toxoplasma
Gondii IgG/IgM ELISA.

guidelines.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated periodically or when new
information becomes available.
