Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
TOXOPLASMA GONDII ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii
antibodies (IgG) in patient serum samples to assist in the diagnosis
of infections caused by Toxoplasma gondii.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document all procedures as outlined.
• Supervisors and laboratory managers must ensure compliance
with this SOP and handle corrective actions for any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Use a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Handling:
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Transfer serum into a new aliquot container, if necessary.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated at
2-8°C.
• For long-term storage beyond 7 days, freezing at -20°C or lower
is recommended.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer.
• Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody test kits (specific manufacturer
instructions to be followed).
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Calibrators and Controls: Positive and negative controls.
• Distilled/Deionized water.
• Incubator (if required by the kit).
• Timer.
• Tubes or microplates (depending on assay format).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control should be performed with each assay run:
• Positive and negative controls included with each batch.
• External quality control samples should be used per laboratory
protocol.
• Document results of QC to ensure assay performance within
acceptable limits.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Ensure the assay kit and reagents are at room temperature
before use.
• Prepare work area and ensure all necessary materials are
available.
• Equip analyzers per manufacturer's instructions.
B) Testing:
• Step 1: Label test tubes or microplate wells.
• Step 2: Pipette the appropriate volume of patient serum,
calibrators, and controls into designated wells/tubes following
manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Step 3: Add the specific reagents (conjugate, substrate, etc.) as
instructed by the manufacturer's kit insert.
• Step 4: Incubate the assay mixture at the temperature and
duration specified in the kit insert.
• Step 5: Wash the microplate/wells/tubes according to the kit
instructions to remove unbound conjugates.
• Step 6: Add substrate solution and allow color to develop for the
prescribed time period.
• Step 7: Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution when
required.
• Step 8: Read results using an appropriate analyzer at the
recommended wavelength.
C) Interpreting Results:
• Interpret the absorbance or signal values based on the kit-specific
criteria.
• Compare patient values against the cut-off values provided to
determine IgG status (positive/negative or equivocal).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all patient and control data to confirm accuracy.
• If results fall outside acceptable limits or are invalid (e.g. failed
controls), repeat the assay for those specimens.
• Report positive, negative, or equivocal results as appropriate.
• Ensure results are entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for verification and transmission to clinicians.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for Toxoplasma gondii IgG Antibody will be
specified in the test kit insert. Typically:
• Negative: No significant level of IgG antibodies detected.
• Equivocal: Borderline levels; retesting or follow-up testing may
be recommended.
• Positive: Presence of IgG antibodies indicating past or chronic
infection.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for limitations concerning
sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences such as cross-
reactivity with other antibodies.
