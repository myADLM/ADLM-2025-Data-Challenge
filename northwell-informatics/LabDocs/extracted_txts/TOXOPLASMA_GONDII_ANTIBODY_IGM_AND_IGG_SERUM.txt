Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analysis and Reporting of Toxoplasma
gondii Antibody, IgM and IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting
of Toxoplasma gondii antibody (IgM and IgG) levels in serum
specimens to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• 5 mL of venous blood collected in an SST (serum separator tube).
• Specimens must be processed within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient information.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens that are not processed within the specified time frame.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Microplate Reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Refrigerators (2-8°C)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Multichannel pipettes
• Toxoplasma gondii IgM and IgG ELISA kits
• Deionized water
• Controls for positive and negative results
4. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge SST tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
2. Transfer serum into properly labeled secondary tubes.
3. Store specimens at 2-8°C until analysis, within 48 hours.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, vials, and specimens to room
temperature before use.
◦ Label all microplate wells clearly.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash microplates as per kit instructions, ensuring no
residual wash buffer remains in wells.
3. Dilution:
◦ Dilute serum samples and controls as required by the ELISA
kit instructions.
4. **Loading:
◦ Add diluted samples, controls, and standards to the
appropriate wells.
◦ Seal with a plate sealer and incubate at 37°C in the
incubator for the specified time (as per kit instructions).
5. Detection:
◦ Add detection conjugates (e.g., horseradish peroxidase-
labeled antibodies) following the specified incubation period.
◦ Incubate again at 37°C as per kit instructions.
6. Reading:
◦ Add substrate solution and stop solution sequentially.
◦ Read absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Review control results to ensure they fall within prescribed ranges
before validating the patient results.
• If controls fail, document and troubleshoot before continuing
analysis.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in periodic proficiency testing with external agencies to
ensure overall analytical consistency and accuracy.
• Maintain and review documentation of proficiency testing results.
6. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
Interpretation Criteria:
• IgM Positive:
◦ Indication of recent or acute infection.
◦ Threshold value as per kit insert.
• IgG Positive:
◦ Suggests past infection or immunity.
◦ Threshold value as per kit insert.
• Negative Results:
◦ Absence of detectable antibodies.
Reporting:
• Results are reviewed by the laboratory technologist and
transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Flag any critical or unexpected results for immediate review and
reporting to the ordering physician.
• Document any deviations or unexpected issues encountered
during the testing process.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with the
test results.
• Patient immune status may affect antibody levels.
• Refer to kit insert for specific reagent pad limitations.
8. SAFETY AND DOCUMENTATION
• Follow standard laboratory safety guidelines:
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Dispose of biohazard waste according to laboratory protocols.
• All procedural steps, quality control results, corrective actions,
and specimen tracking must be documented clearly in the
laboratory records.
