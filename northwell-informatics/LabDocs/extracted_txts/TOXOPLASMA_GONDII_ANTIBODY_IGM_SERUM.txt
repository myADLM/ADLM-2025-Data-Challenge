Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
TOXOPLASMA GONDII ANTIBODY, IGM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized guidelines
for the analysis and reporting of Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibody in
serum samples. This includes ensuring consistent and accurate
results through proper handling, processing, and analysis.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the Clinical Microbiology/Immunology
Laboratory for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibodies in
serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Technologist/Technician: Responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP, ensuring accuracy and quality
control.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensures that the procedure is followed
correctly, troubleshoots any issues, and verifies the results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitors the quality control
processes and certification of the equipment.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Serum collected in a plain red-top tube
or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Long-term stability
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibody test kit (e.g., ELISA or
Chemiluminescence Immunoassay)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge (for serum separation)
• Refrigerators and freezers (for specimen storage)
• Timer
• Incubator (if required by the test kit)
• Plate reader (for ELISA) or Analyzer (for Chemiluminescence)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Reception and Verification:
◦ Verify the specimen against the requisition form.
◦ Ensure the specimen is properly labeled with patient
identifiers.
◦ Inspect the specimen for integrity (e.g., no hemolysis).
2. Serum Separation (if not already done):
◦ Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, labeled tube using a
micropipette.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents, controls, and calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature.
3. Assay Execution:
◦ Pipette the required amount of patient serum, calibrators,
and controls into the appropriate wells (for ELISA) or into
the sample cups (for Chemiluminescence Immunoassay).
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for incubation times and
temperatures, washing steps, and addition of substrates.
◦ For ELISA:
▪ Incubate the plate as specified.
▪ Wash the plate using a plate washer or manually.
▪ Add the substrate and incubate.
▪ Stop the reaction and read the plate with a plate reader
at the specified wavelength.
◦ For Chemiluminescence:
▪ Load the samples, reagents, and substrates onto the
analyzer.
▪ Follow automated instructions for processing and
reading results.
C) Calculations and Interpretation:
1. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Toxoplasma gondii IgM
antibodies using the software or manual calculation
methods as specified by the manufacturer. Compare patient
sample values against the calibrators and controls.
2. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Negative: Below the specified cut-off value.
◦ Positive: Above the specified cut-off value.
◦ Equivocal: Within the indeterminate range; recommend
retesting or using an alternative method for confirmation.
D) Quality Control:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with every batch of tests.
◦ Documentation of QC results and any corrective actions if
controls fall outside acceptable ranges.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate and review all results by a certified technologist and/or
supervisor.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring proper patient identification and documentation.
• Report any critical or unexpected positive results to the requesting
physician immediately following laboratory policies.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Value below cut-off
• Positive: Value above cut-off
• Equivocal ranges as specified by the assay manufacturer
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity: Potential for cross-reactivity with other IgM
antibodies or interfering substances.
• Specimen handling: Improper handling can affect the assay
accuracy.
• External factors: Results should be interpreted in conjunction with
clinical findings and other diagnostic tests.
