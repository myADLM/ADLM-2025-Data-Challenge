Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TOXOPLASMA GONDII,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
detection of Toxoplasma gondii DNA in blood specimens using real-
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This protocol ensures
accurate and reliable molecular detection results, complying with
CLIA guidelines.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedures as outlined in this SOP and to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen volume: Minimum of 2 mL blood.
• Storage: Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. If
longer storage is required, specimens should be frozen at -70°C
or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens collected in any anticoagulants other than EDTA.
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 24 hours.
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or leaking specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-time PCR instrument.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips with aerosol barriers.
• Vortex mixer.
• Thermal cycler.
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit appropriate for blood samples.
• Toxoplasma gondii-specific primers and probes.
• PCR master mix reagents.
• Negative and positive control material.
• Nuclease-free water.
Supplies:
• EDTA tubes.
• PCR tubes or plates.
• Gloves and laboratory coat.
• Disposable sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers.
• Biohazard disposal containers.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Label all specimens and controls accurately with patient
identification and date of collection.
2. Allow specimen tubes to equilibrate to room temperature if
previously refrigerated or frozen.
3. Perform a visual inspection of blood specimens for hemolysis or
clotting. Reject unacceptable specimens.
B) DNA Extraction
1. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the DNA
extraction kit appropriate for extracting DNA from blood.
2. Pipette an appropriate volume of blood (e.g., 200 µL) for DNA
extraction.
3. Proceed with the extraction process as described in the kit
protocol.
4. Elute the DNA in a specified volume (e.g., 50 µL) of nuclease-
free water or elution buffer.
5. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further use, if not proceeding
directly with PCR amplification.
C) PCR Setup
1. Thaw all reagents, including PCR master mix, primers, probes,
and controls, on ice and mix thoroughly by vortex.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the manufacturer’s
instructions, including Toxoplasma gondii-specific primers and
probes.
3. Dispense the master mix into PCR tubes or plates, appropriate
for the number of specimens and controls being tested.
4. Add the extracted DNA sample (5 µL) to each reaction tube or
well.
5. Include positive and negative controls with each run. Controls
should be subjected to the same extraction and amplification
procedures as clinical specimens.
6. Seal the PCR tubes or plate and load into the real-time PCR
instrument.
D) Amplification and Detection
1. Set up the thermal cycler program according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines for the real-time PCR reagent being
used, which typically includes:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ 40 cycles of denaturation (e.g., 95°C for 15 seconds) and
annealing/extension (e.g., 60°C for 1 minute).
2. Ensure the real-time PCR instrument is correctly calibrated and
perform a run according to the programmed method.
E) Analysis of Results
1. Analyze the amplification plots and cycle threshold (Ct) values
generated by the real-time PCR instrument.
2. A positive result is indicated by a Ct value below the
predetermined threshold specific for Toxoplasma gondii.
3. A negative result is indicated by no amplification or a Ct value
above the threshold.
4. Validity of the run should be confirmed by assessing the results
of the negative and positive controls. Negative control should
show no amplification, and positive control should show an
expected Ct value.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report positive results as "Toxoplasma gondii DNA detected"
with corresponding Ct values.
2. Report negative results as "Toxoplasma gondii DNA not
detected."
3. Include appropriate comments in the report if any deviations or
issues occurred during the process.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Assay runs must include both positive and negative controls to
validate the test and results.
2. External quality control samples should be tested periodically to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the assay.
3. Any unusual or outlier results should be investigated with
repeat testing and documented accordingly.
8. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kit and PCR
reagents.
2. Standard operating procedures for real-time PCR instrument.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Follow laboratory biosafety guidelines while handling clinical
specimens and performing molecular testing.
2. Dispose of all biological waste in designated biohazard
containers.
3. Use personal protective equipment, including gloves and lab
coats, at all times when handling specimens and reagents.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING
1. Maintain thorough documentation of specimen processing, DNA
extraction, PCR setup, and results in laboratory records.
2. Ensure all equipment maintenance and calibration logs are up
to date.
This SOP is essential to provide a standardized approach for the
molecular detection of Toxoplasma gondii, ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of test results in the laboratory.
