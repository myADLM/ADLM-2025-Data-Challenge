Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Toxoplasma gondii,
Molecular Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To provide comprehensive instructions for the molecular detection of
Toxoplasma gondii using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff, including molecular technologists and
supervisors, will perform and ensure the accurate execution of the
Toxoplasma gondii PCR assay.
It is the responsibility of all staff to adhere to the SOPs to guarantee
the quality and validity of the results.
1. PRINCIPLE
The Toxoplasma gondii PCR assay is a molecular test designed to
detect the DNA of Toxoplasma gondii in various clinical specimens.
This test is based on the amplification of target DNA sequences
specific to Toxoplasma gondii using PCR, providing high sensitivity
and specificity for its detection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable specimens:
• Whole blood
• Amniotic fluid
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Placental tissue
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
• Biopsy specimens
Specimen collection and handling:
• Collect specimens using aseptic techniques to avoid
contamination.
• Store and transport specimens at 2-8 °C if processing within 24
hours. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C
or -80°C.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens with improper labeling
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or visibly contaminated specimens
• Specimens without a collection date/time
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-time PCR thermocycler
• Class II biosafety cabinet
• Micropipettes and tips
• Refrigerators and freezers
• Centrifuge
Reagents and supplies:
• DNA extraction kit (specified by the laboratory)
• PCR master mix
• Toxoplasma gondii-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control DNA templates
• PCR tubes or plates
• Disposable gloves, gowns, and face shields
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction from clinical specimens using an
appropriate commercial DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Include a negative control (no-template control) and a positive
control (known Toxoplasma gondii DNA) in each extraction
batch.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or a similar device.
B. PCR Setup
1. Thaw PCR reagents and DNA templates on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the assay
specifications. The components may include:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Toxoplasma gondii-specific primers and probes
◦ DNA polymerase
◦ Nuclease-free water
3. Vortex gently and briefly spin the mixture to collect the contents
at the bottom of the tube.
4. Dispense the appropriate amount of PCR master mix into each
PCR tube or plate well.
5. Add template DNA (clinical specimen, positive control, or
negative control) to the appropriate tubes/wells.
6. Seal the PCR tubes/plate and centrifuge briefly to ensure no air
bubbles are present.
C. Amplification and Detection
1. Place the PCR tubes/plate in the real-time PCR thermocycler.
2. Program the PCR thermocycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 40
3. Start the PCR run and ensure real-time data acquisition.
D. Quality Control
1. Ensure that each run includes a negative control and a positive
control to validate the assay's performance.
2. Analyze the control results:
◦ The positive control should show amplification, indicating
the assay is working correctly.
◦ The negative control should not show amplification,
indicating no contamination.
3. If controls fail, do not report patient results, and rerun the assay
after troubleshooting.
E. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Analyze the amplification plots and thresholds for each sample.
2. Interpret results based on the cycle threshold (Ct) values:
◦ Positive result: Ct value within the defined range for
Toxoplasma gondii
◦ Negative result: No detectable amplification within 40 cycles
◦ Indeterminate result: Requires repeat testing
3. Verify and document results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines,
ensuring critical results are communicated promptly.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable. PCR results are qualitative (positive/negative).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for limitations specific to the
PCR assay and DNA extraction kit. Limitations may include potential
inhibitory substances in the specimen, cross-contamination risks, and
sensitivity to specimen storage conditions.
