Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Toxoplasma
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for the technical component
of performing the Toxoplasma immunostain in clinical specimens.
This process is intended to ensure consistency, accuracy, and quality
of the technical work involved in staining specimens for the detection
of Toxoplasma.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all personnel performing the
Toxoplasma immunostain in the laboratory. The protocol covers the
steps from specimen preparation to the technical generation of
immunohistochemical staining results for Toxoplasma.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: All laboratory personnel performing
Toxoplasma immunostain procedures are responsible for adhering to
this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with the procedure, providing training as needed, and
troubleshooting any technical issues.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Toxoplasma: A genus of parasitic protozoa found in various
tissues of vertebrates.
• Immunostain: A laboratory technique used to detect specific
antigens in tissue sections using antibodies tagged with a visible
label.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Positive charges or coated microscope slides
• Tissue sections (4-5 µm)
• Immunostaining reagents from a validated Toxoplasma
immunohistochemistry kit
• Xylene
• Graded alcohol series (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Primary antibody specific for Toxoplasma
• Secondary antibody with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin
• Coverslips
• Mounting media
• Control slides (positive and negative)
• Incubation chambers/humidified box
• Timer
• Microscope (for initial evaluation)
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1. Preparing Tissue Sections:
1. Section the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at a thickness of
4-5 µm using a microtome.
2. Float the sections on a water bath set at approximately 45°C
and pick up the sections on positive charged or coated
microscope slides.
3. Dry the slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper
adhesion of the tissue sections.
6.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the tissue sections by placing the slides in three
changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water before proceeding to antigen
retrieval.
6.3. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Preheat the antigen retrieval solution in a microwave or
steamer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Place slides in the preheated antigen retrieval solution, and
heat for the recommended time.
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS.
6.4. Blocking Non-specific Binding: Apply a protein blocking
solution over the tissue sections and incubate for 10 minutes at room
temperature. (Buffer composition is usually included in the staining
kit). Do not wash; drain the slides.
6.5. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the primary antibody specific for Toxoplasma over the
sections and incubate in a humidified chamber as per the
manufacturer's instructions (typically 1 hour at room
temperature).
2. Rinse slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
6.6. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) and incubate
in a humidified chamber for the duration specified by the
manufacturer (usually about 30 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
6.7. Detection:
1. Apply DAB substrate; incubate slides until a brown color
develops, typically within a few minutes. Monitor under a
microscope.
2. Stop the reaction by rinsing the slides in distilled water.
6.8. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water to remove excess stain.
3. Dip slides in 0.25% acid alcohol for a few seconds and rinse in
tap water.
4. Rinse slides in PBS briefly to blue the hematoxylin.
6.9. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate through graded alcohol series (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear tissue sections in xylene.
2. Mount sections with coverslips using appropriate mounting
media.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Each batch of slides stained must include appropriate positive
and negative control slides.
2. Evaluate control slides to ensure staining specificity and
sensitivity before any patient slides are interpreted.
3. Document any deviations, observations, or technical issues
encountered during the staining process and report to the
laboratory supervisor.
8. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING:
1. The technical component of generating results for Toxoplasma
immunostain involves performing and completing the staining
protocol.
2. Results interpretation, clinical correlation, and final reporting are
to be performed by a qualified pathologist.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL: Not applicable for the technical
component of the immunostain procedure.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
1. Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and safety glasses.
2. Follow all laboratory safety protocols and universal precautions
when handling biological specimens and reagents.
3. Dispose of all waste materials appropriately as per biohazard
regulations.
11. DOCUMENTATION:
1. Maintain records of all quality control measures, including batch
numbers and expiration dates of reagents.
2. Log the results of control slide evaluation and any
troubleshooting activities.
12. REFERENCES: Specific references from the manufacturer’s
package inserts and relevant clinical laboratory standards must be
reviewed and updated periodically to ensure compliance with current
best practices.
13. REVIEW & APPROVAL: This SOP is reviewed annually by
laboratory management and approved by the laboratory director.
