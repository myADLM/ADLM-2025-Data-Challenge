Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for TP53 Gene Somatic
Mutation Pre-Analysis Cell Sorting, Varies
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the pre-analysis cell sorting required for
detecting TP53 gene somatic mutations. The procedure ensures that
only the target cell population is isolated for subsequent molecular
analysis, guaranteeing high accuracy in mutation detection.
Responsibility:
Designated staff trained in cell sorting and molecular analysis
techniques will perform and document the pre-analytical sorting. All
staff are responsible for identifying any issues that may affect the
outcome and bringing them to the attention of a supervisor.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the pre-analytical cell sorting phase in the
detection of TP53 gene somatic mutations in various specimens,
including tissue biopsies, blood samples, and other biological fluids.
3. DEFINITIONS
FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting): A specialized type of
flow cytometry used for sorting a heterogeneous mixture of cells into
different parts, based upon the specific light scattering and
fluorescent characteristics of each cell.
TP53 Gene: A gene that codes for the p53 protein, which plays a
critical role in controlling cell division and apoptosis. Mutations in this
gene are associated with several forms of cancer.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Sorting medium (e.g., PBS with 2% FBS)
• Fluorescently labeled antibodies specific to surface markers
• Flow cytometry tubes and sort collection tubes
• Ethanol or other appropriate disinfectant
• TP53 reference standard
• Molecular grade water
• Shield Fluid (e.g., FluoroPure grade water)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Flow cytometer with sorting capability (e.g., FACSAria)
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Refrigerated storage for samples at 2-8°C
• Logger to record temperature
6. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types: Acceptable specimens include fresh tissues,
blood, bone marrow, and other relevant biological fluids.
Handling:
• All specimens should be processed as soon as possible.
• Biopsies and tissues must be kept at 4°C and processed within 24
hours.
• Blood specimens should be collected in EDTA tubes and
processed within 4-6 hours.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Daily Calibration: Calibrate the flow cytometer daily following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Document calibration results.
2. Quality Control Samples: Run quality control samples using
known cell populations to verify the instrument’s performance.
B. Specimen Preparation:
1. Tissue Samples: Mince samples into small pieces and digest
using collagenase or another appropriate enzyme to obtain a
single-cell suspension.
2. Blood/Bone Marrow Samples: Dilute with an equal volume of
sorting medium and pass through a cell strainer to remove
clumps.
C. Cell Staining:
1. Add labeled antibodies: Mix the cell suspension with
fluorescently labeled antibodies specific to the surface markers.
2. Incubation: Incubate the mixture at appropriate conditions
(e.g., 4°C for 30 minutes in the dark).
3. Wash Steps: Wash cells twice with sorting medium to remove
unbound antibodies.
D. Cell Sorting:
1. Instrument Setup: Set up the flow cytometer according to the
pre-determined parameters suitable for the sample type.
2. Sorting Execution: Program the cytometer to sort the target
cell population (e.g., cancer cells).
3. Collection: Collect sorted cells into appropriate collection tubes
containing sorting medium.
E. Post-Sorting Handling:
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge collected cells at 300 x g for 10
minutes to pellet cells.
2. Resuspension: Resuspend the cell pellet in a suitable buffer
(e.g., PBS with 2% FBS) and count cells using a
hemocytometer.
F. Quality Control:
1. Verification: Verify that sorted cells have the expected purity
by re-analyzing a small aliquot via flow cytometry.
2. Documentation: Record the purity, yield, and any observations
in the logbook.
8. CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
1. Clean flow cytometer: Clean and disinfect the flow cytometer
after each run using 10% bleach followed by sterile water to
prevent contamination.
2. Periodic Maintenance: Follow manufacturer’s
recommendations for regular maintenance checks.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Analysis: Analyze the sorted cell population data and
verify against the TP53 gene mutation reference standards for
accuracy.
2. Result Documentation: Input results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and review/verify by the designated
technologist.
