Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TP53 Mutation Analysis
via Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a comprehensive protocol for the analysis of TP53
mutations using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology on
tumor samples. This protocol ensures accurate mutation identification
and reporting.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of TP53 mutation analysis using NGS in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Adhering to the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Performing all quality control (QC) checks.
• Documenting all observations, deviations, and corrective actions.
• Reporting any issues that may affect the integrity of the results to
a supervisor immediately.
4. DEFINITIONS
TP53 gene: A tumor suppressor gene that codes for the p53 protein,
which regulates the cell cycle and prevents genome mutation. NGS
(Next-Generation Sequencing): High-throughput sequencing
technology capable of sequencing multiple DNA strands
simultaneously. Tumor Samples: Specimens collected from tumor
tissues for analysis.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA extraction kits specific for tumor samples
• Quantification reagents (such as Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit)
• NGS library preparation kits
• NGS sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq)
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis (e.g., BaseSpace,
Galaxy)
• Reference genomic databases
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibrated laboratory instruments (pipettes, microcentrifuges,
thermocyclers, etc.)
• Temperature-monitored refrigerators and freezers for specimen
and reagent storage
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Utilize the DNA extraction kit to isolate DNA from tumor tissue
samples, following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Quantify the DNA using a fluorometric method (e.g., Qubit).
3. Assess DNA quality and purity using Nanodrop or another
spectrophotometer.
6.2 DNA Library Preparation
1. Follow the library preparation kit protocol for NGS. This typically
involves: a. DNA fragmentation. b. End repair. c. Adapter
ligation. d. Library amplification.
2. Confirm the quality and quantity of the prepared library using a
Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
6.3 NGS Sequencing
1. Load the prepared library onto the NGS sequencing platform as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up and configure the sequencing run.
3. Monitor the sequencing process, ensuring optimal performance
of the instrument.
6.4 Data Analysis
1. Transfer the sequencing data to the designated bioinformatics
software.
2. Perform quality control checks of the reads (e.g., using
FastQC).
3. Align the sequenced reads to the reference human genome.
4. Identify TP53 mutations using variant calling software.
5. Annotate the variants using appropriate databases (e.g.,
COSMIC, dbSNP).
6.5 Data Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the variant analysis results to identify clinically
significant TP53 mutations.
2. Cross-reference identified mutations with databases to
determine their known pathogenicity.
3. Generate a comprehensive report detailing: a. Patient
identification (in compliance with confidentiality policies), b.
Methodology, c. Detected mutations, d. Clinical significance, e.
Any limitations of the test.
6.6 Quality Control and Troubleshooting
1. Perform all necessary QC steps, including positive and
negative controls.
2. Document any deviation from the expected performance and
corrective action taken.
3. Verify and validate the results according to laboratory
standards.
6.7 Documentation
1. Complete all relevant documentation accurately and legibly.
2. Record the temperature and condition of freezers and
refrigerators containing samples and reagents.
3. Maintain instrument logs, and record any maintenance or
calibration.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable for mutation analysis; provide clinical significance
based on databases.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include known TP53 mutation-positive and -negative control
samples in every run.
2. Perform bi-weekly instrument validation checks.
3. Review QC data regularly to ensure consistency and accuracy
of results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Results will be automatically uploaded to the LIS but must be
reviewed and verified by a designated technologist. Ensure that
critical mutation findings are communicated promptly to the
requesting clinician.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. The sensitivity of detecting mutations depends on the
abundance of mutant alleles in the tumor sample.
2. Technical sensitivity and specificity may vary with sequencing
depth.
3. Certain regions of the TP53 gene may have sequencing or
mapping challenges.
