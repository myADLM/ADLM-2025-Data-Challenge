Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TRAMADOL AND
METABOLITE, RANDOM, URINE
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized and reliable method for the analysis of
Tramadol and its metabolites in random urine samples.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for Tramadol and its
metabolites in urine samples collected randomly.
3. Responsibilities
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis and documentation as per this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP,
review of the results, and taking any required corrective actions.
4. Definitions
• Tramadol: A synthetic opioid analgesic used for pain relief.
• Tramadol Metabolite: Major metabolite of Tramadol, primarily O-
desmethyltramadol.
5. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Random urine
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 10 mL
• Storage Conditions: Store specimens at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately. Specimens should be analyzed within 48 hours of
collection.
6. Equipment and Reagents
• Equipment:
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
with appropriate columns
◦ Mass Spectrometer (MS) for detection
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents:
◦ Deionized water
◦ Acetonitrile
◦ Formic Acid
◦ Tramadol reference standard
◦ Internal standard (e.g., Deuterated Tramadol)
◦ Calibrators and quality control materials
◦ Solid-phase extraction cartridges
7. Procedure
7.1 Sample Preparation
1. Thawing and Mixing:
◦ If urine samples are frozen, thaw them at room temperature.
◦ After thawing, mix the samples thoroughly by vortexing.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE):
◦ Condition the SPE cartridge with 1 mL of methanol followed
by 1 mL of deionized water.
◦ Apply 1 mL of the urine sample to the SPE cartridge.
◦ Wash the cartridge with 1 mL of deionized water.
◦ Elute with 2 mL of acetonitrile:deionized water (80:20)
containing 0.1% formic acid.
◦ Dry the eluent under a gentle stream of nitrogen at room
temperature.
4. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the dried eluent with 100 µL of mobile phase
(50% acetonitrile: 50% deionized water with 0.1% formic
acid).
7.2 HPLC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Column Preparation:
◦ Install and equilibrate the HPLC column as per the
manufacturer's instructions using the mobile phase.
2. Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using Tramadol reference
standards at different concentrations.
3. Sample Injection:
◦ Inject 10 µL of the reconstituted sample into the HPLC
system.
4. Chromatographic Conditions:
◦ Column: C18, 5 µm, 150 x 4.6 mm
◦ Mobile Phase: 50% acetonitrile: 50% deionized water with
0.1% formic acid
◦ Flow Rate: 0.5 mL/min
◦ Run Time: 10 minutes
5. Detection:
◦ Perform MS/MS detection in positive ion mode.
◦ Select Tramadol and its metabolites using their specific ion
transitions (mass-to-charge ratios).
8. Quality Control
• Include at least two levels of quality control (QC) samples (one
low and one high) with each batch of specimens.
• Run blanks and QC samples after every ten specimens to ensure
system integrity.
• Accept results only if QC samples fall within the defined limits.
9. Reporting Results
• Analyze the data using the HPLC-MS/MS software.
• Compare the sample peak areas to the calibration curve to
determine Tramadol and metabolite concentrations.
• Review and verify the data for each sample.
• Report results in μg/mL.
10. Reference Intervals
• Tramadol: Not detected, or as per laboratory reference intervals
for patients on prescribed medication.
11. Method Limitations
• Any sample showing interference or abnormal chromatographic
behavior should be repeated.
• Hematuria or high protein content may interfere with analysis and
should be noted.
12. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for HPLC and MS systems.
• CAP and CLIA guidelines for analytical procedures.
• Peer-reviewed literature on Tramadol metabolism and analysis in
biological samples.
13. Review and Approval
This SOP must be reviewed every 2 years and updated as
necessary. Approval from the laboratory director is required for any
changes.
