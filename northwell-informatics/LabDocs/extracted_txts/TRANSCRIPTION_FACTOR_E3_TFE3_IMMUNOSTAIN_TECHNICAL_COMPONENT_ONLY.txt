Standard Operating Procedure for TFE3 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the technical steps
required for the preparation, staining, and quality control of
specimens for Transcription Factor E3 (TFE3) immunostaining in the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor
to ensure that all personnel are trained and competent in this
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not FFPE.
• Poorly fixed specimens.
• Specimens that have not been properly processed or oriented.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Staining rack
• Moist chamber or humidifying chamber
• Microscope
Reagents:
• Primary antibody: Anti-TFE3
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate species-specific secondary
antibody conjugated with HRP or AP
• Detection system: HRP or AP substrate (e.g., DAB for HRP)
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Xylene and alcohol series for dewaxing and rehydration
Supplies:
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Forceps
• Slide labels
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Section Preparation:
1. Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 4-5 µm sections using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath (37-40°C) to flatten them.
3. Mount sections onto microscope slides and allow them to dry
overnight at room temperature or in a 60°C oven for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in a staining rack and deparaffinize by immersing
in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a graded alcohol series by immersing slides
in:
◦ 100% ethanol for 3 minutes (2 times)
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ Distilled water for 2 minutes (2 times)
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate method (e.g.,
heat-induced epitope retrieval using a microwave or pressure
cooker with citrate buffer pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer pH 9.0).
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and then rinse in
distilled water for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Encircle tissue sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections
with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes.
4. Apply primary antibody (Anti-TFE3) to the sections and
incubate in a moist chamber for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Rinse sections in PBS for 5 minutes (3 times).
6. Apply secondary antibody and incubate in a moist chamber for
30 minutes at room temperature.
7. Rinse sections in PBS for 5 minutes (3 times).
E. Detection:
1. Apply appropriate chromogen/substrate solution (e.g., DAB for
HRP) to sections and monitor the color development under a
microscope.
2. Rinse sections in distilled water.
F. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain sections by immersing in hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes.
2. Rinse sections in distilled water.
3. Blue the sections by dipping in Scott’s tap water substitute or
ammonia water for 30 seconds.
4. Rinse sections in distilled water.
G. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate sections through a graded alcohol series and clear
in xylene.
2. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Include a known positive control tissue on each run to ensure
staining quality.
5. Include a negative control (omitting the primary antibody) to
check for non-specific staining.
6. Inspect the stained slides under a microscope to confirm the
presence and specificity of the staining.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Stained slides are forwarded to a pathologist for interpretation. No
results are to be reported by the laboratory personnel.
