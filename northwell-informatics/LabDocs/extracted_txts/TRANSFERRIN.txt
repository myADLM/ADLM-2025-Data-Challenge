Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Transferrin Assay
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps involved in the analytical phase of generating
results for transferrin, ensuring accuracy, precision, and reliability of
the results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the assay according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of laboratory
supervisors to ensure the assay is performed and documented
appropriately, including any corrective actions that may be required.
1. DEFINITION
Transferrin is a glycoprotein that binds and transports iron in the
blood. Measurement of serum transferrin is used to evaluate iron
status and diagnose disorders such as iron deficiency anemia or
hemochromatosis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum or plasma (collected in an EDTA, heparin, or
sodium citrate tube).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum and plasma samples are stable for up to 7 days when
refrigerated at 4-8°C.
• Samples can be stored frozen at -20°C or colder for up to 6
months if prolonged storage is required. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Samples collected in tubes other than those specified above.
• Specimens received in the laboratory without proper labeling or
collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Chemistry analyzer capable of performing immunoassays.
• Transferrin reagent kits specific to the analyzer (ensure they are
stored and used according to the manufacturer's instructions).
• Calibrators and quality control (QC) materials.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Sample cups or tubes.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and lab
coat.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Calibration and Quality Control
• Before running patient samples, calibrate the analyzer with the
appropriate transferrin standards according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Run QC materials (one normal and one abnormal level) alongside
patient samples to ensure assay accuracy and precision.
Document QC results in the log.
5.2. Sample Preparation
• Thaw frozen samples (if applicable) at room temperature and mix
thoroughly by gentle inversion or vortexing.
• Centrifuge samples at 2000-3000 RPM for 10-15 minutes to
ensure the removal of any particulate matter or cells.
• Aliquot the required volume of sample into sample cups or tubes
for analysis.
5.3. Performing the Assay
• Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and QC materials onto
the analyzer.
• Program the analyzer according to the transferrin assay protocol
provided by the manufacturer.
• Start the assay and monitor the analyzer to ensure proper
functioning. Address any analyzer errors or alerts according to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
5.4. Result Verification and Documentation
• Once the assay is complete, review results for both patient
samples and QC materials.
• Accept results only if QC materials are within the specified
confidence limits. If QC results are out of range, investigate and
repeat the assay with fresh QC materials and patient samples.
• Document patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and manually record in the log if required.
• Ensure proper calculation and reporting of transferrin results in
mg/dL or g/L as per laboratory protocols.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transferrin results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and
must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Ensure any flagged or critical results are addressed promptly with
appropriate action, including contacting the relevant clinician if
necessary.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for transferrin may vary by laboratory and
population but generally fall within the following ranges:
• Adult males: 200-360 mg/dL (2.0-3.6 g/L)
• Adult females: 180-340 mg/dL (1.8-3.4 g/L)
Consult the reagent kit insert for any specific reference interval
recommendations from the manufacturer.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the package insert of the transferrin assay for specific
limitations including:
• Potential interferences from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Cross-reactivities and assay specificities.
• Impact of improper sample collection and handling on the
accuracy of results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure routine maintenance and calibration of the analyzer
according to manufacturer guidelines.
• Regularly monitor and document QC results to identify trends or
deviations requiring corrective action.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing assay accuracy.
