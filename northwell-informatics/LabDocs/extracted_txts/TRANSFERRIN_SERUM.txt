Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measurement of Serum
Transferrin
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized, accurate,
and precise testing for the measurement of serum transferrin
concentration in patient samples. It is essential for ensuring
consistency in results, thereby facilitating correct medical diagnosis
and treatment.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the operation,
maintenance, and result reporting of serum transferrin testing in the
clinical laboratory.
3. DEFINITION
Transferrin is a glycoprotein that binds and transports iron in the
blood. Measurement of serum transferrin is useful in the diagnosis
and management of iron deficiency and various anemias.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel authorized and trained to perform serum
protein assays are responsible for conducting these tests following
this guideline. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
validating test results, ensuring compliance with the procedure, and
handling any issues that arise.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Analyzer: Cobas 6000 (Insert specific model if applicable)
• Reagents:
◦ Transferrin reagent kit (e.g., Roche Diagnostics)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Quality control material (QC) - 2 levels (Normal and high/low
controls)
• Supplies:
◦ Serum separation tubes (SST) or red top tubes
◦ Micropipettes and tips
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or a plain red top tube.
• Processing: Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 20-30
minutes. Centrifuge the sample at 1000-2000 x g for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
• Storage: Serum can be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or
lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Pre-Analytical Check:
◦ Review and confirm specimen type and patient details.
◦ Inspect serum for hemolysis or lipemia which may interfere
with the assay.
2. Preparation:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
guidelines using the provided calibrators.
◦ Then, prepare and load the reagent kits and quality control
materials onto the analyzer as described in the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Perform QC testing at the beginning of each shift or batch of
tests.
◦ Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range before
running patient samples. If not, troubleshoot according to
the manufacturer's instructions and repeat QC testing.
4. Running the Test:
◦ Ensure the analyzer is ready for operation according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Load patient samples onto the analyzer. Indicate the sample
position numbers.
◦ Start the test run and ensure the analyzer completes the
process without errors.
5. Post-Run:
◦ Evaluate quality control data and ensure it meets acceptable
criteria.
◦ Review results from the patient run for any flags or error
messages on the analyzer. Repeat any samples that show
inconsistent results or fall outside reference ranges.
8. RESULT REPORTING
• Reference Range: Confirm with the latest laboratory reference
intervals. Generally:
◦ Normal Range: 200-360 mg/dL (may vary slightly by lab and
methodology)
• Interpreting Results:
◦ Low transferrin levels may indicate iron overload, chronic liver
disease, or malnutrition.
◦ Elevated transferrin levels may suggest iron deficiency anemia
or pregnancy.
• Documentation and Verification:
◦ Once the results are verified, they will be entered into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS), after which they are
released to the healthcare provider.
◦ Critical results must be phoned directly to the healthcare
provider and documented in LIS.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Transferrin levels may be affected by factors like liver disease,
chronic inflammation, malnutrition, and certain medications.
• Hemolyzed and lipemic samples may yield inaccurate results and
should be avoided.
• Refer to the reagent insert for additional specific limitations.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow the laboratory’s quality assurance guidelines.
• In the event of equipment malfunction or result inconsistency,
refer to the analyzer manual and perform necessary
troubleshooting actions.
• Initiate corrective action based on the percentage deviation of QC
from the mean.
