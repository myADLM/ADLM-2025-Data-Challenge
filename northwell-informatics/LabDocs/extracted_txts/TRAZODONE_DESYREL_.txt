Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
TRAZODONE (DESYREL)
Purpose: To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating TRAZODONE (DESYREL) results in the CLIA-certified
laboratory to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: Designated staff will follow the procedures outlined
to perform TRAZODONE (DESYREL) analysis. It is the responsibility
of all laboratory personnel to identify any issues affecting test results
and notify the supervisor immediately.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
equivalent analytical instrumentation
• HPLC columns suitable for TRAZODONE analysis
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g. acetonitrile, water, buffer solutions)
• TRAZODONE (DESYREL) reference standard
• Internal standard (if applicable)
• Sample vials and caps
• Auto-sampler (if available)
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Specimen type: Blood (serum or plasma) or urine
• Blood specimens should be collected in serum separator tubes
(SST) or EDTA tubes.
• Urine specimens should be collected in clean containers without
preservatives.
• Specimens must be stored and transported under recommended
conditions to maintain stability until analysis.
◦ Blood specimens: Stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C.
◦ Urine specimens: Stable for up to 72 hours at room
temperature.
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure specimens are properly labeled and documented
with patient information.
◦ Centrifuge blood specimens at recommended speed and
time to obtain serum/plasma.
◦ Aliquot serum/plasma or urine into appropriately labeled
sample vials.
◦ Add internal standard to each sample if required.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Prepare and filter mobile phase solvents.
◦ Condition the HPLC column with mobile phase as described
in the column manufacturer's instructions.
3. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Prepare calibration standards using TRAZODONE reference
standard at multiple concentrations.
◦ Run calibration standards to generate calibration curve.
◦ Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) to ensure the accuracy of the calibration
curve.
◦ Document calibration and quality control results.
4. Analysis:
◦ Load prepared samples into the auto-sampler (if available)
or manually inject samples into the HPLC system.
◦ Set HPLC parameters including flow rate, injection volume,
column temperature, and detector settings.
◦ Run the samples and record chromatograms.
◦ Ensure retention time and peak identification of
TRAZODONE align with the reference standard and
calibration curve.
5. Data Processing:
◦ Analyze chromatograms to quantify TRAZODONE
concentration in each sample using the calibration curve.
◦ Verify results against quality control samples.
6. Reporting Results:
◦ Document TRAZODONE concentrations in laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a designated
staff member before reporting.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting critical results.
7. Quality Control:
◦ Perform routine quality checks on equipment and reagents.
◦ Document any discrepancies and take corrective actions as
needed.
◦ Include participation in inter-laboratory comparison
programs if applicable.
