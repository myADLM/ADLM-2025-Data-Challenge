Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus spp) IgE
1. PURPOSE
To outline procedures for the analysis and reporting of IgE levels
specific to Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus spp) using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or similar immunoassay techniques,
ensuring accuracy and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory staff qualified in ELISA and other immunoassay
techniques are responsible for performing the analysis according to
this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this
SOP and addressing any procedural deficiencies.
1. DEFINITION
IgE (Immunoglobulin E): A class of antibody associated with allergic
reactions. Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus spp): A genus of the family
Simaroubaceae known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive
individuals.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Preparation
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples collected in red-top clot tubes.
• Plasma samples collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to 7 days at refrigerated
temperatures (2-8°C) and up to 3 months at -20°C.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples hemolyzed or contaminated.
• Samples with insufficient volume for analysis (minimum 1 mL
required).
B) Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies
Reagents:
• ELISA kit specific for Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus spp) IgE
(purchase from a certified supplier).
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the manufacturer.
Equipment:
• ELISA reader capable of reading at specified wavelengths
(usually 450 nm).
• Microplate washer.
• Incubator (37°C).
Supplies:
• Micropipettes and sterile tips.
• Microplates (96-well format).
• PPE including lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles.
C) Analytical Procedure
1. Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum/plasma samples to come to room temperature before
analysis.
• Centrifuge the samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates.
1. ELISA Assay Setup:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for setting up the ELISA
assay.
• Ensure proper calibration of the ELISA reader and consistent
washing of wells during the assay.
1. Running the Assay:
• Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples to the
designated wells.
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended time (usually 1
hour).
• Wash wells extensively using the microplate washer.
• Add the enzyme conjugate and incubate again as per the kit's
instructions.
• Add substrate solution and incubate until the color develops.
• Stop the reaction using the stop solution provided.
1. Reading and Interpreting Results:
• Read the plate using an ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength.
• Calculate IgE concentration for Tree of Heaven by comparing OD
values of samples with the standard curve.
• Document findings on the appropriate record sheet with date,
time, and initials of the technologist.
D) Quality Control
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Log control results and ensure they fall within the acceptable
range.
• Include results of calibrator and control verification in the final
report.
Troubleshooting:
• If results fall outside accepted control ranges, check reagents,
equipment calibration, and assay conditions.
• Re-run assay if necessary and notify supervisor of persistent
issues.
E) Reporting Results
Documentation:
• Record findings including patient identification, IgE levels, and
relevant comments in the electronic LIS system.
• Verify results per laboratory protocol before releasing reports to
physicians.
Critical Values:
• Notify supervising staff if results indicate values outside of
clinically accepted ranges.
• Follow the protocol for reporting critical results to ensure timely
physician notification.
