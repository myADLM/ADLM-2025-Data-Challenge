Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for TREE PANEL #1, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the analytical procedures for TREE PANEL #1,
SERUM, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reproducible test results.
This protocol outlines the steps for the analysis phase using
designated laboratory equipment and reagents while maintaining
compliance with CLIA standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all designated laboratory scientists who
perform TREE PANEL #1, SERUM analysis in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory scientists to follow this
protocol thoroughly and to report any deviations or inconsistencies
immediately to the laboratory supervisor. Additionally, ensure that
quality control measures are adhered to and documented properly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Collection: Blood is collected and allowed to clot. Serum is
separated by centrifugation. Ensure that serum is free from
hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
Specimen Stability: Serum specimens are stable for 48 hours at
2-8°C. If longer storage is required, serum should be aliquoted and
stored at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed serum
• Serum with significant lipemia or icterus
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection (if stored
at 2-8°C) without prior freezing.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (specified model: e.g., Cobas
6000)
• Reagent Kits specific for TREE PANEL #1
• Calibrators and Controls specific for the target analytes
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample cups or racks compatible with the analyzer
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
• Quality Control materials
6. REAGENTS
• TREE PANEL #1 Reagent Kit (store as per manufacturer's
instructions)
• Calibrators
• Control materials (store as per manufacturer's instructions)
• Distilled water
7. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Checks:
1. Verify the integrity of the specimen (no hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus).
2. Ensure serum volume meets the minimum requirement.
3. Bring serum specimens to room temperature slowly before
analysis if stored at 2-8°C.
Analyzer Preparation:
1. Turn on the analyzer and allow it to perform self-checks.
2. Load reagents into the analyzer, ensuring they are compatible
and not expired.
3. Perform daily maintenance and calibration as per the analyzer’s
guidelines and manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Run a system check QC to ensure the analyzer is functioning
properly before running patient specimens.
Sample Analysis:
1. Label sample cups or racks properly with patient identifiers.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum into designated sample
cups or directly into the analyzer's sample position.
3. Load the sample cups/racks into the analyzer.
4. Select the TREE PANEL #1 test in the analyzer software.
5. Confirm and start the test run.
Quality Control:
1. Run QC materials alongside patient samples as per laboratory
policy (at least two levels of QC - normal and abnormal).
2. Evaluate QC results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range. Any deviations must be addressed before patient results
are reported.
Post-Analytical Procedures:
1. Review all results generated by the analyzer for any flags or
alerts indicating potential issues.
2. Validate results if QC is within acceptable ranges.
3. Manually check any flagged results.
4. Document any necessary follow-up tests or actions.
5. Ensure all results are recorded in the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) and reportable to the ordering physician.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Ensure critical values are flagged and reported immediately to
the ordering physician.
3. Results are entered into the LIS.
4. Maintain detailed records of all specimens, controls, and
calibrator results for future review and audit purposes.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide for any error codes or
malfunctions.
• Repeat analysis if QC fails and re-assess all equipment and
reagents used in the initial run.
• Report persistent issues to the laboratory supervisor or
manufacturer’s service representative.
10. LABORATORY SAFETY
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
• Follow standard laboratory biosafety procedures.
• Dispose of all waste material, including used reagents and
sample cups, according to biohazard protocols.

12. REVIEW CYCLE
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure
compliance with the latest standards and technological updates.
