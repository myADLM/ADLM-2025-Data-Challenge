Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
TREE PANEL #3, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the analytical steps required to generate
reliable and accurate results for TREE PANEL #3 from serum
samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory scientists to follow this
SOP and ensure all steps are correctly performed and documented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Minimum volume: 2 mL.
• Specimens should be delivered to the laboratory within 24 hours
of collection.
• Specimens should be stored/refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
immediately processed.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection.
• Specimens with incorrect labeling or without collection date/time
indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ARCHITECT i2000SR)
• Appropriate assay kits for TREE PANEL #3 analytes.
• Calibrators, controls, and diluents specific to the assay kits.
• Micropipettes and disposable tips.
• Centrifuge for serum separation.
• Biohazard disposal containers.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Checks:
• Verify specimen labeling and ensure appropriate volume and
condition.
• Centrifuge SST tubes at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
• Pour serum off the separator and into a properly labeled
secondary tube.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and controls have been run
and are within acceptable ranges.
B. Assay Preparation:
• Prepare calibrators and controls according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Load sample, calibrators, and quality control material onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
• Enter sample information into the LIS (Laboratory Information
System) including unique identifiers and test panel details.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for setting up and
processing the TREE PANEL #3 assays on the immunoassay
analyzer.
2. Perform sample dilutions if necessary, ensuring traceability and
accurate documentation.
3. Start the assay run and monitor the analyzer for any error
codes or abnormal conditions during the run.
D. Quality Control:
• Run at least two levels of control material (Low and High) with the
TREE PANEL #3 assays.
• Verify that control results fall within specified limits. If control
results are out of range, troubleshoot per manufacturer guidelines
and rerun controls if necessary before testing patient samples.
• If control failures persist, do not report patient results and consult
a supervisor for further action.
E. Result Generation:
1. Once the run is complete, review the automatic data
transmission to the LIS.
2. Verify results against quality control values.
3. Check results for any flags or alerts generated by the analyzer
and investigate as necessary.
4. Ensure results are correctly matched to patient identifiers and
test requisitions.
F. Reporting Results:
• Review results for accuracy and consistency.
• Verify and authorize results in the LIS.
• Report critical values promptly according to laboratory policy.
• Document any instances of analytical issues or unusual results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay kit inserts for limitations regarding
interference, sensitivity, specificity, and performance characteristics
inherent to each test included in TREE PANEL #3.
