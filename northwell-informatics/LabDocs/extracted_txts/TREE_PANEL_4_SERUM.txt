Protocol for Analytical Phase: TREE PANEL #4, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analysis of Tree Panel
#4 in serum specimens. The process ensures accurate and
consistent results while adhering to regulatory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
analysis, maintaining equipment, performing quality control, and
documenting results as per this protocol. Supervisors ensure
compliance with these procedures and address any issues that arise
during testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Serum specimens should be collected in a serum
separator tube (SST). After blood collection, allow the sample to
clot for 30 minutes at room temperature, then centrifuge for 10
minutes at 1500–2000 x g.
• Volume: Minimum volume required is 2 ml of serum.
• Storage:
◦ Short-term: Store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
◦ Long-term: Store at -20°C for up to 6 months. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
• Transport: Specimens should be transported in a cooler with ice
packs to maintain the temperature between 2-8°C.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Freezer (-20°C)
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Analytical instruments specific to Tree Panel #4
• Reagents: Specific reagents and controls for Tree Panel #4
analysis as provided by the manufacturer.
• Supplies:
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Sample cups or vials for autoanalyzer
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-Analysis
1. Specimen Reception:
◦ Record the specimen ID, collection time/date, and any
relevant clinical information.
◦ Verify specimen integrity and volume.
◦ Store specimen at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 72
hours; otherwise, store at -20°C.
2. Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
◦ Mix specimens gently by inversion and check for hemolysis,
turbidity, or any discrepancies.
5.2 Analysis
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Turn on the analytical instrument and verify calibration
status.
◦ Perform daily calibration using provided calibrators.
◦ Run quality control checks using high, medium, and low
control materials. Record results.
2. Testing Procedure:
◦ Load specimens into the instrument as per manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Input specimen ID and test parameters.
◦ Run the Tree Panel #4 analysis according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Review real-time data output and flag any anomalous
results for further inspection.
5.3 Post-Analysis
1. Data Review:
◦ Examine raw data for adherence to expected ranges.
◦ Ensure all quality control results are within acceptable limits.
◦ Apply necessary corrections based on QC results.
2. Result Verification:
◦ Validate results against reference ranges.
◦ Ensure accurate transcription of results into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks at the beginning of each shift and
whenever new reagents are introduced. Record all QC results.
• Address any QC failures immediately, repeat tests if necessary,
and notify the supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Tree Panel #4 analytes must be reported within clinically
established reference intervals.
◦ Specific intervals should be included according to individual
tests in the panel.
• Documentation:
◦ Report results in the LIS along with flagged abnormal findings.
◦ Review and confirm results before releasing to clinicians.
8. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Critical result values must be reported immediately following
standard communication protocols. Document all critical result
notifications as per regulatory guidelines.
9. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure all equipment is routinely maintained according to
manufacturer instructions.
• In case of instrument malfunction or unexpected results, follow
the troubleshooting guide provided by the manufacturer.
• Inform supervisor of persistent issues and log all corrective
actions taken.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
