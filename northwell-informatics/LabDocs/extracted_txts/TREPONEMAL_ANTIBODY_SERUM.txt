STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: TREPONEMAL
ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline a standardized protocol for the analytical procedure of
detecting Treponemal antibodies (syphilis antibodies) in serum
samples, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and reliability in test
results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top
tube.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum is preferred.
• Samples should be centrifuged and separated to obtain serum
within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in EDTA, citrate, or heparin tubes.
• Samples with less than 0.5 mL of serum.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or have no collection
date/time indicated.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or Chemiluminescent Immunoassay
(CLIA) system compatible with Treponemal antibody testing.
• Calibrators and controls specific to Treponemal antibody assays.
• Incubators set at 37°C.
• Automated microwell plate washer (for EIA methods).
• Microwell plate reader or chemiluminescence analyzer.
• Pipettes and tips for accurate transfer of reagents.
• Dilution buffers and clean microplates if manual dilution is needed
before processing.
• Timer.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Run control samples (positive and negative) with each new lot of
reagents and periodically according to the laboratory's quality
assurance program. Results must fall within the established range for
the assay to be considered valid.
5. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Sample Preparation
• Allow refrigerated serum samples to equilibrate to room
temperature.
• Mix the samples gently before processing.
Step 2: Loading Samples and Reagents
• Add an appropriate volume (typically 50-100 µL as specified by
the test kit manufacturer) of patient serum, calibrators, and control
sera to designated wells of the assay plate.
• Add enzyme conjugate reagent and incubate the plate within the
specified temperature-controlled incubator. Duration and
temperature will vary based on the assay manufacturer's
instructions, generally 37°C for 30-60 minutes.
Step 3: Washing
• Wash the wells with the supplied wash buffer solution using an
automated plate washer. Typically, 3-5 wash cycles are required
to remove unbound material.
Step 4: Detection Reaction
• Add the substrate solution to all wells and incubate for the
specified period, allowing the enzyme-substrate reaction to occur.
• For EIA: Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided
with the test kit.
• For CLIA: Proceed directly to reading the luminescence.
Step 5: Reading and Interpretation
• For EIA: Read the optical density (OD) using a plate reader set to
the appropriate wavelength (usually between 450 nm to 620 nm).
• For CLIA: Read the relative light units (RLU) using a
chemiluminescent reader.
Step 6: Calculating Results
• Quantitative assays: Compare the patient sample OD/RLU results
to the calibrator curve to determine the antibody concentration.
• Qualitative assays: Interpret the sample result as reactive, non-
reactive, or equivocal based on pre-established cut-off values
provided by the manufacturer.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Attach relevant interpretative comments. For example, "Reactive
results indicate the presence of Treponemal antibodies,
consistent with past or present Syphilis infection."
• Equivocal results should be followed by a repeat test with a fresh
sample or confirmatory testing via a different method if clinically
appropriate.
7. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly check and maintain equipment according to
manufacturer specifications.
• If controls fall outside acceptable ranges or equipment signals an
error, recalibrate or conduct maintenance before re-testing
affected samples.
