Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for Triazolam (Halcion) to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedures outlined in this SOP and ensuring quality control.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to these
procedures.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the measurement of Triazolam in human
serum or plasma. It is intended for use by trained laboratory
personnel in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimen Types:
• Serum: 3-5 mL of blood collected in a red-top tube.
• Plasma: 3-5 mL of blood collected in a lavender-top (EDTA) or
green-top (heparin) tube.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride/oxalate or citrate tubes.
• Specimens not properly labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Mass
Spectrometry (MS).
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., test tubes, vials).
Reagents and Supplies:
• Triazolam reference standard.
• Internal standard (e.g., Diazepam).
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, methanol).
• Calibration curve standards.
• Quality control (QC) materials.
1. PROCEDURE
a) Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum/plasma specimens to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes.
• Centrifuge samples at 1,300-1,500 g for 10 minutes to obtain
clear supernatant.
• Aliquot serum/plasma into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
b) Preparation of Calibration Curve:
• Prepare a series of calibration standards with known
concentrations of Triazolam.
• Include an internal standard in each calibration standard.
• Process the calibration standards through the same extraction
and analytical procedure as patient specimens.
c) Sample Extraction:
• Pipette an aliquot of each patient specimen into a clean extraction
tube.
• Add the internal standard to each specimen.
• Vortex mix for 1-2 minutes.
• Perform liquid-liquid extraction using appropriate solvent (e.g.,
hexane).
• Centrifuge the mixture and transfer the organic layer to a clean
tube.
• Evaporate the organic layer under a stream of nitrogen.
• Reconstitute the residue in the mobile phase.
d) Chromatographic Analysis:
• Set up the HPLC or MS system according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Inject a known volume of the prepared extract into the system.
• Use the following chromatographic conditions (example for
HPLC):
◦ Column: C18 analytical column.
◦ Mobile phase: Acetonitrile:Water (60:40) with 0.1% formic acid.
◦ Flow rate: 1 mL/min.
◦ Detection wavelength: 220 nm.
◦ Injection volume: 10 µL.
• Run the chromatographic analysis and record the peak areas.
e) Data Analysis:
• Generate a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratio
(Triazolam: Internal Standard) of the calibration standards.
• Calculate the concentration of Triazolam in patient specimens
using the calibration curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples (low, medium, and high) with each batch of
patient specimens.
• Evaluate QC results against established acceptance criteria.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, review the procedure,
investigate the cause, and reanalyze affected specimens.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review chromatograms and calculated concentrations for each
patient specimen.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and release results according to laboratory protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Therapeutic Range:
• 0.01 – 0.02 µg/mL.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample preparation to avoid matrix effects or
interference.
• Cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines may lead to false-
positive results.
1. REFERENCES
• Current laboratory guidelines and manufacturer’s instructions for
HPLC or MS.
• Relevant clinical and pharmacological literature on Triazolam
analysis.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Document all procedures, including calibration curves, QC results,
and patient results.
• Maintain records for a minimum of the duration required by
regulatory agencies.
