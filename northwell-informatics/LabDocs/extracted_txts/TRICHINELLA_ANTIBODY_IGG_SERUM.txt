TRICHINELLA ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM - STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of Trichinella
Antibody, IgG, in serum samples using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory technologists to perform the
procedure correctly and maintain accurate records. Supervisors must
ensure timely and proper training of all staff conducting the assay.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Microplate Reader
• ELISA Washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Trichinella Antibody (IgG) ELISA Kit
• Calibrated Timer
• Distilled or Deionized Water
• Absorbent Paper
• Lab Coat, Gloves, and Eye Protection
4. DEFINITIONS
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a plate-based
assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying soluble
substances.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: 5 mL of serum separated from a venous blood
sample collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
The serum should be free from hemolysis and lipemia.
• Unacceptable: Plasma or whole blood specimens, hemolyzed or
lipemic samples, and specimens stored at inappropriate
temperatures for extended periods.
6. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer
storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the serum samples and all reagents are at room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions
provided in the Trichinella Antibody (IgG) ELISA Kit.
2. Label the microplate wells in the required configuration,
ensuring proper identification of standards, controls, and patient
samples.
3. Add 100 µL of each standard, control, or patient sample to the
designated wells. Duplicate wells are recommended for each
standard.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Wash the wells 5 times with the provided wash buffer, using the
ELISA washer. Ensure complete removal of wash buffer after
the last wash by tapping the plate on absorbent paper.
6. Add 50 µL of biotinylated antibody reagent to each well.
7. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
8. Wash the wells as described in step 5.
9. Add 100 µL of the provided enzyme conjugate to each well.
10. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
11. Wash the wells as described in step 5.
12. Add 100 µL of chromogen substrate solution to each well.
13. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 10-20 minutes in the
dark.
14. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
Gently tap the plate to mix.
C) Measurement
1. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
the assay's validity.
• Evaluate results of the controls before interpreting patient results.
The assay is valid if:
◦ The OD of the negative control is within the specified range.
◦ The OD of the positive control is within the specified range and
higher than the negative control.
9. CALCULATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
1. Construct a standard curve using the ODs of the standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of Trichinella antibody IgG in
patient samples by comparing their ODs with the standard
curve.
3. Report results as positive or negative based on the cutoff value
provided in the kit insert.
4. Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and review by a qualified technologist.
10. LIMITATIONS
• False-positive results may occur due to cross-reactivity with
antibodies against other infections.
• Clinical correlation, along with other diagnostic tests, is necessary
for a definitive diagnosis.
