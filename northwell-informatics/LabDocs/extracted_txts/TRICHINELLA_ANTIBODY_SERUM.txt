Standard Operating Procedure for the Detection of Trichinella
Antibody in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps for the detection of Trichinella antibody in
serum samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) method. This test is used to aid in the diagnosis of Trichinella
infection.
Responsibility:
• The laboratory technologist is responsible for performing the
procedure as outlined.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedure and for reviewing the documented results.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum samples collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or a
plain red-top tube.
• Samples should be allowed to coagulate and then centrifuged at
3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate serum.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly contaminated samples.
• Samples without proper labeling or requisition.
• Samples not stored appropriately or beyond the stability period.
Stability:
• Samples are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, samples should be stored at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader with a 450 nm filter.
• ELISA incubator/shaker.
• Micropipettes and tips (10 µL, 100 µL, 200 µL, 1000 µL).
• Multi-channel pipette and tips.
• 1X PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline).
• Wash buffer.
• TMB substrate.
• Stop solution (1N HCl or equivalent).
• Positive and negative control sera.
• Trichinella antibody ELISA kit, including antigen-coated wells,
conjugate, and sample diluent.
• Laboratory timer.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
• Gently mix all reagents before use. Do not use reagents past their
expiration date.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute serum samples 1:100 in sample diluent (e.g., 10 µL of
serum + 990 µL of diluent).
2. ELISA Plate Setup:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted samples to appropriate wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of positive control to designated wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of negative control to designated wells.
◦ It is recommended to run all standards, controls, and
samples in duplicate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Remove the well contents and wash the plate 3 times with
1X PBS or wash buffer. After the final wash, tap the plate
upside down to remove any residual buffer.
5. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Washing:
◦ Repeat the wash step 3 times as described above.
8. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well and incubate at
room temperature in the dark for 10-15 minutes or until a
color change is observed.
9. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. The solution should turn yellow.
10. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA reader
immediately after adding the stop solution.
11. RESULT CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the mean absorbance of the standards, controls, and
samples.
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards versus their known concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of Trichinella antibodies in the
samples by comparing the absorbance values to the standard
curve.
Reference Range:
• Negative: Absorbance below the cut-off value determined by the
kit insert.
• Positive: Absorbance equal to or above the cut-off value.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure assay
validity.
• If controls do not meet the expected values, the run is considered
invalid, and the assay must be repeated.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are documented and entered into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Positive results should be reviewed by the laboratory supervisor
before reporting.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow biosafety guidelines for handling blood samples.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• All waste should be disposed of according to biohazard
regulations.
1. LIMITATIONS
• This test is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of
Trichinella infection.
• Cross-reactivity with antibodies from other infections may occur.
