Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for
Generating Results for Trichloroacetic Acid, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) in urine.
This includes sample preparation, reagent and equipment setup,
analysis, quality control, and reporting results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of Trichloroacetic Acid in urine samples at the laboratory.
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
3.1 Specimen:
• Acceptable: 50 mL urine sample collected in a sterile container,
properly labeled with patient identifier, collection date, and time.
• Stability: Urine samples are stable for up to 48 hours when
refrigerated at 2-8°C. For immediate analysis, samples should be
brought to room temperature.
3.2 Unacceptable:
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation.
• Specimens that have been collected longer than 48 hours without
refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• pH meter
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
4.2 Reagents:
• Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) standard solutions
• Mobile Phase: Acetonitrile-water mixture, appropriately buffered
• Internal standard (if applicable)
• Methanol (HPLC grade)
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the urine sample thoroughly by inverting the container
several times.
2. Centrifuge urine sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial.
4. Adjust the pH of the supernatant to the desired range (e.g.,
2.0-3.0) using dilute hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as
needed.
5. Add the internal standard (if applicable) to the prepared sample.
5.2 HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase by mixing Acetonitrile and water in
the desired ratio and buffer appropriately.
3. Prime and equilibrate the HPLC system with the mobile phase.
4. Inject a set amount of the prepared urine sample (e.g., 20 µL)
into the HPLC system.
5. Run the sample under set chromatographic conditions (e.g.,
flow rate, temperature, and detection wavelength).
6. Record the chromatogram and identify the peak corresponding
to Trichloroacetic Acid by comparing retention times with the
standard solution.
5.3 Quality Control:
1. Run quality control standards including blank, low, medium, and
high concentrations of Trichloroacetic Acid.
2. Ensure that the QC results fall within the acceptable range.
3. Document any deviations and take necessary corrective
actions.
4. Perform calibration checks using standard solutions at regular
intervals.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Analyze the chromatogram to quantify the concentration of
Trichloroacetic Acid in the urine sample using the calibration
curve obtained from the standard solutions.
7. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
8. Review the results for accuracy and consistency.
9. Verify the results after ensuring that all quality control
parameters are met.
10. Report critical or abnormal results to the appropriate clinical
personnel immediately following clinical protocols.
11. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
12. Aliquot a small amount of the sample and centrifuge if
necessary to check for any issues like hemolysis.
13. Use best judgment to assess sample integrity before reporting.
14. METHOD LIMITATIONS
15. Interferences: Consult the instrument and reagent manual for
known interferences and ensure steps are taken to minimize
them.
16. Linearity: Verify that the results fall within the linear range of the
method.
