1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the standard procedure for
the analytical phase of generating results for Trichoderma viride, IgE,
serum. This test is used to investigate potential allergic reactions
caused by the presence of Trichoderma viride.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel who are trained and
competent in immunoassay testing to ensure that this procedure is
followed accurately and efficiently to guarantee the reliability of test
results.
1. DEFINITION
Trichoderma viride-specific IgE testing involves quantitative
measurement of immunoglobulin E antibodies in the serum,
indicative of an allergic hypersensitivity to Trichoderma viride.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
Preferred:
• 1 mL of serum collected in a clot activator tube (e.g., red-top tube)
or serum separator tube (SST).
• Maintain serum samples at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately and
for long term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples as they can interfere with
the accuracy of the results.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or other anticoagulants.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250, ImmunoCAP)
• Trichoderma viride-specific IgE reagent kits
• Controls (negative and positive)
• Calibrators
• Serum sample tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained as per the
manufacturer's specifications.
2. Verify and document that the temperature of storage equipment
(refrigerator/freezer) is within the target range.
3. Prepare all necessary reagents, controls, and calibrators as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
Testing Procedure:
1. Thaw frozen samples to room temperature. Mix samples
thoroughly by gently inverting.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Load samples, controls, and calibrators into the Immunoassay
analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Input the test parameters into the analyzer for Trichoderma
viride-specific IgE detection.
5. Start the analysis and monitor the run. Note the start time.
Quality Control:
1. Run negative and positive controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Ensure controls are within the expected range before analyzing
patient samples.
3. Document any deviations and take corrective actions if controls
do not meet criteria.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Upon completion, review the results for the analyte
concentration:
◦ Positive result: Detectable and elevated levels of
Trichoderma viride-specific IgE.
◦ Negative result: Levels of Trichoderma viride-specific IgE
within the normal reference range.
Reference Intervals:
• Trichoderma viride, IgE, serum: <0.35 kUA/L
Note: Results significantly above the normal range may indicate an
allergic response to Trichoderma viride.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify and validate results against the control samples and
reference ranges.
3. Document any critical results and communicate immediately to
the requesting clinician as per the laboratory’s critical result
policy.
Sample Integrity:
1. Evaluate the sample for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus. If
significant interference is present, reject the sample and
request a recollection.
2. Document any issues regarding sample integrity and the
corrective actions taken.
Method Limitations:
1. Potential interference from high levels of total IgE, heterophilic
antibodies, or other allergens.
2. Refer to the reagent manufacturer's insert for detailed
limitations.

This protocol ensures that the examination and reporting of
Trichoderma viride, IgE, serum are conducted reliably and in
compliance with the required standards, thus providing accurate and
meaningful results for patient diagnosis and management.
