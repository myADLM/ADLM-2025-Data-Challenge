Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Trichomonas
Vaginalis, Nucleic Acid Amplification
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for the analytical phase
of testing for Trichomonas Vaginalis using Nucleic Acid Amplification
(NAA) techniques.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
testing, ensure the accuracy of results, and document all steps as per
this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred/acceptable specimens:
◦ Vaginal swabs collected in a sterile container or in a transport
medium suitable for nucleic acid testing.
◦ Urine samples collected in a sterile container (first-catch urine
preferred).
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Specimens not in appropriate collection/transport medium.
◦ Specimens not labelled with collection date/time.
◦ Specimens that have leaked or are visually contaminated.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocycler (PCR Machine)
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kits
• Trichomonas Vaginalis Nucleic Acid Amplification Kit
• Sterile pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Centrifuge
• Heat block/incubator
• Vortex mixer
5. PROCEDURAL STEPS
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Preparation:
◦ Clean and disinfect work surfaces.
◦ Gather all needed reagents, tubes, pipettes, and tips.
2. Sample Lysis:
◦ Add 200 µL of sample to a microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add lysis buffer (as per the extraction kit instructions) and
mix well.
◦ Incubate at the recommended temperature (e.g., 56°C for
10 minutes).
3. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
◦ Follow specific extraction kit protocols for binding, washing,
and eluting nucleic acids.
◦ Transfer the extracted nucleic acid to a new microcentrifuge
tube.
◦ Store at -20°C (short term) or -80°C (long term) if not
proceeding immediately to amplification.
B. Amplification and Detection
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw reagents and samples on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the Trichomonas
Vaginalis Nucleic Acid Amplification Kit instructions.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Label PCR tubes or wells of a PCR plate.
◦ Add the prepared master mix to each tube/well.
◦ Add the extracted nucleic acid to the appropriate tubes/
wells.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in the run.
3. Amplification:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the thermocycler.
◦ Program the thermocycler with the recommended cycling
conditions (e.g., denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1
minute).
◦ Start the thermocycler and monitor the run.
4. Post-Amplification Handling:
◦ Carefully remove PCR plate from the thermocycler.
◦ Proceed with detection method according to the Nucleic
Acid Amplification Kit instructions (e.g., gel electrophoresis
or real-time fluorescence detection).
C. Result Interpretation
1. Analysis:
◦ Compare the sample results to the provided positive and
negative controls.
◦ Use the kit instructions to interpret the Ct (cycle threshold)
values if using real-time PCR.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record the results in the appropriate worksheet or
laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure to document any anomalies and troubleshooting
steps.
D. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive, negative, and internal controls with each batch
of samples.
◦ Document control results in the Quality Control log.
2. Corrective Actions:
◦ If control results are outside acceptable limits, investigate
and rectify the possible causes (e.g., reagent failure,
instrument error).
◦ Re-run the test for problem samples after addressing
issues.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results and verify accuracy.
• Transmit results to the LIS.
• Authorized personnel must review and sign off on the final report.
• Report any critical or unusual results immediately to the referring
physician and document this communication.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit.
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Trichomonas Vaginalis Nucleic
Acid Amplification Kit.
• Laboratory specific guidelines for reporting and quality control
procedures.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety procedures including the use of
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological specimens as potential biohazards.
• Dispose of all waste materials according to the laboratory's
biosafety protocols.
