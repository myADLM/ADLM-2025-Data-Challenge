SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Trichomonas
Vaginalis PCR
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the detection of Trichomonas
vaginalis in clinical specimens using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR). The protocols cover the necessary steps from sample
preparation, reagent setup, amplification, detection, and result
interpretation.
Responsibility:
Designated lab personnel are responsible for performing the PCR
assay according to this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable specimens: - Vaginal swabs, endocervical swabs, or urine
samples
Unacceptable specimens: - Specimens with insufficient volume -
Specimens that have not been stored or transported as per
recommended guidelines - Specimens without proper labeling (no
identification details)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Biosafety Cabinet
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Micropipettes and Pipette Tips (filter tips recommended)
• Sterile, DNase/RNase-free Tubes
• Trichomonas vaginalis PCR Master Mix
• Primers and Probes specific to Trichomonas vaginalis
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit
• Positive Control: Trichomonas vaginalis DNA
• Negative Control: DNase/RNase-free Water
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Prepare the sample by vortexing for 3-5 seconds and centrifuge
at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the nucleic acid
extraction kit to isolate DNA from the specimen.
3. Elute the DNA in an appropriate volume (e.g., 50 µL) of the
elution buffer provided in the extraction kit.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not proceeding immediately to
PCR.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice. Vortex and briefly
centrifuge the PCR master mix, primers, and probes before
use.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Include the following:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ MgCl2 (if not included in the buffer)
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Primers (forward and reverse)
◦ Probe (TaqMan probe)
◦ DNA polymerase
3. Dispense the appropriate volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the PCR
master mix into each PCR tube or well of a qPCR plate.
4. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each tube or well. Use separate
pipette tips for each sample to avoid contamination.
5. Include a positive control with known Trichomonas vaginalis
DNA and a negative control (water) in each run.
6. Seal the PCR tube caps or plate with appropriate sealing film.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Place the tubes or plate in the thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Ensure the thermal cycler lid is heated, if applicable.
D. Detection:
1. Post-amplification, analyze the amplification plot from the
thermal cycler.
2. Positive samples will exhibit sigmoidal curves crossing the
threshold line, whereas negative samples will not generate
curves above the baseline.
3. Verify the cycle threshold (Ct) values. A Ct value below 35
typically indicates a positive result.
E. Interpretation of Results:
• Positive: Ct value < 35 in accordance with control results (Positive
control should be positive; Negative control should be negative).
• Negative: No amplification curve or Ct value > 35 indicating no
detectable Trichomonas vaginalis DNA.
• Invalid: If controls do not perform as expected (e.g. positive
control negative, or negative control positive), the run should be
repeated.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a positive and negative control with each batch of
specimens.
• If control results are not within acceptable ranges, document the
deviation and take corrective action (e.g., reviewing reagent
integrity, PCR setup procedures, or thermal cycler conditions).
• Ensure that lab personnel performing the test are properly trained
and competent.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
as per laboratory policy.
3. Positive results must be reported as “Trichomonas vaginalis
DNA detected.”
4. Negative results must be reported as “No Trichomonas
vaginalis DNA detected.”
5. Invalid results must be reviewed, documented, and resolved
before reporting.
