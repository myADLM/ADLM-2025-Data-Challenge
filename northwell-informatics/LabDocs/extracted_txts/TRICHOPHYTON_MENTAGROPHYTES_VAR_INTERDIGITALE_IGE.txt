Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Trichophyton
mentagrophytes (var. interdigitale) IgE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and efficient
analysis of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (var. interdigitale) IgE in the
laboratory using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This
ensures that results are reliable and consistent across different
operators and conditions.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of specimens for Trichophyton
mentagrophytes (var. interdigitale) IgE.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for following this SOP to ensure
consistent and accurate results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that staff follow this SOP and that all equipment
maintenance and quality control measures are performed as
required.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit for Trichophyton mentagrophytes (var. interdigitale) IgE
detection
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• ELISA microplate reader
• Incubator
• Washing buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Distilled or deionized water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
• Storage: Store at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or microbially
contaminated samples.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Review and confirm the test requisition form.
• Verify specimen identity and integrity upon receipt.
• Allow frozen samples to thaw completely and mix gently by
inversion before analysis.
6.2 Reagent Preparation
• Prepare all reagents and materials according to the
manufacturer's instructions supplied with the ELISA kit.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
6.3 Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Standard Preparation:
◦ Label microplate wells for standards, controls, and samples.
◦ Prepare standard dilutions according to the kit instructions.
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
samples into the designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of antibody conjugate to all
wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration
as recommended by the manufacturer (typically at 37°C for
60 minutes).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate wells with the washing buffer supplied
in the kit for the recommended number of times to remove
any unbound substances.
◦ Tap the plate firmly on absorbent paper to remove residual
wash buffer.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for the time
specified by the manufacturer (usually 10-15 minutes).
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well, changing the color of the
solution.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the recommended
wavelength (450 nm is common) using the ELISA microplate
reader within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction.
6.4 Calculations
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
versus the concentration of standards.
• Determine the concentration of Trichophyton mentagrophytes
(var. interdigitale) IgE in the patient samples by comparing their
absorbance to the standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative and positive controls in each run.
• Verify that control results are within the expected range before
reporting patient results.
• Repeat any out-of-range results and perform necessary
troubleshooting as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Reference intervals will be provided as per kit manufacturer’s
instructions and any additional site-specific criteria.
• Report results to the requesting physician while ensuring that
critical results are communicated immediately following lab policy.
9. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the ELISA microplate reader
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform routine maintenance of micropipettes and other
equipment used in the procedure.
• Document any troubleshooting steps taken when encountering
issues with the assay to ensure consistent resolution of problems.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific ELISA kit used.
• Relevant laboratory quality control procedures and guidelines.
11. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed when updates to
the procedure or kit instructions are necessary.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accuracy
and reliability of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (var. interdigitale) IgE
testing, contributing to the proper diagnosis and treatment of affected
patients.
