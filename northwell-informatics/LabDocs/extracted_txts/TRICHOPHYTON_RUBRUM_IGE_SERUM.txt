Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Trichophyton Rubrum, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the steps required to perform and generate
results for the detection of Trichophyton rubrum-specific IgE in serum
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of trained Laboratory Technologists to
perform and document the analysis according to this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure and
ensuring all staff follow these guidelines.
• It is also the responsibility of staff to report any issues or
abnormalities encountered during the testing process to their
supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum - collect blood in a SST tube, allow
the blood to clot at room temperature, and centrifuge to separate
serum within 2 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum
samples; specimens not properly labeled or not properly handled.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450
nm.
• ELISA washing system.
• Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C.
• Microplate strips coated with Trichophyton rubrum antigen.
• Standards and controls for Trichophyton rubrum-specific IgE.
• Enzyme conjugate (anti-human IgE conjugated to HRP).
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB).
• Stop solution (e.g., 1N H2SO4).
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preliminary Steps
1. Review and arrange necessary reagents, microplate strips, and
controls (positive, negative, and calibrators) as per the kit's
instructions.
2. Allow reagent solutions and samples to reach room
temperature before use.
5.2 Assay Procedure
1. Preparation of Standards and Controls:
◦ Prepare standard solutions and controls as instructed in the
kit insert. Ensure proper labeling and documentation.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Pipette 100 μL of each standard, control and patient serum
sample into the appropriate wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells with the provided wash buffer 3-5 times.
5. Enzyme Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 μL of the enzyme conjugate into each well,
incubate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 30 minutes, and
wash the wells thoroughly 3-5 times.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of the TMB substrate solution to each well.
Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 10-15 minutes
or until the highest standard obtained sufficient color.
7. Stop the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL stop solution to each well. The color will change
to yellow.
5.3 Measuring Absorbance
1. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA microplate reader. Ensure the reader is blanked on air.
6. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
1. Calculations:
◦ Construct a calibration curve by plotting the mean
absorbance of the standards against the known
concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of Trichophyton rubrum-
specific IgE in patient samples from the calibration curve.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Compare the IgE concentration in the patient sample to
reference intervals or clinical cut-offs provided in the kit
instructions.
◦ Record all results neatly and use these findings per the
clinical needs of the requesting clinician.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Each batch must include a blank, negative control, positive
control, and a series of known standards.
• Quality control samples must be within control limits before
processing patient samples.
• Document any deviations that occur during the procedure and
ensure they are addressed before proceeding.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Abnormal findings or deviations must be immediately
communicated to the responsible supervisor.
• Results must be reviewed by a laboratory technologist before final
verification and output to the clinician.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals supplied by the kit will guide the interpretation
of results.
• Modify standard intervals according to specific population or
patient history when necessary.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Consult the kit insert for assay-specific limitations.
• Consider potential interferences, including cross-reactivity with
other fungal antigens.
