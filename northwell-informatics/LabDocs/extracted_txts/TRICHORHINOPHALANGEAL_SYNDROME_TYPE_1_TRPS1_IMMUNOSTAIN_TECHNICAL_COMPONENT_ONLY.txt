TRICHORHINOPHALANGEAL SYNDROME TYPE 1 (TRPS1)
IMMUNOSTAIN Technical Component Only – Protocol for Analytical
Phase
1. PURPOSE
To outline the technical procedure for generating results for
TRICHORHINOPHALANGEAL SYNDROME TYPE 1 (TRPS1)
immunostaining. This SOP provides a detailed process for
immunostaining of TRPS1, ensuring consistent, accurate, and
reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting TRPS1 immunostaining as per this procedure. All staff
are responsible for flagging any issues that may affect the reliability
of test results and bringing them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
TRICHORHINOPHALANGEAL SYNDROME TYPE 1 (TRPS1)
immunostaining refers to the use of antibodies to stain tissues for
TRPS1 protein, allowing visualization under a microscope.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment
1. Antibodies:
◦ Primary TRPS1 antibody: Store at 2-8°C. Follow
manufacturer’s instructions for dilution.
◦ Secondary antibody: Store at 2-8°C or as directed by
manufacturer.
2. Buffers and Solutions:
◦ Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), pH 7.4
◦ Blocking solution: Follow manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Staining solution: Prepared as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Microscope slides and coverslips
◦ Slide staining racks
◦ Humid chamber
◦ Microscope (with appropriate filters if using fluorescence)
B. Specimen Preparation
1. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
2. Tissue sectioning:
◦ Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 micrometers thickness
using microtome.
◦ Place sections onto microscope slides.
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 60 minutes or as indicated for
specific procedure.
C. Immunostaining Protocol
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes. Repeat twice.
◦ Gradually rehydrate slides through 100%, 95%, and 70%
ethanol, followed by deionized water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced or enzymatic antigen retrieval as per
antibody manufacturer's specifications.
3. Blocking:
◦ Immerse slides in blocking solution for 30-60 minutes at
room temperature.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply primary TRPS1 antibody to tissue sections. Incubate
overnight at 4°C or as per manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS, three times for 5 minutes each.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody to tissue sections. Incubate at
room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
7. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS, three times for 5 minutes each.
8. Counterstaining:
◦ If desired, counterstain with hematoxylin or another nuclear
stain as per specific protocol.
9. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides thoroughly under running tap water.
10. Mounting:
◦ Mount stained sections with appropriate mounting medium
and cover with coverslips.
D. Quality Control
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include known positive and negative control tissues in each
staining run to ensure specificity and reliability.
2. Staining Evaluation:
◦ Verify staining under microscope. Check for appropriate
staining pattern (nuclear/cytoplasmic) and intensity.
E. Troubleshooting
1. Inconsistent Staining:
◦ Evaluate antigen retrieval conditions, antibody
concentrations, and incubation times.
2. High Background:
◦ Check blocking steps, antibody dilutions, and washing
procedures.
3. No Staining:
◦ Confirm antibody activity and tissue integrity.
F. Documentation
1. Record all lot numbers, expiration dates, and conditions of
reagents.
2. Maintain a detailed log of each staining run including date, time,
technician’s initials, and any issues encountered.
3. Reporting Results
4. Results are conveyed as technical findings without
interpretation. Interpretation should be conducted by a qualified
pathologist or clinician.
5. Ensure documented findings are reviewed, verified, and
transmitted to the LIS as per laboratory standards.
