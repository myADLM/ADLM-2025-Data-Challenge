Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Measurement of Triglycerides in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps
necessary for the accurate and precise measurement of triglycerides
in body fluids, ensuring quality control and reliable results. This
procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who perform triglyceride
assays using body fluid samples.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to
follow this SOP accurately and consistently. All deviations, errors, and
issues must be promptly reported to the supervisor, and corrective
actions must be documented.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Body fluids, such as pleural, peritoneal, synovial, or cerebrospinal
fluid.
Collection and Handling:
• Collect body fluid using aseptic techniques into sterile, leak-proof
containers.
• Label the container with patient details, including name,
identification number, date, and time of collection.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately or store it at
2-8°C if there is a delay. Do not store the specimen for more than
24 hours.
• Avoid hemolysis and contamination.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are unlabeled or improperly labeled.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or contamination.
• Specimens that have been stored for more than 24 hours or
improperly stored.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated biochemical analyzer (specific model).
Reagents:
• Triglyceride reagent kit (specific manufacturer and lot number).
• Calibrators and quality control materials (2 levels - normal and
abnormal).
Supplies:
• Disposable pipettes and tips.
• Sterile containers for specimen processing.
• Timer or stopwatch.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained.
2. Bring all reagents and quality control materials to room
temperature before use.
3. Verify expiration dates and lot numbers on all reagents and
quality control materials.
Calibration:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibrating the
biochemical analyzer.
2. Use the appropriate calibrators provided with the triglyceride
reagent kit.
3. Document the calibration results and any corrective actions
taken.
Quality Control:
1. Prepare the quality control materials according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run the quality control materials at two levels (normal and
abnormal) with each batch of specimens.
3. Document the quality control results, ensuring they fall within
the acceptable range. If not, investigate and resolve the issue
before proceeding with patient samples.
Specimen Processing:
1. Centrifuge the body fluid specimen at 2000 x g for 10 minutes
to remove any cellular debris.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean container for analysis.
Analytical Measurement:
1. Set up the biochemical analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions for triglyceride testing.
2. Add the triglyceride reagent to the analyzer as per the reagent
kit instructions.
3. Using a pipette, carefully add the patient sample supernatant to
the analyzer.
4. Input the necessary patient information into the analyzer.
5. Initiate the analysis and ensure the analyzer completes the
process without errors.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Print or electronically retrieve the results from the analyzer.
2. Verify that the quality control results for the run are within
acceptable limits.
3. Review the results for each patient sample, checking for any
inconsistencies or abnormalities.
4. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. If critical values are detected, follow the laboratory's critical
value reporting policy.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for triglycerides in body fluids will be
determined based on established clinical guidelines and validated
data specific to the laboratory's patient population.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are free from hemolysis and contamination, as
these can affect results.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for reagent handling and
storage to avoid degradation.
• Recognize that certain medications and clinical conditions may
affect triglyceride levels.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the triglyceride reagent kit.
• CLSI guidelines for body fluid specimen processing.
• Laboratory quality control and calibration documentation.
9. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes made to the procedure, including the date
and description of the revision.
