Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Triglycerides Using the CDC, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard protocol for the measurement and analysis of
triglycerides in serum specimens using the CDC method. This SOP
ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the results
generated.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained in
the analysis of triglycerides using the CDC method in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory scientists to follow this
SOP. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance and for
the proper training of staff.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of fasting serum (collected after an
8-14 hour fast).
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum collected in a plain red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STORAGE
• Immediately after collection, allow the blood to clot by leaving it
undisturbed at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500 g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Automated clinical chemistry analyzer
• Triglycerides reagent kit (compatible with the analyzer)
• Calibrators
• Quality control materials (2 levels)
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample cups
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Review the worklist and verify the patient samples and IDs.
2. Allow frozen samples to thaw completely at room temperature.
Mix samples gently by inverting.
3. Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
B. Calibration
1. Calibrate the instrument using the calibrators provided in the
reagent kit.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibration frequency
and settings.
3. Document calibration details including date, time, calibrator lot
number, and initials of the operator.
C. Quality Control
1. Run two levels of quality control materials (normal and
abnormal) at the beginning of each shift, after calibration, and
after any maintenance.
2. Document QC results in the quality control log.
3. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's instructions and do not proceed
with patient testing until QC is in range.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load the patient samples, calibrators, and QC materials into the
appropriate sample cups and place them on the analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer with the appropriate method for
triglycerides.
3. Start the analysis run according to the instrument’s instructions.
4. Verify that the instrument's settings (e.g., wavelength,
temperature) align with the reagent kit’s requirements and the
CDC method.
E. Reviewing and Reporting Results
1. Review the analyzer-generated results for accuracy and any
flagged results indicating potential issues.
2. Re-run samples if there are any instrument flags or if results
appear inconsistent.
3. Verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Document any pertinent information or comments as needed.
5. Report results according to site-specific guidelines, ensuring
they are delivered to the clinician in a timely manner.
7. PROCEDURAL NOTES
• Contaminated or hemolyzed samples can cause erroneous
results and should be flagged and rejected.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored properly.
• If serum samples are lipemic, they must be ultracentrifuged
before analysis to avoid interference.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Regularly review quality control trends to identify shifts or trends
that could indicate instrument or reagent issues.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for
triglycerides as required by CLIA.

10. RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain records of specimen receipt, analysis, quality control,
calibration, and maintenance activities.
• Document and archive all results, QC data, calibration logs, and
any corrective actions taken.
11. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of waste according to biohazard guidelines.

performed consistently and accurately, adhering to the guidelines set
forth by the CDC and meeting the requirements of a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
