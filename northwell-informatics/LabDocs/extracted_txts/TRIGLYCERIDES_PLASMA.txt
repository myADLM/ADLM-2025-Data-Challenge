Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Triglycerides, Plasma
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the measurement of plasma triglycerides
using an automated analyzer in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This SOP
ensures accurate, precise, and timely reporting of triglyceride levels
in patient samples.
1. Scope
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained in the
analysis of plasma triglycerides using the designated automated
analyzer.
1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel performing
triglyceride testing to follow this SOP precisely. Supervisors must
ensure staff compliance with the procedure and address any
deviations or issues that may arise.
1. Definitions
Triglycerides: a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. Plasma: the
liquid component of blood in which the blood cells are suspended.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred specimen: Plasma collected in an EDTA or lithium
heparin tube.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed samples, improperly
labeled samples.
• Specimen Stability: If testing is delayed, store plasma at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Automated clinical chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 6000,
Abbott Architect c8000)
• Triglycerides enzymatic reagent kits
• Quality control materials (both normal and abnormal levels)
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
1. Quality Control
• Perform quality control procedures as per the manufacturer's
instructions and laboratory policy.
• Analyze two levels of control (normal and abnormal) every 24
hours or as required by the analyzer's protocol.
• Document all quality control procedures and results in the Quality
Control log.
1. Procedure
2. Calibration of Analyzer:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions using calibrators provided with the reagent kit.
◦ Document calibration in the analyzer log.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge plasma specimens at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to ensure separation of plasma from cellular components.
◦ Verify the integrity of the plasma (no hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus that could interfere with the test).
4. Loading Samples:
◦ Load the plasma specimens into sample cups or appropriate
racks as per the analyzer's requirement.
◦ Ensure that each sample is properly labeled and positioned
in the analyzer.
5. Running the Test:
◦ Select the appropriate test for triglycerides on the analyzer’s
software.
◦ Ensure that the reagent kit and consumables are adequately
stocked and loaded onto the analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis process as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
6. Reviewing Results:
◦ Once the analysis is complete, review the results for
accuracy and validity.
◦ Verify that quality control results are within acceptable
ranges before accepting patient results.
7. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Input the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure that any critical values are promptly communicated
to the appropriate clinical personnel according to the
laboratory’s critical results policy.
◦ Document the date, time, and initials of the technologist
performing the test on the result printout or log.
8. Reference Intervals
• The reference range for triglycerides is as follows:
◦ Normal: <150 mg/dL
◦ Borderline High: 150-199 mg/dL
◦ High: 200-499 mg/dL
◦ Very High: ≥500 mg/dL
1. Method Limitations
• Interferences: Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect the
accuracy of triglyceride measurements.
• Instrument-specific limitations: Refer to the analyzer’s manual for
detailed information on assay limitations.
1. Corrective Actions
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, reanalyze
the control, recalibrate the analyzer, and/or replace reagents as
necessary.
• Document all corrective actions taken.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s reagent and instrument manuals.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual.

By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will adhere to
standardized procedures that ensure the reliable and accurate
measurement of plasma triglycerides.
