Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Triglycerides, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized process for the measurement and
reporting of serum triglycerides levels to ensure accurate and
reliable results for clinical use.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ All laboratory personnel performing triglycerides, serum
testing must adhere to this SOP.
◦ It is the duty of laboratory supervisors to ensure that staff
are trained and comply with this procedure.
◦ Designated personnel must perform regular quality control
and maintenance checks of equipment and reagents.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Serum samples collected in a SST (Serum Separator Tube),
allowed to clot at room temperature, and then centrifuged.
◦ Specimens may be stored for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C, or
longer if frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
◦ Specimens not stored appropriately or beyond the stability
limits mentioned above.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas or similar
equipment)
◦ Triglycerides reagent kit from an approved manufacturer
(e.g., Roche Diagnostics)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific for triglycerides
measurement
◦ SST collection tubes
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Analytical grade water and other necessary supplies
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
a. Ensure all reagents are prepared and warmed to room
temperature as necessary. b. Calibrate the analyzer according
to manufacturer's instruction using the appropriate calibrators.
c. Perform quality control using normal and abnormal control
material; ensure results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient samples.
Analyzing the Specimen:
a. Verify that all specimen requisitions and tubes are correctly
labeled and matched. b. Thoroughly mix specimens by gentle
inversion before analysis. c. Place serum samples, calibrators,
and quality controls in the designated sample rack location of
the analyzer. d. Input or scan patient information into the
analyzer's software ensuring accurate identification and
correlation of samples. e. Select the appropriate triglycerides
assay method on the analyzer. f. Follow the analyzer’s specific
instructions for operation, ensuring proper handling and
processing of each specimen. g. Observe the analyzer as it
runs, making note of any error messages or flags.
Post-Analysis:
a. Review results for accuracy prior to verification. b. Evaluate
any flagged or questionable results; repeat analysis if
necessary. c. Document any issues encountered during
analysis, including any troubleshooting steps taken.
6. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS REPORTING
◦ The analyzer automatically performs necessary calculations
for triglyceride concentrations.
◦ Results will be reported in mg/dL or mmol/L according to
laboratory policy.
◦ Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for entering or
verifying results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Critical values, if identified, should be immediately
communicated to the healthcare provider following
established critical result protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control materials at the start of each shift, after
reagent changes, and as required by the laboratory's quality
assurance program.
◦ Document all quality control results, and ensure they fall
within the laboratory’s established acceptable ranges.
◦ Investigate and resolve any quality control deviations before
proceeding with patient samples.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for serum triglycerides should be
documented and kept up-to-date in accordance with CLSI
guidelines or provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Normal Range: 0-150 mg/dL (may vary based on laboratory-
specific reference values)
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Interfering substances such as hemoglobin, bilirubin, and
lipids may affect test results.
◦ Specimens with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus should
be noted, and results interpreted with caution.
10. SAFETY GUIDELINES
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coats, gloves, and face protection where
appropriate.
◦ Handle biological specimens with care and follow
established biohazard waste disposal protocols.
◦ Refer to the laboratory’s safety manual for details on
handling spills, exposure incidents, and other safety
concerns.

End of SOP
This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any
changes in technology, procedures, or regulatory requirements. All
laboratory personnel must receive training and demonstrate
competency in this procedure.
