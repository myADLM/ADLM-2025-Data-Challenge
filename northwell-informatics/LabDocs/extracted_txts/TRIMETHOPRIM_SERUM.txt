Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Trimethoprim, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reproducible analysis of trimethoprim
concentration in serum samples using High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP and ensure compliance with all guidelines and instructions.
Supervisors are to ensure that staff are adequately trained and
competent.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Trimethoprim: An antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.
• HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, an analytical
technique for separating, identifying, and quantifying compounds.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Preferred Collection Container:
◦ Gold or red-top tubes without anticoagulant.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 6 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours.
◦ Frozen (-20°C): 1 month.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC system with UV detector.
• HPLC column: C18 reversed-phase.
• Mobile phase: A mixture of acetonitrile and water with 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid.
• Standard Trimethoprim solution.
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high levels).
• Serum samples.
• Disposable pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Calibrated analytical balance.
• Vortex mixer.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the serum sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum from cells.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant serum to a clean tube.
2. Sample Dilution:
◦ If necessary, dilute the serum sample with distilled water or
an appropriate diluent to stay within the linear range of the
assay.
3. Standards and Controls Preparation:
◦ Prepare a series of standard solutions of known
trimethoprim concentrations.
◦ Ensure controls are prepared and handled in the same
manner as the patient samples.
B. HPLC Analysis
1. Equipment Setup:
◦ Turn on the HPLC system and allow it to equilibrate.
◦ Set the column temperature to 25°C.
◦ Set the flow rate according to the standard protocol
(typically 1.0 mL/min).
◦ Set the UV detector to 210 nm.
2. Running Samples:
◦ Inject 20 μL of the serum sample, standards, and controls
into the HPLC system.
◦ Run the samples and record the chromatograms.
◦ Ensure that each run includes appropriate standards and
controls.
C. Data Analysis
1. Peak Identification:
◦ Identify the trimethoprim peak by comparing the retention
time to that of the standards.
2. Quantification:
◦ Calculate the concentration of trimethoprim in the serum
samples by plotting the peak area against the concentration
of the standards (calibration curve) and using linear
regression analysis.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with every batch of patient samples
and after every 10 samples to ensure the accuracy of the assay.
• If quality controls fall outside the acceptable range, the batch run
is not valid, and the issues must be troubleshooted before re-
running patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results to the LIS immediately upon verification.
• Ensure that all critical results are communicated promptly
according to the established critical value notification policy.
• Document any anomalies with relevant comments.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult the laboratory's reference interval documentation, as these
may vary depending on population and methodology specifics.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in serum samples may interfere
with accurate readings.
• Analyses must be performed promptly to avoid degradation or
alterations in the sample.
