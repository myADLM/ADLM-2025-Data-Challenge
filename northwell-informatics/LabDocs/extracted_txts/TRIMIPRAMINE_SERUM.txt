Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Trimipramine, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide precise and accurate measurements of
Trimipramine concentration in patient serum samples for
therapeutic drug monitoring.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to ensure adherence to this protocol. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for ensuring staff competency in performing
the assay and maintaining quality control.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System
• UV Detector
• Analytical column suitable for Trimipramine detection
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• HPLC-grade water, acetonitrile, and methanol
• Trimipramine standard (certified reference material)
• Calibration standards and Quality control (QC) samples
• Sample vials with caps
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENT PREPARATION
• Mobile Phase: Prepare a mixture of HPLC-grade water and
acetonitrile (30:70, v/v).
• Calibration Standards: Prepare Trimipramine standards at
concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ng/mL in
control human serum.
• Quality Control Samples: Prepare QC samples at low, medium,
and high levels (QC-L: 75 ng/mL, QC-M: 300 ng/mL, QC-H: 750
ng/mL).
1. SAMPLE PREPARATION
• Collect blood samples in SST, allow clotting, and centrifuge at
3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Aliquot the serum into labeled sample vials.
• Store serum samples at -20°C if not immediately analyzed.
1. HPLC SETUP
• Set the HPLC system flow rate to 1.0 mL/min.
• Set the UV detector wavelength to 254 nm for Trimipramine.
• Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase for at least 20
minutes before injecting samples.
1. PROCEDURE a. Calibration and Quality Control
◦ Inject calibration standards sequentially into the HPLC
system.
◦ Verify calibration linearity (R² ≥ 0.995).
◦ Verify QC samples to ensure assay precision (Coefficient of
Variation, CV% < 15%) and accuracy (within ± 20% of
nominal values).
b. Sample Analysis
• Thaw and vortex serum samples thoroughly.
• Inject 10 µL of each patient serum sample into the HPLC.
• Ensure consistency in retention time and peak shape between
patient samples and standards.
c. System Suitability
• After every 10 samples, inject QC samples to ensure system
suitability.
• If QC results are out of predefined limits, reassess the procedure,
recalibrate if necessary, and reanalyze affected samples.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ QC samples must be run at the beginning of each batch and
after every 10 patient samples.
◦ The run is considered acceptable if all QC samples are
within ± 20% of the target value.
◦ Reassess and reanalyze samples if QC criteria are not met.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Calculate Trimipramine concentrations using the calibration
curve.
◦ Validate results by checking the QC and system suitability
data.
◦ Report Trimipramine concentration results in ng/mL.
◦ Flag and comment on any results that fall outside the
therapeutic range or show any signs of sample integrity
compromise.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS Therapeutic Range: 180 - 300 ng/
mL
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in serum samples may interfere
with Trimipramine detection.
• Improper handling before analysis (e.g., improper storage
temperature) may lead to degradation.
