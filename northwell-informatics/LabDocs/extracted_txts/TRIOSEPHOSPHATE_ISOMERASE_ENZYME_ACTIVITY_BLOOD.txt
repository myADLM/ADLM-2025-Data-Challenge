Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Triosephosphate Isomerase Enzyme Activity, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) enzyme activity in blood samples.
This SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis of TPI enzyme activity according to this procedure and to
ensure that all quality control measures are observed.
3. DEFINITIONS
Triosephosphate Isomerase (TPI): An enzyme that catalyzes the
reversible conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) in the glycolysis pathway.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood
Collection Container:
• Use EDTA anticoagulant blood collection tubes to prevent
coagulation.
Volume:
• Preferred: 5 mL
• Minimum: 2 mL
Specimen Stability:
• At room temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8ºC): Stable for up to 24 hours
• Frozen (-20ºC or colder): Stable for up to 1 month
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Spectrophotometer (UV-VIS)
• Incubator set at 37ºC
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• Tris buffer (pH 7.4)
• NADH
• DHAP
• G3P Dehydrogenase
Supplies:
• Micropipette tips
• Tubes
• Cuvettes
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge: Centrifuge whole blood samples at 1500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
2. Aliquot Plasma: Carefully aliquot the plasma into a clean,
labeled microcentrifuge tube.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare Tris Buffer: Prepare a 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4.
2. NADH Solution: Prepare a stock solution of 0.12 mM NADH in
Tris buffer.
3. DHAP Solution: Prepare a 0.12 mM DHAP solution in Tris
buffer.
4. G3P Dehydrogenase: Reconstitute G3P Dehydrogenase
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
C. TPI Assay Procedure:
1. Reaction Mixture: In a cuvette, prepare the reaction mixture:
◦ 1 mL of 50 mM Tris buffer
◦ 0.05 mL of 0.12 mM NADH solution
◦ 0.05 mL of 0.05% G3P Dehydrogenase solution
2. Baseline Reading: Take an initial absorbance reading at 340
nm using the spectrophotometer to establish a baseline
(A_initial).
3. Add Plasma: Add 0.1 mL of plasma to the reaction mixture.
4. DHAP Addition: Add 0.05 mL of 0.12 mM DHAP to the mixture
to start the reaction.
5. Mix and Incubate:
◦ Mix the contents gently but thoroughly.
◦ Incubate the cuvette at 37°C in the spectrophotometer.
6. Kinetic Reading: Measure absorbance at 340 nm at 1-minute
intervals for 5 minutes.
7. Data Recording: Record each absorbance reading, ensuring
consistent timing.
D. Calculation:
1. Delta Absorbance Calculation: Determine the change in
absorbance per minute (ΔA/min) by plotting absorbance against
time and calculating the slope.
2. TPI Activity Calculation:
◦ Use the formula: [ \text{TPI Activity (U/L)} = \left( \frac{ΔA/
min \times V_{total}}{\varepsilon \times l \times V_{sample}}
\right) ]
◦ Where:
▪ (ΔA/min) = change in absorbance per minute
▪ (V_{total}) = total volume of the reaction mixture (mL)
▪ (\varepsilon) = molar extinction coefficient of NADH
(6200 L/(mol·cm))
▪ (l) = path length of the cuvette (1 cm)
▪ (V_{sample}) = volume of the sample (mL)
3. Multiply the result by a factor if needed to obtain the
activity in U/L.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with known TPI activity levels (low,
normal, high) alongside patient samples.
• Ensure controls fall within the established acceptable range for
precision and accuracy.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for TPI activity
to compare with peer laboratories' performance.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Normal TPI Activity: 26–48 U/L
• Report results along with reference intervals.
Critical Values:
• Any significantly low TPI activity indicating a potential deficiency
should be flagged and communicated to the supervising clinician
immediately.
Documentation:
• Document all findings, reagents used, calibrations, and any
deviation from the standard procedure in the laboratory
information system (LIS) or appropriate logbook.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure appropriate sample handling to prevent enzyme
degradation.
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with spectrophotometric
readings and should be avoided.
10. REFERENCES
• Literature references, reagent inserts, and other relevant
procedural documents.
This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect any relevant changes in methodology, equipment, or
regulations.
