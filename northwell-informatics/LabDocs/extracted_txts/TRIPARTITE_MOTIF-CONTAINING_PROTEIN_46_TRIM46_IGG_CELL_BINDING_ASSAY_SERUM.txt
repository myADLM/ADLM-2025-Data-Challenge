1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the standardized procedure for conducting
the analytical phase of generating results for TRIPARTITE MOTIF-
CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG using a cell binding assay
from serum samples. This assay is designed to detect and
quantitatively analyze the presence of TRIM46-specific IgG
antibodies in patient serum samples.
Responsibilities:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for following this procedure
accurately and recording all necessary data. The supervising clinical
laboratory scientist ensures the accuracy and validity of results. 2.
SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory staff trained in the procedure
and working within a CLIA-certified laboratory setting. The protocol
verifies sample integrity, performs the cell binding assay, and
generates results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum, 1.0-1.5 mL.
• Collected in red top or serum separator tubes (SST) and
centrifuged to isolate serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Serum with signs of hemolysis or lipemia.
• Serum collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens not kept at the required storage conditions prior to
testing (keep refrigerated at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours or
freeze at -20°C for longer storage).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader equipped with a 450 nm filter.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel) and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents and Supplies:
• TRIM46 recombinant protein or cells expressing TRIM46.
• Primary anti-TRIM46 IgG antibody.
• Anti-human IgG secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme
(e.g., HRP).
• Substrate solution for HRP (e.g., TMB).
• Wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20).
• Assay diluent (e.g., bovine serum albumin, 1% BSA).
• Plate sealing tapes.
• 96-well microtiter plates.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Bring serum samples and reagents to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Dilute serum samples 1:100 with assay diluent.
Cell Binding Assay:
1. Coat 96-well microtiter plates with TRIM46 recombinant protein
(2 µg/mL) in coating buffer. Incubate overnight at 4°C.
2. Wash the wells 3 times with wash buffer.
3. Block wells with 200 µL of assay diluent for 1 hour at room
temperature to reduce non-specific binding.
4. Discard the blocking solution and wash the wells 3 times with
wash buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples to the respective wells in
duplicate.
6. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
7. Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
serum antibodies.
8. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary
antibody to each well.
9. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
10. Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
secondary antibody.
11. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate for
15 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
12. Stop the reaction by adding 50 µL of stop solution (e.g., 2N
H2SO4) to each well.
13. Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes after adding the stop solution.
14. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
15. Run a standard curve for TRIM46-specific IgG by including
serial dilutions of a known positive serum or purified TRIM46
IgG.
16. Include negative control serum and blank wells (no serum) on
each plate to ensure background levels are appropriately low.
17. Perform the assay in duplicate to ensure consistency and
reproducibility.
18. Implement internal quality control measures, such as running
known positive and negative control sera.
19. RESULT REPORTING
20. Calculate the average OD of each sample and control.
21. Subtract the average OD of the blank wells from the average
OD of each sample and control to correct for non-specific
background.
22. Generate a standard curve from the OD readings of the
standard dilutions.
23. Determine the concentration of TRIM46-specific IgG in the
serum samples by plotting the corrected OD values onto the
standard curve.
24. Report results according to established site-specific guidelines.
25. METHOD LIMITATIONS
26. Hemolysis, lipemia, icterus, or microbial contamination of serum
samples can interfere with results.
27. Antibody cross-reactivity and non-specific binding may cause
false positives.
28. Inaccurate pipetting and improper washing can lead to
erroneous results.
