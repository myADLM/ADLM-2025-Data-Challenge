Protocol for Analytical Phase of TRIPARTITE MOTIF-
CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG, Cell Binding Assay,
Spinal Fluid
1. Purpose
To provide a consistent and accurate method for the analysis of
TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG in
spinal fluid using a cell-binding assay.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Accepted Speciments: 1 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected
in a sterile, plastic screw-cap tube.
• Transport: Specimens should be transported on ice to maintain
integrity and reach the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
• Storage: If there is a delay in processing, refrigerate samples at
2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For storage longer than 72 hours freeze
at -20°C or colder.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Consumables
• Cell Culture Plates (96-well flat-bottomed)
• Cell Culturing Equipment (CO2 Incubator, Microplate Reader)
• Cell Line expressing TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING
PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46)
• Cell Culture Media and Supplements
• TRIM46 IgG Standards and Controls
• Blocking Agent (e.g., Bovine Serum Albumin)
• Primary Antibody (Anti-TRIM46)
• Secondary Antibody (IgG specific and conjugated with an
enzyme, preferable HRP)
• Substrate for HRP
• Washing Buffer (e.g., PBS + 0.05% Tween-20)
• Data Analysis Software
1. Procedures
4.1 Preparation
4.1.1 Thaw and prepare all reagents and patient samples as
required. Bring all samples to room temperature before starting the
assay.
4.1.2 Prepare the cell culture plates:
• Plate cells expressing TRIM46 at an optimal density in 96-well
plates.
• Incubate cells overnight in a CO2 incubator at 37°C until cells
reach desired confluency.
4.2 Binding Assay
4.2.1 Aspirate the media from the wells and wash plates three times
with washing buffer.
4.2.2 Block wells to prevent nonspecific binding:
• Add 200 µL of blocking agent to each well and incubate for 1 hour
at room temperature.
4.2.3 Add 100 µL of patient CSF specimens and controls to the
designated wells in duplicate:
• Prepare a dilution series of TRIM46 IgG standards in appropriate
diluent.
4.2.4 Incubate plates at 37°C for 2 hours in a CO2 incubator to allow
binding of TRIM46 IgG to the antigen.
4.2.5 After incubation, wash the plates five times with washing buffer.
4.2.6 Add primary antibody specific to TRIM46 IgG (appropriately
diluted) to each well:
• Incubate plates for 1 hour at room temperature.
4.2.7 Wash the plates five times with washing buffer.
4.2.8 Add secondary antibody conjugated with HRP to each well:
• Incubate plates for 1 hour at room temperature.
4.2.9 Wash the plates five times with washing buffer.
4.2.10 Add chromogenic substrate for HRP and incubate in the dark
for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
4.2.11 Stop the reaction by adding 50-100 µL of stopping solution
(e.g., 1M sulfuric acid).
4.3 Reading and Analyzing Results
4.3.1 Measure absorbance at appropriate wavelength (450 nm) using
a microplate reader.
4.3.2 Generate a standard curve and quantify TRIM46 IgG
concentrations from the absorbance values of patient samples using
data analysis software.
4.4 Quality Control
4.4.1 Use TRIM46 IgG controls (negative/positive controls) with each
assay run to ensure assay performance:
• QC sample values must fall within established ranges.
4.4.2 Repeat the assay for any controls or patient samples that fall
outside acceptable limits.
4.5 Reporting Results
4.5.1 Calculate and interpret results according to established
guidelines and standard curves.
4.5.2 Report results in mg/mL or appropriate unit as determined by
standard curves.
4.5.3 Include any comments on sample integrity or assay
interference as observed during testing.
1. Reference Intervals
Reference intervals for TRIM46 IgG in spinal fluid will be established
based on population data and clinical correlations.
1. Limitations
6.1 Cross-reactivity with other IgGs or binding proteins may occur.
6.2 Inconsistent refrigeration or handling of CSF samples may affect
TRIM46 IgG stability and assay results.
