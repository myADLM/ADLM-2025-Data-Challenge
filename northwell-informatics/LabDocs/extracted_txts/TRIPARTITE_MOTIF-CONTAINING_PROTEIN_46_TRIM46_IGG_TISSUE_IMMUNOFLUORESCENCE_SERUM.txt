Standard Operating Procedure for TRIPARTITE MOTIF-
CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG, Tissue
Immunofluorescence, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for TRIM46 IgG through tissue
immunofluorescence, using serum specimens. This procedure
ensures accurate, consistent, and timely results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedure as detailed. It is the responsibility of all
staff to identify any deficiencies that may affect the test results and
promptly notify the supervisor. Staff and supervisors must ensure the
procedure is performed and documented according to this SOP,
including corrective actions as required.
1. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Collect blood using vacutainer tubes with appropriate
preservatives/anticoagulants.
• Serum specimen stable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C. Preferred
volume is 1-3 mL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 72 hours after
collection.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without collection date/time
indicated on the sample container or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope.
• Tissue slides.
• Micro-pipettes.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator for serum storage (2-8°C).
Reagents:
• TRIM46 IgG primary antibody.
• Secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent dye.
• Positive and negative control serum.
• Wash buffers (e.g., PBS).
Supplies:
• Glass slides.
• Cover slips.
• Labeling markers.
• Serum collection tubes.
1. PROCEDURE:
Preparation of Tissue Slides:
1. Set up workspace:
◦ Ensure all equipment and reagents are prepared and
calibrated according to SOPs.
◦ Log room temperature and humidity according to
temperature control SOP.
2. Specimen preparation:
◦ Thoroughly mix serum specimen and centrifuge if necessary
to remove particulates.
◦ Aliquot the required volume into a labeled tube.
3. Primary antibody incubation:
◦ Prepare tissue sections on slides.
◦ Block non-specific binding sites using blocking solution.
◦ Apply TRIM46 IgG primary antibody to the tissue sections.
◦ Incubate slides at the recommended temperature and
duration as per antibody manufacturer's instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash slides with PBS or appropriate wash buffer to remove
excess primary antibody.
◦ Repeat wash steps as specified by the protocol.
5. Secondary antibody incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent dye
to the washed tissue sections.
◦ Incubate slides at recommended temperature and duration.
6. Final washing:
◦ Wash slides with PBS to remove excess secondary
antibody.
◦ Repeat wash steps as specified.
7. Observation:
◦ Mount coverslips on the slides.
◦ Observe tissue sections under the fluorescence microscope.
◦ Capture and document images of fluorescence pattern.
Quality Control:
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Run positive and negative control specimens in parallel with
patient specimens.
◦ Ensure controls give expected results before reporting
patient results.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all observations, including control results, in
laboratory log.
◦ Any abnormal findings or deviations from expected results
should be documented and reviewed by a supervisor.
3. REPORTING RESULTS:
4. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the fluorescence patterns observed under the
microscope.
◦ Compare findings with control specimens and reference
images.
5. Documentation and Verification:
◦ Document results in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
◦ Results should be reviewed and verified according to
laboratory protocols before release.
6. Communication of Results:
◦ Critical results should be reported to the requesting
physician immediately as per the critical result policy.
◦ Ensure proper communication channels are used for
reporting results.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for antibodies used.
• Fluorescence microscopy user manual.
• Internal SOPs for temperature control, quality control, and
specimen handling.
Note: Any deviations from the protocol must be documented,
investigated, and reported to the supervisor. All steps in the
procedure must be performed according to this SOP to ensure
accuracy and reliability of results.
