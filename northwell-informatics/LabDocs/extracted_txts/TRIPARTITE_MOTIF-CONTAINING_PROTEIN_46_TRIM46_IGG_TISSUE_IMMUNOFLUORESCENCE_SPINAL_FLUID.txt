Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TRIPARTITE MOTIF-
CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IGG Tissue
Immunofluorescence, Spinal Fluid
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedures and protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for TRIPARTITE MOTIF-
CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG using tissue
immunofluorescence, including analysis of spinal fluid samples.
These procedures ensure accurate and precise operations to
achieve reliable diagnostic results.
2. Responsibility
The responsibility for performing the TRIM46 IgG tissue
immunofluorescence testing and documenting the results falls
upon the designated trained laboratory personnel. It is also the
responsibility of all staff to adhere to the SOP, identify potential
issues affecting the test results, and communicate these
promptly to the laboratory supervisor.
3. Specimen Requirements and Stability
◦ Specimen Collection: Spinal fluid samples must be
collected aseptically in sterile tubes labeled with patient
identification, collection date, and time.
◦ Preferred Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of spinal fluid is
required.
◦ Handling and Transport: Specimens must be immediately
transported to the laboratory. If there is a delay, store spinal
fluid at 2–8°C for up to 24 hours, and then process
immediately upon receipt.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Immunofluorescence microscope
◦ TRIM46 IgG-specific antibodies
◦ Fluorescent secondary antibodies
◦ Positive and negative control slides
◦ Mounting medium with DAPI
◦ Microscope slides and cover slips
◦ Wash buffers (PBS, pH 7.4)
◦ Humid chamber
5. Procedure
1. Preparation of Samples and Controls
▪ Freshly collected spinal fluid should be centrifuged at
1500 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain a cell pellet.
▪ Resuspend the cell pellet in PBS, transfer onto a
microscope slide, and allow to air dry.
▪ Prepare positive and negative control slides using
known tissue samples.
2. Fixation and Permeabilization
▪ Fix the slides in cold acetone (-20°C) for 10 minutes.
▪ Permeabilize samples by immersing in PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Blocking
▪ Block non-specific binding by incubating slides with
5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 minutes.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation
▪ Incubate slides with TRIM46 IgG-specific primary
antibody diluted in PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature.
▪ Wash slides three times in PBS.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation
▪ Incubate slides with fluorescent-conjugated secondary
antibodies diluted in PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature in the dark.
▪ Wash slides three times in PBS.
6. Mounting
▪ Add DAPI-containing mounting medium, apply cover
slips, and seal edges with clear nail polish if
necessary.
7. Immunofluorescence Microscopy
▪ Examine slides under an immunofluorescence
microscope.
▪ Capture images using appropriate filters to indicate the
presence of TRIM46 IgG and the location of nuclei.
6. Quality Control
◦ Use positive and negative control slides to validate each
assay run.
◦ Document all quality control checks including sample
preparation, antibody incubation, and microscopy.
7. Reporting Results
◦ Record observations and interpret findings with respect to
TRIM46 IgG presence and distribution.
◦ Ensure that each result includes patient ID, sample source,
date of analysis, and technologist initials.
◦ Results should be verified by another technologist and
reviewed by the laboratory supervisor before reporting to
clinicians.
8. References
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for antibodies and reagents.
◦ Peer-reviewed publications on TRIM46 IgG tissue
immunofluorescence methods and their clinical applications.
By following this protocol, laboratory staff can ensure that the
analytical phase of TRIM46 IgG tissue immunofluorescence for spinal
fluid is performed consistently, accurately, and in accordance with
established guidelines.
