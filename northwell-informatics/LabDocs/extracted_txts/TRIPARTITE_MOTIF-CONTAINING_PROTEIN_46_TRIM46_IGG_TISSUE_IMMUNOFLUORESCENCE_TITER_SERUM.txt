Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TRIPARTITE
MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG, Tissue
Immunofluorescence Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for TRIM46 IgG using tissue immunofluorescence
titer on serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technicians and scientists are responsible for
performing the immunofluorescence assay according to this SOP
and documenting the results.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying that the procedure is
followed and that the testing conditions remain consistent with this
protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL of serum is required.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if testing is
performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum at
-20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope with fluorescence capabilities
• Pre-prepared TRIM46 antigen slides
• Incubator (37°C)
• Humidified chamber
• Washing buffer (e.g., PBS)
• Serum diluent
• Conjugated secondary antibody (e.g., FITC-labeled anti-human
IgG)
• Mounting medium for fluorescence
• Positive and negative control serums
• Glass coverslips
• Pipettes and tips
• Laboratory timer
• Laboratory safety equipment
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Ensure that all reagents and equipment are ready.
• Allow frozen serum samples to thaw at room temperature and mix
thoroughly before use.
5.2 Initial Setup
• Label slides with patient identification and control designations.
5.3 Serum Dilution
• Prepare serial dilutions of the patient's serum in serum diluent
(e.g., 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, etc.).
• Include positive and negative control serums in the assay.
5.4 Sample Application
• Apply 10 µL of each serum dilution to separate wells on the
antigen slide.
• Apply control serums to designated control wells.
5.5 Incubation
• Place slides in a humidified chamber and incubate at 37°C for 30
minutes.
5.6 Washing
• Remove slides from the chamber and rinse gently with washing
buffer multiple times to remove unbound antibodies.
5.7 Secondary Antibody Application
• Apply 10 µL of fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody to
each well.
• Incubate in the humidified chamber at 37°C for an additional 30
minutes.
5.8 Washing and Mounting
• Repeat the washing step to remove unbound secondary antibody.
• Mount slides using an anti-fade mounting medium and apply a
coverslip.
5.9 Microscopy
• Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope.
• Document the fluorescence intensity and pattern of staining.
5.10 Titration and Result Calculation
• Determine the endpoint titer, defined as the highest dilution at
which specific fluorescence is observed.
• Compare patient results with control results to ensure assay
validity.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control serums with each batch of
patient samples.
• Controls must meet predefined criteria:
◦ Positive control must show specific fluorescence at designated
titer.
◦ Negative control must show no specific fluorescence.
• Record all control results and any deviations from expected
outcomes.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the endpoint titer as the specific titer of TRIM46 IgG
detected.
• If no specific fluorescence is observed at any dilution, report as
"TRIM46 IgG not detected."
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a senior
technologist or supervisor prior to release.
1. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal reference range: TRIM46 IgG titer < 1:10
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturer’s insert for reagents for details on
limitations.
• Operator proficiency and subjective interpretation of fluorescence
can affect results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert for fluorescent secondary antibodies.
• Published guidelines for immunofluorescence assays.
Note: This SOP must be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure
compliance with the latest standards and regulations.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff can ensure the accurate and
reproducible generation of results for TRIM46 IgG using tissue
immunofluorescence titer on serum samples.
