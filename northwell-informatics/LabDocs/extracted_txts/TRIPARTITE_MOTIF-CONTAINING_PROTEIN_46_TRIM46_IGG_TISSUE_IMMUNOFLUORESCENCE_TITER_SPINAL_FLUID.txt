Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase of Testing for TRIPARTITE MOTIF-
CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG, Tissue
Immunofluorescence Titer, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for TRIPARTITE MOTIF-
CONTAINING PROTEIN 46 (TRIM46) IgG in spinal fluid using the
tissue immunofluorescence titer method. This protocol describes the
procedures to be followed for the accurate and reliable analysis of
TRIM46 IgG titer in spinal fluid samples, using immunofluorescence
techniques.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this protocol. It is the
responsibility of all staff to follow the procedures strictly to ensure
accuracy and reproducibility of test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Spinal fluid collected in sterile containers with cleanly punctured,
sealed tops.
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL is required.
• The specimen must be kept and transported at 2-8°C and must
be analyzed within 24 hours of collection for best results.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens transported or stored beyond 24 hours.
• Specimen containers not properly sealed.
• Specimens showing visible signs of contamination or hemolysis.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• TRIM46 IgG primary antibody
• FITC-labeled secondary antibody
• Control Slides (positive and negative)
• Wash Buffer (PBS pH 7.4)
• Mounting Medium with Anti-fade properties
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Microcapillary pipettes and Micropipettes for dilution and
application.
• Humid chamber for incubation
1. EQUIPMENT
• Fluorescence Microscope with FITC filter
• Incubation chamber (37°C)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation of Samples
• Thaw spinal fluid samples gently at room temperature if
previously frozen.
• Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any cell
debris.
• Prepare a dilution series of the spinal fluid for titer determination.
Suitable dilutions may range from 1:10 to 1:1000 depending on
the expected levels of TRIM46 IgG.
5.2 Preparation of Tissue Slides
• Prepare tissue sections on glass slides ensuring proper labeling.
• Fix the tissue sections by incubating in acetone for 10 minutes at
-20°C.
• Air dry the slides for 10 minutes before use.
• Wash the slides in PBS to remove any fixative residue.
5.3 Immunofluorescence Staining
• Apply 50 µL of diluted spinal fluid onto the tissue sections.
• Incubate in a humid chamber at 37°C for 60 minutes.
• Wash the slides three times in PBS, 5 minutes each, to remove
unbound primary antibody.
• Apply 50 µL of the FITC-labeled secondary antibody to each
section.
• Incubate for 60 minutes in the dark at 37°C.
• Wash again as previously described.
• Apply a drop of mounting medium on the tissue section and place
coverslip.
5.4 Microscopy and Imaging
• Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope using a
FITC filter.
• Evaluate staining intensity and patterns, comparing to positive
and negative controls.
• Capture images of representative fields for documentation.
5.5 Determining End-point Titer
• The titer is determined as the highest dilution of spinal fluid that
still produces a positive staining reaction.
• Positive staining is defined as the presence of specific, non-
diffuse fluorescent signal in the tissue.
• Record the end-point titer along with the results and any
observations in the laboratory log.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure the reliability of the staining procedure.
• Document all control results. If controls fail, invalidate the run and
repeat the procedure.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results as the titer value at the highest dilution showing
positive staining.
• Any unusual or notable findings should be documented and
recorded.
• Verify that results meet laboratory quality standards before
releasing to the LIS.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
• Reference ranges and interpretation guidelines for TRIM46 IgG
titer in spinal fluid should be based on in-house validation or
literature references. Provide trained healthcare professionals
with appropriate context for interpretation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings.
• Potential cross-reactivity or non-specific staining must be
considered.
• Refer to specific reagent inserts for any additional methodological
limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for antibodies and reagents used.
• Published literature on the methodology and interpretation of
TRIM46 IgG titers in spinal fluid.
This completes the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for TRIM46 IgG, tissue immunofluorescence titer, spinal fluid.
All personnel must adhere to these procedures to maintain testing
accuracy and reliability.
