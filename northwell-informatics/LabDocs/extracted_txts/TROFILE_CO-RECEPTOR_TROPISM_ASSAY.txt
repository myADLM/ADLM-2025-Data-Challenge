TROFILE Co-Receptor Tropism Assay Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of the TROFILE Co-Receptor Tropism Assay is to
determine the tropism of HIV in patient samples. The assay identifies
whether the virus uses CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptors for cell entry,
which is critical for determining the appropriateness of certain
antiretroviral therapies.
Responsibility:
Designated staff will perform the TROFILE assay, monitor the
process, and document results. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure that proper training and quality control
procedures are followed.
1. DEFINITION
The TROFILE Co-Receptor Tropism Assay is a molecular diagnostic
test that uses PCR and sequencing techniques to evaluate the HIV
tropism in patient specimens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Plasma: Collect 10 mL of blood in an EDTA tube. Plasma should
be separated within 6 hours of collection.
• Serum: Collect 10 mL of blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
Allow clotting and centrifuge within 1 hour of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA or SST.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or contaminated.
• Specimens that arrive more than 24 hours after collection without
proper processing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Sequencing Instrument
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes
• Biosafety Cabinet
Reagents:
• TROFILE PCR Kit
• TROFILE Sequencing Kit
• EDTA anticoagulant
• Molecular-grade water
• Ethanol (70%)
Supplies:
• PCR reaction tubes
• Sequencing reaction tubes
• Tips for pipettes
• Sterile gloves
• Laboratory notebook
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the specimen, verify patient information. Log the
specimen according to accession protocols.
2. Centrifuge the EDTA tube at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully transfer the plasma to a clean, labeled
microcentrifuge tube.
4. Store plasma samples at -20°C if not processing immediately.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Follow the TROFILE PCR kit instructions for amplifying the
treated sample.
2. Set up PCR reaction:
◦ Add plasma, molecular-grade water, PCR buffer, primers,
and Taq polymerase.
◦ Program the thermocycler according to the kit guidelines
(usually initial denaturation, annealing, extension cycles).
3. Verify the amplified product through gel electrophoresis.
C) Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR product following TROFILE Sequencing Kit
instructions.
2. Set up sequencing reaction:
◦ Add purified PCR product, sequencing primers, and
sequencing buffer in the reaction tubes.
3. Load tubes into the sequencing instrument and start the
protocol.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Sequence data will be analyzed using TROFILE's specified
software or algorithms.
2. Compare sequences to reference databases to determine
tropism.
E) Verification and Documentation:
1. Verify the results with appropriate controls.
2. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Ensure documentation includes:
◦ Patient identifier
◦ Date of test
◦ Technician initials
◦ Result (CCR5 or CXCR4 tropism)
◦ Any notes on findings or issues during processing.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
QC Procedure:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Record control results in a QC log.
3. Troubleshoot any discrepancies in control results before
reporting patient samples.
QC Materials:
• Positive control samples (known CCR5 and CXCR4 tropism)
• Negative control samples (known non-HIV/RNA samples)
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting:
• Results will be automatically uploaded to the LIS from the
sequencing software.
• Technologist will review and verify results before they are
available for clinician access.
Critical Values:
• CCR5-tropic result may suggest eligibility for CCR5 antagonist
therapy.
• CXCR4-tropic result may contraindicate CCR5 antagonist therapy.
Comments:
• If results are ambiguous or tropism cannot be determined,
recommend re-sampling and re-testing.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable for TROFILE Co-Receptor Tropism Assay as it is a
qualitative test.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Insufficient viral RNA quantity may limit assay sensitivity.
◦ Contaminated specimens may produce false results.
◦ High genetic variability of HIV may affect accuracy.
