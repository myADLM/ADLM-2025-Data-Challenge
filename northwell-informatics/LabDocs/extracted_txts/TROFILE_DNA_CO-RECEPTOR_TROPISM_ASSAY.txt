TROFILE DNA Co-Receptor Tropism Assay Protocol
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of the Trofile DNA Co-Receptor Tropism Assay.
This assay determines HIV-1 co-receptor usage (CCR5 or
CXCR4) by analyzing the segment of the HIV-1 envelope gene.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the Trofile DNA Co-Receptor Tropism Assay.
3. Responsibilities
◦ Laboratory Technologist: Perform the assay according to
the SOP and document all steps. Identify any issues and
communicate them to the supervisor.
◦ Supervisor: Ensure proper training of personnel, oversee
the process, and address identified issues.
◦ Quality Control Officer: Monitor the QC process and
documentation, verify results, and ensure adherence to the
SOP.
4. Specimen Requirements
◦ Specimen Type: Plasma or serum.
◦ Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL.
◦ Storage Conditions: Store specimens at -80°C until
testing. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 1 month at -80°C.
5. Equipment and Reagents
◦ PCR Thermal Cycler
◦ Centrifuge
◦ DNA Extraction Kit
◦ Real-Time PCR Instrument
◦ Trofile DNA Assay Kit (containing primers, probes, and
controls)
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Pipettes and disposable tips
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction
1. Thaw the specimen at room temperature.
2. Use the DNA Extraction Kit to isolate DNA from the
specimen according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer
and record the concentration.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix using reagents from the
Trofile DNA Assay Kit.
2. Aliquot the reaction mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Add the extracted DNA to each reaction tube or well.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
5. Program the thermal cycler according to the
manufacturer’s instructions:
- Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
- Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
- Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
- Number of Cycles: 40
C. Real-Time PCR Detection
1. Load the PCR tubes or plate into the Real-Time PCR
Instrument.
2. Perform the amplification and detection as per the
instrument’s protocol.
3. Monitor amplification plots and ensure proper
performance of controls.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Analyze the Real-Time PCR data using the appropriate
software.
2. Determine HIV-1 co-receptor tropism based on the
assay’s specific guidelines.
3. Document the results and ensure accurate interpretation.
7. Quality Control
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens.
◦ Record control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
◦ If control results are outside acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot, repeat the assay, and document corrective
actions.
8. Reporting Results
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify results and ensure they are correctly assigned to the
respective specimens.
◦ Report any discrepancies to the supervisor immediately.
9. Safety and Waste Disposal
◦ Wear appropriate PPE when handling specimens and
reagents.
◦ Dispose of all hazardous waste, including biological
specimens and used reagents, according to local
regulations and the laboratory’s waste management
protocol.
