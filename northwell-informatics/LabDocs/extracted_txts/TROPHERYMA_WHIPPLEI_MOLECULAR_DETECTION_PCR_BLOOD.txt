Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
TROPHERYMA WHIPPLEI: Molecular Detection, PCR, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized and
reliable protocol for the molecular detection of Tropheryma whipplei
in blood samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
technology.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel who are
responsible for the molecular detection of Tropheryma whipplei
from blood samples using PCR.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to ensure:
• Adherence to this procedure.
• Proper handling and processing of blood samples.
• Accurate performance and documentation of all PCR testing
steps.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Acceptable volume: 5-10 mL of whole blood.
• Transport conditions: Maintain at 4°C if delay in processing is
anticipated. Ensure samples are processed within 24 hours of
collection.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR Workstation
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Pipettors and sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers
• Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL and 0.2 mL)
• DNA extraction kit suitable for whole blood
• PCR master mix specific to Tropheryma whipplei detection
• Positive and negative controls
• Nuclease-free water
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Receipt and Accessioning:
◦ Upon receipt, verify that the blood sample is labeled
correctly and log into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ This should include patient identification number, date and
time of collection, and collector’s initials.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Process the whole blood sample within 24 hours of
collection.
◦ Aliquot the required volume (typically 200 µL) into a sterile,
labeled microcentrifuge tube for DNA extraction.
6.2 DNA Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
to extract DNA from the blood sample.
2. Quantify the yield and assess the quality of extracted DNA.
6.3 PCR Setup
1. Preparation of PCR Master Mix:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, including the PCR buffer,
dNTPs, primers specific for Tropheryma whipplei, Taq
polymerase, and other required components.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
2. Reaction Mixture:
◦ Aliquot the PCR master mix into labeled 0.2 mL PCR tubes
or a 96-well PCR plate.
◦ Add a defined volume of template DNA (5-10 µL) to each
PCR tube/well.
3. Amplification:
◦ Place the tubes/plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Set up the PCR program, which typically includes:
▪ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2-3 minutes.
▪ 30-40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds.
▪ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Extension at 72°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.
6.4 Post-PCR Analysis
1. Analyze the PCR products using the real-time PCR instrument's
software.
2. Evaluate the amplification curves of the test samples and
controls.
3. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Positive Result:
▪ Detection of the specific Tropheryma whipplei target
sequence in the patient sample, evident by a Ct value
within the established threshold range similar to the
positive control.
◦ Negative Result:
▪ No amplification above the threshold level for the
Tropheryma whipplei target sequence, indicating the
absence of the bacteria in the tested sample.
◦ Invalid Result:
▪ Any issues with controls or inconsistencies that
necessitate retesting the sample.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure the validity of the test.
• External Quality Controls:
◦ Participate in an external quality assurance program to
regularly assess the accuracy and reliability of the PCR assay.
• Document all control results, and any corrective actions taken if
controls fall outside acceptable limits.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification.
• Include clear interpretation (positive, negative, invalid) with
optional commentary as necessary.
• Ensure that all verified results are communicated promptly to the
requesting clinician.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit and PCR
master mix.
• Relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature and guidelines for the
molecular detection of Tropheryma whipplei.
10. RECORD-KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough records of all test runs, including raw data,
control outcomes, and final interpretations.
• Ensure all corrective actions are documented if necessary.
11. SAFETY
• Adhere to Universal Precautions and laboratory biosafety
guidelines.
• Properly dispose of biohazardous materials following established
protocols.
