Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Tropheryma Whipplei
Molecular Detection - PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures for the detection of Tropheryma
Whipplei in clinical specimens using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical specimens received by the
laboratory for the detection of Tropheryma Whipplei via PCR. The
specimen has been collected, received, and accessioned prior to
beginning this analytical phase.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP. It is
the responsibility of the staff to ensure the integrity of the specimens
and the accuracy of PCR results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Laminar Flow Hood or PCR Workstation
• Micropipettes and Tips with aerosol barrier
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerators and Freezers for reagent and specimen storage
• PCR reagents:
◦ Tropheryma Whipplei-specific primers
◦ DNA polymerase enzyme
◦ Nucleotides mix (dNTPs)
◦ Reaction buffers
◦ Positive and negative control templates
• Nucleic acid extraction kits (validated for PCR use)
• PCR tubes and plates
• Agarose gel electrophoresis equipment (if required)
• Documentation materials (e.g., log books, result sheets)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen Types:
• Synovial fluid
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Biopsy tissue (intestinal, lymph node, etc.)
• Blood
Criteria for Acceptability:
• Adequate volume
• Correct labeling with patient information and collection time
• Arrived within an acceptable time frame post-collection
• Proper storage and transport conditions maintained
6. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Verify specimen information (volume,
labeling, condition). b. Combine sample with lysis buffer and
vortex vigorously. c. Follow nucleic acid extraction kit
instructions for sample processing. d. Store extracted nucleic
acid at -20°C or proceed immediately to PCR.
2. Controls: a. Include positive extraction control – a known
Tropheryma Whipplei DNA sample. b. Include negative
extraction control – a blank sample processed alongside clinical
specimens.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Preparation of PCR Mix: a. Thaw reagents on ice. b. Prepare
master mix as follows (per reaction): - 12.5 µL PCR buffer - 2.5
µL nucleotide mix (dNTPs) - 0.5 µL each primer (forward and
reverse) - 1 µL DNA polymerase enzyme - Up to 5 µL template
DNA (extracted sample) - Nuclease-free water to final volume
of 25 µL
2. Thermal Cycler Settings: a. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5
minutes b. 30 cycles of: i. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds ii.
Annealing: adjust temperature based on primer specifications
(typically 55-65°C) for 30 seconds iii. Extension: 72°C for 45
seconds c. Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
C. PCR Product Analysis:
1. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable): a. Prepare a
2% agarose gel with DNA staining dye. b. Load PCR products
and appropriate molecular weight markers. c. Run gel at 90
volts for 1 hour. d. Visualize under UV light and document
results.
D. Interpretation and Documentation:
1. Result Analysis: a. Confirm the presence of Tropheryma
Whipplei DNA in clinical specimens by comparing PCR product
size to positive control. b. Note any PCR anomalies, such as
non-specific bands or absence of expected bands, and repeat if
necessary.
2. Reporting Results: a. Document PCR results in the laboratory
information system (LIS). b. Report positive results as
"Tropheryma Whipplei detected" and negative results as
"Tropheryma Whipplei not detected". c. Notify ordering
physician promptly for critical positive results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Controls: a. Run positive and negative controls with
each batch of specimens. b. Monitor and document control
results to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. External Controls and Proficiency Testing: a. Participate in
regular external proficiency testing programs for Tropheryma
Whipplei PCR. b. Ensure continuous improvement based on
proficiency testing feedback.
8. MAINTENANCE
1. Equipment Calibration and Maintenance: a. Regularly
calibrate PCR cyclers and other instruments. b. Follow
maintenance schedules for all equipment.
2. Temperature Monitoring: a. Monitor and document
temperature of refrigerators and freezers storing reagents and
specimens.
9. SAFETY
1. Personal Protective Equipment: a. Wear lab coats, gloves,
and eye protection when handling specimens and reagents.
2. Waste Disposal: a. Dispose of biohazard waste according to
safety guidelines.
