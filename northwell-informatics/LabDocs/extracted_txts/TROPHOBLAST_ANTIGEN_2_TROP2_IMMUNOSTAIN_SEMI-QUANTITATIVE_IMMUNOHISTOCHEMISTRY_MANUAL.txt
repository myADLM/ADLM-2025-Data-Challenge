Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for generating semi-quantitative results for
Trophoblast Antigen 2 (TROP2) Immunostain using manual
immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to conduct the
analysis following the outlined procedures and to ensure the quality
and accuracy of the recorded results. The laboratory manager/
supervisor is responsible for overseeing the adherence to this SOP
and for addressing any issues that arise during the procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Trophoblast Antigen 2 (TROP2) is a cell surface glycoprotein that is
involved in various cancer pathways and has potential implications
for diagnosis and therapy.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections. Section Thickness: 4-5 micrometers. Number of Slides: A
minimum of 2 slides per specimen; one for the TROP2 IHC stain and
one for a negative control.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Primary Antibody: Anti-TROP2 antibody. Secondary Antibody:
Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection System:
DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate kit. Counterstain:
Hematoxylin. Mounting Medium: Appropriate mounting medium (e.g.,
DPX). Positive Control: Known TROP2-positive tissue. Negative
Control: A separate section with no primary antibody applied. Other
Supplies: Xylene, ethanol series, PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline),
slides, cover slips, and necessary pipettes and timers.
1. EQUIPMENT
Microtome for sectioning FFPE tissue blocks. Water bath at 37-40°C.
Incubator at 37°C. Microscope.
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
Prepare FFPE tissue sections at 4-5 micrometers using a microtome.
Float the sections on a water bath set at 37-40°C for flattening. Pick
up the sections onto positively charged slides and incubate at 60°C
for 1 hour to affix the tissue.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
Place the slides in xylene and incubate for 3 minutes, repeat twice to
ensure adequate deparaffinization. Rehydrate the slides in an ethanol
series, starting with 100% ethanol (2 minutes) down to 70% ethanol,
and finally rinse in distilled water (2 minutes each).
Antigen Retrieval:
Prepare the antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer). Heat the
retrieval solution to 95-100°C. Submerge the slides in the heated
retrieval solution for 20 minutes. Rinse slides in PBS after cooling.
Blocking:
Incubate slides with appropriate blocking solution for 10 minutes to
prevent non-specific binding.
Primary Antibody Incubation:
Apply diluted primary anti-TROP2 antibody to the sections. Incubate
the slides in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 1 hour.
Wash the sections in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 times.
Secondary Antibody Incubation:
Apply the secondary HRP conjugated antibody to the sections.
Incubate in the humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Wash the sections in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 times.
DAB Chromogen Reaction:
Mix the DAB substrate solution according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Apply the DAB substrate to the sections and incubate
until adequate staining develops (generally 3-10 minutes monitoring
under the microscope). Stop the reaction by immersion in distilled
water.
Counterstain:
Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. Rinse in
running tap water for 5 minutes. Dehydrate sections through an
ethanol series to xylene (70%, 95%, 100%) and air-dry.
Mounting:
Apply an appropriate mounting medium and cover slip the slides.
Allow slides to dry and observe under the microscope to ensure
adequate staining.
Quality Control:
Analyze the positive and negative control slides. Verify the staining
intensity on control slides before reviewing patient slides.
Reporting Results:
Observe at least 10 high-power fields for each specimen under a
microscope. Report TROP2 staining semi-quantitatively based on the
percentage and intensity of positive cells: Percentage scale: 0: No
staining. 1: <10% of cells stain positive. 2: 10-50% of cells stain
positive. 3: >50% of cells stain positive. Intensity scale: 0: No
staining. 1: Weak staining. 2: Moderate staining. 3: Strong staining.
1. QC PROCEDURES
Reagent and antibody QC using control slides. Review of staining
pattern and intensity on control and patient slides. Include internal
and external quality control measures through proficiency tests and
inter-laboratory comparisons.
1. REPORTING
Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS), verify, and
review by a pathologist before final reporting. Document all findings
and discrepancies according to laboratory policies.
1. REFERENCES
Include relevant literature, antibody datasheets, and manufacturer
instructions for reagents and equipment.
1. APPENDIX
Provide sample forms, logs, and any additional supportive
documentation necessary.
The above procedure will ensure the integrity and quality of TROP2
IHC results, ensuring reliable patient care and diagnostic outcomes.
