Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase (TRK)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results using Tropomyosin Receptor
Kinase (TRK) immunostain. This protocol applies to the technical
component of the process, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of
the immunostain results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the technical component of TRK immunostain analysis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol strictly. Laboratory personnel must notify a supervisor if any
deviations or issues arise during the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with improper fixation
• Specimens that are inadequately preserved or processed
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Microscope
• Water bath
• Drying oven
• Staining racks
• Coverslipper
Reagents:
• TRK primary antibody
• Secondary antibody reagent
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated polymer)
• DAB or other chromogen
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
1. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Sectioning and Mounting:
1. Cut FFPE tissue sections at 3-4 micrometers using a
microtome.
2. Place tissue sections in a water bath set to 40-45°C to ensure
smooth spreading.
3. Mount sections onto positively charged slides.
4. Allow slides to dry in a drying oven set to 60°C for at least 30
minutes.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in xylene (or a xylene substitute) for 3 x 5 minutes
to remove paraffin.
2. Rehydrate tissue sections through a series of ethanol solutions:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 x 5 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 x 5 minutes
◦ 80% ethanol, 1 x 5 minutes
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval by placing slides in a preheated
retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and incubate in a
microwave or pressure cooker as per the retrieval method
specifics (generally 15-20 minutes).
2. Allow sections to cool in the buffer at room temperature for
approximately 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water, followed by PBS (phosphate-
buffered saline) or TBS (tris-buffered saline) for 5 minutes.
D) Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply protein block (if required) to the sections and incubate for
10 minutes at room temperature to reduce nonspecific binding.
2. Tap off excess liquid and wipe around sections to avoid cross-
contamination.
3. Apply TRK primary antibody to the sections and incubate in a
humidified chamber at the manufacturer’s recommended time
and temperature (usually 30-60 minutes at room temperature).
E) Detection:
1. Rinse slides twice in PBS/TBS buffer for 5 minutes each.
2. Apply secondary antibody reagent to the slides and incubate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (usually 20-30
minutes at room temperature).
3. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS buffer for 5 minutes, twice.
4. Apply detection reagent (e.g., HRP-conjugated polymer) and
incubate as per the manufacturer’s instructions (typically 20
minutes).
5. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS buffer for 5 minutes, twice.
F) Chromogen Development:
1. Apply DAB or other chromogen to the slides and incubate until
the desired staining intensity is achieved (generally 5-10
minutes, monitoring progress under a microscope).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
G) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes to blue the
hematoxylin.
H) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate sections through a graded series of ethanol (70%,
95%, 100%) for 2 x 2 minutes each.
2. Clear slides in 2 x 5 minutes xylene changes.
3. Mount sections with a suitable mounting medium and apply
coverslips.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include a positive control slide with each batch to ensure
successful staining.
6. Include a negative control slide where the primary antibody is
omitted to monitor nonspecific binding.
7. Document the quality control results in the QC log along with
corrective actions for any anomalies observed.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. The stained slides will be reviewed by a pathologist or
designated reviewer.
10. Findings will be documented, and technical quality will be noted
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
11. Notify a supervisor immediately if any issues affecting result
integrity are observed.
