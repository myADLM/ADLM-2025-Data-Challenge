Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for TROPONIN I, HIGH SENSITIVITY,
PLASMA
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the accurate
and timely analysis of Troponin I, High Sensitivity in plasma
using the designated analyzer. This protocol ensures the
reliability and reproducibility of results, which are critical for the
diagnosis and management of patients.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis as defined in this
procedure.
• Supervisors and staff are responsible for ensuring that the
procedure is followed and that corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
1. DEFINITION Troponin I, High Sensitivity is a cardiac biomarker
used to detect myocardial infarction.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma
• Collection Tube: Lithium Heparin (green top) or EDTA (lavender
top)
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of plasma
Stability:
• At room temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated at 2-8°C: 24 hours
• Frozen at -20°C or lower: 1 month
Unacceptable Specimen Criteria:
• Samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or exhibit gross particulate
matter.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or accompanied by the
correct requisition forms.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• High Sensitivity Troponin I analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e 801)
• Troponin I reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample tubes and racks
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Preparation:
• Verify the specimen type, volume, and integrity.
• Ensure specimen labeling matches the requisition form.
• Document any discrepancies in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
Calibration:
• Perform calibration using designated calibrator according to
manufacturer’s instruction before running patient samples.
• Record calibration data, including date, time, and initials of the
technologist.
Quality Control:
• Run the appropriate quality control (QC) material at the start of
each shift and after calibration.
• QC materials with known concentrations should be used to
validate the system’s performance.
• Document QC results in the LIS.
• Ensure that QC results fall within the acceptable range. If QC
results are out of range, troubleshoot as per manufacturer’s
guidelines and do not proceed with patient sample analysis until
resolved.
Sample Analysis:
1. Ensure the analyzer is on and properly maintained.
2. Load plasma samples into the designated area on the analyzer.
3. Enter the required patient and sample information into the LIS.
4. Select the Troponin I, High Sensitivity test from the analyzer
menu.
5. Begin the analysis process per the analyzer’s operation
manual.
6. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alarms during
the operation.
7. If errors occur, refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by
the manufacturer and perform corrective actions as necessary.
Post-Analytical Processes:
1. Review generated results for accuracy and completeness.
2. Validate results ensuring QC results are within acceptable
ranges and patient results do not show any inconsistencies.
3. Confirm critical high Troponin I results as per site-specific
guidelines.
4. Document all steps, including any actions taken for odd or
critical results.
5. Transmit results directly to LIS for reporting.
6. Ensure proper documentation of patient results, QC outcomes,
and any errors or corrective actions are noted in the logbook.
Reporting Results:
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Critical results are reported immediately to the physician/nurse
and documented according to site-specific critical results reporting
guidelines.
• Results are automatically transmitted to LIS following validation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS The reference intervals should be
based on the specific guidelines provided by the test
manufacturer and validated by the laboratory.
• For Troponin I, High Sensitivity (Example reference values):
◦ Male: < 20 ng/L
◦ Female: < 17 ng/L
1. QUALITY CONTROL Refer to the specific guidelines provided
by the reagent and analyzer manufacturer. Ensure timely
performance and documentation of QC checks.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to manufacturer’s instructions
and insert for the reagent and analyzer being used for specific
limitations regarding Troponin I, High Sensitivity analysis.
3. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package insert for Troponin I, High Sensitivity
reagent kits.
• Laboratory’s internal procedure manuals.
• Regulatory guidelines for Troponin I testing.
1. REVISION HISTORY Include history of revisions to this SOP
with dates and details of changes.
