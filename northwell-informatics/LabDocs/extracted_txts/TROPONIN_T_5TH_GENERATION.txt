Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Troponin T, 5th Generation
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the processing, testing, and
reporting of Troponin T, 5th Generation results in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay,
documenting results, and following quality control procedures. All
staff must report any deficiencies or issues affecting the accuracy of
the test results to a supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum or plasma collected in lithium heparin, K2EDTA, or SST
(serum separator tube)
• Specimens should be collected according to standard
venipuncture procedures.
• The specimen should be transported and processed within 24
hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic.
• Specimens collected in non-standard tubes or expired collection
tubes.
• Specimens that have been stored improperly or beyond
acceptable timeframes.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Troponin T, 5th Generation assay kits (according to
manufacturer’s specifications)
• Roche Cobas e 411 or similar immunoassay analyzers
• Calibrators and control materials specific to Troponin T, 5th
Generation
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tubes, centrifuge, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all assay reagents, calibrators, and controls are within
expiry dates and stored as per manufacturer instructions.
• Allow specimens and control materials to come to room
temperature before analysis.
• Perform daily maintenance and calibration of the analyzer as per
manufacturer guidelines.
Testing:
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Centrifuge specimens at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to ensure
serum/plasma separation.
◦ Inspect specimens for signs of hemolysis, icterus, or
lipemia. Reject and reorder specimens if necessary.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Load specimens, calibrators, and quality control materials
into the analyzer according to the specified procedure.
◦ Follow the analyzer’s operational manual to input assay
parameters and initiate the test cycle.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal assay controls (low, medium, high) at the start
of each shift and with each batch.
◦ Document control results and assess against pre-
determined acceptable ranges. Investigate and resolve any
deviations before proceeding with patient samples.
4. Analysis:
◦ The analyzer quantifies Troponin T levels through
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method.
◦ Troponin T values are automatically transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for documentation and
result verification.
◦ Review and verify results within the LIS, ensuring no flagged
issues or codes that require troubleshooting.
5. Reporting:
◦ Report results within the LIS according to site-specific
guidelines, including critical values.
◦ Critical Values for Troponin T > 0.10 ng/mL must be
communicated to the ordering clinician immediately.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Bi-level controls (Normal and Abnormal Troponin T levels) must
be run daily and documented.
• Acceptable control limits as per manufacturer or lab established
guidelines.
• Any failed controls must lead to assay recalibration and re-testing
until acceptable results are achieved.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs and compare
inter-lab results every quarterly.
• Document and address any discrepancies or irregularities found
in proficiency testing promptly.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed specimens can interfere with Troponin T results and
should be avoided.
• Ensure minimum sample volume (as specified by the assay
manufacturer) to avoid erroneous results.
• Refer to manufacturer’s insert for additional limitations and
interferences.
