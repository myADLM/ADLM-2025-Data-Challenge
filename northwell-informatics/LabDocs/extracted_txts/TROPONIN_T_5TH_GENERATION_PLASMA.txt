Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedures for Troponin T, 5th Generation, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for the quantitative measurement of
Troponin T, 5th Generation, in plasma specimens in order to ensure
accurate, precise, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members trained in conducting
Troponin T, 5th Generation assays in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assays and compliance with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma collected in lithium or sodium heparin tubes
(light green or green top tubes).
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood specimen following standard phlebotomy
procedures.
• Gently invert the collection tubes 5-8 times to ensure mix with
anticoagulant.
• Centrifuge and separate plasma within 2 hours of collection.
• Plasma specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with gross hemolysis.
• Samples with lipemia or icterus that significantly interfere with
assay readings.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer approved for Troponin T, 5th
Generation testing.
• Centrifuge.
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer for gentle mixing of samples as needed.
• Relevant computer hardware and software for data processing.
Reagents:
• Troponin T, 5th Generation reagent kit, including calibrators and
quality controls.
• Reagent Storage: Store reagents as per manufacturer’s
instructions, typically 2-8°C.
• Note: Do not use reagents past their expiration date.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Quality control material of at least two levels (normal and
abnormal) commercially available.
• Follow manufacturer's storage and preparation instructions.
Procedure:
• Analyze quality control materials prior to patient testing and after
instrument calibration or maintenance.
• Document and verify that quality control results are within
acceptable limits provided by the manufacturer.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Perform daily maintenance and calibration of the analyzer
according to manufacturer’s protocols.
2. Verify that the analyzer is within acceptable operating
conditions.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure plasma samples are brought to room temperature
before testing.
2. Vortex to mix if necessary.
3. Load the samples onto the analyzer according to the
instrument’s guidelines.
C. Assay Performance:
1. Select the correct assay method on the analyzer.
2. Place reagents, calibrators, quality controls, and samples in the
appropriate positions on the analyzer.
3. Initiate the assay run following the instrument’s operational
steps.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Ensure that all quality control results fall within the acceptable
range.
2. Review and validate all patient results prior to reporting.
3. Results should be automatically transferred to the LIS system
or manually entered if required.
4. All results must be reported in ng/L or as appropriate per
laboratory reporting guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference intervals are typically provided by the manufacturer
based on population studies. Confirm that the following values are
aligned with your specific analyzer and reagents:
◦ Males: <15.5 ng/L
◦ Females: <9.0 ng/L
9. CRITICAL VALUES
• Any result above the clinical decision limit should be considered
critical and promptly communicated to the relevant healthcare
provider.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can interfere with test results and
should be minimized.
• Biotin interference: High biotin levels may affect assay results,
ensure patient preparation is consistent with avoiding biotin
supplements 24-48 hours prior to testing.
