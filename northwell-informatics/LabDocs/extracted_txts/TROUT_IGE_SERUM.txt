Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TROUT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for processing and analyzing
serum samples for the determination of Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
levels. The objective is to ensure accuracy, consistency, and
reliability of IgE test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the clinical laboratory staff to ensure
proper handling and processing of the serum samples during
the analytical phase. Laboratory technologists are solely
responsible for performing the test and ensuring quality control
measures are adhered to.
3. DEFINITIONS
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody that plays a crucial role in
allergic reactions. TROUT: Test Required for Optimal
Understanding of Test results, a quality control measure.
4. EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer or ELISA Reader
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips
◦ Reagents and calibrators specific to the IgE assay
◦ Control materials (positive and negative controls)
◦ Test tubes and racks
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the serum samples have been received,
accessioned, and are properly labeled.
2. Inspect serum samples for any hemolysis, lipemia, or
clots. Record any observations.
3. Centrifuge the serum samples at 3000 RCF for 10
minutes to separate serum if not already done.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and control materials as
per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Allow all reagents to come to room temperature prior to
use.
3. Follow any specific mixing or reconstitution instructions
outlined by the reagent manufacturer.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Automated Immunoassay Analyzer:
a. Load the reagents, controls, calibrators, and serum
samples into the appropriate racks and positions in the
analyzer. b. Ensure all pipettes are calibrated and
volumes set according to assay requirements. c. Program
the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s protocol for
IgE determination. d. Initiate the run and monitor for any
pipetting or error alerts.
2. Manual ELISA Method:
a. Add the appropriate volume of assay buffer to each well
of the microtiter plate. b. Pipette serum samples,
calibrators, and controls into designated wells. c. Follow
the sequential addition of reagents and incubation times
as per the kit’s instructions. d. Wash wells thoroughly
between each step to remove unbound substances. e.
Add the substrate solution and incubate for the specified
period before stopping the reaction. f. Measure
absorbance at the specified wavelength using an ELISA
reader.
D. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (positive and negative) with
each batch of patient samples.
2. Evaluate the quality control results before releasing
patient results. Results should fall within the specified
range provided by the manufacturer.
3. If control results are out of range, do not report patient
results. Identify and resolve the issue before rerunning
controls and samples.
E. Result Calculation and Reporting
1. The concentration of IgE in patient serum is calculated by
the analyzer or manual method using a calibration curve.
2. Verify the accuracy of results by reviewing control and
calibrator recoveries.
3. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) without transcription errors.
6. REFERENCE RANGES
◦ The reference range for serum IgE levels may vary by age,
gender, and methodology. Refer to the assay's specific
package insert for reference intervals.
◦ Generally, the reference range for adults is up to 100 IU/mL.
For children, consult the age-specific reference range
provided in the test kit insert.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
In case of any discrepancies or instrument alerts, refer to the
troubleshooting guide provided by the instrument manufacturer.
Log all troubleshooting activities and outcomes.
