Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Trypanosoma Cruzi (Chagas) Antibody
Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed and standardized
procedure for the analytical phase involved in generating results for
the Trypanosoma Cruzi (Chagas) Antibody Panel from serum
samples. This ensures the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of
laboratory results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedures as described.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and addressing any procedure-related issues.
1. DEFINITION
The Trypanosoma Cruzi (Chagas) Antibody Panel is a serological
assay for the detection of antibodies specific to Trypanosoma Cruzi in
human serum. This is used for diagnosing Chagas disease.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred Specimen: Serum isolated from clotted blood collected
in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples with visible hemolysis,
samples that were not stored properly, and samples with
insufficient volume.
• Stability:
◦ Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
◦ For long-term storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C or lower.
B. Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies
• Trypanosoma Cruzi Assay Kit (Manufacturer specific)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microtiter plate reader (ELISA reader)
• Timer
• Deionized or distilled water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
C. Reagent Preparation
• Reagents should be prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions provided with the assay kit.
• All reagents must reach room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
• Reconstituted reagents should be labeled with the preparation
date and stored as instructed by the manufacturer.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Preparation of Samples and Controls
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix gently.
• Prepare the positive and negative control sera according to the kit
instructions.
1. Adding Samples to Microtiter Plate
• Add the required volume of diluted controls, standards, and serum
samples into the designated wells of the microtiter plate using a
precision micropipette.
• Avoid cross-contamination by changing pipette tips between each
sample.
1. Incubation
• Incubate the plate covered according to the specified temperature
and duration detailed in the kit instructions.
1. Washing
• Wash the plate as instructed in the assay manual to remove
unbound substances. Ensure proper functioning of the washing
step to avoid false results.
1. Addition of Conjugate
• Add the enzyme-linked conjugate to each well.
• Incubate as directed by the manufacturer’s protocol.
1. Substrate Reaction
• Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
for the time specified in the kit instructions.
1. Stopping the Reaction
• Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzyme-substrate
reaction.
1. Reading the Plate
• Read the absorbance of each well at the wavelength specified by
the assay kit (usually within 450nm range) using the microplate
reader.
E. Quality Control
• Run the positive and negative controls provided in the assay kit
with each batch of samples.
• Acceptable quality control ranges must be met before reporting
patient results.
• If quality control results are not within specified ranges,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
repeat the assay.
F. Calculating and Reporting Results
• Calculate the results based on the absorbance readings and
comparison to the calibrators/standard curve.
• Results interpretation will depend on the cut-off values provided
by the assay instructions. Report final results in accordance with
the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Results are reported qualitatively (Positive or Negative) based on the
cut-off value defined in the kit instructions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positive or false negative results may occur due to technical
errors, sample handling, or inherent limitations of the assay.
• Cross-reactivity with other Trypanosoma species may occur.
• High levels of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the
test results.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Properly document all the steps taken during the assay
procedure, including sample IDs, date, time, and initials of the
personnel performing the test.
• Record the final results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
or specified reporting format.
1. SAFETY
• Always employ standard lab safety practices, including the use of
PPE (gloves, lab coat, and eye protection).
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious materials.
1. REFERENCE
Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for the Trypanosoma Cruzi
assay kit for detailed instructions, quality control ranges, and
troubleshooting steps.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures a high standard of
accuracy and reliability in the test results generated for the
Trypanosoma Cruzi (Chagas) Antibody Panel, Serum.
