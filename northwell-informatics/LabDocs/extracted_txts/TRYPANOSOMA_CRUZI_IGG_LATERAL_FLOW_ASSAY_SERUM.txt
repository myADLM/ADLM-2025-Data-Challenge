Standard Operating Procedure TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI IGG,
LATERAL FLOW ASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of detecting Trypanosoma cruzi IgG antibodies
in serum using a lateral flow assay.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of laboratory
technologists and designated staff to perform the assay
according to this procedure, document results, and take
appropriate corrective actions if required. Supervisors are
responsible for verifying compliance and ensuring training of
personnel.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable specimen: Serum separated from blood
collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or a red-top tube
without anticoagulant. Specimen must be processed and stored
as per the laboratory's serum processing protocol.
• Unacceptable specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
specimens, or specimens that were not stored under the
appropriate conditions.
• Minimum required volume: 500 µL of serum.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Trypanosoma cruzi IgG lateral flow assay kit (Ensure the kit is
within the expiration date and stored as per manufacturer’s
guidelines)
• Micropipettes and tips (appropriately calibrated)
• Timer
• Disposable gloves
• Absorbent paper
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) as required
1. STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ASSAY COMPONENTS
• Store assay kits as per manufacturer’s instructions, typically at
2-30°C and away from direct sunlight.
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
• Do not use reagents or test components beyond their expiration
date.
• Do not mix reagents from different lots.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) using positive and negative controls
provided by the manufacturer or other validated QC materials
before testing patient specimens.
• Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before processing patient samples.
• If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's
guidelines and repeat QC testing. Do not proceed with patient
testing until QC passes.
1. PROCEDURE a. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure the serum sample is at room temperature.
◦ Mix the serum sample gently by inverting the tube several
times before use.
b. Running the Assay:
1. Label the test device and pipette with the patient’s identification
number.
2. Add a specified number of drops (as per manufacturer’s
instructions) of the serum sample into the sample well of the
lateral flow device.
3. Add the appropriate amount of the provided assay buffer to the
buffer well (if applicable).
4. Start the timer as per manufacturer’s protocol (usually around
15-20 minutes).
5. Allow the test to develop undisturbed on a flat surface. Avoid
moving or shaking the test device.
c. Reading the Results:
1. Read the results within the specified time window after adding
the sample (typically 15-30 mins).
2. Interpretation should follow the manufacturer’s guidelines:
◦ Positive Result: Presence of both control (C) and test (T)
lines.
◦ Negative Result: Presence of the control (C) line only.
◦ Invalid Result: Absence of the control (C) line, regardless of
the presence of the test (T) line. An invalid result requires a
repeat assay.
3. If the result is invalid:
◦ Verify the performance of the assay by checking QC
materials.
◦ If QC is satisfactory, retest a new aliquot of the serum
sample using a new test device.
◦ Document all invalid results, corrective actions taken, and
repeat the test if required.
4. RECORDING RESULTS
• Record the results, as per the interpretation guidelines, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Document the date, time, and initials of the technologist
performing the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and release results according to the laboratory's reporting
guidelines. Critical or unexpected results should be reviewed by a
supervisor before release.
• Notify the requesting clinician immediately of any positive results,
according to the laboratory’s protocol for critical values
notification.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If issues arise, consult the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
• Common issues include invalid results due to improper sample
application, expired reagents, or a malfunctioning device.
• Document any troubleshooting steps, corrective actions, and
outcomes.
