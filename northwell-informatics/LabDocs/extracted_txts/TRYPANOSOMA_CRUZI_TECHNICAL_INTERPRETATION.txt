Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) serological testing,
ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability in the technical
interpretation of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory scientists/technologists to perform
and document the technical analysis as described in this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying the results.
2. SPECIMEN
• Specimen Requirement: Serum or plasma.
• Collection: Blood collected in SST or Plasma Separator Tube.
• Specimen Volume: A minimum volume of 500 µL is required.
• Transport Conditions: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory at 2-8°C within 48 hours of collection. For longer
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Specimen Rejection: Hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric, or improperly
labeled samples.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated Serology Analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Trypanosoma cruzi Antibody Test Kit
• Microplate Shaker
• Pipettes and Tips
• Incubator (37°C)
• Microwell Plates
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
• Quality Control Materials: Positive and Negative Control Sera
• Timer
4. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge SST tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum from the clot.
2. Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
3. Ensure that aliquoted samples are free from particulate matter.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(15-30°C) before use.
◦ Prepare Wash Buffer as instructed by the test kit insert.
◦ Set up the Automated Serology Analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Dilution of Specimen:
◦ Dilute patient sera 1:21 in Sample Diluent. For 10 µL of
serum, add 200 µL of Sample Diluent.
◦ Mix well by gentle vortexing.
3. Loading the Microplate:
◦ Dispense 100 µL of diluted specimens, controls (positive
and negative), and calibrators into designated wells.
◦ Include at least one well of Reagent Blank.
4. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate with adhesive cover and incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Washing:
◦ After incubation, remove adhesive cover and immediately
wash wells thoroughly with Wash Buffer.
◦ Complete 5 wash cycles, making sure to fill wells to overflow
and remove all liquid after washing.
6. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate (anti-human IgG-HRP) to each
well.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for another 30 minutes with the microplate
covered.
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Wash wells as described in Step 5.
◦ Add 100 µL of the Substrate Solution to each well and
incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature away from
direct light.
8. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of Stop Solution to each well to terminate the
substrate reaction.
◦ Gently mix the microplate to ensure complete mixing of the
Stop Solution.
9. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Measure absorbance at 450 nm with a 620-650 nm
reference filter using an automated ELISA reader.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run Positive and Negative Controls with each batch of specimens
tested.
• Acceptable Control Ranges: Provided within the kit insert or
laboratory-defined limits.
• Review all control results before proceeding with the interpretation
of patient results.
• Document control results and maintain records.
6. TECHNICAL INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the Cut-off value as follows: [ \text{Cut-off value
(CO)} = \text{Mean Absorbance of Negative Controls} +
(0.1) ]
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Positive Result: Specimen Absorbance ≥ Cut-off value.
◦ Negative Result: Specimen Absorbance < Cut-off value.
◦ Indeterminate Result: Absorbance values that fall within
±10% of the Cut-off value.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report positive results as "Reactive" for Trypanosoma cruzi
antibodies.
◦ Report negative results as "Non-reactive".
◦ Indeterminate results may require repeat testing or
additional confirmatory testing.
