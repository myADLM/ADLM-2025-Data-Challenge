Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the detection of
Trypanosoma cruzi total antibody in serum by Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
Responsibility:
All qualified laboratory personnel conducting the T. cruzi ELISA assay
must follow this SOP to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable
results.
1. DEFINITION
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can be
detected by identifying specific antibodies in the patient's serum
using ELISA methodology.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader (Microplate spectrophotometer)
• Microplate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• Trypanosoma cruzi total antibody ELISA kit
• Wash buffer (following kit instructions)
• Substrate solution (e.g., tetramethylbenzidine [TMB])
• Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid)
• Positive and negative control sera (provided with the kit)
• Sampling buffer (provided with the kit)
• Deionized or distilled water
Supplies:
• 96-well microtiter plates (provided with the kit)
• Pipettes (single-channel or multi-channel)
• Pipette tips (filter tips recommended)
• Sera storage tubes
• Calibrated timer
• Absorbent paper
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum specimens collected in red top or
serum separator tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or microbial contaminated
sera.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
starting the assay. Reagents should be mixed thoroughly but
gently before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer and substrate solution as indicated in the
kit insert.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microtiter plate according to the sample layout and
plan. Include wells for blank, positive, and negative controls.
2. Add 100 µL of positive control, negative control, and serum
samples (diluted as required by the kit instructions) to their
designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
4. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
Complete removal of wash buffer is essential to avoid assay
variability.
5. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
6. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes or as stated by the kit's instructions.
7. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. The color will change from blue to yellow.
8. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction.
C. Quality Control:
• The assay includes built-in controls (positive and negative) for
validation of each run.
• Run additional quality controls specific to your laboratory, if
available.
D. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
1. Subtract the average absorbance values of the blank wells from
the average absorbance values of the control and test sample
wells.
2. Compare the test sample absorbance values to the cutoff value
determined from the positive and negative controls.
3. Results interpretation:
◦ Positive: Sample absorbance values above the cutoff value.
◦ Negative: Sample absorbance values below the cutoff value.
E. Result Reporting:
• Record sample results using site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Report as positive or negative for T. cruzi total antibody presence.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for limitations in sensitivity and
specificity of the ELISA methodology.

1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all samples and reagents according to the laboratory's
biosafety regulations.
• Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, and eye protection).
• Properly dispose of biohazardous waste and used materials.
Enacting this SOP helps to standardize and ensure the accuracy and
reliability of the Trypanosoma cruzi antibody detection process within
the laboratory.
