STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
(SOP)
Trypsin Immunostain - Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary to
perform the technical component of a Trypsin immunostain, ensuring
the proper preparation, staining, and documentation of results for
histopathological analysis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the staining procedure as well as monitoring and
documenting all steps to maintain quality control. All staff involved are
responsible for identifying and correcting any issues that may arise
during the process.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated Immunostainer or manual staining setup
• Microscope
• Water baths
• Heating blocks
• Incubators
Reagents:
• Trypsin working solution (pH 7.8-8.1)
• Primary antibody specific for trypsin
• Secondary antibody (as per manufacturer's instructions)
• DAB chromogen solution
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Positive and negative control slides
• Patient tissue slides
• Hydrophobic barrier pen
• Timer
• Coplin jars or staining dish
• Absorbent wipes or paper towels
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
Ensure that the tissue sections are properly fixed and paraffin-
embedded.
Section the tissue at 3-4 microns and place on positively charged
slides.
Dry the slides overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
Place slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
Transfer slides through graded ethanol solutions (100%, 95%, 80%,
70% - 2 minutes each), followed by a rinse in distilled water.
Antigen Retrieval and Blocking:
Immerse slides in pre-warmed Trypsin working solution at 37°C for
20 minutes.
Rinse slides in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 5 minutes.
Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Rinse slides in distilled water followed by TBS for 5 minutes.
Primary Antibody Incubation:
Encircle the tissue section with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
Apply the primary antibody specific for trypsin and incubate according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically 1 hour at room
temperature in a humidified chamber.
Rinse slides 3 times in TBS for 5 minutes each.
Secondary Antibody and Chromogen Incubation:
Apply the secondary antibody and incubate as per manufacturer’s
instructions, typically for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Rinse slides 3 times in TBS for 5 minutes each.
Apply DAB chromogen solution and incubate until desired stain
intensity is reached, typically 5-10 minutes.
Rinse slides in distilled water.
Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting:
Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
Rinse slides in distilled water.
Go through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% - 2
minutes each).
Clear slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
Mount sections with mounting medium and coverslip.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Include positive and negative control slides in each run.
Observe sections under the microscope to confirm the presence of a
specific and appropriate staining pattern. Positive control sections
should show a specific trypsin signal, while negative controls should
not show any staining background.
Record the lot number of all reagents used and the date of
preparation.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If staining is too light or absent on control sections, check antigen
retrieval parameters, antibody incubation times, and reagent
expiration dates.
If there is high background staining, review the slides for proper
blocking, thorough washing steps, and dilutions of primary and
secondary antibodies.
If technical issues are identified, repeat the staining process,
including updated steps taken to correct the issue.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Log all slides processed in the laboratory information system,
including patient identifier, date of staining, technician initials, and
results noted.
Maintain records of all reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
deviations from the standard protocol.
File printed images of representative stained sections or store digital
images when applicable.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Provide the stained slides to the pathologist for interpretation and
reporting.
Document completion of the technical component in the laboratory
information system, including any anomalies noted during the
staining procedure and the resolution steps taken.

used.
