Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for Tryptase
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing
tryptase levels in autopsy serum specimens to ensure accurate and
reliable results for clinical and research purposes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
tryptase analysis, following the protocol, and documenting all results
and actions taken. It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to
identify and report any issues or abnormalities encountered during
the analysis process to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum Storage
Conditions: Serum specimens should be stored at -20°C until
analysis. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Collection Time Frame:
Specimens should be collected post-mortem and sent to the
laboratory as soon as possible. Proper labeling of the specimen with
collection date/time and relevant autopsy details is crucial.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Microplate wells or tubes
• Tryptase ELISA kit (commercially available)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Laboratory timer
• Specimen storage (freezer -20°C)
1. PROCEDURE
Note: Follow the manufacturer's insert for the tryptase ELISA kit used
in the laboratory for detailed instructions.
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex samples briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge the thawed serum at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any debris or particulates.
4. Extract the supernatant and transfer it to a clean
microcentrifuge tube.
B) ELISA Assay Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C)
before starting the assay.
2. Label the microplate wells or tubes accordingly to include
standards, controls, and samples.
C) ELISA Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare the standard curve according to the kit instructions.
2. Add 100 µL of prepared standards, controls, and samples into
the assigned wells or tubes.
3. Incubate the plate at the recommended temperature and time
specified by the ELISA kit instructions.
4. Wash the wells as directed (typically includes multiple washes
with wash buffer).
5. Add the appropriate volume of detection antibody into each well
and incubate again.
6. Wash the plate after incubation.
7. Add substrate solution and incubate until color development.
8. Stop the reaction using Stop Solution provided in the kit.
9. Read the developed color on an ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength (usually 450 nm).
D) Result Calculation and Documentation:
1. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance values of the
standards.
2. Calculate the tryptase concentration for each sample using the
standard curve.
3. Document the results accurately, including any observations
and deviations encountered during the assay.
4. Ensure that all results are recorded in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and verified by the technologist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include internal quality control samples with each batch of
analysis to monitor assay performance.
• Verify the standard curve and ensure it meets the acceptance
criteria outlined in the kit's insert.
• Log any quality control failures and, if necessary, rerun the assay.
1. POST-ANALYSIS HANDLING
• Store remaining serum samples at -20°C for potential retesting.
• Dispose of used reagents and consumables according to
laboratory safety protocols.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results in the LIS for accuracy.
• Document any critical results and communicate them to the
appropriate clinical personnel.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for final result
dissemination.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's insert for the tryptase ELISA kit.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) documentation protocol.
• Local and international guidelines for post-mortem serum
analysis.
This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with new regulations and advancements in
laboratory practices.
