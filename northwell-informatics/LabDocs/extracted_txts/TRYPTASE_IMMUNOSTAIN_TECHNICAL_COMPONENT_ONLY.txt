1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the
methodology for performing the technical component of tryptase
immunostaining in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The purpose is to
ensure consistent and accurate staining of tryptase on tissue
sections for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel performing immunostaining
procedures share the responsibility for adhering to these protocols to
ensure the integrity of test results. It is the responsibility of
supervisors to ensure that staff are adequately trained and that these
procedures are accurately followed.
1. DEFINITION
Tryptase immunostaining is an immunohistochemical technique used
to detect the presence of tryptase enzyme in mast cells on tissue
sections. This procedure contributes to the diagnosis of mast cell-
related disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or
unstained slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not adequately fixed.
• Damaged or improperly labeled specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Oven
• Moist chamber or humidified slide box
• Staining racks
Reagents and Supplies:
• Primary antibody specific for tryptase
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated or other relevant detection
system)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Xylene and ethanol (various concentrations)
• Mounting medium
• Adhesive microscope slides
• Coverslips
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks using a microtome to obtain 4-5 µm
thick sections.
2. Float sections on a water bath at approximately 40°C and
mount them onto adhesive microscope slides.
3. Bake slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour or at 37°C overnight.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 4. Deparaffinize tissue sections
by immersing slides in xylene for 3 changes of 5 minutes each. 5.
Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol solutions
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each. 6. Rinse slides in distilled
water for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval: 7. Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides
in a suitable retrieval buffer and heating, according to antibody
manufacturer's instructions (e.g., microwave, water bath, or pressure
cooker). 8. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes. 9.
Rinse slides in PBS or another wash buffer for 5 minutes.
D) Immunostaining: 10. Encircle tissue sections with a hydrophobic
barrier pen. 11. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating
slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. 12. Wash slides in
PBS or wash buffer for 5 minutes. 13. Apply protein block solution to
sections for 10-20 minutes. 14. Incubate sections with primary anti-
tryptase antibody, diluted according to manufacturer’s
recommendations, for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at
4°C. 15. Wash slides in PBS or wash buffer for 3 changes of 5
minutes each. 16. Incubate sections with an appropriate secondary
antibody for 30 minutes. 17. Wash slides in PBS or wash buffer for 3
changes of 5 minutes each. 18. Apply chromogen solution (e.g.,
DAB) to sections for the recommended time to develop the color
(typically 3-5 minutes). 19. Rinse slides in distilled water. 20.
Counterstain with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then rinse
in tap water.
E) Dehydration, Clearing, and Mounting: 21. Dehydrate sections by
immersing slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, and
100%) for 3 minutes each. 22. Clear sections in 3 changes of xylene
for 5 minutes each. 23. Mount coverslips using a mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Include a control slide with known positive
tryptase staining to verify the specificity and sensitivity of the
staining process.
• Negative Control: Include a control slide where the primary
antibody is omitted or replaced with an irrelevant antibody to
assess non-specific binding.
• Documentation: Record all information about specimen handling,
reagent lot numbers, and procedural steps in the laboratory
logbook or electronic reporting system.
• Review and troubleshoot any discrepancies in staining patterns or
intensity under the supervision of a qualified pathologist.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are technically reviewed by a designated laboratory
technologist for quality and consistency.
• Slides are forwarded to the pathologist for interpretation,
evaluation, and final reporting of results to the requesting
clinician.
• All discrepancies or abnormal findings must be documented and
promptly communicated to ensure timely patient diagnosis and
care.
