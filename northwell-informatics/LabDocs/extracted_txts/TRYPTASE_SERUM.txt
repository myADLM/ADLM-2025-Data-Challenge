Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase
of TRYPTASE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for TRYPTASE, SERUM in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. The aim is to ensure accurate and reproducible results
using appropriate methodologies.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified medical laboratory scientists to
perform the analysis according to this procedure, including initial
training and periodic proficiency assessments.
3. DEFINITIONS
Tryptase, Serum: Tryptase is a protease found in the granules of
mast cells. Elevated levels in serum may indicate mast cell activation
as seen in allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, or mastocytosis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum obtained from fasting blood.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST; gold top) and allowed to clot for 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
• Processing: After clotting, centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes. Aliquot the serum into a plastic cryovial.
• Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if the analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours. If analysis will be delayed, samples
must be frozen at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader: Capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm.
• Pipettes: Adjustable to various volumes including multi-channel
pipettes.
• Reagents: Tryptase ELISA kit (commercially available).
• Microtiter plates: Provided with the ELISA kit.
• Calibrators and Controls: Provided with the ELISA kit.
• Deionized water: For reagent reconstitution.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
◦ Reconstitute wash buffer, standards, and any other
necessary reagents as per the ELISA kit’s instructions.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples to
the appropriate wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Ensure all calibrators, controls, and samples are run in
duplicate for accuracy.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 18-25°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using an appropriate plate washer. Perform
5-7 wash cycles with the wash buffer provided.
5. Conjugate Addition and Incubation:
◦ Add 100 µL enzyme-linked conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 18-25°C for 30 minutes.
6. Substrate Addition and Incubation:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at 18-25°C for 10-15 minutes.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The color should
change from blue to yellow.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
7. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the average absorbance for
each standard concentration on the y-axis against the
corresponding concentration on the x-axis.
• Calculate the tryptase concentration in patient serum samples
using the generated standard curve.
• Ensure quality control specimens fall within acceptable ranges
before validating patient results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run low, medium, and high controls with each batch of specimens
to ensure assay performance.
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, investigate
possible causes and repeat the assay if necessary.
9. REPORTING OF RESULTS
• All results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before releasing to the LIS.
• Refer to the laboratory-specific reference range for interpretation.
Typical reference range for serum tryptase: < 11 ng/mL.
10. LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or gross bacterial contamination may affect
the assay results.
• Ensure sample integrity to avoid erroneous results.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Tryptase ELISA kit.
• Laboratory reference manuals.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps, calibrator and control results, patient results, QC results,
and any deviations or troubleshooting must be documented in the
laboratory’s data management system.
This SOP ensures that the analysis of TRYPTASE, SERUM is
conducted uniformly and meets the highest standards of scientific
rigor and accuracy within a CLIA-certified laboratory setting.
