Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Tryptophan, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed, standardized
protocol for the analysis of tryptophan in plasma samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of the testing process
for determining tryptophan levels in plasma specimens received in
the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and consistently. The lab supervisor is
responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Plasma
• Collection tube: Lithium heparin or EDTA
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of plasma is required for analysis.
• Handling and storage:
◦ Specimens should be kept on ice immediately after collection.
◦ Plasma must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ The separated plasma should be stored at -20°C if not
analyzed immediately.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a fluorescence detector.
• Tryptophan standards.
• Mobile phase: Methanol-Water (50:50 v/v).
• Column: C18 reverse phase, 4.6 mm x 150 mm, 5 µm particle
size.
• Calibration solutions.
• Quality control materials (commercially available with known
tryptophan concentrations).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Glass vials and syringe filters.
• Plasticware and gloves for handling specimens and reagents.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control
Samples
1. Calibration standards should be prepared fresh for each batch
of analyses from a stock solution of known concentration.
2. Prepare a series of calibration standards of varying
concentrations by appropriate dilution with the mobile phase.
3. Include at least two levels of quality control samples in each
analytical run. Quality control samples should consist of known
concentrations of tryptophan similar to expected sample values.
6.2 Sample Preparation
1. Thaw plasma samples if previously frozen.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Pipette the required volume of plasma into clean tubes.
4. If necessary, dilute the plasma samples with an appropriate
volume of mobile phase.
6.3 HPLC Analysis
1. Prepare the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase at a flow
rate of 1 mL/min.
3. Set the detector to monitor fluorescence at an excitation
wavelength of 285 nm and emission wavelength of 365 nm.
4. Inject an appropriate volume of calibration standards, quality
control samples, and plasma samples (typically 10-20 µL) into
the HPLC system.
5. Record retention times and peak areas for all injections.
6.4 Data Analysis and Calculation
1. Construct a calibration curve by plotting the peak area of each
calibration standard against its concentration.
2. Determine the concentration of tryptophan in each plasma
sample by interpolating the sample’s peak area on the
calibration curve.
3. Verify that quality control samples fall within acceptable limits to
validate the batch run.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Analyze quality control materials with each batch of samples to
ensure accuracy and precision of the assay.
2. All quality control data must be reviewed prior to reporting
patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Ensure all patient results are evaluated against quality control
data and within acceptable method performance criteria.
2. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Ensure critical values, if applicable, receive appropriate
notification and documentation per laboratory policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to site-specific reference intervals for tryptophan in plasma.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the instrument and reagent manuals for limitations specific to
the HPLC method of tryptophan measurement.

This SOP is to be reviewed annually with any procedural updates
documented. Any deviations must be reported and corrected
immediately.
