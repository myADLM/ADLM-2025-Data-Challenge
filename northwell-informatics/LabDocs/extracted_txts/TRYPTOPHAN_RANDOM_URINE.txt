Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Tryptophan,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the accurate and precise
analysis of tryptophan in random urine samples. This ensures results
are reliable for diagnostic purposes or research studies that require
the measurement of urine tryptophan.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained and certified laboratory personnel to
follow this protocol. The quality control process must be handled by
designated supervisors to maintain and verify the accuracy of results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Random urine
Acceptable Container: Standard urine collection container.
Volume Required: Minimum 10 mL of urine.
Stability:
• Freshly voided samples must be analyzed within 24 hours if
stored at room temperature (20-25°C).
• If refrigerated (2-8°C), specimens are stable for up to 72 hours.
• If frozen (-20°C or colder), specimens are stable for up to 3
months. Ensure sample is thawed and brought to room
temperature prior to analysis.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens with particulate matter (suggest filtration or
centrifugation before analysis)
• Specimens in containers that are not properly labeled
• Specimens with hemolysis (check specimen integrity)
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Mobile Phase: Acetonitrile and water (or other appropriate solvent
system)
• Calibration Standards for Tryptophan: Range 5 - 100 µg/mL
• Internal Standard (if applicable)
• Quality Control Materials: High, Medium, and Low concentration
levels
• Specific Column: Suitable HPLC or LC-MS/MS column for amino
acid analysis
• Sample Tubes
• Analytical Balance
• Centrifuge
5. EQUIPMENT
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS)
• Sonicator (if required for sample preparation)
• Vortex Mixer
• Pipettes (calibrated)
• Water bath (if sample preparation involves heating)
• Temperature monitored refrigerator/freezer
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge urine samples at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any precipitates or debris.
2. Aliquot: Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean sample
tube.
3. Dilution: If the sample concentration is expected to be high,
dilute with appropriate solvent.
4. Internal Standard (Optional): Add predetermined volume of
internal standard solution to each sample.
5. Vortex Mixing: Vortex the mixture briefly to ensure proper
mixing.
HPLC Settings:
• Column: Use a specific column designed for amino acid analysis.
• Mobile Phase: Use a gradient of acetonitrile-water system or
another optimized solvent system.
• Flow Rate: Set appropriate flow rate (e.g., 0.5 ml/min).
• Injection Volume: Typically 10-20 µL.
• Detection: Set detection wavelength suitable for tryptophan (e.g.,
280 nm).
LC-MS/MS Settings (if applicable):
• Ion Source: Electrospray Ionization (ESI) in positive mode.
• MS Conditions: Optimize for tryptophan.
• Analyte Transitions: Set to specific mass transitions for
tryptophan.
Analysis:
1. Calibration: Prepare calibration standards across the range
from low to high concentration to construct a calibration curve.
2. Quality Control: Run QC materials at High, Medium, and Low
concentrations.
3. Sample Analysis: Inject prepared urine sample into the HPLC
or LC-MS/MS system.
4. Data Acquisition: Acquire and analyze data with appropriate
software to quantify tryptophan.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Daily QC: Include at least one set of QC samples (High,
Medium, Low) in each run.
2. Calibration Standards: Ensure calibration standards bracket
the analyzed samples.
3. Run Duplicates: Run duplicate samples and average results
for reliable data.
4. Review Control Charts: Ensure QC results are within
acceptable control limits. If outside, troubleshoot and correct
before reporting results.
5. Instrument Maintenance: Regularly maintain and calibrate the
HPLC/LC-MS/MS instruments.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review: Ensure all data is reviewed and verified by a certified
technologist.
2. Entry: Enter results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) in the format:
◦ Tryptophan, Random, Urine: x.xxx µg/mL
3. Critical Values: Immediately report any results outside of the
reference range to the prescribing clinician.
