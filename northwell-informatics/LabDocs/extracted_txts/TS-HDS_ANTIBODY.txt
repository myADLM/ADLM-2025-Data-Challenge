Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
TS-HDS Antibody
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and efficient analysis of TS-
HDS antibody in patient samples in order to facilitate diagnosis and
treatment planning. This SOP defines the steps for evaluating and
generating results to ensure high-quality and dependable results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel who are responsible
for performing TS-HDS Antibody tests as part of the laboratory's
diagnostic services.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible for the
following:
• Performing the TS-HDS antibody test according to the outlined
procedure.
• Maintaining equipment and reagents used in the testing process.
• Documenting all procedures, observations, and results accurately.
• Reporting any inconsistencies or outliers observed during testing
to the supervising authority.
4. REQUIRED MATERIALS
Equipment:
• Microplate Reader
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (single and multichannel)
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator
Reagents and Supplies:
• TS-HDS Antibody ELISA Kit
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
• Calibrators/standards
• Control samples (positive and negative controls)
• Distilled Water
• Sample collection tubes
5. DEFINITION
TS-HDS (Thrombospondin Type 1 motif, Human Disintegrin and
Metalloproteinase) antibody analysis is a specialized immunological
test used to detect specific autoantibodies in patient samples, which
can be pertinent for diagnosing certain autoimmune conditions.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analysis Preparation:
1. Preparation of Samples:
◦ Collect patient serum samples in accordance with standard
clinical and laboratory practices.
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C if not tested immediately or freeze
samples at -20°C for extended storage.
◦ Before analysis, allow frozen samples to thaw completely
and mix thoroughly.
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare Wash Buffer by diluting the concentrated wash
buffer with distilled water as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all necessary reagents and calibrators according to
kit instructions.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Add 100µL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples to
the appropriate wells.
◦ Seal the plate with a microplate seal and incubate for 60
minutes at room temperature on a microplate shaker.
3. Washing:
◦ Carefully remove the seal and wash the wells 5 times with
the prepared Wash Buffer. Completely remove any
remaining liquid by blotting the wells on absorbent paper.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100µL of enzyme conjugate solution to each well. Seal
the plate and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature
on a microplate shaker.
5. Washing:
◦ Perform the wash step again as previously described.
6. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100µL of Substrate Solution to each well. Incubate the
plate in the dark at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100µL of Stop Solution to each well. Tap the plate
gently to ensure thorough mixing.
8. Reading:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader
within 15 minutes of stopping the reaction.
C) Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls with each run.
• If controls fall outside of the expected ranges, do not proceed with
patient sample results. Identify and resolve any issues before re-
running the assay.
7. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards versus their concentrations. Use the curve to determine
the concentration of TS-HDS antibodies in the patient samples.
• Results can be calculated manually or with the help of specialized
software provided with the microplate reader.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results from the microplate reader.
• Double-check all entries against the standard curve for accuracy.
• Transcribe results to the laboratory information system (LIS) and
flag any abnormal values according to established reference
intervals.
• Consult with a supervisor for results that are anomalous or show
unexpected patterns.
9. REFERENCE RANGES
• Negative: <20 U/mL
• Borderline: 20-30 U/mL
• Positive: >30 U/mL
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that all reagents are stored and handled according to
manufacturer’s instructions to prevent degradation.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results.
• Ensure that the assay is performed at room temperature within
the specified time frames to maintain consistency and accuracy.
