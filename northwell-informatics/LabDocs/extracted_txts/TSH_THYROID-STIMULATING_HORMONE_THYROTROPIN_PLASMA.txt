Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone
(TSH) Measurement in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
accurate and reliable measurement of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone
(TSH) in plasma samples in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated and trained laboratory
technologists to perform TSH testing according to this SOP.
• All laboratory staff must adhere to this protocol to ensure the
accuracy and validity of the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Container: EDTA (Lavender-top) tubes or heparinized
(green-top) tubes
• Volume: Minimum volume of 1 mL required
• Handling: Specimens should be centrifuged and plasma
separated within 30 minutes of collection. Plasma should be
stored at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 48 hours or at
-20°C or lower for longer storage.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott
Architect)
• TSH Assay Reagent Kits (specific to the analyzer in use)
• Calibrators specific for TSH
• Quality Control (QC) materials: Two levels (e.g., low and high)
• Sample cups/racks
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC materials at the start of each shift, with each assay
calibration, and when a new reagent lot is used.
• Evaluate QC results according to established laboratory criteria.
All QC results must be within the specified ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• Document all QC activities including corrective actions taken if
out-of-control results are observed.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration
1. Setup the Analyzer
◦ Power on the automated analyzer and allow it to complete
its self-check.
◦ Perform any user-required maintenance as indicated in the
analyzer manual.
2. Load Reagents
◦ Load TSH reagent kits, calibrators, and necessary
consumables specific to the analyzer in use.
◦ Allow reagents to reach room temperature if stored
refrigerated, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Calibrate the Assay
◦ Perform assay calibration using appropriate TSH calibrators.
◦ Verify calibration by checking the calibration curve and
ensuring it meets acceptable criteria.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Specimen Verification
◦ Verify the received plasma samples are suitable for testing
(proper volume, no hemolysis, proper storage).
2. Loading Samples
◦ Load plasma samples into the analyzer ensuring proper
patient identification and labeling.
3. Running the Assay
◦ Select the TSH test protocol from the analyzer menu.
◦ Run patient samples according to the automated analyzer’s
operating procedure.
◦ Monitor the assay run for any flags or error messages.
4. Result Validation
◦ Review assay results for each patient sample.
◦ Repeat testing if flags or error messages indicate possible
assay issues.
◦ Record and document results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Interval: The laboratory-established reference range
for TSH should be included in the report.
• Critical Values: Any critical value should be communicated
immediately to the ordering physician as per the laboratory's
critical results policy.
• Document results review by the laboratory technologist including
any comments necessary for atypical findings or repeat testing.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure all samples are free from significant hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus which could interfere with TSH measurement.
• Consult the TSH assay kit insert or analyzer manual for specific
interferences and limitations.
• Ensure the proper storage and handling of reagents to maintain
assay integrity.

By adhering strictly to this protocol, laboratory staff will ensure the
accurate and consistent measurement of TSH in plasma samples,
contributing to quality patient care and reliable diagnostic outcomes.
