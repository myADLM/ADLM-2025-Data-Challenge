Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for TSH
WITH REFLEX, PLASMA
1. PRINCIPLE AND PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for
generating results for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) with reflex
testing in plasma samples. Reflex testing involves automatically
conducting an additional test based on the results of the initial test if
certain criteria are met. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable
assessment of TSH levels and subsequent reflex testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Collect plasma in a vacutainer tube with EDTA or lithium
heparin.
◦ Specimens should be centrifuged within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Plasma should be separated from cells as soon as possible
and stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens received in tubes without anticoagulant.
◦ Specimens that have not been centrifuged within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Specimens exhibiting signs of hemolysis or improper
handling.
◦ Specimens with insufficient sample volume (less than 1 mL).
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas
e411)
◦ Reagents specific for TSH assay
◦ Reflex test reagents as needed (e.g., Free T4 reagent)
◦ Calibrators and controls for TSH and reflex testing
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Storage tubes for plasma samples
3. PROCEDURE
A. Initial TSH Testing:
1. Load plasma sample into the sample rack of the
automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Select TSH assay on the analyzer software.
3. Ensure quality control samples are run and within
acceptable limits.
4. Begin the analysis according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
5. Retrieve the TSH result from the analyzer once the assay
is completed.
B. Reflex Testing Criteria:
1. If the TSH result is within the normal range (typically 0.4 -
4.0 mIU/L), no further testing is required.
2. If TSH result is outside the normal range:
▪ Elevated (> 4.0 mIU/L): Perform reflex testing for Free
T4.
▪ Decreased (< 0.4 mIU/L): Perform reflex testing for
Free T4.
C. Reflex Testing (Free T4):
1. Load the same plasma sample into the sample rack for
reflex testing.
2. Select Free T4 assay on the analyzer software.
3. Ensure quality control samples are run and within
acceptable limits.
4. Begin the analysis according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
5. Retrieve the Free T4 result from the analyzer once the
assay is completed.
6. Record both TSH and Free T4 results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run appropriate calibrators and controls for TSH and Free
T4 assays daily and with each new lot of reagents.
◦ Ensure all quality control materials are within the acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
◦ Document all quality control results in the QC log as per
site-specific guidelines.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify TSH results in the LIS.
◦ If reflex testing was performed, review and verify Free T4
results.
◦ Report the final results according to site-specific guidelines.
◦ For critical values, follow protocols for immediate
notifications to healthcare providers.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ TSH: 0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L
◦ Free T4: Refer to the specific assay used for reference
range (typically around 0.8 - 2.7 ng/dL)
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s package inserts for TSH and Free
T4 assays for individual test limitations and interferences.
