Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TTF41 (SPT24) + P40
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the detailed steps for processing and staining
slides for TTF41 (SPT24) and P40 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This SOP specifically addresses the
technical component of staining, excluding any diagnostic
interpretation.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in IHC
techniques, working in the diagnostic histopathology department.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all histotechnicians and laboratory scientists
performing the TTF41 (SPT24) + P40 immunostaining to adhere to
this SOP to ensure consistency and accuracy.
1. DEFINITIONS
TTF41 (SPT24): Thyroid Transcription Factor-1, a marker commonly
used in the identification of lung and thyroid tumors.
P40: DeltaNP63, a marker primarily used to identify squamous cells
in various tissue types.
Immunostaining: A laboratory process that uses antibodies to detect
specific antigens in tissue sections, enabling visualization of proteins
within cells.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Negative Control slides
• Positive Control slides specific for TTF41 and P40
• Immunostaining instrument (if automated) or manual staining
setup
• Primary antibodies: TTF41 (SPT24) and P40
• Secondary antibodies
• Detection system (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Slides
• Xylene or xylene substitutes
• Ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Antigen retrieval solution (if required)
• Wash buffer (PBS or TBS)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Slides
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into 4-5 µm sections
using a microtome.
◦ Place sections onto charged slides and ensure proper
labeling.
2. Drying:
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour or overnight at 37°C to
ensure adherence of the tissue sections.
6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene or xylene substitutes (three
changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Hydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%) and then water.
6.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution.
◦ Use a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath to
maintain the solution at the required temperature (typically
98-100°C) for 20-30 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
6.4 Immunostaining Procedure
If using an automated staining system, load slides, reagents, and
select the appropriate program for TTF41 and P40 staining.
If performing manual staining, follow the steps below:
1. Blocking:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes (if using HRP
detection).
2. Primary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply primary antibody (TTF41 and P40) to the appropriate
slides.
◦ Incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or as
recommended by the antibody manufacturer.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in wash buffer (PBS or TBS) for 5 minutes
(three changes).
4. Secondary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes as recommended by the
manufacturer's protocol.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in wash buffer for 5 minutes (three changes).
6. Detection/Visualization:
◦ Apply detection system (e.g., DAB) and incubate until the
desired color intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes.
8. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides by running them through an ethanol series
and xylene.
◦ Apply a coverslip using a suitable mounting medium.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Include positive and negative controls on each staining run to
ensure the staining procedure is functioning properly.
11. Review control slides to confirm appropriate staining intensity
and specificity.
12. RESULT REPORTING
• Document all steps, reagents, and incubation times.
• Record any deviations from the protocol and associated reasons.
• Note the acceptance or need to repeat the staining based on
control results.

1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP should be reviewed annually or when there is a change in
procedure or reagents. Approved by the Laboratory Manager and
Medical Director.
