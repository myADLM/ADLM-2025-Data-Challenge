STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to detail the
analytical steps involved in generating results for TTR
(Transthyretin) gene full gene analysis to ensure accuracy,
reproducibility, and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technologists to
perform and document the TTR gene analysis according to this
protocol.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to review and
approve the final results.
1. SCOPE This protocol applies to the processing and analysis of
specimens received for TTR gene full gene analysis.
2. DEFINITIONS TTR (Transthyretin) Gene: The gene that
provides the instructions for producing the protein transthyretin,
which is involved in the transport of the thyroid hormone
thyroxine and retinol-binding protein.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood (EDTA tube) or saliva collected
in an approved collection kit.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 3-5 mL of peripheral blood or 2
mL of saliva.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and are
stable for up to 7 days.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit)
• PCR reagents (e.g., Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific for
TTR gene)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis supplies
• Sanger Sequencing reagents or Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) platform
1. EQUIPMENT
• PCR machine (Thermal Cycler)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV transilluminator
• Automated Sequencer (e.g., ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer) or NGS
system
1. PROCEDURE A) DNA Extraction:
2. Use the DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic DNA from the
specimen.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of the isolated DNA using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop) and ensure that the A260/
A280 ratio is between 1.8 and 2.0.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Design primers to amplify all exons and flanking intronic regions
of the TTR gene.
2. Set up the PCR reactions using the following components:
◦ Template DNA: 100 ng
◦ Forward and Reverse primers: 0.2 µM each
◦ dNTPs: 0.2 mM each
◦ Taq Polymerase: 0.5 U
◦ PCR buffer: 1X
◦ MgCl2: 1.5 mM
◦ Nuclease-free water: to make up the final volume (typically
25 µL)
3. Cycle the reaction in a PCR machine using the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (annealing
temperature specific to primers)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Run the PCR products on a 1.5-2.0% agarose gel stained with
an appropriate DNA stain (e.g., ethidium bromide or GelRed).
2. Visualize the bands under UV light and document the gel
image.
D) Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit or
ExoSAP-IT.
2. Perform sequencing using Sanger sequencing or NGS as
follows:
◦ For Sanger sequencing: Use the purified PCR product as a
template for the sequencing reaction and run on an
automated sequencer.
◦ For NGS: Prepare the sequencing library according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and run on an NGS platform.
3. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULT GENERATION A) Sequence
Analysis:
4. Analyze the sequencing data using appropriate software (e.g.,
SeqScape, Chromas, or NGS data analysis pipelines).
5. Align the sequences to the reference TTR gene sequence (e.g.,
NM_000371.3) to identify variants.
B) Variant Interpretation:
1. Classify identified variants according to established guidelines
(e.g., ACMG/AMP guidelines).
2. Document and review all findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
C) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
ensure the accuracy of the test.
2. Review and document any quality control issues observed
during the analysis.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review the analyzed data and interpretation by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
5. Verify the results and generate the final report using the LIS.
6. Ensure the final report is co-signed by a laboratory supervisor
or director before release to the ordering clinician.
