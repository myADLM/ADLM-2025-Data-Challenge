Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Tuberous Sclerosis
Gene Panel Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Tuberous Sclerosis Gene Panel. This panel
is designed to detect mutations in genes associated with Tuberous
Sclerosis Complex (TSC), including TSC1 and TSC2. The protocol
covers the processes from DNA extraction to data analysis and result
interpretation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
the procedure as described. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
manager to ensure all staff are adequately trained and competent in
these procedures.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood in EDTA tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL.
• Storage: Keep at 2-8°C if processing is delayed. Samples should
ideally be processed within 24 hours of collection.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated DNA Extractor (e.g., QIAsymphony)
• PCR Thermocycler
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq)
• Reagents for DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing
• TSC Gene Panel Kit
• Standard laboratory consumables (pipettes, tips, microcentrifuge
tubes, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction
1. Load EDTA tube into the automated DNA extractor.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction.
3. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
4. Dilute DNA to the required concentration for library preparation.
5.2 Library Preparation
1. Prepare the DNA library using the TSC Gene Panel Kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the prepared library using a
bioanalyzer or equivalent device.
3. Pool libraries as per protocol.
5.3 Sequencing
1. Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS platform according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set up the sequencing run and initiate the process.
5.4 Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline for
analysis.
2. Perform read alignment to the reference genome, variant
calling, and annotation.
3. Utilize software tools (e.g., GATK, Annovar) as per standard
bioinformatics guidelines.
5.5 Result Interpretation
1. Review and validate variants using appropriate databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD).
2. Interpret pathogenicity based on ACMG/AMP guidelines.
3. Compile a comprehensive report detailing the findings.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of DNA
extraction, library preparation, and sequencing.
2. Run internal quality controls for sequencing, including standard
reference materials.
3. Document and investigate any deviations from expected
results.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If DNA yield is insufficient, repeat extraction ensuring optimal
technique.
• If library quality is poor, verify reagent integrity and repeat library
preparation.
• In case of sequencing failure, review run parameters, reagent
volumes, and possible contamination sources. Correct and repeat
the run if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reviewed by a certified clinical geneticist.
2. Final validated results are entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
3. Reports are generated and communicated to the referring
clinician.
9. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain comprehensive records of all steps including:
• DNA extraction logs
• Library preparation and sequencing logs
• Data analysis records
• QC logs and results
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction, library preparation,
and sequencing kits.
• ACMG/AMP guidelines for variant interpretation.
• Relevant scientific literature and databases for variant annotation
and interpretation.
