1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Tubular Reabsorption of Phosphorus
(TRP) using random urine and serum specimens. These results
are crucial for assessing renal tubular function and phosphorus
reabsorption capacity.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting the results accurately according to this
protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types:
• Serum: Preferred specimen; collected in SST (serum separator
tube) or red-top tube without anticoagulant.
• Urine: Random urine sample collected without preservatives.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum: Stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature (18-26°C),
4 days refrigerated (2-8°C), or longer when frozen (-20°C or
below).
• Urine: Stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature (18-26°C),
or up to 48 hours refrigerated (2-8°C).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed serum samples.
• Urine or serum specimens exhibiting bacterial contamination
(evident by turbid appearance, unpleasant odor, or presence of
bacteria under microscopic evaluation).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Phosphorus reagent kits (traceable to NIST standards).
• Atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) or suitable
alternative.
• Calibrators and controls (both high and low phosphorus
concentrations).
• Urine analysis cups.
• Serum separator tubes (SST).
• Precision micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Appropriate labelling and documentation supplies.
1. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Ensure the AAS is calibrated with phosphorus standards before
use.
• Run quality control specimens (both high and low) with each
batch of patient specimens to ensure the accuracy of the results.
Serum Phosphorus Measurement:
• Prepare the serum sample: Centrifuge the blood collection tube to
separate the serum.
• Pipette a specified volume of serum (as per kit instructions) into
the assay tubes.
• Add phosphorus reagent and incubate as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Measure the absorbance using AAS.
• Record the results concentrations in mg/dL or mmol/L.
Urine Phosphorus Measurement:
• Pipette a specified volume of random urine into the assay tubes.
• Add phosphorus reagent and incubate as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Measure the absorbance using AAS.
• Record the results concentrations in mg/dL or mmol/L.
Creatinine Measurement (if required):
• To understand reabsorption efficiency, measure the creatinine
levels in both serum and urine using a traceable reagent kit and
calibrated analyzer following standard biochemical analysis
methods.
Calculation of TRP:
Use the following formula to determine the Tubular Reabsorption of
Phosphorus: [ \text{TRP} = \left( 1 - \frac{\text{(Urine Phosphorus)}
\times (\text{Serum Creatinine})}{(\text{Serum Phosphorus}) \times
\text{(Urine Creatinine)}} \right) * 100 ]
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Ranges and Interpretation:
• Normal Range for TRP: 80-95%
• Deviations from the normal range may indicate renal tubular
dysfunction and should be reviewed by the laboratory supervisor.
Result Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
complete with reference ranges.
• Verify results and ensure no transcription errors before submitting
them for clinical review.
Critical Values:
• Phosphorus levels below 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L) or above 7.0
mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L) in serum should be considered critical and
immediately communicated to the patient's healthcare provider.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
QC Practices:
• Always use freshly prepared reagent solutions.
• Conduct regular maintenance and calibration of the AAS
equipment as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Regularly participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
Troubleshooting:
• If QC fails, re-run controls and calibrators. If the problem persists,
check equipment settings, reagent quality, and sample integrity. In
case of equipment malfunction, notify the supervisor and refrain
from releasing patient results.
Method Limitations:
• Ensure accurate sample preparation to avoid dilution or
concentration errors.
• Highly lipemic or icteric samples might interfere with the
phosphorus assay and need appropriate handling or alternative
testing.
