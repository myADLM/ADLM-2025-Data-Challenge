Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Tubulin Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of tubulin antibody testing within the laboratory.
The procedures outlined ensure consistent and accurate results in
compliance with CLIA requirements.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the tubulin
antibody tests and documenting results. Supervisors must ensure
proper training, adherence to the SOP, and implementation of
corrective actions as needed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Collect blood in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
Allow the sample to clot for at least 30 minutes and then
centrifuge to separate the serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis
• Specimens with lipemia
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or have damage that
compromises testing integrity
Specimen Storage:
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if testing is within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated ELISA Reader or immunoassay analyzer
• Tubulin Antibody ELISA Kit (specific brand as per laboratory’s
usage)
• Calibrators and controls provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Plate washer (if applicable)
• Sample tubes and containers
• Personal protective equipment
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Set up the ELISA reader/immunoassay analyzer according to
manufacturer specifications.
2. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature prior to use.
3. Label and arrange sample tubes appropriately.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration of the ELISA reader/immunoassay analyzer
using the calibrators included in the tubulin antibody kit,
following manufacturer guidelines.
2. Run quality controls at the beginning of each testing batch to
ensure system accuracy.
C. Sample Testing
1. Add calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples to
designated wells on the ELISA plate.
2. Follow the kit manufacturer’s instructions for incubations,
washing steps, and addition of reagents.
3. Incubate the plate as instructed to allow antigen-antibody
reactions to occur.
4. Wash the plate adequately using the plate washer to remove
unbound reagents.
5. Add the substrate solution to develop the color reaction,
incubate as recommended.
6. After stopping the reaction, read the plate on the ELISA reader/
immunoassay analyzer.
D. Result Analysis
1. Review the optical density (OD) readings from the ELISA
reader.
2. Compare the sample OD values against the standard curve
generated from the calibrators.
3. Calculate the concentration of tubulin antibody in the patient
samples based on this comparison.
E. Reporting Results
1. Document results promptly in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Verify and review results following site-specific guidelines.
3. Report any out-of-range, negative or positive findings to the
requesting physician.
F. Troubleshooting
1. If controls are out of range, do not report patient results. Identify
and correct the issue:
◦ Check for reagent expiration or contamination.
◦ Verify proper functioning of equipment.
◦ Repeat the test if necessary.
2. Document all corrective actions taken.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch to ensure the
accuracy of test results.
• Document QC results in the QC log.
• Maintain control measures as per regulatory guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and other sample factors can affect test
accuracy.
• Kit insert should be referred to for specific limitations on tubulin
antibody testing.
