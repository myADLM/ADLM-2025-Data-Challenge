Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating diagnostic test results for Total Unbound Nitrogen (TUNA),
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum samples in the clinical laboratory
setting. The aim is to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists to perform
the procedures outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to this SOP and addressing any issues or
deviations that arise.
3. DEFINITION
TUNA: Total Unbound Nitrogen, an important marker in clinical
diagnostics.
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, commonly used in allergy testing.
Serum: The liquid portion of the blood that is used for various
biochemical analyses.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Total Unbound Nitrogen (TUNA): - Specimen Type: Serum or
heparinized plasma. - Stability: Stable for 7 days at 2-8°C, up to 1
year frozen at -20°C or below.
• Immunoglobulin E (IgE): - Specimen Type: Serum or plasma. -
Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. Longer storage
requires freezing at -20°C or below.
• Serum: - Specimen Type: Serum samples need to be centrifuged
and adequately separated to avoid hemolysis or other
contaminants. - Stability: Store at 2-8°C if analysis is within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer or Immunoassay Analyzer.
• Calibration standards and quality control materials specific to
TUNA, IgE, and general serum analyses.
• Reagents recommended by instrument manufacturers for TUNA
and IgE determinations.
• Disposable pipettes and tubes.
• Centrifuge for serum separation.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Total Unbound Nitrogen (TUNA)
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date and
have been brought to room temperature.
◦ Calibrate the chemistry analyzer as per manufacturer
instructions.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Aliquot an adequate amount of separated serum/plasma.
◦ Load the samples onto the chemistry analyzer according to
the instrument manual.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the TUNA assay on the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that the appropriate calibration and quality control
checks are performed.
◦ Initiate the sample analysis as per instrument protocols.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Review the results generated by the analyzer.
◦ Flag any results that fall outside of the reference or critical
ranges.
◦ Document the results and include any necessary comments
regarding sample quality or assay performance.
5. Troubleshooting:
◦ If results are inconsistent, recalibrate the analyzer and re-
run quality controls.
◦ Consult the instrument troubleshooting guide or
manufacturer support if needed.
B) Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
1. Preparation:
◦ Confirm that reagents are prepared and within expiration.
◦ Perform instrument calibration using provided standards.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Verify the integrity of serum/plasma samples and load them
onto the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the IgE assay on the analyzer.
◦ Verify appropriate calibration and quality control results.
◦ Follow the analyzer protocol to process the samples.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Analyze the results as displayed by the analyzer.
◦ Investigate any abnormal or critical values.
◦ Record the results, ensuring the inclusion of sample
conditions and any deviations from the normal process.
5. Troubleshooting:
◦ Address discrepancies in results by rechecking calibrations
and controls.
◦ Seek assistance from technical support if issues persist.
C) General Serum Analysis
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure that all reagents and equipment are ready and
validated.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Ensure that serum samples are processed promptly to avoid
degradation.
◦ Load the serum samples appropriately onto the analyzer.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the relevant assays for the serum samples.
◦ Conduct the analysis following the specific protocols for
each required test.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Review and interpret the analyzer output.
◦ Ensure that any outliers or unusual results are verified and
commented upon.
5. Troubleshooting:
◦ Re-run tests if initial results are questionable.
◦ Document any corrective actions taken if deviations are
noted in the process.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Perform routine quality control checks before running patient
samples.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
controls fall outside the acceptable ranges.
• Follow a maintenance schedule for calibration and validation of
analyzers.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review by the technologist.
• Document any critical values and follow the set protocols for
reporting them to the relevant clinicians.
• Ensure all results are verified for accuracy and completeness
before validation.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines and user manuals for the chemistry and
immunoassay analyzers.
• Quality control protocols as per the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
• Maintenance and calibration logs as per laboratory standards.
10. NOTES
Any deviations from this SOP should be documented and addressed
promptly. Continuous training and competency assessments for staff
involved in these procedures will be conducted to maintain high
standards of laboratory practice.
This SOP offers a comprehensive guide for generating TUNA, IgE,
and serum analysis results, ensuring accuracy and consistency in
laboratory diagnostics.
