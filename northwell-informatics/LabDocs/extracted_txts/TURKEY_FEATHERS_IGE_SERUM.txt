Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase: Turkey
Feathers, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable measurement of IgE antibodies
specific to turkey feathers in human serum samples following
standardized laboratory protocols and quality control measures.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to perform and
document the analytical process for serum IgE testing as per this
SOP. This includes handling instruments, reagents, and samples
correctly, maintaining temperature control, and adhering to specific
procedural steps to produce accurate results. Supervisors are
responsible for the review and validation of the results, including any
necessary troubleshooting and corrective actions.
3. DEFINITIONS
IgE – Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
responses. Serum – The liquid part of the blood used for testing after
coagulation. Allergen-specific IgE – IgE antibodies that react
specifically to a particular allergen, in this case, turkey feathers.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: 1-2 mL of serum collected in a red-top or serum-
separator tube (SST).
• Handling/Storage: Serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C
if not analyzed immediately. Freeze at -20°C if delayed for more
than 72 hours. Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable: Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) reader
• ELISA plates (96-well format)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Incubators set at 37°C
• Wash buffer (PBS-Tween or equivalent)
• Turkey feathers allergen-specific IgE ELISA kit (including
calibrators, controls, substrate, stop solution, and assay buffer)
• Timer
• Documentation logs
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Plate Preparation
• Arrange and label the ELISA plate(s) according to the number of
standards, controls, and patient samples.
• Ensure all reagents are brought to room temperature before
starting the assay.
6.2. Sample and Control Preparation
• Thaw frozen serum samples and controls at room temperature.
Mix by gentle inversion.
• Prepare serial dilutions of calibrators per kit instructions.
6.3. Assay Procedure
• Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to designated
wells in duplicate.
• Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
• Wash the wells 3-5 times with wash buffer.
• Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugate to each well.
• Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
• Wash the wells again 3-5 times with wash buffer.
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 15-30 minutes.
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
6.4. Reading and Calculation
• Read the plate using the ELISA reader at the wavelength
specified in the kit instructions, typically 450 nm with a 620 nm
reference filter.
• Generate a standard curve from the absorbance readings of the
calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of turkey feathers-specific IgE in
patient samples based on the standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least one positive control and one negative control with
each batch of tests.
• Acceptable control ranges must fall within the manufacturer's
specifications.
• Utilize internal and external quality control programs for ongoing
quality assurance.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and document results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• If an IgE result is exceptionally high or low, ensure repeated
testing to verify accuracy and notify the clinician if necessary.
• Reference Interval: Interpretation must adhere to the guidelines
provided in the kit insert, typically denoted by international units
(IU/mL).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High potential for interference due to hemolysis, lipemia, or
improper storage of samples.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens may occur; consult kit insert
for specific details.

immunoassay procedures.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps are meticulously documented in the appropriate
logs, including reagent lot numbers, sample IDs, control results,
and any deviations from protocol.
• Maintain copies of all associated Data Sheets, Calibration Curves,
and QC Logs.
This SOP must be reviewed annually or as per updating of standard
practices, and approved by laboratory management for compliance
and improvements.
Note: This protocol assumes familiarity with general laboratory
practices. Always follow specific institutional and manufacturer
guidelines.
