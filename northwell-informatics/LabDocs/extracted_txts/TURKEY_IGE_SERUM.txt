Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TURKEY, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of Turkey-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples using the [insert relevant
method name, e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA] assay. The protocol outlines
the necessary steps, equipment, and procedures to accurately
generate results.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory staff involved in performing
Turkey-specific IgE assays are responsible for following this SOP.
Lab supervisors must ensure that appropriate quality control
measures are taken, and any deviations from this protocol are
documented and addressed promptly.
1. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top
tube.
• Centrifuge and separate serum from the clot within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store separated serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer
storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens received in other types of collection tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparin) without validation.
• Samples not stored according to specifications (e.g., not
refrigerated or frozen properly).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• [Insert method name] Analyzer
• Turkey-specific IgE assay kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Reagent grade water or buffer solution
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Quality control material (positive and negative controls)
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Pre-Analytical:
1. Verify that the specimen meets acceptable criteria.
2. Ensure all equipment, reagents, and supplies are ready and
within their expiration date.
B. Analytical:
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Run calibration verification tests using quality control
materials.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix
gently.
◦ Centrifuge samples briefly to ensure clarity if necessary.
◦ Label all samples clearly with barcode to be used in the
analyzer.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Load the samples into the designated positions of the
analyzer.
◦ Ensure proper placement of Quality Control (QC) samples in
the analyzer for each run.
4. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay protocol on the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Monitor the assay run for any alerts or errors and resolve
them promptly.
◦ Print or save the generated results.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative control samples with each batch
of patient samples.
◦ Ensure that QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
◦ Document all QC outcomes and take corrective actions if
necessary.
C. Post-Analytical:
1. Review Results:
◦ Verify all control and patient sample results for accuracy.
◦ Repeat analysis if QC fails or results are questionable.
2. Documentation:
◦ Verify and document the assay run, noting any deviations,
interventions, or anomalies encountered during the run.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and review them for accuracy.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Release results to the clinician after review and verification.
◦ Notify the clinician of any critical values immediately as per
the laboratory’s protocol for critical results.
4. Sample Storage:
◦ Store remaining serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or
at -20°C for long term, if further testing is required.
5. Maintenance:
◦ Perform regular maintenance of the analyzer as per
manufacturer’s recommendations.
◦ Document all maintenance activities thoroughly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Analyze internal quality control samples regularly to ensure
ongoing accuracy and precision.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs as available.
• Review and document all quality control data periodically and
initiate corrective actions when outliers are detected.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
Reference Intervals:
• The standard reference range will be defined based on the
specific method used and should be available within the method
documentation (e.g., product insert).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the method insert for limitations regarding specific
interferences, cross-reactivity, and sensitivity of the assay.

Include example logs, forms, and relevant excerpts from method
manuals as appendices to this SOP as needed.
