Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Turkey IgG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide the detailed process for the analytical phase in the
generation of results for Turkey IgG (Immunoglobulin G) testing. This
procedure is intended to ensure standardized, accurate, and reliable
results in all tests performed.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing
the Turkey IgG test according to this SOP. All staff must ensure
adherence to this procedure to maintain consistency and accuracy in
test results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP covers the analytical phase from receiving the accessioned
specimen to generating the final test results for Turkey IgG.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• 2 mL of serum obtained from a blood sample collected and
processed within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimen should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately
and must be analyzed within 48 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens stored longer than 48 hours without proper
refrigeration.
• Specimens with insufficient volume for analysis.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Turkey IgG ELISA Kit (Commercially available, store as per
manufacturer's instructions)
• Calibrators and Controls (Included in the ELISA Kit)
• Wash Buffer, Substrate Solution, and Stopping Solution (Provided
in the ELISA Kit)
Equipment:
• ELISA Microplate Reader with 450 nm filter
• Automated Microplate Washer (optional)
• Precision Pipettes (single and multichannel)
• Timer
• Incubator set at 37°C
Supplies:
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Absorbent paper
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare the Wash Buffer according to the kit instructions.
3. Set up the ELISA Reader to the correct parameters for the
Turkey IgG assay.
6.2. Analytical Method
1. Label the microplate wells and assign calibrators, controls, and
specimens.
2. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples
into appropriate wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Wash the plate: a. Manually: Decant the contents and fill wells
with Wash Buffer, repeat wash cycle 4 times. b. Automated
Washer: Follow manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Add 100 µL of Enzyme Conjugate into each well.
6. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Repeat the washing step as described above.
8. Add 100 µL of Substrate Solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
9. Add 50 µL of Stop Solution to each well.
10. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader
within 10 minutes after adding the Stop Solution.
6.3. Quality Control
1. Run quality controls (Positive and Negative) with every batch of
tests performed.
2. Verify that control values are within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
6.4. Reporting Results
1. Enter the absorbance readings into the provided software or
manual calculation sheet.
2. Determine the concentration of Turkey IgG using the calibration
curve generated from the calibrators’ absorbance values.
3. Compare patient results to the reference intervals:
◦ Normal: 5 – 15 mg/L
◦ Elevated: > 15 mg/L
4. Verify and validate the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus might interfere with assay results.
• Specimens must be tested within the stability period to ensure
accurate results.
• Ensure proper incubation times to avoid false results.
