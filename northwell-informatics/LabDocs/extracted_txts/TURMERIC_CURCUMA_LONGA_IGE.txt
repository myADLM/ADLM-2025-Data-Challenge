Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Turmeric
(Curcuma Longa) IgE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis of turmeric
(Curcuma longa) IgE antibodies in patient sera to ensure accurate
and reliable results. The purpose is to guide laboratory personnel
through the analytical phase of conducting the test, monitoring quality
control, handling specimens, and reporting results appropriately.
Responsibility: All laboratory technologists performing the turmeric
IgE antibody test must adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of
the lab's quality control manager to ensure compliance with this SOP
and to monitor the accuracy and precision of test results.
1. DEFINITION
Turmeric IgE test is an immunoassay used to detect and quantify IgE
antibodies specific to turmeric allergen in a patient's serum.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required per test. Collect
blood specimens using a standard venipuncture technique and
process according to the laboratory's serum processing protocols.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than SST
(serum separator tubes).
• Incorrectly labeled, expired, or leaking specimens.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA reader (microwell plate reader)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• ELISA Turmeric IgE test kit containing capture antibodies,
enzyme-labeled detection antibodies, and appropriate controls
• Wash buffer
• Substrate and stop solution
• Laboratory timer
• Plate shaker
Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation: a. Prepare reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions included in the ELISA test kit. b.
Make sure all reagents have reached room temperature before
use.
2. Plate Preparation: a. Set up wells for standards, controls, and
patient samples as per the plate layout provided with the kit. b.
Add 100 µL of diluted standards, controls, and patient sera to
the designated wells.
3. Incubation: a. Cover the plate with the provided adhesive seal.
b. Incubate the plate at room temperature or as specified in the
kit instructions for the specified incubation period (typically 1-2
hours).
4. Washing: a. Wash the plates according to the kit protocol.
Generally, perform 3-5 wash cycles using the wash buffer to
remove unbound substances. b. Ensure no residual liquid is left
in the wells after the final wash.
5. Detection Antibody: a. Add 100 µL of enzyme-labeled
detection antibody to each well. b. Incubate the plate again
under conditions specified in the kit instructions. c. Perform
washing steps as described above.
6. Substrate Solution: a. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to
each well. b. Incubate the plate for the time specified or until
color development occurs. c. Avoid prolonged exposure to light
during this step.
7. Stop Reaction: a. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to
halt the enzymatic reaction. b. The color should change
accordingly, and this indicates the end of the reaction.
8. Reading the Plate: a. Measure the absorbance of each well at
the wavelength specified in the kit (e.g., 450 nm) using the
ELISA reader. b. Record the absorbance values.
9. Calculation of Results: a. Generate the standard curve by
plotting the mean absorbance of the standards against their
corresponding concentrations. b. Determine the concentration
of turmeric IgE in patient samples by interpolating their
absorbance values on the standard curve.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
11. Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch to
validate performance.
12. Ensure consistent calibration of the ELISA reader as per
standard protocols.
13. Adhere to preventive maintenance schedules and performance
checks for equipment.
14. REPORTING RESULTS
15. Verify the accuracy and precision of the results by reviewing the
control values.
16. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
manually verify for consistency.
17. If critical or unexpected results arise, promptly notify the
designated clinical contact or physician.
18. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
19. Report results as IU/mL based on the standard curve.
20. Normal reference range for turmeric IgE will be indicated
according to the latest clinical guidelines and kit instructions.
21. Positive results indicate sensitization to turmeric and need
clinical correlation for diagnosis of turmeric allergy.

This procedure must be reviewed semi-annually and revised as
necessary to maintain compliance with CLIA requirements and to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
This SOP is effective as of [Effective Date] and must be followed by
all personnel performing turmeric (Curcuma longa) IgE testing.
