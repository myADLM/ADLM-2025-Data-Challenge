SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Type and Screen,
Blood
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps to be followed in
the analytical phase of generating results for Type and Screen
testing, ensuring accurate and reliable identification of patient
blood type and screening for atypical antibodies.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing Type and Screen testing and ensuring that the procedures
are followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1. Acceptable Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Specimen volume should be adequate to perform the test:
minimum of 6 mL.
• Ensure proper labeling with patient identification information, date,
and time of collection.
2.2. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted or hemolyzed samples.
• Samples labeled incorrectly or with discrepancies.
• Samples received with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Centrifuge
• Blood Bank Refrigerator and Freezer
• Test tube rack or automated equipment
• Reagent red blood cells (A1 cells, B cells, O cells)
• Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-A,B, Anti-D reagents
• Screening cells (three vials)
• Quality Control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Temperature monitoring logs and traceable thermometers
• Automated blood grouping and antibody screening equipment (if
applicable)
• Incubator (set at 37°C ± 0.5°C)
1. PROCEDURE:
4.1. Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the sample, verify patient identification and
proper labeling.
2. Gently mix the blood sample by inverting it several times to
ensure thorough mixing of anticoagulant and blood cells.
4.2. Forward Typing (ABO & Rh Typing):
1. Label test tubes for each reagent (Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-A,B, Anti-
D) and for controls.
2. Add one drop of patient’s RBCs into each labeled test tube.
3. Add two drops of each respective reagent (Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-
A,B, Anti-D) into the corresponding test tubes.
4. Mix the contents of each tube gently and centrifuge for 20
seconds at 1000-2000 RPM.
5. Resuspend the red cells by gently shaking the tube and
observe for agglutination.
6. Record the results:
◦ Positive agglutination indicates the presence of the
corresponding antigen.
◦ No agglutination indicates the absence of the corresponding
antigen.
4.3. Reverse Typing (Serum/Plasma Group):
1. Label test tubes as A1 cells, B cells, and control.
2. Add two drops of patient’s plasma/serum into each labeled test
tube.
3. Add one drop of A1 cells and B cells into the corresponding test
tubes.
4. Mix the contents of each tube gently and centrifuge for 20
seconds at 1000-2000 RPM.
5. Resuspend the red cells by gently shaking the tube and
observe for agglutination.
6. Record the results:
◦ Positive agglutination indicates the presence of antibodies
against the corresponding cell type.
◦ No agglutination indicates the absence of antibodies.
4.4. Antibody Screening:
1. Label three tubes as Screening Cell 1, Screening Cell 2, and
Screening Cell 3.
2. Add two drops of patient’s plasma/serum to each tube.
3. Add one drop of Screening Cells 1, 2, and 3 to the
corresponding tubes.
4. Mix and incubate all tubes at 37°C for 15 minutes.
5. Following incubation, centrifuge the tubes for 20 seconds at
1000-2000 RPM.
6. Resuspend the red cells by gently shaking the tube and
observe for agglutination.
7. Interpret and record results; the presence of agglutination
indicates a positive screen, suggesting the presence of atypical
antibodies.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control for reagent red blood cells and antisera
daily.
• Include positive and negative controls with each test run.
• Record QC results in the appropriate log.
• Perform corrective action if QC results fall outside acceptable
limits, and notify the supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify all results before releasing them.
• In case of positive antibody screening, further identify the specific
antibody using additional panels as per standard procedures.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• ABO Typing: A, B, AB, or O
• Rh Typing: Positive or Negative
• Antibody Screening: Negative (positive result suggests the
presence of atypical antibodies and requires further identification)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure correct specimen handling and storage.
• Hemolyzed or contaminated specimens may yield inaccurate
results.
• Discrepancies in forward and reverse typing must be resolved
before reporting.
