Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for the Measurement of Tyrophagus
Putrescentiae-Specific IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for the accurate measurement of
IgE antibodies specific to Tyrophagus putrescentiae in serum
samples. The results are used to aid in the diagnosis of allergic
conditions.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff members are responsible for performing the
assay and documenting the results according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the assay is performed
correctly and that all quality control measures are adhered to.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
2.1 Equipment:
• Incubator
• Microcentrifuge
• ELISA reader (with 450 nm filter)
• Pipettes (variable volumes: 10 µL, 100 µL, and 1000 µL)
• Micropipette tips
• Plate washer (optional)
2.2 Reagents:
• Tyrophagus putrescentiae-specific IgE ELISA kit
• Calibrated standards and controls (low, medium, and high)
• Wash buffer (as provided by the kit)
• Substrate solution (e.g., tetramethylbenzidine, TMB)
• Stop solution (e.g., 1M sulfuric acid)
• Sample diluent (as provided by the kit)
• Deionized or distilled water
2.3 Supplies:
• 96-well microtiter plates (as provided by the kit)
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, safety glasses
• Absorbent paper
• Timer
• Data recording logbook or electronic system
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Preparation:
• Ensure all required equipment, reagents, and supplies are
available and within their expiration dates.
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
starting the assay.
• Prepare the wash buffer as per the kit instructions.
3.2 Sample Preparation:
• Mix serum samples thoroughly and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for
10 minutes to remove any particulate matter.
• Use the clear supernatant for the assay.
3.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Coating: If not pre-coated, coat the microtiter plate with the
provided antigen following the kit's instructions. Incubate at 4°C
overnight or at room temperature for the recommended
duration.
2. Washing: Wash the plate 3-5 times with wash buffer. Tap the
plate on absorbent paper to remove any remaining wash buffer.
3. Blocking: Add the provided blocking solution to each well and
incubate according to the kit instructions to prevent non-specific
binding.
4. Washing: Repeat the washing step as outlined above.
5. Adding Standards and Samples: Add 100 µL of standards,
controls, and diluted serum samples (1:10 in sample diluent)
into their respective wells in duplicate.
6. Incubation: Incubate the plate as specified in the kit's
instructions (e.g., 1-2 hours at room temperature).
7. Washing: Wash the plate as previously described.
8. Adding Detection Antibody: Add 100 µL of the detection
antibody into each well. Incubate according to the kit
instructions.
9. Washing: Wash the plate again.
10. Adding Substrate: Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each
well. Incubate in the dark at room temperature until adequate
color development is observed (approximately 15-30 minutes).
11. Stopping the Reaction: Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well
to halt the enzyme-substrate reaction.
12. Reading the Plate: Measure the optical density (OD) of each
well at 450 nm using an ELISA reader within 30 minutes of
stopping the reaction.
3.4 Calculation of Results:
• Create a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their known concentrations.
• Calculate the concentration of Tyrophagus putrescentiae-specific
IgE in the serum samples by interpolating their OD values on the
standard curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the standards and controls in duplicate with each batch of
samples.
• Ensure that the OD values of the controls fall within the expected
ranges. If QC results fall outside expected ranges, repeat the
assay.
• Document all deviations and corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all results, including sample identification, OD readings,
calculated IgE concentrations, and any relevant notes in the data
recording logbook or electronic system.
• Review and verify the results before reporting.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure that all equipment is properly maintained and calibrated.
• Refer to the kit instructions and ELISA reader manual for
troubleshooting common issues such as equipment errors or
inconsistent results.
• Document any issues encountered and actions taken in the
maintenance log.
