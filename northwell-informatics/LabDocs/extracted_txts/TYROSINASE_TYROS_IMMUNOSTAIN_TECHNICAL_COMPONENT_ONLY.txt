Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for TYROSINASE (TYROS)
IMMUNOSTAIN – TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for performing the TYROSINASE
(TYROS) immunostain on tissue sections. This procedure outlines
the steps required for the technical component only, including the
preparation, staining, and quality control measures to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing the
TYROSINASE immunostain to follow this procedure correctly and
consistently. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
that all staff are trained and competent in performing this procedure
and that quality control measures are adhered to.
1. DEFINITIONS
TYROSINASE (TYROS) immunostain: An immunohistochemical
technique used to detect the presence of tyrosinase enzyme in tissue
samples, commonly used to identify melanocytic lesions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Unacceptable specimens: Unfixed tissue, inadequately fixed
tissue, tissue that has been frozen without prior fixation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Adhesive microscope slides
• Deparaffinization reagents (e.g., xylene, ethanol)
• Distilled water
• Immunostaining reagents:
◦ Primary antibody: Anti-Tyrosinase
◦ Secondary antibody: Anti-rabbit/mouse (depending on primary
antibody)
◦ Detection system: HRP-conjugated detection system
◦ Chromogen: DAB or other appropriate chromogen
◦ Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing Tissue Sections
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from the FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath set at 42°C and pick them up
onto adhesive microscope slides.
3. Bake the slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure adhesion of the
tissue to the slide.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 10 minutes,
repeat with fresh xylene.
2. Rehydrate sections through a graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each, followed by a rinse in distilled
water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable method (e.g., heat-
induced epitope retrieval; HIER) in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or
other appropriate buffer.
2. Heat slides in a microwave or pressure cooker as per the
specified protocol.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled
water.
D. Immunostaining
1. Block endogenous peroxidase by incubating slides in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in PBS buffer.
3. Incubate slides with blocking serum for 20 minutes to reduce
non-specific binding.
4. Apply primary antibody (Anti-Tyrosinase) diluted in antibody
diluent to the tissue sections and incubate as recommended
(e.g., 30-60 minutes at room temperature).
5. Rinse slides in PBS buffer.
6. Apply secondary antibody and incubate as recommended (e.g.,
30 minutes at room temperature).
7. Rinse slides in PBS buffer.
8. Apply the HRP-conjugated detection system and incubate for
30 minutes.
9. Rinse slides in PBS buffer.
E. Chromogen Development
1. Apply the chromogen (e.g., DAB) for the time specified by the
manufacturer (e.g., 5-10 minutes) until appropriate staining
intensity is achieved.
2. Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water.
F. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water until clear.
3. Dehydrate sections through a graded ethanol series (70%,
95%, 100%).
4. Clear in xylene and mount coverslips using a permanent
mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of patient
samples.
• Positive control: Skin or melanoma tissue known to express
tyrosinase.
• Negative control: Replacement of primary antibody with non-
immune serum or PBS.
• Document all control results and ensure they meet expected
outcomes before reporting patient results.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Ensure staining is clearly visible and appropriate localization
within the tissue (cytoplasmic and membrane staining for
tyrosinase).
• Positive results indicate the presence of melanocytic cells.
• Record findings in the laboratory information system as per site-
specific reporting guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for antibody and detection system.
• Laboratory specific protocols and guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature on tyrosinase immunostaining
techniques.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP shall be reviewed annually or as needed based on new
regulations, guideline updates, or procedural changes.
