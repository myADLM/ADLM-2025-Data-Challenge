STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Tyrosinemia Follow-Up Panel,
Self-Collect, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase protocol for generating results for the
Tyrosinemia Follow-Up Panel from self-collected blood spot samples.
This SOP ensures consistent and accurate testing, including
appropriate handling, analyte evaluation, quality control, and data
management.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures in accordance with this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring strict adherence to this
SOP and for addressing any deficiencies that may impact the
results.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Calibrated mass spectrometer
• Liquid chromatography system
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Blood spot puncher
• Calibrated incubator
• Organic solvent (methanol)
• Internal standards for quantitative analysis
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal levels)
• Reagent storage containers
• Data management system (LIS)
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) card with 4-5 separate
blood spots, received in the laboratory within 7 days of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Blood spots with insufficient sample volume.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 7 days after
collection date.
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated, improperly labeled, or
not stored under proper conditions.
1. PROCEDURES
4.1 Specimen Handling:
1. Verify that the self-collected DBS card is properly labeled with
the patient’s full name, date of birth, collection date, and time.
2. Protect the DBS card from moisture and store it at room
temperature until analysis.
4.2 Sample Preparation:
1. Using the blood spot puncher, punch a defined diameter disc
(e.g., 3.2 mm) from the center of each blood spot on the DBS
card.
2. Place the punched disc into a well of a microplate.
3. Add the extraction solvent (e.g., methanol) containing internal
standards to each well.
4. Vortex the microplate for 2 minutes, and then incubate in a
shaking incubator at 37°C for 30 minutes to ensure thorough
extraction.
5. Centrifuge the plate at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet any
particulate matter.
4.3 Analytical Procedure:
1. Transfer the supernatant from each well to a clean microplate
or vial.
2. Set up the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
system with the appropriate column and settings for tyrosine
metabolites.
3. Inject the sample aliquots from the microplate or vial into the
LC-MS system.
4. Analyze the samples according to the programmed method for
the Tyrosinemia Follow-Up Panel.
5. Record and review all chromatographic and mass spectrometric
data.
4.4 Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control materials with known normal and
abnormal levels of tyrosine metabolites simultaneously with
patient samples.
2. Accept the batch run only if QC results fall within the acceptable
range.
3. If QC fails, troubleshoot the problem, correct the issue, and re-
analyze the patient and QC samples.
4.5 Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Review the generated data and ensure all peaks are correctly
identified and quantified.
2. Calculate the concentration of tyrosine and related metabolites
using the internal standards for quantitation.
3. Enter the results into the LIS and review them for accuracy.
4. Verify the results as per laboratory protocol and report findings
to the requesting physician.
5. REFERENCES
• Relevant mass spectrometry operation manuals.
• Package inserts of internal standards and QC materials.
• LIS user manual.
• Scientific literature on tyrosine metabolite analysis.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
• Maintain records of calibration and maintenance of the LC-MS
system.
• Retain quality control data, including logs and corrective actions
taken.
• Document all patient sample information, analytical results, and
the final report in the LIS.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND REVIEW
• Perform periodic audits to ensure compliance with this SOP.
• Review and update the SOP at least annually or whenever
changes in procedure or equipment occur.
1. SAFETY
• Follow laboratory safety guidelines and wear appropriate PPE
(personal protective equipment) when handling samples and
reagents.
• Dispose of biological waste in accordance with laboratory
biohazard protocol.
