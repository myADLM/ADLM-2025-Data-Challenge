Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to detail the steps necessary for the
analytical phase of generating results for Tyrosinemia Follow-Up
Panel, Blood Spot in the clinical laboratory setting. This panel is
crucial for the follow-up and management of patients suspected of
having Tyrosinemia. It is essential to ensure accurate, reliable, and
timely results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
adhere to these protocols to maintain the integrity and accuracy of
the results.
1. DEFINITION
Tyrosinemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to
break down the amino acid tyrosine. Follow-up testing involves the
measurement of specific amino acids and metabolites in dried blood
spots.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Sample Type: Dried Blood Spots (DBS) on standard filter paper
• Volume Required: At least 3 full spots
• Stability: The specimen is stable for 7 days at room temperature
and up to 1 month when refrigerated. Long-term storage can be
achieved by freezing at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) system
◦ Puncher for DBS
◦ Incubator
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Microplate reader
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Extraction solution (e.g., methanol with internal standards)
◦ Calibration standards and quality control materials for Tyrosine
and related metabolites
◦ Reagents for derivatization (if applicable)
◦ Microplates
◦ Pipettes and tips
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Punching Blood Spots:
◦ Punch at least 3 full spots from each dried blood spot card
into individual wells of a microplate.
2. Extraction:
◦ Add 200 µL of extraction solution to each well.
◦ Vortex mix the plate for 2 minutes.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes with
gentle shaking.
3. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the plate at 4,000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate
the extracted metabolites.
4. Transfer Supernatant:
◦ Carefully transfer 100 µL of the clear supernatant to a new
well of a clean microplate.
B) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. System Preparation:
◦ Calibrate and perform system checks on the LC-MS/MS
system according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare calibration standards and quality controls.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject 10 µL of each sample, calibration standard, and
quality control into the LC-MS/MS system.
3. Acquisition:
◦ Create a run queue ensuring inclusion of calibration
standards and quality controls at appropriate intervals.
◦ Start the mass spectrometer run using the validated method
for tyrosine and its related metabolites.
4. Data Acquisition Parameters:
◦ Ensure the parameters for the LC-MS/MS system are set
according to the validated method (e.g., column type,
gradient, flow rate, ionization mode).
C) Data Processing and Validation:
1. Analysis:
◦ Upon completion of the run, analyze the data using the
appropriate software.
◦ Confirm peak identification and integrate peak areas.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Review calibration curves and ensure all QC samples are
within the acceptable ranges.
◦ Any deviations must be documented and investigated.
3. Result Validation:
◦ Ensure the results for patient samples are within the
established assay range.
◦ Re-run any samples that show discrepancies or out-of-
range values.
D) Reporting:
1. Results Entry:
◦ Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Results must include concentrations of tyrosine and other
metabolites as specified.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Immediately notify the ordering physician of any critical
values per laboratory policy.
◦ Document the notification in the LIS.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each run using commercially available
QC material.
• Implement and adhere to routine QC practices to ensure
instrument calibration and reagent stability.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
