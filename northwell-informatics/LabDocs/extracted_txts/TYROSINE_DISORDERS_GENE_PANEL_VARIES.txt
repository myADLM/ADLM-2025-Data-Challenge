Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for TYROSINE DISORDERS GENE PANEL,
VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for the analysis of the Tyrosine Disorders Gene Panel. This SOP
outlines the process for generating results, from sample preparation
to final data analysis, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the
detection of genetic variants associated with tyrosine metabolism
disorders.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this protocol.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for verifying that these
procedures are followed and for addressing any deviations.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Tyrosine Disorders Gene Panel: A molecular diagnostic test
used to detect mutations in genes associated with tyrosine
metabolism disorders.
• NGS (Next Generation Sequencing): High-throughput
sequencing method used to analyze multiple genes
simultaneously.
• Bioinformatics Analysis: The use of software tools to interpret
sequencing data and identify genetic variants.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from 2-5 mL of whole blood or 1-2 mg
of tissue sample using a validated DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
◦ Assess DNA quality by running an aliquot on a 1% agarose
gel.
2. Library Preparation:
◦ Shear the DNA to the desired fragment size (150-200 bp)
using a sonicator or enzyme-based method.
◦ Use a validated library preparation kit to construct
sequencing libraries, following the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Assess library quality and concentration using a Bioanalyzer
or similar instrument.
B. Sequencing
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Dilute libraries to the appropriate concentration for
sequencing.
◦ Load libraries onto the sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq, NextSeq) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Sequencing Run:
◦ Initiate the sequencing run and monitor for any issues.
◦ Ensure that sequencing metrics (e.g., cluster density, Q-
score) meet the quality control standards.
C. Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing:
◦ Perform base calling to convert raw sequencing data into
sequence reads.
◦ Demultiplex the reads if multiple samples were pooled in a
single run.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align sequence reads to the reference genome (e.g.,
GRCh38) using a validated alignment tool (e.g., BWA).
◦ Perform variant calling to identify single nucleotide variants
(SNVs), insertions, deletions (INDELs), and copy number
variations (CNVs) using a validated variant caller (e.g.,
GATK).
3. Annotation:
◦ Use an annotation tool (e.g., ANNOVAR) to provide
functional annotations for identified variants.
◦ Cross-reference variants with databases (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP, OMIM) to determine clinical significance.
D. Quality Control
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of
samples to ensure the reliability of the sequencing process.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run quality metrics (e.g., coverage
depth, base quality) and compare with predetermined
thresholds.
2. External Validation:
◦ Periodically participate in external quality assessment (EQA)
programs to validate the accuracy of the test.
E. Reporting Results
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Clinical scientists or geneticists shall review the variants
identified in the context of patient clinical information to
determine their relevance.
◦ Interpret findings according to the latest guidelines and
recommendations from genetics societies (e.g., ACMG
guidelines).
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document the findings in the patient report including details
of identified variants, their clinical significance, and
recommendations for follow-up testing if necessary.
◦ Ensure that reports are reviewed and signed by a qualified
clinical geneticist.
3. Data Storage and Security
1. Data Storage:
◦ Store raw sequencing data, processed data, and analysis
results securely on laboratory servers, ensuring compliance
with data protection regulations.
2. Data Security:
◦ Implement appropriate security measures for data storage,
access, and transmission to ensure patient confidentiality
and data integrity.
