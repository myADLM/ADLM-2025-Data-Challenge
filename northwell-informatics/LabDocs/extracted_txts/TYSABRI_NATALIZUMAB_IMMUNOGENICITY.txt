Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for TYSABRI (NATALIZUMAB) Immunogenicity
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical steps and
quality control measures implemented to ensure accurate and timely
generation of immunogenicity results for TYSABRI (NATALIZUMAB)
in the laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
1. All designated laboratory staff involved in the immunogenicity
testing are responsible for adhering to the procedures
described in this document.
2. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring and ensuring
compliance with the procedures and for addressing any issues
that may arise during the analytical phase.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
1. Specimen type: Serum samples.
2. Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of serum is required for each test.
3. Storage and stability: Serum samples should be stored at -20°C
or lower until testing. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
4. Specimen rejection criteria:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
◦ Samples with insufficient volume.
◦ Specimens collected in inappropriate containers or with
incorrect labeling.
◦ Samples received thawed (if previously frozen).
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
1. Equipment:
◦ Refrigerators and freezers maintained within specified
temperature ranges.
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
and 620 nm.
◦ Centrifuge for serum separation.
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips.
◦ Multichannel pipette.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Timer.
2. Reagents:
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit specific
for TYSABRI (NATALIZUMAB) antibodies.
◦ Calibrators and controls provided with the ELISA kit.
◦ Washing buffer, substrate solution, stop solution, diluent,
and other reagents as specified by the ELISA kit
manufacturer.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing Reagents and Controls
1. Thaw serum samples to room temperature (18-25°C) and mix
gently before analysis.
2. Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions.
3. Label microplate wells appropriately for calibrators, controls,
and samples.
B. Sample and Reagent Addition
1. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples
to the designated wells.
2. Cover the plate with adhesive plate sealer and incubate for the
specified time at the temperature recommended by the
manufacturer (usually 1-2 hours at room temperature).
C. Washing Steps
1. Remove the plate sealer and aspirate the contents of the wells.
2. Wash each well with 350 µL of washing buffer. Repeat the wash
step a total of four times.
3. Remove any remaining wash buffer after the final wash by
gently tapping the plate on absorbent paper.
D. Detection Antibody Addition
1. Add 100 µL of enzyme-linked detection antibody to each well.
2. Cover the plate with a new adhesive plate sealer and incubate
for the specified time (usually 1 hour at room temperature).
E. Additional Washing Steps
1. Repeat the washing steps as described in Section C.
F. Substrate Addition and Plate Development
1. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate in the dark for the specified time (usually 15-30
minutes) to allow color development.
3. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
G. Measurement
1. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength at 620 nm using the microplate reader.
2. Process the data according to the ELISA kit instructions to
generate the final antibody levels for TYSABRI
(NATALIZUMAB).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative controls with each run to
ensure the validity of the assay.
2. QC materials must fit within the predefined acceptable ranges
established during assay validation.
3. Document all assay runs, including any deviations, corrective
actions, and results.
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Review and verify all results before reporting.
2. Results are expressed in units per mL (U/mL) as per the ELISA
kit instructions.
3. Critical values should be immediately communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider following the laboratory's critical
result notification procedures.
4. Results are documented and transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for reporting, following the established
procedures.
