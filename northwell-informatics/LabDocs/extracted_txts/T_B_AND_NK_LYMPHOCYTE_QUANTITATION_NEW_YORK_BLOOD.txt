Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for T, B, and NK
Lymphocyte Quantitation, New York, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the quantitation of T, B, and NK lymphocytes in blood samples. This
procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for
clinical and research purposes while adhering to quality control and
safety guidelines.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and scientists trained in flow cytometry and
lymphocyte quantitation are responsible for performing this
procedure. It is their duty to ensure that all steps are followed
precisely, quality control measures are adhered to, and results are
accurately documented and reported. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this SOP and addressing any issues that
arise during the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 2 mL of peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection to
ensure cell integrity and accurate results.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens older than 24 hours.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Clotted blood samples.
• Hemolyzed samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• BD FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer or equivalent.
• BD FACSCanto Clinical Software or equivalent.
• BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK reagent with TRUCOUNT tubes.
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge (for specific steps as required).
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles.
• Logbooks and documentation forms.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Ensure that all reagents, controls, and equipment are within
their expiration dates and properly calibrated.
2. Verify patient identification and specimen details.
3. Gently invert the blood sample tube 8-10 times to mix
thoroughly.
B) Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation of Sample and Reagents:
◦ Label the TRUCOUNT tube with patient identification.
◦ Add 50 μL of well-mixed whole blood to the TRUCOUNT
tube.
◦ Add 20 μL of BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK reagent.
◦ Cap and vortex the tube gently for 5 seconds.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the tube in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature (20-25°C).
3. Lysis of Red Blood Cells:
◦ Add 450 μL of 1X BD FACS Lysing Solution to the tube.
◦ Vortex immediately for 5 seconds.
◦ Incubate in the dark for an additional 15 minutes at room
temperature.
4. Flow Cytometric Analysis:
◦ Set up the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions, ensuring proper compensation and calibration.
◦ Acquire samples on the flow cytometer using predefined
TBNK settings.
◦ Ensure that at least 10,000 lymphocyte events are collected
for statistical reliability.
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze data using BD FACSCanto Clinical Software or
equivalent.
◦ Identify and gate lymphocyte populations (T cells, B cells,
and NK cells) based on fluorescence markers.
◦ Calculate absolute counts using TRUCOUNT tube beads
and relative percentages.
◦ Verify results for accuracy and consistency. Flag and
address any outliers or discrepancies.
C) Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Document all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Review results for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Report results to the requesting physician or medical team
in accordance with laboratory protocols.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal and external quality control samples with each
batch of patient samples.
◦ Record and analyze QC data. Report and troubleshoot any
failures or discrepancies.
◦ Ensure equipment maintenance and calibration records are
up to date.
3. Sample Storage and Disposal:
◦ Store any remaining sample at 4°C for 24 hours in case
reanalysis is required.
◦ Safely dispose of all biohazard materials according to
institutional guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC: Run known control samples (high, normal, and low
levels) alongside patient samples.
• External QC: Participate in external proficiency testing programs
as required.
• Record all QC results and take corrective actions if QC results are
outside acceptable ranges.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps, controls, and results are documented in the
designated logbook or electronic system. Document any deviations
or issues encountered during the procedure and the corrective
actions taken.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate and reliable
quantitation of T, B, and NK lymphocytes in blood samples,
contributing to effective patient diagnosis and management.
