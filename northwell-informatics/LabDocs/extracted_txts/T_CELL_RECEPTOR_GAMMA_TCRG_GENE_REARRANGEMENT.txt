Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for T Cell Receptor Gamma (TCRG) Gene
Rearrangement
1. Purpose To outline the procedures and responsibilities involved
in the analytical phase of generating results for T Cell Receptor
Gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangement testing. This includes the
protocols for equipment setup, amplification, detection, and
result analysis.
2. Scope This SOP applies to all staff members involved in the
handling, processing, and analysis of samples for TCRG gene
rearrangement within the clinical laboratory.
3. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Scientists: Conduct and oversee all steps of the
analytical phase.
• Supervisors: Ensure the laboratory operates in compliance with
this SOP and addresses any discrepancies or issues.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• PCR instruments (e.g., Thermocycler)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Reagents and consumables for PCR (primers, buffers, dNTPs,
Taq polymerase, etc.)
• Agarose gel and related electrophoresis reagents
• Positive and negative control samples
• UV transilluminator and documentation system
• Molecular weight markers
1. Procedure A) Initial Setup
2. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and in proper working
condition. Verify calibration records.
3. Prepare and aliquot all reagents required for PCR per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Prepare samples following the standardized extraction process.
B) PCR Amplification
1. Set up PCR reactions in a designated PCR workstation to
minimize contamination.
2. Prepare master mix following the specific PCR protocol for
TCRG gene rearrangement, including primers and controls.
3. Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes along with appropriate
sample DNA.
4. Program the thermocycler with the appropriate amplification
cycle settings specific for TCRG gene rearrangement.
5. Load the PCR tubes into the thermocycler and initiate the PCR
run.
C) Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare an agarose gel at the recommended concentration
(typically 2%-3% agarose).
2. Load PCR products and controls into the gel wells, alongside
the molecular weight markers.
3. Perform electrophoresis according to standard protocols.
4. Document the gel picture using a UV transilluminator and
imaging system.
D) Analysis
1. Review the gel electrophoresis results, comparing bands
against control samples and molecular weight markers.
2. Interpret the presence or absence of specific TCRG gene
rearrangement bands.
3. Ensure all results are documented and cross-checked for
accuracy.
E) Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to ensure test validity.
2. Monitor the laboratory temperature and humidity to remain
within specified limits.
3. Record any deviations and initiate troubleshooting steps as
necessary.
4. Validate procedures and instruments following designated
guidelines.
F) Reporting Results
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following proper verification procedures.
2. Flag and review any critical or aberrant results per protocol.
3. For ambiguous results, repeat the testing process or consult a
supervisor for further investigation.
4. Ensure all reported results are reviewed and authorized by a
qualified laboratory scientist.
