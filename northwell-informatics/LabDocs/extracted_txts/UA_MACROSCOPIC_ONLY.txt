Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for UA Macroscopic Only
(Urinalysis)
1. Purpose
To outline the procedures for performing macroscopic urinalysis
when automated urinalysis instruments are down, ensuring
reliable and accurate results for visual and gross inspection of
urine samples.
2. Specimen Requirements
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 10 mL freshly voided urine sent to the laboratory within 6 hours of
collection. Patient should be instructed to discard the initial
portion.
• BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Conical Urine tube.
Specimens in these tubes are stable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C
with an ideal volume of 7-9 mL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 6 hours after
collection (for BD Vacutainer tubes, specimens arriving in the
laboratory greater than 72 hours after collection).
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without the collection date/
time indicated on the sample container or requisition.
Upon receipt, confirm specimen information and ensure the
acceptance criteria are met.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG reagent strips.
• Timer
• Urine containers
• Pipettes
• Deionized water for cleaning purposes
• Disposable gloves and lab coat for safety
1. Procedure Visual Inspection:
◦ Examine the urine sample for color, clarity, and odor.
◦ Document findings in the Urinalysis Report.
Testing with Siemens Multistix:
1. Ensure the specimen is at room temperature if it was
refrigerated.
2. Completely immerse the reagent strip in urine and remove
immediately to avoid dissolving reagents.
▪ Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to
remove excess urine.
3. Start Timer.
4. Read each pad at the time shown on the label, starting
with the shortest time:
▪ Hold the strip close to the color block on the label and
match carefully.
▪ Note any discrepancies or abnormal color ranges and
document accordingly. Note: If the color of the test pad
is outside the expected color range, do not provide a
result and instead add the result comment ‘No result
due to interference.’
2. Quality Control
• Verify reagent strip expiration date and storage conditions. Strips
should be stored at room temperature without removing
desiccant.
• Control Material: Use Kenlor Industries – 2 Levels: 3 x 10mL
Negative QC and Positive QC (Cat. # 210306), Biorad Liquichek
Urinalysis (Bilevel) Ref # 435, Biorad qUAntify Advance (#975).
◦ Quality control tests should be performed with each new batch
of reagent strips.
◦ Ensure QC aliquots are brought to room temperature before
use.
◦ Record QC results following site-specific guidelines.
1. Reporting Results
• Document results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines, ensuring accurate and
timely communication of results to healthcare providers.
• In case of any discrepancies, escalate to the on-call supervisor for
review before finalizing the report.
1. Reference Intervals
• Glucose: Negative
• Ketone: Negative
• Specific Gravity: 1.005–1.030
• Blood: Negative
• pH: 5.0–8.5
• Protein: Negative
• Nitrate: Negative
• Leucocyte: Negative
• Urobilinogen: Normal
1. Method Limitations Refer to Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG
insert for individual reagent pad limitations. Be aware of
interference factors and document appropriately when
limitations are encountered.

This SOP is to ensure that all analytical procedures related to
macroscopic urinalysis are performed consistently and accurately to
provide reliable diagnostic information. All staff members responsible
for urinalysis must adhere strictly to this protocol.
