Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
UA Microscopic Only - Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides detailed instructions for the analysis of urine
sediment by microscopic examination (UA Microscopic Only). This
assay is performed when requested by laboratory order to evaluate
the presence and quantity of formed elements in the urine, such as
cells, casts, crystals, and organisms.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing urinalysis microscopy in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document the UA Microscopic Only procedure according to the
standards outlined in this SOP. Any deviations or issues arising
during the procedure must be reported to a supervisor for appropriate
corrective action.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Glass microscope slides and coverslips
• Transfer pipettes
• Sterile centrifuge tubes
• Manual light microscope (with phase-contrast capability if
applicable)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Urine sediment stain (optional based on laboratory-specific
protocol)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Requirements
• A freshly collected urine sample is preferred.
• Specimen should be properly labelled with the patient’s
identification, collection date, and time.
• A minimum volume of 10 mL is required for performing urinalysis.
5.2 Preparation
• Ensure that all equipment is clean and functioning properly.
• Correctly label a sterile centrifuge tube with the appropriate
patient information.
5.3 Centrifugation
• Transfer 10 mL of the well-mixed urine sample into the centrifuge
tube.
• Balance the centrifuge properly by ensuring samples are placed
opposite each other with similar volumes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 RPM for 5 minutes.
5.4 Sediment Preparation
• Carefully decant the supernatant, leaving a small volume (~0.5-1
mL) to resuspend the sediment.
• Gently resuspend the sediment by tapping or swirling the tube.
5.5 Microscopic Examination
• Using a pipette, transfer a drop of the resuspended urine
sediment onto a clean microscope slide.
• Cover the drop with a coverslip to avoid introducing air bubbles.
• Examine the slide under a microscope at low (10x) and high (40x)
power magnifications.
• Use phase-contrast microscopy if available for better visualization
of certain formed elements (e.g., hyaline casts).
5.6 Analysis and Reporting
• Systematically scan the slide to identify and count formed
elements, including:
◦ Erythrocytes and leukocytes
◦ Epithelial cells
◦ Casts (hyaline, granular, cellular, etc.)
◦ Crystals (type and quantity)
◦ Bacteria, yeast, and other organisms
◦ Artifacts
• Record findings as cells per high power field (HPF) or low power
field (LPF) where appropriate.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Positive and Negative Controls
• Perform microscopic analysis on control slides to ensure the
proper functioning of the microscope and the accuracy of the
technician's observations.
• Record control results in the appropriate logbook as per
laboratory-specific guidelines.
6.2 Competency Assessment
• Laboratory personnel must undergo periodic competency
assessments to ensure they maintain a high level of proficiency in
performing urinalysis microscopy.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Results are dependent on the timely and proper handling of
specimens and may be affected by delayed examination or
improper storage.
• External factors such as contamination or improper sample
processing may influence the accuracy of results.
8. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urinalysis.
• Laboratory-specific reference materials and previous training
documentation.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all analysis results in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
• Note any deviations or issues encountered during the testing
process in the laboratory logbook and inform a supervisor for
corrective action if necessary.
