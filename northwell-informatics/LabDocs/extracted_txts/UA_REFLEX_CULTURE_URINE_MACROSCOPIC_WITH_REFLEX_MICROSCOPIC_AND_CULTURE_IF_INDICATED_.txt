Title: Analysis Protocol for Urine Macroscopic Analysis with Reflex
Microscopic and Culture (UA REFLEX CULTURE)
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for
performing urine macroscopic analysis with reflex microscopic
analysis and culture, if indicated. This procedure ensures accurate
and reliable results for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections and
other urinary diseases.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists and technicians are responsible for
performing and documenting the procedures as outlined in this SOP.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP and managing any discrepancies or deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Freshly voided, midstream, clean-catch urine is preferred.
• Specimens can also be obtained via catheterization if necessary.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 10 mL
• Preferable volume: 20 mL for comprehensive testing
Storage and Transport:
• Urine specimens should be analyzed within 2 hours of collection if
kept at room temperature, or within 24 hours if refrigerated at
4-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens with excessive delays in transport (more than 24
hours post-collection if refrigerated).
• Contaminated specimens (e.g., visible fecal matter, foreign
objects).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Urinalysis strip reader
• Microscopes
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (for culture)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Refrigerators and freezers
Reagents:
• Urinalysis reagent strips (e.g., Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG)
• Culture media (e.g., Cystine-Lactose-Electrolyte-Deficient (CLED)
agar, MacConkey agar)
• Sterile saline
Supplies:
• Urine collection containers
• Centrifuge tubes
• Sterile swabs
• Petri dishes
1. PROCEDURE
A. Macroscopic Analysis:
1. Observe and document the color, clarity, and odor of the urine
sample.
2. Record any abnormalities such as turbidity, unusual colors, or
foul odors.
B. Chemical Analysis:
1. Dip the urinalysis reagent strip completely into the urine sample
and remove immediately.
2. Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to remove
excess urine.
3. Place the reagent strip on the urinalysis strip reader as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Document results on the appropriate log.
C. Reflex Microscopic Analysis:
1. Perform a microscopic examination if indicated by abnormal
macroscopic or chemical findings (e.g., presence of blood,
nitrite, leukocyte esterase).
2. Centrifuge 10 mL of the urine at 1500-2000 RPM for 5 minutes.
3. Decant the supernatant, leaving a small volume to resuspend
the sediment.
4. Place a drop of the resuspended sediment on a microscope
slide, cover with a coverslip, and examine under both low and
high magnification.
5. Document the presence and quantity of any findings, such as
red blood cells, white blood cells, epithelial cells, casts, crystals,
bacteria, or yeast.
D. Reflex Culture:
1. Perform a urine culture if indicated by significant microscopic
findings (e.g., presence of bacteria, white blood cells).
2. Using a calibrated loop, inoculate 1 µL of urine onto CLED and
MacConkey agar plates.
3. Streak for isolation and incubate plates at 35-37°C for 18-24
hours.
4. After incubation, examine colonies for growth.
5. Use a microscope for Gram staining and observe bacterial
morphology.
6. If clinically significant growth is found, perform identification and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing as per standard procedures.
7. Document the type and quantity of bacteria or other pathogens
found.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls for urinalysis reagent strips
with each new lot or shipment.
• Perform periodic calibrations of the urinalysis strip reader,
microscope, and incubator.
• Utilize standardized microscopy and culture techniques.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Initial Results:
• Document and report initial urinalysis and any abnormal
microscopic findings to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Reflex Culture Results:
• Report culture results including organism identification and
antibiotic susceptibilities to LIS.
• Document critical findings and notify the responsible physician as
per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS (for urinalysis)
• Glucose: negative
• Ketone: negative
• Specific Gravity: 1.005–1.030
• Blood: negative
• pH: 5.0–8.5
• Protein: negative
• Nitrite: negative
• Leukocyte: negative
• Urobilinogen: normal
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG insert for individual
reagent pad limitations.
• Ensure the urine sample is representative and properly collected
to avoid contamination errors.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps performed and results obtained are documented in
the laboratory log or electronically stored in the LIS. Maintain detailed
records for traceability.
This protocol ensures that urine macroscopic analysis with reflex
microscopic and culture, if indicated, is performed accurately and
efficiently, providing valuable diagnostic information for patient care.
