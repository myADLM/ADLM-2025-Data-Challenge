SOP: Urine Macroscopic with Reflex Microscopic (UA REFLEX
MICROSCOPIC)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the proper procedure for conducting a urine macroscopic
analysis and the conditions under which a reflex microscopic
examination is to be performed, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and
compliance with regulatory guidelines.
1. SCOPE
Applies to all urine samples received in the laboratory for routine
urinalysis testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff performing the urinalysis tests. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this SOP and
ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Siemens Multistix 10SG or equivalent (Refer to product insert for
storage conditions).
• Microscope (for reflex microscopy).
• Manual dipstick reader (if available).
• Timer.
• Centrifuge.
• Urinalysis centrifuge tubes.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: 10 mL freshly voided urine sent to the
laboratory within 2 hours of collection or stored at 4°C for up to 6
hours after collection.
• Unacceptable: Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 6
hours after collection, samples with no collection date/time
indicated, or visibly contaminated samples.
• Note: If refrigerated, bring to room temperature prior to analysis.
1. PROCEDURE: URINE MACROSCOPIC ANALYSIS
2. Prepare the specimen:
◦ Check the specimen for any signs of contamination or
improper labeling.
◦ Bring the specimen to room temperature if it was
refrigerated.
3. Perform a macroscopic assessment:
◦ Observe the color and clarity of the urine and document the
findings.
4. Conduct a dipstick analysis:
◦ Completely immerse the reagent strip in urine and remove
immediately to avoid the dissolution of reagents.
◦ Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to remove
excess urine.
◦ Start the timer immediately after removing the strip.
5. Read the dipstick results:
◦ Read each pad at the time specified on the reagent strip
container, starting with the shortest time.
◦ Compare the color of each pad to the color block on the
label and record the results.
6. Criteria for reflex microscopic analysis:
◦ Perform a microscopic examination if any of the following
dipstick findings are positive:
▪ Blood: trace to 3+
▪ Nitrite: positive
▪ Protein: 1+ to 3+
▪ Leukocytes: trace to 3+
◦ Additionally, perform microscopy if there is a specific request
for crystals or if indicated on the requisition.
7. PROCEDURE: REFLEX MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS
8. Prepare the specimen for microscopy:
◦ Transfer 10 mL of well-mixed urine into a centrifuge tube.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 rpm for 5 minutes.
9. Examine the sediment:
◦ Decant the supernatant without disturbing the sediment.
◦ Add 1-2 drops of the remaining sediment to a microscope
slide.
◦ Cover with a coverslip.
10. Microscope examination:
◦ Use the microscope to examine the urine sediment at both
low (10x) and high (40x) magnifications.
◦ Identify and enumerate the following elements:
▪ Red blood cells (RBCs)
▪ White blood cells (WBCs)
▪ Epithelial cells
▪ Bacteria
▪ Yeasts
▪ Casts
▪ Crystals
◦ Document the findings appropriately.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record macroscopic and dipstick findings in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• If microscopic analysis was performed, record the findings in the
LIS under “Reflex Microscopy.”
• Review and verify results for accuracy before releasing them.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) testing each day of use using
recognized QC materials (e.g., Kenlor Industries QC).
• Follow manufacturer's guidelines for QC material handling and
testing.
• Record QC results and take corrective actions if results are
outside acceptable limits.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Glucose: negative
• Ketone: negative
• Specific Gravity: 1.005–1.030
• Blood: negative
• pH: 5.0–8.5
• Protein: negative
• Nitrate: negative
• Leukocyte: negative
• Urobilinogen: normal
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete and retain Temperature Monitoring Logs and QC
records daily.
• Verify specimen and QC data entry in the LIS.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to Multistix product insert for individual reagent pad
limitations.
• Consider potential interferences and limitations during result
interpretation.

1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure
compliance with current guidelines and laboratory practices.
