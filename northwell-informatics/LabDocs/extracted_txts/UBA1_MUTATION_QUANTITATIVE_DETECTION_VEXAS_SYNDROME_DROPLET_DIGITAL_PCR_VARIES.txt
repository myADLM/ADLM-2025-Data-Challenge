Standard Operating Procedure
for Generating Results for UBA1
Mutation Quantitative Detection,
VEXAS Syndrome Using
Droplet Digital PCR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and reliable protocol for the quantitative
detection of UBA1 mutations associated with VEXAS syndrome using
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). This ensures accuracy, precision, and
reproducibility of results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of samples for UBA1 mutations using ddPCR within the
clinical laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure the generation of accurate and reliable results.
Supervisors are responsible for training and oversight.
4. DEFINITIONS
UBA1:
UBA1 is the gene that encodes the Ubiquitin-Like Modifier Activating
Enzyme 1, mutations of which are associated with VEXAS syndrome.
VEXAS syndrome:
A clinically defined adult-onset autoinflammatory syndrome
associated with somatic mutations in the UBA1 gene.
Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR):
A method for performing digital PCR that partitions the sample into
thousands of droplets, allowing absolute quantification of target DNA
sequences.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• ddPCR system (Bio-Rad QX200 or equivalent)
• Droplet generator cartridges and gaskets
• Droplet reader
• PCR reagents: Master mix, primers, probes specific for UBA1
mutations
• DNA extraction kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Thermal cycler
• Appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety goggles)
• Laboratory consumables
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Collection: Ensure that samples are collected
following standard blood or tissue collection procedures. DNA
should be isolated from whole blood or tissue samples.
2. DNA Extraction: Extract DNA using an appropriate DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Quantify and assess the quality (purity) of the extracted DNA
using a spectrophotometer.
B. ddPCR Setup
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare the reaction mix by combining ddPCR Master Mix,
forward and reverse primers, and probes specific to UBA1
mutations for VEXAS syndrome.
◦ Add extracted DNA to the reaction mix.
2. Droplet Generation:
◦ Load the reaction mix into the appropriate wells of the
droplet generator cartridge.
◦ Use the droplet generator to partition the sample into
droplets. Seal the droplet generation cartridges with
gaskets.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Transfer droplets into a 96-well PCR plate.
◦ Seal the plate securely and load into the thermal cycler.
◦ Perform PCR amplification using the following cycling
conditions:
| Step | Temperature | Time | Cycles |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------| | Initial
Denaturation| 95°C | 10 minutes | 1 cycle | | Denaturation | 95°C
| 30 seconds | 40 cycles | | Annealing/Extension | 55-60°C | 1
minute | 40 cycles | | Final Extension | 72°C | 5 minutes | 1
cycle | | Hold | 4°C | Indefinite | --- |
4. Droplet Reading:
◦ After PCR amplification, load the plate into the droplet
reader.
◦ Analyze the results by counting the positive and negative
droplets using appropriate software provided by the ddPCR
system.
C. Data Analysis
1. Analysis:
◦ Calculate the absolute quantity of UBA1 mutation using the
droplet reader software.
◦ Ensure that data is backed up and saved securely. Review
the output data for consistency and accuracy.
D. Quality Control
1. Controls:
◦ Include positive controls (known UBA1 mutations) and
negative controls (wild-type UBA1) to validate the assay.
◦ Ensure that proper calibration and control checks are
performed regularly on the ddPCR machine as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
E. Reporting Results
1. Results Reporting:
◦ Review and verify results.
◦ Report results according to the laboratory’s reporting
protocol.
◦ Critical results should be communicated directly to the
ordering physician and documented in the patient's chart.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND
TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure standard operating procedure compliance through regular
audits.
• Address any deviations or issues in the procedure immediately.
• Keep detailed logs of all runs, including controls, anomalies,
reagent lot numbers, and equipment maintenance.
• Maintain proper training of personnel on ddPCR technology and
the specifics of UBA1 mutation detection.
