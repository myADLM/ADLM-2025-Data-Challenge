SOP for Ubiquitin (UBIQ) Immunostain, Technical Component
Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the technical component of
performing ubiquitin (UBIQ) immunostaining in the laboratory,
ensuring accurate and reliable immunohistochemical results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
ubiquitin immunostain according to the procedures outlined in this
SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure that the staining is
completed accurately and any anomalies are brought to the attention
of a supervisor.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Ubiquitin antibody (primary)
• Secondary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated polymer)
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Blocking solution (e.g., serum or BSA)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer)
• Washing buffer (e.g., PBS)
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide staining racks
• Immunostaining system (automated or manual)
• Light microscope
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
3.1. Slide Preparation:
a) Prepare paraffin-embedded tissue sections using a microtome,
cutting sections to 4-5 microns thickness. b) Place the tissue sections
onto positively-charged slides and incubate at 60°C for 30 minutes to
ensure adherence. c) Deparaffinize slides by sequential immersion in
xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each). d) Rehydrate slides through
graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70% ethanol - 5 minutes each) and
finally in distilled water (5 minutes).
3.2. Antigen Retrieval:
a) Place slides in antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer) and
heat in a microwave or pressure cooker as per manufacturer's
instructions for unmasking antigenic sites (typically 10-20 minutes at
high power). b) Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20
minutes. c) Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes to remove excess
antigen retrieval solution.
3.3. Blocking:
a) Apply blocking solution to the tissue sections to prevent non-
specific binding. Incubate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. b)
Blot off excess blocking solution without washing.
3.4. Primary Antibody Application:
a) Apply the ubiquitin primary antibody to the sections, ensuring
complete coverage. b) Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at
room temperature for 1 hour or overnight at 4°C for optimal staining
intensity. c) Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes to remove unbound
primary antibody.
3.5. Secondary Antibody Application:
a) Apply secondary antibody compatible with the primary antibody to
the sections. b) Incubate slides for 30 minutes at room temperature in
a humidified chamber. c) Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes to remove
unbound secondary antibody.
3.6. Detection:
a) Apply the detection system (HRP-conjugated polymer) to the
sections. b) Incubate in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature. c) Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3.7. Visualization:
a) Apply DAB substrate to the sections until the desired staining
intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes). b) Rinse slides in
distilled water to stop the reaction.
3.8. Counterstaining:
a) Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. b) Wash slides in
running tap water for 5 minutes to remove excess counterstain.
3.9. Dehydration and Mounting:
a) Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100% for 5
minutes each). b) Clear slides in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
c) Mount slides with coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of staining
to ensure reliability of the results.
• Review the slides under a light microscope to verify specific
staining patterns and absence of non-specific staining.
• Document the staining process and any deviations from the
protocol.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the staining intensity and patterns observed.
• Provide the results to the pathologist for interpretation.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's guidelines for the ubiquitin antibody and detection
system.
• Relevant immunohistochemistry literature and laboratory
manuals.
1. NOTES
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date and are stored
according to manufacturer recommendations.
• Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn
throughout the procedure to ensure safety.
This protocol ensures a standardized, accurate, and reliable method
for performing ubiquitin immunostaining in the laboratory, allowing for
consistent and high-quality results.
