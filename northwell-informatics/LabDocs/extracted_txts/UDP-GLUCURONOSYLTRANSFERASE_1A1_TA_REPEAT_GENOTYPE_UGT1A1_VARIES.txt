Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): UDP-
Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 TA Repeat Genotype
(UGT1A1) Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the analysis and genotyping of the UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase
1A1 (UGT1A1) TA repeat region. This genotyping is essential for
determining variations in the UGT1A1 gene that can influence drug
metabolism, specifically irinotecan and bilirubin conjugation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory staff responsible for molecular
genetics to perform UGT1A1 genotyping in accordance with this
SOP. Designated supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance and accuracy in performing and documenting the
analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Specimen Types:
▪ Whole blood: Collected in EDTA tubes
▪ Buccal swabs: Collected using sterile swabs and
preserved appropriately
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Whole blood: Stable for up to 1 week at 4°C
▪ Buccal swabs: Stable for up to 2 weeks at room
temperature or longer if frozen
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermal cycler
◦ Gel electrophoresis apparatus
◦ DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen or equivalent)
◦ PCR reagents: Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific for
UGT1A1 TA repeat region, buffers
◦ Agarose, Ethidium Bromide or other nucleic acid stains
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer and microcentrifuge
◦ Gel imaging system
◦ Laboratory notebook or electronic documentation system
3. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
• Isolate genomic DNA from 200 µL of whole blood or from buccal
swab using a validated DNA extraction kit.
• Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer (A260/A280 ratio).
B. PCR Amplification:
• PCR Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare a PCR master mix with the following components per
reaction:
▪ 1X PCR buffer
▪ 2.5 mM MgCl2
▪ 0.2 mM each dNTP
▪ 0.5 µM each primer (forward and reverse specific for TA
repeat region)
▪ 1 U Taq polymerase
▪ 50-100 ng genomic DNA
▪ Nuclease-free water to total volume of 25 µL
• Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
• Prepare a 2-3% agarose gel with an appropriate nucleic acid
stain.
• Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with 2 µL loading dye into each
well.
• Run gel at 100V for approximately 1 hour or until the dye front has
migrated an appropriate distance.
• Visualize and document the gel under UV light or appropriate
imaging system.
D. Interpretation of Results:
• Compare band patterns to a known DNA ladder (molecular weight
marker).
• The number of TA repeats is correlated with the size of the PCR
product:
◦ 6 TA repeats: Approx. 98 bp
◦ 7 TA repeats: Approx. 100 bp
E. Reporting Results:
• Record the genotype based on observed band size (e.g., 6/6, 6/7,
7/7).
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
confirm by a second analyst.
• Generate and review the report according to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include a positive control with known UGT1A1 genotype and
a no-template negative control in each PCR run.
◦ Maintain documentation of all QC results.
◦ Perform regular proficiency testing to ensure accuracy and
reliability of the genotyping process.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Genotypes are reported as the number of TA repeats
present in both alleles of UGT1A1.
3. REPORTING AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
◦ Genotypes are interpreted according to guidelines (e.g.,
impact on irinotecan dosing or bilirubin conjugation).

necessary to incorporate advances in technology and best practices.
