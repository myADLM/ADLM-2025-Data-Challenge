Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for UDP-
Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), Full Gene Sequencing
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for
conducting full gene sequencing of the UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase
1A1 (UGT1A1) gene, from DNA extraction through to result
generation. This ensures that results are accurate and reliable for
diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all staff involved in the analysis of
patient samples for UGT1A1 full gene sequencing at our CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Molecular Technologists: Perform DNA extraction, quantification,
and sequencing under the outlined procedures.
• Bioinformaticians: Conduct data analysis, variant calling, and
annotation.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Oversee the procedures, ensure
compliance with SOPs, and validate results before release.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• DNA extraction kits (commercial kit specified)
• NanoDrop or Qubit for DNA quantification
• Thermocyclers
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina,
Thermo Fisher)
• UGT1A1-specific primers/panel for NGS
• Reagents for library preparation (kit specified by NGS platform)
• Bioinformatics software for sequence analysis (e.g., BWA, GATK,
ANNOVAR)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure specimens are properly accessioned and labelled.
◦ Prepare a clean working area following standard laboratory
sterility protocols.
2. Extraction:
◦ Use the specified DNA extraction kit.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol to isolate DNA from the
sample.
◦ Include positive and negative controls to ensure the validity
of extraction.
3. Quantification:
◦ Assess the quality and quantity of extracted DNA using
NanoDrop or Qubit.
◦ Document DNA concentration and purity ratios (A260/A280)
in the LIS.
B. Library Preparation
1. Fragmentation:
◦ Fragment the DNA to the desired size (~150-200 bp) using
the recommended method (e.g., enzymatic fragmentation).
2. Library Construction:
◦ Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation according
to the library preparation kit's protocol.
◦ Amplify the library using PCR with UGT1A1-specific
primers.
3. Quantification and Normalization:
◦ Quantify the prepared library using Qubit or PicoGreen.
◦ Normalize the concentration of libraries to ensure even
loading onto the sequencing platform.
C. Sequencing
1. Platform Preparation:
◦ Prepare the NGS platform for sequencing as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load the normalized library onto the sequencing instrument.
2. Run Sequencing:
◦ Execute the sequencing run by selecting appropriate
program settings.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for quality metrics and any
issues.
D. Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing:
◦ Convert raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) into aligned
data (BAM files) using alignment software (e.g., BWA).
◦ Apply quality control checks on reads and alignment.
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Identify variants in the UGT1A1 gene using variant calling
software (e.g., GATK).
◦ Annotate variants with relevant information using ANNOVAR
or similar tools.
3. Quality Assessment:
◦ Review QC metrics including depth of coverage, read
quality, and alignment statistics.
◦ Verify the presence of positive control variants in control
samples.
E. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Variant Interpretation:
◦ Classify identified variants based on established guidelines
(e.g., ACMG/AMP).
◦ Include pathogenicity, clinical significance, and relevant
guidelines in variant interpretation.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Compile results, including interpretations, into a patient
report.
◦ Review the report for accuracy, completeness, and
compliance with reporting standards.
3. Report Validation:
◦ The laboratory supervisor or designated pathologist
validates the final report.
◦ Release the validated report to the referring physician via
the LIS.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Implement positive, negative, and no-template controls in each
run to monitor for contamination and ensure assay accuracy.
• Perform regular instrument maintenance and calibration as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons
to ensure competence.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Document all steps of the process from DNA extraction to result
reporting in the LIS.
• Maintain records of quality control checks, validations, and any
deviations from standard procedures.
• Ensure all electronic and paper records are securely stored and
accessible for review.
