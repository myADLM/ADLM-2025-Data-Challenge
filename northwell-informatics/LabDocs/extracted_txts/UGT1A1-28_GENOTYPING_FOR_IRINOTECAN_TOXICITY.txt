Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) UGT1A1-28 Genotyping for
Irinotecan Toxicity
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of UGT1A1-28
genotyping, in order to identify patients who are at risk for irinotecan
toxicity. This will guide personalized treatment plans and minimize
adverse drug reactions.
Responsibility:
The designated molecular genetics technologist is responsible for
performing the UGT1A1-28 genotyping as described in this SOP. The
laboratory manager or supervisor is responsible for ensuring the
procedure is followed and for addressing any issues that arise during
the testing process.
1. DEFINITIONS
UGT1A1-28: A polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1
gene, which can affect the metabolism of the chemotherapy drug
irinotecan. Irinotecan: A chemotherapy drug used to treat various
cancers. Its metabolism is influenced by the UGT1A1 enzyme.
Heterozygous: Having two different alleles at a genetic locus.
Homozygous: Having two identical alleles at a genetic locus.

1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
The specimen must be collected, received, and accessioned
according to established laboratory protocols.
Preferred/acceptable:
• 3-5 mL of whole blood in EDTA (lavender top) tube
• Extracted genomic DNA (concentration ≥20 ng/µL, total volume
≥20 µL)
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens without proper labeling
• Specimens not accompanied by a requisition form
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from whole blood using a genomic DNA
extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Measure the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
using a fluorometer or spectrophotometer.
3. Normalize the DNA concentration to 20 ng/µL for PCR
amplification.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows (per reaction):
◦ 12.5 µL of PCR reaction buffer with MgCl2
◦ 1 µL of dNTP mix (10 mM each)
◦ 1 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 0.5 µL of Taq DNA polymerase
◦ 7 µL of nuclease-free water
◦ 2 µL of template DNA (20 ng/µL)
2. Mix the components thoroughly and aliquot 24 µL of the master
mix into each PCR tube.
3. Add 2 µL of template DNA to each PCR tube.
4. Place the tubes in the PCR thermal cycler and run the following
program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
5. Store the amplified PCR products at 4°C until electrophoresis.
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel in 1X TAE buffer and allow it to
solidify.
2. Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with 1 µL of loading dye into
each well.
3. Include a DNA ladder in one of the wells to serve as a size
reference.
4. Run the gel at 100 volts for 1 hour.
5. Stain the gel with ethidium bromide (or alternative) and
visualize under UV light using a gel documentation system.
D. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Compare the observed band pattern with the DNA ladder to
determine the genotype at the UGT1A1-28 locus.
2. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Verify and sign off on the results by a qualified technologist.
4. Generate a report detailing the patient's UGT1A1-28 genotype
and its implications for irinotecan therapy.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control samples in each PCR run.
2. Record all lot numbers of reagents and any deviations from the
SOP.
3. Any deviations must be documented and reviewed by the
supervisor.
