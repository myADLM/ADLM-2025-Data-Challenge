Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
ULOCLADIUM CHARTARUM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedure for the analytical
phase of testing for Ulocladium Chartarum-specific IgE antibodies in
serum.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis of serum specimens for Ulocladium Chartarum-specific
IgE, ensuring accurate and timely results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the testing
process and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-stopper or SST tube.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Serum that has been hemolyzed or contaminated.
• Specimens that do not have a collection date/time indicated on
the sample container or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA, ImmunoCAP)
• Ulocladium Chartarum-specific IgE test kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to the Ulocladium Chartarum IgE
assay
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Microplate reader (if using ELISA)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are brought to
room temperature if required.
2. Prepare the workstation by setting up the necessary equipment
and supplies as per manufacturer's instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add calibrators, controls, and serum specimens to respective
wells in the immunoassay plate following the instructions
provided by the test kit manufacturer.
2. Incubate the plate according to specified conditions (e.g.,
temperature, time) mentioned in the kit instructions.
3. Wash the plate thoroughly using the wash buffer to remove
unbound materials.
4. Add the detection antibody or enzyme conjugate as per the
manufacturer's protocol, and incubate again as specified.
5. Add the substrate solution and incubate for the recommended
time period to develop the color reaction.
6. Add the stop solution to halt the reaction.
7. Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at the
appropriate wavelength (if using ELISA).
C. Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control samples alongside patient specimens to
ensure the assay performs within acceptable limits.
2. Document the results of the control samples on the Quality
Control Log.
3. If any of the control samples fall outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and re-run the assay if necessary.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the concentration of Ulocladium Chartarum-specific IgE
antibodies in each specimen using the standard curve generated
from calibrators.
• Compare the patient results against reference intervals provided
by the test kit manufacturer.
• Any result falling outside the reference range should be flagged
and reviewed by the supervising technologist for potential further
action.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Generate reports according to site-specific guidelines for issuing
patient results.
• Document any critical values and follow the protocol for
communicating these results to the appropriate healthcare
provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the test kit insert for specific reference intervals for
Ulocladium Chartarum-specific IgE.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for limitations of the specific test kit
used for Ulocladium Chartarum-specific IgE determination.
