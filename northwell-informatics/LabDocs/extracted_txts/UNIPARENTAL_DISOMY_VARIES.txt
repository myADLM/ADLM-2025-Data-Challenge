Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Uniparental Disomy (UPD)
Testing
1. Purpose
To outline the analytical procedures involved in the detection and
confirmation of Uniparental Disomy (UPD) using genetic analysis
techniques. This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results for the detection of UPD.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to adhere to this protocol,
perform the necessary analyses, and report findings accurately.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing that these procedures are
correctly implemented and followed.
2. Definitions
Uniparental Disomy (UPD): A genetic condition in which both copies
of a chromosome or part of a chromosome are inherited from one
parent, rather than one copy from each parent.
3. Specimen Requirements and
Preparation
Acceptable Specimens:
• Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood
• Amniotic fluid
• Chorionic villus sample (CVS)
• Tissue sample (if necessary, e.g., for prenatal diagnosis)
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without clear identification
• Specimens that are improperly labeled
• Specimens that show signs of contamination
Specimen Handling:
• Store DNA at -20°C until ready to use.
• All specimens must be properly labeled with patient identification
and accompanied by the appropriate requisition form.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• PCR thermal cycler
• Centrifuge
• Electrophoresis unit or capillary electrophoresis instrument
• UV transilluminator (if using agarose gels)
• Real-time PCR or next-generation sequencer (if using appropriate
techniques)
Reagents:
• QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit or equivalent for DNA extraction
• PCR reagents (buffers, dNTPs, primers, Taq polymerase)
• Agarose and gel electrophoresis buffers (if applicable)
• Fluorescent dyes or probes for real-time PCR or sequencing
library preparation kits
• Ethidium bromide or SYBR safe for gel visualization (if applicable)
Supplies:
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• PCR reaction tubes or plates
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PPE
5. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Prepare samples according to the manufacturer's instructions
using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit or equivalent.
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Design and validate primers specific to the regions of interest
on the chromosome suspected of UPD.
2. Prepare a reaction mix containing:
◦ 2 µL of genomic DNA
◦ 10 µL of PCR buffer
◦ 1.5 mM MgCl2
◦ 0.2 mM dNTP mix
◦ 0.5 µM of each primer
◦ 1 unit of Taq polymerase
◦ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 µL
3. Load PCR reaction tubes into the thermal cycler.
4. Set the PCR cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing at primer-specific temperature (typically
55-65°C) for 30 seconds
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel using agarose and TAE or TBE
buffer.
2. Load PCR products and a DNA ladder into the gel wells.
3. Run the gel at 100V for approximately 1 hour or until bands are
resolved.
4. Visualize the bands under UV light.
D. Analysis by SNP Array or Sequencing:
1. Prepare the DNA library according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load samples onto the next-generation sequencer or SNP
array system.
3. Follow the instrument's protocol for sequencing run or SNP
array analysis.
4. Analyze the output using appropriate bioinformatics tools to
detect regions of homozygosity or confirm UPD.
E. Interpretation:
1. Review the data and identify any regions of uniparental disomy.
2. Compare the results with the parental DNA (if available) to
confirm UPD.
6. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Use validated reference standards for SNP array or sequencing.
• Regularly calibrate instruments and document their performance.
• Follow established guidelines for the interpretation of UPD results.
• Document all results, including control performance, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. Reporting Results
• Confirm the presence of UPD with a second independent method
if possible.
• Document and report findings according to the laboratory's
reporting guidelines.
• Review all results for accuracy and consistency before finalizing
the report.
8. References
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on UPD detection techniques.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the PCR reagents, SNP array, or
sequencing platform used.
• Internal laboratory protocols and guidelines for genetic testing.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to
incorporate new technological advances and updated best practices
for UPD testing.
