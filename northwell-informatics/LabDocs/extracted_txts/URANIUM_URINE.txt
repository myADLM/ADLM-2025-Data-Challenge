Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Uranium Analysis in Urine
1. PURPOSE To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase
in detecting and quantifying uranium levels in urine samples in the
laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Assigned laboratory personnel are responsible for accurately
conducting the analysis and ensuring compliance with the defined
protocol.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process, validating results, and taking corrective actions if
necessary.
3. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to all urine samples received in the
laboratory for the determination of uranium levels.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Calibration standards specific for uranium
• Nitric acid (ultrapure grade)
• Deionized water (resistivity > 18 MΩ cm)
• Centrifuge
• Conical centrifuge tubes
• Adjustable micropipettes and tips
• Urine sample containers
• Cleaning supplies for labware
5. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable: A minimum of 50 mL of freshly voided urine collected
in a clean, plastic container and ideally refrigerated (4-8°C) if
analysis is delayed.
• Unacceptable: Insufficient volume, visible particulates, samples
not properly refrigerated or that exceed storage duration, and
samples with no collection date/time indicated.
6. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION OF SAMPLES
1. Record Keeping: Log in the sample into the laboratory
information system and assign a unique identification number.
2. Sample Mixing: Vortex the urine sample to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Aliquoting: Transfer ~10 mL of the urine sample into a conical
centrifuge tube.
4. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
5. Acidification: Aliquot 5 mL of the supernatant and add 0.1 mL
of ultrapure nitric acid. Mix thoroughly.
B) INSTRUMENT SETUP AND CALIBRATION
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Power on the ICP-MS.
◦ Check and fill the argon gas supply.
2. Calibration Standards: Prepare a series of uranium calibration
standards from stock solution (ranging from 0.1 µg/L to 100 µg/
L).
3. Calibration Curve: Run the calibration standards through the
ICP-MS and generate a calibration curve. Ensure that the
correlation coefficient (r^2) is ≥ 0.995.
4. Quality Control Samples: Prepare and run uranium quality
control samples at low, mid, and high points of the calibration
curve.
C) URINE SAMPLE ANALYSIS
1. Introduction: Introduce the prepared urine samples into the
ICP-MS.
2. Analysis: Measure the uranium concentration in each sample
based on the established calibration curve.
3. Blank Samples: Run a blank sample (diH2O + nitric acid)
between every 5 urine samples to check for contamination or
carryover.
D) DATA RECORDING AND PROCESSING
1. Result Evaluation: Review the uranium concentration results
obtained from the ICP-MS.
2. QC Verification: Ensure that quality control results are within
acceptable ranges before processing patient samples.
3. Calculation: Calculate the final uranium concentration in urine,
ensuring it falls within the calibration range. If outliers or
abnormal values are noted, reanalyse the sample.
4. Reporting: Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) with units of µg/L. Any values below the detection
limit shall be reported as “< 0.1 µg/L”.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform instrument calibration using certified uranium standards
prior to sample analysis.
• Analyze control samples with known uranium concentrations to
ensure accuracy and precision.
• Conduct regular maintenance and calibration of the ICP-MS as
per manufacturer recommendations.
8. REPORTING
• Reference Intervals: To be defined based on laboratory and
clinical guidelines.
• Critical Results: Notify the relevant healthcare provider
immediately if uranium concentration exceeds 30 µg/L.
• Method Limitations: Document any matrix interferences or
analytical limitations encountered during the assay and report any
atypical findings.
