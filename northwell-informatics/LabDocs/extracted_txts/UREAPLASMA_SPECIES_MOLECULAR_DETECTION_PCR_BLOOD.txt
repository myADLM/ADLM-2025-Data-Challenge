UREAPLASMA SPECIES, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR,
BLOOD - Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
for the molecular detection of Ureaplasma species in a blood
sample using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This protocol
ensures the accuracy and reliability of test results, proper
documentation, and adherence to quality control measures.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the procedures as outlined and ensuring all required
quality control steps are followed. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any anomalies or deficiencies during the testing process and
notify a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE Specimen
Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes (Lavender top) or ACD (Acid
Citrate Dextrose) tubes (Yellow top).
Specimen Stability:
• Preferred: Process the blood sample immediately after collection.
• Acceptable: Blood samples can be stored at 2-8°C and
transported to the laboratory within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Clotted blood samples.
• Samples not kept at appropriate temperatures.
• Samples received outside the acceptable timeframe.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• Automated or manual nucleic acid extraction system
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filter tips
• PCR tubes or plates
• Ureaplasma species-specific primers and probes
• PCR Master Mix (including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control samples
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Invert the collected blood sample gently to mix.
2. Transfer 1 mL of blood to a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
3. If using manual extraction, follow the nucleic acid extraction
protocol specific to your extraction kit. For automated
extraction, load the samples as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
4.2 Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Perform nucleic acid extraction from blood samples using a
validated extraction method.
2. Elute the DNA in a final volume of 100 µL of nuclease-free
water.
3. Store the extracted DNA at 2-8°C if PCR is to be performed
within 24 hours. For longer storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
4.3 PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix in a clean environment, free from
any contamination. Use separate areas for reagent preparation,
DNA handling, and PCR product analysis.
2. For each reaction, prepare the following mix:
◦ Generally, a 20 µL reaction volume is used, consisting of:
▪ 10 µL of PCR Master Mix
▪ 1 µL of Ureaplasma-specific primer and probe mix
▪ 4 µL of nuclease-free water
▪ 5 µL of extracted DNA (sample) or control DNA
3. Pipette the mix into PCR tubes or wells of a PCR plate,
ensuring accurate dispensation and avoiding bubbles.
4.4 PCR Amplification:
1. Place the tubes or plates into the PCR thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions, or conditions specific to the primer and probe
system in use:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 45 seconds
3. Ensure the inclusion of positive controls, negative controls, and
a no-template control to validate each PCR run.
4.5 Post-PCR Analysis:
1. After amplification, analyze the PCR products using a real-time
PCR detection system.
2. Interpret the results based on threshold cycle (Ct) values. A
lower Ct value indicates a higher quantity of Ureaplasma DNA
present in the sample. Compare the Ct values of the unknown
samples with those of the controls to determine the presence of
Ureaplasma species.
4.6 Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with every batch of samples.
The positive control should yield a detectable Ct value, and the
negative control should show no amplification.
2. Record all results, including any discrepancies, in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
3. In case of control failure, the entire batch of samples must be
reprocessed.
4. DATA RECORDING AND REPORTING
5. Verify and review all results before reporting.
6. Report the presence or absence of Ureaplasma species based
on the PCR results.
7. Document any anomalies or issues encountered during the
testing process and notify the supervisor.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• A Ct value ≤35 is considered a positive result indicating the
presence of Ureaplasma species.
• A Ct value >35 or no amplification is considered a negative result
indicating the absence of Ureaplasma species.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the accompanying protocol
insert for particular limitations related to primers, probes, and
PCR assays. Note that false negatives may occur if there is
insufficient DNA or inhibitors in the sample. False positives may
arise from contamination; thus, stringent contamination control
measures must be adhered to strictly.
