Analytical Phase Protocol: UREAPLASMA SPECIES,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To describe the standardized procedures for molecular detection of
Ureaplasma species in plasma samples using PCR.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection unless frozen.
• Specimens not properly labelled with collection date/time.
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis.
Specimen Storage:
• Plasma samples must be stored at -20°C if not processed
immediately.
• Samples must be thawed gradually at 4°C before testing.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR workstation
• Thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Nucleic acid extraction, PCR kits (provided by manufacturer)
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kits (specific to the manufacturer’s instructions)
• Ureaplasma species-specific primers and probes
• PCR master mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control templates
Supplies:
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes/plate
• Lab consumables (pipette tips, gloves, tube racks)
4. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Plasma samples should be thawed at 4°C if frozen.
2. Vortex briefly to mix.
3. Centrifuge at 12,000 RPM for 10 minutes to pellet any cellular
debris.
DNA Extraction:
1. Extract nucleic acids from plasma according to the
manufacturer’s protocol using the provided DNA extraction kit.
2. Elute the DNA in nuclease-free water or the elution buffer
provided by the kit.
PCR Setup:
1. Label each PCR tube/plate with patient ID, appropriate controls,
and blank (negative control).
2. Prepare the master mix as per the reagent kit instructions.
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes/plate.
4. Add specific primers and probes for Ureaplasma species.
5. Add extracted DNA to the corresponding tubes/wells.
6. Include a positive control, a negative control, and a blank
control (without DNA).
Thermal Cycling Conditions:
1. Perform PCR in the thermal cycler following the cycling
parameters recommended by the primer/probe manufacturer.
Typical settings may be:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 60 seconds (repeated for 40 cycles)
Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Analyze the amplification results through gel electrophoresis or
using a real-time PCR system.
2. Confirm the presence of expected PCR product size (consult
specific size based on the PCR kit used).
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Interpretation:
1. Positive result: identification of amplified product specific to
Ureaplasma species.
2. Negative result: no amplification observed in sample and
negative control only, with correct amplification in positive
control.
3. Indeterminate: if amplification is observed in the negative
control, perform troubleshooting and repeat the test.
Documentation:
1. Record all observations, including cycle threshold (Ct) values,
for real-time PCR.
2. Verify and sign the result report.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Critical Results Reporting:
1. Positive results indicating Ureaplasma infection must be
reviewed by the supervising technologist.
2. Communicate positive results to the requesting physician
immediately, following institutional guidelines for critical result
reporting.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Initial Setup Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Ensure controls run correctly.
Ongoing QC:
1. Include internal control sample in each run.
2. Document any irregularities and take corrective actions
promptly.
3. Perform bi-weekly comparisons for consistency between runs.
