Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Ureaplasma Species,
Molecular Detection by PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide clear instructions for the
molecular detection of Ureaplasma species in clinical specimens
using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology. This includes
the procedures for specimen preparation, PCR assay setup,
amplification, detection, and result interpretation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the PCR
assay and documenting results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that the procedure is followed consistently and that
corrective actions are taken when necessary.
2. DEFINITION
Ureaplasma species are small bacteria lacking a cell wall, often
detected in urogenital tract infections. This protocol uses PCR to
amplify and detect specific DNA sequences unique to Ureaplasma
species.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Endocervical swabs, urine, or urethral swabs.
• Acceptable: Amniotic fluid, placenta, and other tissues as
indicated.
Specimen Collection Guidelines:
• Swabs should be placed in a transport medium suitable for
nucleic acid preservation.
• Urine specimens should be first catch, collected in a sterile
container.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as soon as
possible, ideally within 24 hours, and stored at 2-8°C during
transport.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not stored at the appropriate temperature.
• Specimens with significant contamination.
• Specimens received beyond the acceptable timeframe for
processing.
4. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• PCR Master Mix with Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and buffer
• Ureaplasma-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control DNA
Supplies:
• Sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers
• PCR tubes or plates
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• DNA extraction kits
Equipment:
• Class II Biosafety Cabinet
• Refrigerators for reagent and specimen storage (2-8°C)
• Freezer for long-term specimen storage (-20°C or lower)
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Real-time PCR thermal cycler
• UV spectrophotometer or fluorometer for DNA quantitation
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Extract DNA from specimens using a commercially available
DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA concentration using a UV spectrophotometer
or fluorometer.
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C or use immediately for PCR
setup.
B. PCR Assay Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice.
2. Label PCR tubes or wells of a PCR plate.
3. Prepare a PCR master mix according to the following template,
scaled to the number of reactions needed plus 10% extra to
account for pipetting losses:
| Component | Volume per Reaction |
|---------------------|----------------------| | PCR Master Mix | 12.5 µL | |
Ureaplasma Primers | 2.5 µL | | Ureaplasma Probes | 2.5 µL | |
Nuclease-free Water | 5 µL | | Extracted DNA | 25 ng |
1. Vortex the master mix briefly and aliquot 22.5 µL into each PCR
tube or well.
2. Add 2.5 µL of extracted DNA to each PCR tube or well. For
positive and negative controls, add 2.5 µL of positive control
DNA and 2.5 µL of nuclease-free water, respectively.
3. Seal PCR tubes or plate and place in the pre-cooled thermal
cycler.
C. PCR Amplification:
Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions, ensuring a
final volume of 25 µL per reaction:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
• Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
• Annealing and extension: 60°C for 1 minute (45 cycles)
• Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
• Hold: 4°C
D. Detection and Analysis:
1. Following the PCR run, analyze the amplification data using the
thermal cycler's software.
2. Check for the presence of the Ureaplasma-specific
amplification signal in the sample wells.
3. Positive control wells should show amplification at expected Ct
values. The negative control should show no amplification.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
confirm assay validity.
• Repeat test if controls do not perform as expected.
• Verify new lots of reagents by running tests on known positive and
negative specimens.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the Ct values for each sample.
• Results interpretation:
◦ Positive for Ureaplasma: Amplification signal detected at Ct
<40.
◦ Negative for Ureaplasma: No amplification signal detected or
Ct ≥40.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Always include a statement regarding the Ct threshold used for
interpretation.
8. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• The expected result for a healthy individual without Ureaplasma
infection is negative (no amplification detected).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• PCR inhibitors in the specimen may cause false-negative results.
• Contamination can lead to false-positive results; strict adherence
to contamination control practices is required.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all biosafety regulations for handling human specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including gloves
and lab coat.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to the laboratory’s
waste management protocols.

procedure.
