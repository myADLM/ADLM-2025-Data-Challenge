Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Procedure Title: Analytical Phase of Generating UREA Results
for 24 Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing
UREA concentration in 24-hour urine specimens to ensure accurate
and reliable results for clinical decision making.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of UREA concentration in 24-hour urine specimens in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff are responsible for performing the analysis,
documenting results, and ensuring adherence to this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance, performing
quality control checks, and addressing any discrepancies.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 24-hour urine collection in a clean, sterile container.
• Ensure specimen volume is recorded and the container is
properly labeled with the patient’s information and collection time.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in containers with preservatives or
contaminants.
• Specimens not labeled with required patient and collection
information.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501)
• UREA reagent kit specific to the analyzer
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Lab timer
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Wear appropriate PPE.
3. Verify specimen labeling and volume.
6.2 Analysis:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen thoroughly.
2. Pour an aliquot of the urine specimen into a labeled secondary
container.
3. Load the aliquot onto the automated chemistry analyzer.
4. Select and input the UREA test parameters according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
5. Initiate the test run.
6. Document the test run in the laboratory log.
6.3 Result Verification:
1. Upon completion of the test run, review and verify the results
displayed by the analyzer.
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. If results are outside the expected range or flags are present,
perform a repeat analysis or troubleshoot equipment as
necessary (follow manufacturer’s guidelines).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Quality control material with known UREA concentrations, stored
according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
Procedure:
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens.
2. Document quality control results in the QC log.
3. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, do not report patient
results. Investigate and resolve the issue, then re-run the
analysis.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify results in the LIS.
2. Attach relevant comments or flag critical values if necessary.
3. Follow site-specific guidelines for result reporting and
communicate critical results immediately to the ordering
clinician.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to analyzer’s reference material or laboratory’s established
reference intervals for UREA in 24-hour urine.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Avoid contamination of urine specimen.
• Ensure adherence to reagent storage and usage guidelines
based on manufacturer's insert.
REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert for UREA reagent kit used with the analyzer.
• Laboratory’s protocol for urine collection and handling.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all results, any troubleshooting steps, and QC results in
the laboratory log.
• Ensure proper documentation is maintained for regulatory
compliance and quality assurance purposes.
