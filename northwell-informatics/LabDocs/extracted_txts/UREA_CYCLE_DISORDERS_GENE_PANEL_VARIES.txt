Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Urea Cycle Disorders Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedures for performing the analytical
phase of generating results for the Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD)
Gene Panel.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel, including molecular
technologists and laboratory supervisors, are responsible for
conducting and overseeing the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing results,
addressing discrepancies, and ensuring compliance with this
SOP.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Amplification Kit
• Qubit or NanoDrop Spectrophotometer
• Thermal Cycler (PCR machine)
• Agarose Gel Electrophoresis System
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq)
• Bioinformatics analysis software (e.g., BaseSpace, VariantStudio)
• Pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and Freezer (-20°C)
• Laboratory bench and PPE (personal protective equipment)
1. PREPARATION
3.1 Specimen Handling
• Acceptable specimens: Whole blood, saliva or tissues collected in
EDTA tubes or appropriate specimen collection containers.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 7
days of collection for blood and within 30 days for saliva. For
tissues, store at -80°C until ready for DNA extraction.
3.2 DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA from specimens using the DNA Extraction Kit as per
manufacturer’s protocol.
• Quantify extracted DNA using Qubit or NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer.
• Ensure DNA purity (A260/A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0).
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 PCR Amplification
• Prepare PCR reactions using specific primers for UCD genes.
• Set up reactions according to PCR Amplification Kit instructions.
• Include positive and negative control samples.
• Amplify target regions using the Thermal Cycler.
4.2 Verification of PCR Products
• Run PCR products on a 1.5% agarose gel (90V for 45 minutes) to
verify successful amplification.
• Visualize using a UV transilluminator and document results.
4.3 Library Preparation for NGS
• Prepare sequencing libraries using the PCR products as per NGS
platform protocols.
• Quantify and normalize libraries to the required concentration.
• Pool libraries for sequencing, ensuring enough copies/sample.
4.4 Sequencing Run
• Load pooled libraries on the NGS platform following
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Monitor sequencing run and address any alerts or issues.
4.5 Bioinformatics Analysis
• Transfer sequence data to bioinformatics analysis software.
• Perform quality control checks on raw data.
• Align reads to reference genome and call variants.
• Annotate variants using appropriate databases (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP).
1. RESULT GENERATION AND INTERPRETATION
5.1 Data Review
• Review variant calls and annotation results for accuracy.
• Reconfirm suspicious variants by Sanger sequencing if required.
• Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines.
5.2 Quality Control
• Analyze positive and negative controls to confirm the validity of
results.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken during the
process.
5.3 Result Reporting
• Compile results into a standardized report format.
• Include identified variants, their significance, and any
recommendations.
• Review final report for accuracy and completeness.
• Sign-off by authorized personnel before releasing the report.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain detailed records of all steps performed, including
specimen details, extraction yields, PCR setup, library
preparation, and sequencing run logs.
• Keep traceability of all reagents and consumables used.
• Store copies of final reports and raw data securely as per
laboratory data retention policies.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If PCR fails, re-evaluate primer design, DNA template quality, and
amplification conditions.
• If sequencing quality is suboptimal, inspect library preparation
steps and ensure accurate pooling.
• For bioinformatics issues, verify software settings, and ensure
correct reference genome usage.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocols for DNA Extraction Kit, PCR
Amplification Kit, and NGS Platform.
• ACMG Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of
Sequence Variants.
• Bioinformatics software user guides for data analysis.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the analytical
phase of generating results for the Urea Cycle Disorders Gene Panel
is standardized, accurate, and reliable.
