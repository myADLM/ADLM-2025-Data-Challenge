1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and reliable determination
of urea nitrogen in body fluid specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
steps outlined in this procedure and ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of the results.
Definitions:
Urea nitrogen is a waste product formed from the breakdown of
proteins and is measured as an indicator of renal function.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 5-10 mL of body fluid (e.g., peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, or
synovial fluid) collected in a sterile container.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimens should be processed as soon as possible after
collection.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, specimens can be stored at
2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be aliquoted and frozen
at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 2 hours.
• Specimens that are visibly hemolyzed or contaminated.
• Specimens without proper labeling (e.g., lacking patient
identification, collection date/time).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer (e.g. Beckman Coulter AU480 or similar)
• Calibrators and controls for urea nitrogen analysis
• Sterile specimen containers
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) as per laboratory safety
protocols
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and calibrators are at room temperature
before use.
2. Verify the calibration of the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Sample Handling:
1. Thoroughly mix the body fluid specimen by gentle inversion.
2. If necessary, centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to remove any cellular debris.
3. Pipette the supernatant into a sample cup, avoiding any
sediment.
Analysis:
1. Load the sample cup onto the analyzer according to the
instrument’s instructions.
2. Select the appropriate assay for urea nitrogen.
3. Run the analysis according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Interpreting Results:
1. The analyzer will automatically generate urea nitrogen results
expressed in mg/dL or mmol/L.
2. Compare the results to reference intervals:
◦ Reference intervals may vary based on the type of body
fluid and clinical context.
3. Review the results for any flags or error messages.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (at least two levels) at the start of
each shift, with new reagent lots, and after any major
instrument maintenance.
2. Document all quality control results.
3. If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot the issue and re-run the controls before analyzing
patient specimens.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify results against established reference intervals.
6. Report the urea nitrogen results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
7. Include a comment if results are outside of the expected range,
indicating possible clinical relevance.
8. If any critical values are obtained, notify the appropriate
healthcare provider immediately as per the laboratory’s critical
value policy.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia or icterus can interfere with the accurate
measurement of urea nitrogen.
• Certain medications and clinical conditions may also affect urea
nitrogen levels. Refer to the analyzer’s manual and clinical
literature for detailed interference information.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines and package inserts for the urea
nitrogen assay and analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of specimen handling, analysis, quality
control, and any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure that results are securely and accurately recorded in the
LIS and communicated to relevant healthcare providers.
