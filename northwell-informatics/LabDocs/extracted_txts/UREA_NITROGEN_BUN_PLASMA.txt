Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measurement of Urea
Nitrogen (BUN) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the
measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in plasma samples in
order to ensure consistent and accurate results. This procedure
applies to all plasma samples received in the laboratory designated
for BUN testing.
2. DEFINITIONS
BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen): A measure of the amount of nitrogen in
the blood that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made
when protein is broken down in the body.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel who have completed appropriate
training are responsible for following this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance and
to address any issues that arise during testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Type: Plasma collected in lithium heparin
(green-top) tubes.
• Acceptable Specimen Type: Plasma collected in EDTA
(lavender-top) or SST (serum separator tube, marble-top) tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of plasma.
• Specimen Stability: Plasma samples should be refrigerated at
2-8°C if not analyzed immediately and are stable for up to 7 days.
For long-term storage, freeze plasma at -20°C or below.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of measuring urea
nitrogen.
• Calibrators and controls specific to the analyzer being used.
• Reagent kit for urea nitrogen (BUN) determination.
• Precision pipettes and tips.
• Quality control materials (low, normal, and high BUN levels).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Equipment
1. Ensure the chemistry analyzer is calibrated and performs
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run the analyzer's startup routine if applicable, and ensure all
necessary reagents are loaded and at the proper temperature.
6.2 Preparation of Reagents
1. Follow manufacturer's instructions to prepare the urea nitrogen
reagent kit.
2. Load the reagents onto the analyzer, and ensure the reagents
are at the appropriate temperature as per the manufacturer
instructions.
3. Verify the expiration date of all reagents; do not use expired
reagents.
6.3 Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the plasma sample is properly labeled with patient
identification and is within the accepted stability period.
2. If the plasma has been frozen, thaw completely and gently mix
to ensure homogeneity.
6.4 Measurement Procedure
1. Place the plasma sample into sample cups or appropriate
containers on the analyzer.
2. Ensure the analyzer settings are correct for BUN testing.
3. Initiate the analysis according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. The analyzer will automatically measure the BUN concentration
and display results.
6.5 Quality Control
1. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift, after
reagent loading, whenever there is a change in reagent lot, and
at intervals recommended by the manufacturer.
2. Log the QC results, ensuring they fall within the acceptable
range specified by the manufacturer.
3. If QC results fall outside of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer's manual, repeat the QC, and do not
report patient results until QC is accepted.
7. RECORDING AND REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are transmitted automatically to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
2. Review and verify the results ensuring the absence of error
flags or abnormal instrument messages.
3. If manual entry into the LIS is required, ensure accurate
transcription of results.
4. Critical values should be indicated according to laboratory
protocols and reported immediately to the requesting physician.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Range: 8-23 mg/dL. Reference intervals may slightly
vary by laboratory and should be verified against your institution's
standard.
9. PROCEDURE NOTES
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with BUN
determination and should not be used.
• Ensure all equipment maintenance logs are up-to-date and any
malfunction is reported immediately for rectification.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard precautions to prevent exposure to potentially
infectious materials.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to institutional policies.
