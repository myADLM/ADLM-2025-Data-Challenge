Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Urea
Nitrogen in Urine (24 Hour Collection)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase in
generating accurate and reliable results for Urea Nitrogen in a 24-
hour urine collection.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable: A 24-hour urine collection.
◦ Collection protocol: Ensure patient collects all urine voided
over a 24-hour period in a provided container. The patient
should be instructed to discard the first voiding and start
collecting from the second voiding onwards for the next 24
hours, including the first voiding of the following day.
◦ Volume: Total urine collection should be accurately recorded.
Ideally, the total volume should be brought to the laboratory.
◦ Storage: Refrigerate the collected urine during the collection
period or store securely in a supplied container with
preservatives.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with less than 24 hours of collection.
◦ Specimens stored improperly or with unstable preservatives.
◦ Specimens arriving without proper labeling of collection date
and time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urea Nitrogen assay kits (specific manufacturer details and lot
number)
• Calibrated pipette
• Automated analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501 or another
validated system)
• Specimen cups
• Calibrated collection container
• Deionized water
• Preservatives (if required, per manufacturer’s protocol)
• Quality control materials (two levels of QC)
4. PROCEDURE
1. Pretreatment of Sample:
◦ Confirm patient information and specimen labeling.
◦ Mix the 24-hour collected urine thoroughly.
◦ Measure and record the total volume of urine collected.
◦ Pipette an aliquot of the mixed urine sample into a labeled
specimen cup.
2. Preparation:
◦ Check and calibrate the automated analyzer as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Ensure urea nitrogen assay reagents are within their expiry
date and stored appropriately.
◦ Prepare necessary quality control materials and run them
before patient samples.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load the urine specimen into the automated analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate assay for Urea Nitrogen.
◦ Run the analysis according to equipment-specific protocols.
◦ Wait for the instrument to generate results.
4. Post-Analysis:
◦ Review the instrument printout for any flags or errors.
◦ Ensure all measured parameters are within acceptable
limits.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Routine QC:
◦ Run two levels of QC material (negative and positive) daily
before analyzing patient samples.
◦ Ensure QC results fall within established acceptable ranges;
otherwise, recalibrate and rerun QC.
◦ Document QC results according to laboratory protocol.
• External QC:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure accuracy
and precision of results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Verify and review the results.
◦ If unevaluated values are seen due to QC failure, do not report
the patient result until QC issues are rectified.
• Enter patient result comments as needed (e.g., interference or
specimen issues).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to site-specific guidelines or manufacturer’s insert for
reference intervals of urine urea nitrogen.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Any limitations specific to the assay and reagent kit will be
documented per the manufacturer's insert.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow instrument error codes and handling procedures per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• If results are inconsistent or there is a problem with the specimen,
consult the on-call supervisor for immediate troubleshooting.

By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate,
reproducible, and reliable measurements of urea nitrogen in 24-hour
urine samples. All steps must be meticulously documented, ensuring
Compliance with CLIA regulations.
