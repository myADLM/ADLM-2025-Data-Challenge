Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for UREA NITROGEN,
URINE, RANDOM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standard instructions for
the analysis of Urea Nitrogen levels in random urine specimens.
Responsibility:
• All laboratory staff performing Urea Nitrogen analysis must ensure
proper adherence to this SOP to achieve accurate and reliable
results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance with
this SOP and addressing any identified issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Random urine sample.
• Collection Container: Clean, dry, and non-reactive container
(e.g., sterile urine collection cup).
• Specimen Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of urine is required for
testing.
• Specimen Stability: Urine specimens should be analyzed within
2 hours of collection. If this is not possible, samples should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Urea Nitrogen reagent set (appropriate for the analyzer being
used, follow manufacturer's instructions for storage and
preparation).
• Calibrators and controls (appropriate for the urea nitrogen test).
• Urine analyzer (with the capability of measuring urea nitrogen).
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
1. EQUIPMENT
• Automated urine analyzer.
• Pipettes/dispensers.
• Calibration standards and control materials.
• Urea Nitrogen reagent kit.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves and lab coat.
2. Ensure the urine analyzer is calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Specimen Handling:
1. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Aliquot required volume of urine into the appropriate sample
cup or tube provided by the analyzer manufacturer.
C. Analyzing the Sample:
1. Place the aliquoted urine specimen into the analyzer.
2. Select the appropriate test panel for Urea Nitrogen.
3. Start the analysis process according to the manufacturer's
operator manual.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, after
any maintenance, and with each batch of specimens. Ensure
controls fall within the acceptable range.
2. Document the control results in the quality control log.
E. Result Interpretation:
1. Upon completion of the analysis, review the results for each
specimen to ensure they fall within the expected biological
range.
2. Any results that fall outside of the average range should be re-
checked, and the specimen should be reanalyzed if necessary.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be recorded in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) as soon as they are validated.
• Flag any critical or out-of-range results according to institutional
protocols.
• Provide results to authorized personnel through the LIS.
1. REFERENCE RANGES
• Urea Nitrogen: 7-20 mg/dL (Reference ranges may vary based on
population and should be verified according to the laboratory's
policies).
1. LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Interferences: Certain medications and contaminants can
interfere with accurate results. Document any noted interferences.
• Instrument Error: If the analyzer indicates an error, follow the
troubleshooting steps in the operator's manual.
• Sample Quality: Ensure urine samples are free from debris or
contamination to avoid erroneous results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Maintain records of all calibration, control, and maintenance logs.
• Address any out-of-range QC results immediately and document
corrective actions.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing as part of a QA program.
