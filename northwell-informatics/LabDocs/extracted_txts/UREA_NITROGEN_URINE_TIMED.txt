Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the Analytical Phase:
UREA NITROGEN, URINE, TIMED
1. PURPOSE: To outline the analytical procedure for the
determination of Urea Nitrogen in a timed urine specimen.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to perform the urea nitrogen test according to this procedure and
ensure accuracy and precision by adhering to quality control
measures.
1. DEFINITION: Urea Nitrogen is a biochemical marker used to
evaluate renal function and nitrogen balance. It is measured
from a timed urine specimen collected over a 24-hour period.
2. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION: Specimen:
Preferred Specimen: 24-hour urine collection in a clean,
appropriately labeled container.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Urine collected for less than or more than the required 24-hour
period.
• Contaminated specimens (e.g., presence of feces, toilet paper)
• Specimens without a proper label showing patient identification,
date, time of start and end of collection.
Specimen Handling:
• Mix the collected urine well before taking an aliquot for testing.
• Measure total volume of 24-hour urine and record.
• Aliquot 10-20 mL of well-mixed urine into a secondary container
and label it.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Urea Nitrogen reagent kit
• Urine specimens (24-hour collection)
• Calibrators
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (or appropriate manual method)
1. EQUIPMENT:
• Centrifuge
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (Capable of measuring Urea
Nitrogen)
• Pipettes and tips
• Urine Collection Container
1. PROCEDURE: A. Preparation of Reagents and Calibration:
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the urea
nitrogen reagent working solution.
3. Calibrate the analyzer using the appropriate urea nitrogen
standards as per manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Validate the calibration using quality control materials at least
two levels (low and high).
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that the urine sample is thoroughly mixed.
2. Centrifuge the urine sample for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm if
particulate matter is present.
3. Load the sample into the analyzer as per equipment guidelines.
4. Input patient information and total volume of 24-hour urine at
the analyzer interface (for calculation of results).
C. Analytical Run:
1. Place calibrators, controls, and patient samples on the
analyzer.
2. Run the samples following the analyzer’s instructions for urea
nitrogen assay.
3. Monitor the analyzer for any flags or errors.
D. Troubleshooting:
1. If the analyzer flags a sample, recheck the sample preparation
and rerun the sample.
2. For repeated errors, verify reagent and instrument performance
before proceeding with sample analysis.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
4. Run quality control materials with each batch of samples.
5. Document and review QC results. Controls must fall within the
established ranges. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot,
and correct the issue before analyzing patient samples.
6. Record all calibrations, QC results, and any corrective actions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
8. The analyzer will calculate the concentration of urea nitrogen in
mg/dL (or mmol/L).
9. Convert the urea nitrogen concentration per volume to a total
24-hour excretion amount using the formula:
Urea Nitrogen (mg/24h) = [Urea Nitrogen (mg/dL)] x [Total urine
volume (dL/24h)]
10. Review and verify the results.
11. Report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
12. REFERENCE INTERVAL:
• Reference intervals should be determined based on population
studies or the manufacturer's instructions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Interferences: Certain substances may interfere with the urea
nitrogen assay. Refer to the reagent package insert for a detailed
list of potential interferences.
• Specific gravity: Extremely dilute or concentrated urine may affect
the assay result.
1. RECORDKEEPING:
• Retain records of patient results, calibration data, and quality
control logs according to laboratory policy.
