Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Urea in Random
Urine
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for accurate and precise determination of
urea levels in random urine samples for diagnostic and monitoring
purposes.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to
follow this procedure and to ensure that the results are accurate,
reliable, and reported in a timely manner. Any deviations, anomalies,
or issues during the procedure should be reported to the supervising
laboratory staff.
1. SCOPE
This procedure covers the analytical process starting from the receipt
of a random urine sample to the generation of results for urea
concentration.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Random urine sample collected in a clean urine container. No
preservatives are required. Ensure a minimum volume of 10 mL is
collected. Unacceptable:
• Urine samples received more than 24 hours post-collection if not
stored at 2-8°C.
• Specimens with visible contamination or insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Beckman Coulter AU680)
• Urea reagent kit (compatible with the analyzer used, e.g.,
Beckman Coulter Urea/BUN reagent)
• Calibrators and quality control (QC) materials (e.g., Bio-Rad
Liquichek Urinalysis Control)
• Pipettes
• Urine sample cups or tubes
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Pre-analytical Procedures: a. Confirm that the urine sample has
been properly received, labeled, and logged into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). b. Inspect the sample for adequacy
(sufficient volume and absence of contamination). c. Mix the urine
gently to ensure homogeneity.
5.2. Calibration and Quality Control: a. Prepare and run calibration
standards as per the manufacturer’s instructions. b. Prepare QC
samples and run them at the beginning of the analytical run, after
calibration, and at specified intervals throughout the analysis. Record
and verify that the QC results are within the acceptable range. c. If
QC results fall outside the acceptable range, investigate and resolve
the issue before proceeding with patient samples.
5.3. Analytical Procedures: a. Load the urine samples onto the
automated analyzer following the device instructions. b. Select the
appropriate assay parameters for urea determination on the analyzer.
c. Start the analysis. The analyzer will automatically measure urea
levels based on the enzymatic or chemical method specified by the
reagent kit manufacturer. d. Upon completion, review the automated
analyzer’s output for each specimen.
5.4. Post-analytical Procedures: a. Transmit the results from the
analyzer to the LIS. b. Review the results and verify that they fall
within the expected physiological range for urea in random urine. c.
Investigate any outliers or abnormal results as necessary. Repeat the
analysis if needed to confirm outliers.
5.5. Result Interpretation and Reporting: a. Report the urea
concentration in mg/dL according to the LIS guidelines. b. If results
are within the critical value threshold, follow the standard laboratory
protocol for communicating critical values to the healthcare provider
immediately.
5.6. Documentation and Data Management: a. Document all steps of
the procedure, including calibration, QC data, sample processing,
and result entry in the LIS. b. Maintain records of calibrations, QC
results, and any corrective actions taken in case of deviations. c.
Properly store the test results and related documentation in
compliance with laboratory standards and regulatory requirements.
5.7. Maintenance: a. Perform routine maintenance of the analyzer as
per the manufacturer’s guidelines. b. Record maintenance activities
and instrument performance checks according to the laboratory’s
maintenance schedule.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The expected reference interval for urea in random urine will be
provided based on established laboratory standards or specific
analyzer/reagent kit insert.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for any limitations related to the
reagent’s performance and potential interferences that may affect
urea measurement.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
a. Confirm that QC results are logged and reviewed with each batch
of samples analyzed. b. Any deviations or corrective actions taken
should be documented and reviewed during periodic quality
evaluations.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
a. Ensure all personnel handling urine samples wear appropriate
PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles). b. Follow biohazard waste
disposal guidelines for the disposal of urine and other waste
materials.
1. REFERENCES: Include the references to the reagent kit’s
package insert, analyzer’s user manual, and any other relevant
literature used in developing this SOP.
By ensuring adherence to this procedure, the accuracy, reliability, and
timeliness of urea concentration results in random urine samples can
be maintained, contributing to optimal patient care and diagnostic
accuracy.
