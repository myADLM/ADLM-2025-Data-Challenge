Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Uric Acid, 24-Hour Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized instructions for
the accurate and reliable measurement of uric acid in a 24-hour urine
sample.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
testing and analysis of uric acid in 24-hour urine samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure accurate and timely testing of uric acid in 24-hour urine
samples and to follow this SOP at all times. The laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring SOP compliance and
addressing any issues or deviations that may arise.
1. DEFINITIONS:
• Uric Acid: A chemical created when the body breaks down
substances called purines. High levels can indicate medical
conditions such as gout or renal issues.
• 24-Hour Urine Collection: Urine collected over a 24-hour period
to provide a comprehensive profile of substances filtered by the
kidneys.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Collection: Collected urine over a 24-hour period.
• Container: Clean, leak-proof container, labeled with patient
details and start/end times of collection.
• Volume: The total urine volume collected should be recorded and
aliquoted for testing.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: Stable for 24 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received without appropriate patient identification
details.
• Specimens not stored under the prescribed conditions.
• Specimens containing preservatives that may interfere with uric
acid measurement.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c System).
• Reagents for uric acid analysis.
• Calibrators and controls specific to uric acid assays.
• Quality control materials.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Verify specimen identification with the accompanying
requisition.
2. Record the total urine volume collected over the 24-hour period.
3. Mix the 24-hour urine sample thoroughly and aliquot the sample
for analysis.
Analyzing:
1. Set up the automated chemistry analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the uric acid reagents, calibrators, and quality control
materials into the analyzer.
3. Enter the patient and sample identification into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4. Place the aliquoted urine samples in the sample rack of the
analyzer.
5. Follow the analyzer's procedure to initiate the test and ensure
proper calibration.
Calculation and Interpretation:
1. The analyzer will measure the uric acid concentration in the
urine sample.
2. Calculate the total uric acid excretion over the 24-hour period
using the formula: [ \text{Total Uric Acid (mg/24hr)} = \text{Uric
Acid Concentration (mg/dL)} \times \text{Total Urine Volume
(dL)} ]
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control checks using two levels (low and high) of
control materials each day of testing.
• Ensure all QC results fall within the acceptable range provided by
the manufacturer.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review and verify results in the LIS.
• Include the total volume of urine collected over the 24-hour period
in the patient report.
• Reference Range: 250–750 mg/24 hours.
• Report any significant deviations or critical values as per
laboratory policy.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• For instrument errors, refer to the analyzer’s manual for
troubleshooting steps.
• In cases of QC failure, re-run the QC materials. If the issue
persists, consult a supervisor for further action.
• If the sample integrity is in question (e.g., signs of contamination
or improper preservation), request a new sample collection.

This SOP must be followed precisely to ensure the accurate and
reliable measurement of uric acid in 24-hour urine samples. Any
deviations or issues should be documented and reported immediately
to the laboratory supervisor.
