Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Uric Acid in
Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed and standardized procedures for the analytical
phase of uric acid determination in body fluids. This SOP ensures the
consistent, accurate, and reliable measurement of uric acid levels in
specified body fluids.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of uric acid in body fluids. Specimens covered under this
SOP include peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and synovial fluid.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the uric acid analyses according to this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure that staff are adequately trained and
proficient in this procedure.
• All staff must report any deviations or issues encountered during
the procedure to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Type of Specimen:
• Acceptable specimens include peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and
synovial fluid.
4.2 Collection and Handling:
• Specimens should be collected using standard sterile techniques.
• Specimens must be free from hemolysis, contamination, and
visible particulate matter.
• All specimens should be labeled with at least two patient
identifiers, date, and time of collection.
4.3 Storage:
• Store the specimens at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours of
collection.
4.4 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, contaminated, clotted, or
incorrectly labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche COBAS, Beckman
Coulter AU series)
5.2 Reagents:
• Uric acid reagent (as per manufacturer’s specifications)
• Calibrators and quality control materials (2 levels: normal and
abnormal)
5.3 Supplies:
• Pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Sample cups or tubes specific to the analyzer
• Gloves, lab coats, and eye protection
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and that reagent levels are
adequate.
• Perform daily quality control using normal and abnormal control
materials. Document all QC results and ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
6.2 Sample Preparation:
• Mix the body fluid specimen well before analysis.
• Centrifuge specimens at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to remove
cellular components if necessary.
• Transfer the clear supernatant to a sample cup for analysis.
6.3 Analytical Procedure:
• Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions
for uric acid analysis.
• Place the sample cups in the analyzer sample tray following the
worklist order.
6.4 During Analysis:
• Monitor the analyzer for any alerts or errors.
• Record any deviations or unusual observations that occur during
the analysis.
6.5 Post-Analysis:
• Retrieve the results from the analyzer.
• Review results for any flags or abnormalities.
• Perform additional testing if necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Run two levels of quality control (QC) material daily (normal and
abnormal) before patient samples.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
• Ensure QC results are within acceptable limits. If not, troubleshoot
and take corrective action before proceeding with patient
samples.
7.2 External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in a recognized external quality assurance (EQA)
program to ensure accuracy and reliability.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 Reference Ranges:
• Uric Acid (Body Fluid): Not established (to be evaluated in the
context of clinical scenario).
8.2 Result Entry:
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
accurately.
• Ensure confidentiality and accuracy when transcribing results.
8.3 Critical Results and Interpretations:
• Any critical or unexpected results should be reviewed, confirmed,
and communicated to the appropriate clinical team immediately
as per laboratory policy.
8.4 Documentation:
• Record all analytical results, including any repeat tests or
deviations, in the patient report.
• Maintain all documentation as per regulatory and accreditation
standards.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The analysis is limited by the quality and integrity of the specimen
received.
• Hemolysis and lipemia may interfere with results and should be
noted if present.
• Specific interferences as detailed by the reagent/instrument
manufacturer.
