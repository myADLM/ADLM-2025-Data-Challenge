Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Uric
Acid/Creatinine Ratio in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable measurement of the uric acid/
creatinine ratio in random urine samples using standardized
laboratory procedures.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
conducting uric acid and creatinine analysis in random urine
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory technologists/technicians: Conduct the analytical
testing, ensure quality control, and report results.
• Supervisors: Review and verify results, ensure compliance with
SOP, and address any issues or discrepancies.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Random urine sample
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL
• Collection: Freshly voided, non-contaminated, collected in a
clean, dry container.
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature: Stable for up to 2 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 24 hours.
◦ Frozen (-20°C): Stable for longer storage.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated biochemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Advia)
• Reagents and calibrators specific for uric acid and creatinine
assays
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Urine containers
• Quality control materials (e.g., Bio-Rad Urine Chemistry Controls)
• Calibration standards
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and in proper working
condition.
• Confirm that all reagents and quality control materials are within
their expiration dates and properly stored.
• Set up the analyzer with the appropriate uric acid and creatinine
assays.
6.2 Sample Handling
• Mix the urine sample well before aliquoting to ensure
homogeneity.
• If the sample has been refrigerated, allow it to come to room
temperature before analysis and mix thoroughly.
6.3 Analysis
6.3.1 Uric Acid Measurement
1. Using a pipette, aliquot the required volume of urine (as per
analyzer requirement) into the sample cup.
2. Load the sample cup onto the biochemistry analyzer.
3. Select and run the uric acid assay according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Record the uric acid concentration provided by the analyzer.
6.3.2 Creatinine Measurement
1. Using a separate pipette tip, aliquot the required volume of
urine into another sample cup.
2. Load the sample cup onto the biochemistry analyzer.
3. Select and run the creatinine assay according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Record the creatinine concentration provided by the analyzer.
6.4 Calculation of Uric Acid/Creatinine Ratio
1. Ensure that the uric acid and creatinine values are expressed in
the same units (e.g., mg/dL or mmol/L).
2. Calculate the uric acid/creatinine ratio using the following
formula:
Uric Acid/Creatinine Ratio = (Uric Acid concentration) /
(Creatinine concentration)
3. Record the ratio in the laboratory information system (LIS).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials for both uric acid and creatinine
assays according to the laboratory's quality control schedule and
document the results.
• Acceptable ranges for quality control materials should be
established and followed to ensure assay accuracy.
• If the QC results fall outside the acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
the assay, repeat the QC, and do not report patient results until
QC is within range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results for accuracy and consistency.
• Report the uric acid/creatinine ratio to the clinician or in the LIS as
per site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Review any flagged results or critical values according to
laboratory policy.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for uric acid and creatinine assays.
• Laboratory Quality Control and Assurance Manuals.
• Clinical guidelines and literature on the interpretation of uric acid/
creatinine ratios.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all samples tested, including patient
identification, date and time of analysis, results, and technologist
initials.
• Document all quality control and maintenance activities.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety procedures, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological specimens with care and assume they are
potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to local regulations
and laboratory policies.
