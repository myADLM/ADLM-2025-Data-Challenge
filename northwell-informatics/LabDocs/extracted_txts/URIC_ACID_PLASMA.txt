Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Uric Acid,
Plasma Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for the analysis of uric acid in plasma
samples. This procedure ensures accurate, consistent, and timely
results in uric acid testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the uric
acid analysis and documenting the results according to this
procedure. It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to identify
and report any issues that may affect test outcomes to a supervisor.
3. DEFINITION
Uric acid is a waste product found in the blood. It is created when the
body breaks down substances called purines. High levels of uric acid
in plasma can lead to a condition known as hyperuricemia, and may
contribute to diseases such as gout and kidney stones.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma obtained from a properly collected
and handled lithium heparin, EDTA, or sodium fluoride/potassium
oxalate vacutainer tube.
• Volume: A minimum of 2 mL plasma is required for analysis.
• Stability: Samples must be analyzed within 48 hours if stored at
2-8°C. If storage exceeds this period, samples should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Centrifuge, automated chemistry analyzer
• Reagents: Uric acid reagent kit, control materials (normal and
elevated), calibrators
• Supplies: Vials, pipettes, gloves, laboratory logbook
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure that all equipment and reagents are calibrated and
validated before use.
2. Confirm that the centrifuge is operational.
3. Verify expiration dates on all reagents and controls.
B. Specimen Processing
1. Centrifuge whole blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate plasma.
2. Carefully pipette the plasma into a clean, labeled vial ensuring
no cellular material is transferred.
C. Analysis
1. Set up the automated chemistry analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the appropriate uric acid reagent kit and ensure the
analyzer is set to the correct parameters.
◦ Follow the reagent inserts for the specific steps required.
3. Use pipettes to dispense plasma, calibrators, and control
materials into the designated slots in the analyzer.
4. Initiate the test sequence on the analyzer.
D. Quality Control and Calibration
1. Run the normal and elevated control materials at the beginning
of each shift or every 24 hours.
2. Ensure that control results are within the acceptable range
before analyzing patient samples.
3. If control results fall outside the acceptable limits, troubleshoot
and resolve the issue before proceeding.
4. Perform calibration as needed or as indicated by the reagent or
analyzer specifications.
E. Result Documentation and Verification
1. Verify the results generated by the analyzer for each sample.
2. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS),
ensuring patient identification and sample identification
numbers match.
3. Flag any results outside the established reference range for uric
acid (3.5-7.2 mg/dL).
F. Reporting Results
1. Report the verified results to the ordering physician or clinic
following current reporting procedures.
◦ Urgent or critical values must be communicated immediately
and documented according to laboratory protocol.
G. Analytical Measurement Range
• Ensure results fall within the established linearity range of the
assay. Verify any results falling outside this range through repeat
analysis or dilution procedures as required.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Analyzer Errors: Follow the manufacturer’s troubleshooting
guide included in the user manual.
• Control Failures: Check reagent integrity, calibration status, and
procedural setup.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Dispose of biohazard materials following the biosafety regulations
of the laboratory.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s inserts and user manuals for the uric acid reagent
kit and chemistry analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
uric acid testing.
• Internal laboratory quality control and safety protocols.
10. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is subject to review and approval by the laboratory director
and must be reviewed annually to ensure it remains current and
effective.
