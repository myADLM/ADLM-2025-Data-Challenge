Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Uric Acid, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedures to be followed for the analysis
of uric acid in serum samples. The intent is to ensure accurate and
consistent test results with appropriate documentation and quality
control measures.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff responsible for
performing uric acid testing on serum samples using a
spectrophotometric method.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel trained in the operation of the
appropriate analytical instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer) and in
the procedures for uric acid serum analysis.
1. PREREQUISITES
• Ensure all necessary training is complete and certification is
current.
• Verify that the instrument has been calibrated and is within the
acceptable calibration range.
• Ensure quality control materials are prepared and within the
expiration date.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Spectrophotometer
• Uric Acid Reagent Kit (follow manufacturer's instructions)
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal control sera)
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes or cuvettes
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory notebook or LIS (Laboratory Information System)
1. REAGENTS STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store reagents and control materials as indicated by the
manufacturer.
• Reagents must not be used past their expiration date.
• Ensure reagents are at room temperature before use.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Collection: A sample of venous blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Sample Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when
refrigerated at 2-8°C.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use two levels of quality control (QC) within the analyzed time
frame (e.g., at the beginning of the shift, every 8 hours of
continuous testing, or with each set of patient samples).
• Document QC results in the QC logbook or LIS.
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshooting
must be performed, and patient testing is suspended until QC
passes.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Mix reagents thoroughly but gently to avoid foaming.
3. Prepare calibration curve using the uric acid calibrator
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 2000-3000 rpm for
10-15 minutes to separate serum.
2. Aliquot the serum into a clean test tube, avoiding any cells or
debris.
C. Analysis:
1. Turn on the spectrophotometer and allow it to warm up as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Set the wavelength to the appropriate value as per the uric acid
reagent kit instructions (typically around 520-540 nm).
3. Pipette the required volume of uric acid reagent into a test tube
or cuvette.
4. Add the specified volume of serum sample to the reagent.
5. Mix gently using a vortex mixer.
6. Incubate the mixture (typically for 10 minutes at room
temperature) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
7. Read the absorbance of the mixture against a reagent blank at
the specified wavelength.
8. Record the absorbance values.
D. Calculations:
1. Calculate the concentration of uric acid in the sample using the
calibration curve.
2. Ensure results are within the reference interval:
◦ Males: 3.4-7.0 mg/dL (0.20-0.42 mmol/L)
◦ Females: 2.4-6.0 mg/dL (0.14-0.36 mmol/L)
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the calculated concentration of uric acid into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Verify and release results according to laboratory protocols.
• If critical values are identified (e.g., >12.0 mg/dL or <2.0 mg/dL),
follow the lab's critical result reporting procedures.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results are out of range, do not proceed with patient
samples.
• Check reagent integrity, calibration curve, instrument functionality,
and sample quality.
• Repeat the assay using a fresh aliquot of serum if necessary.
• Document all corrective actions.
