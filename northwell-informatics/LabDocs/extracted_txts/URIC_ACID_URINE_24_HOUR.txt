PROTOCOL FOR ANALYSIS OF URIC ACID IN 24-HOUR URINE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the quantitative determination
of uric acid concentration in 24-hour urine specimens.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the clinical chemistry laboratory conducting
uric acid analysis in 24-hour urine samples using the enzymatic
uricase method or any other validated method as appropriate.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform testing and initial result
verification.
• Supervisors: Oversee the process, handle quality control, and
validate results.
4. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• 24-hour urine collection.
Specimen Collection:
• The patient should be instructed to collect all urine voided over a
24-hour period.
• Start the collection by discarding the first-morning urine specimen
on Day 1 and record the time.
• Collect all subsequent urine including the first-morning specimen
on Day 2 up to the recorded time on Day 1.
• The urine should be collected in a clean, large, labeled container
provided by the laboratory.
• The container should be kept refrigerated during the collection
period if possible.
Specimen Handling:
• Upon receipt, the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection
should be measured and recorded.
• Mix the specimen thoroughly by inverting the collection container
several times to ensure homogeneity.
• Aliquot an appropriate volume (typically 10-20 mL) into a smaller,
clean, labeled container for analysis.
• Ensure the aliquot is free from particulates; centrifuge if
necessary.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer compatible with uricase method or
another validated method.
• Standard reagents for uric acid analysis.
• Quality control materials (low, normal, and high uric acid controls).
• Aliquot tubes.
• Centrifuge (if needed).
6. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform calibration using the provided standard solutions prior to
analysis.
• Run quality control materials at low, normal, and high levels as
per the lab’s QC schedule. Ensure results are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with specimen testing.
Specimen Analysis:
1. Load the aliquoted urine specimen onto the analyzer.
2. Input the total 24-hour urine volume into the analyzer’s data
entry system.
3. Initiate the test according to the analyzer’s standard operating
procedures.
Calculation of Uric Acid Excretion:
• The analyzer will measure the concentration of uric acid in the
aliquot.
• To calculate the total uric acid excretion over 24 hours, multiply
the concentration (mg/dL) by the total urine volume (in dL): [
\text{Total Uric Acid (mg/24 hr)} = \text{Concentration (mg/dL)}
\times \text{Total Volume (dL)} ]
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the laboratory
technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are communicated to the patient’s clinician
promptly, especially if there are critical or significantly abnormal
values.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Provide age and sex-specific reference intervals as established
by the laboratory.
• Example:
◦ Adult males: 250 to 750 mg/24 hours
◦ Adult females: 250 to 700 mg/24 hours
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform and document daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance of
the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Review control results and calibration data regularly to ensure
accuracy.
• Address and document any deviations or technical issues
encountered during analysis.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemoglobin and bilirubin in urine may interfere with the
determination of uric acid, leading to falsely elevated results.
• Proper specimen collection and handling are essential for
accurate results.
