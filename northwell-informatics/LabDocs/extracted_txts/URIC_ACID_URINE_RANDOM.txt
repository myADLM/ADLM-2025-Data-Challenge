SOP Title: Analytical Phase for Urine
Random Uric Acid Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the analysis and result
generation of Uric Acid in random urine specimens, ensuring
accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of
Uric Acid testing in random urine specimens in the clinical laboratory.
3. DEFINITION
Uric Acid (UA): A product of the metabolic breakdown of purine
nucleotides, and it is an important diagnostic indicator for various
medical conditions.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to follow this
protocol for analyzing random urine specimens for Uric Acid and to
document all findings accurately. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to this protocol and for addressing any issues
that arise during the analysis.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens
• Random urine collection: Fresh, properly labeled, and the
container must indicate the collection date and time.
• Preferred volume: At least 10 mL of random urine.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens collected more than 2 hours prior to laboratory receipt
if not refrigerated.
• Specimens with no indication of collection date/time or improperly
labeled.
• Specimens that exhibit signs of contamination or improper
handling.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment
• Automated urine chemistry analyzer or spectrophotometer
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge, if necessary
Reagents
• Uric Acid reagent kits (store as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Quality control materials – Level 1 (normal) and Level 2
(abnormal), store at 2-8°C
• Calibrators, if required, by analyzer
Supplies
• Urine collection containers
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory labels and pens
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation
1. Verify all reagents and controls are within the expiration dates.
2. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated as per manufacturer’s
instructions if required.
3. Allow reagents, controls, and urine specimens to reach room
temperature before analysis.
Analysis
1. Gently mix the urine specimen by inverting the container,
ensuring any sediment is suspended.
2. Pipette the required volume of the urine specimen into a
sample cup.
3. Load the sample onto the analyzer following the instrument's
operational manual.
4. Run the controls prior to analyzing patient samples:
◦ Level 1: Normal control
◦ Level 2: Abnormal/high control
5. If controls are within acceptable ranges, proceed with the
patient sample analysis.
Quality Control
1. Run quality controls at the beginning of each shift and
whenever a new reagent lot is opened.
2. Document the results of the controls.
3. Acceptable ranges for QC material should be defined as per
laboratory-established criteria.
Result Generation
1. The analyzer will automatically calculate and provide the
concentration of Uric Acid in the urine specimen.
2. Verify the results for any flags or errors indicated by the
analyzer.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review results for accuracy.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Any critical values must be immediately communicated to the
referring physician as per laboratory policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for random urine Uric Acid may vary;
establish based on laboratory validation studies or clinical
references. Common reference: 250-750 mg/24 hours (convert as
necessary).
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, improper specimen handling, and delays in
processing can affect the accuracy of results.
• Uric Acid levels may be altered by certain medications or medical
conditions; comprehensive patient history is advised for accurate
interpretation.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert for Uric Acid reagent kit
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urinalysis testing
12. DOCUMENTATION
All analyses, quality controls, and maintenance must be documented
in the appropriate logs, ensuring traceability and compliance with
regulatory requirements.
Ensure all laboratory staff are trained on this protocol and perform
ongoing competency checks. Maintain a review schedule for the
SOPs to ensure they meet current standards and practices.
