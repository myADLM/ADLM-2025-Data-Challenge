Standard Operating Procedure
Analytical Phase for Generating Results of URIC ACID,
URINE, TIMED
1. PURPOSE
To establish procedures for accurately measuring and reporting the
uric acid levels in timed urine specimens. This includes the steps to
be followed to ensure proper handling, analysis, and recording of test
results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 24-hour timed urine collection in a clean, chemically clean, and
tightly sealed container. The patient should be instructed to
discard the first urine sample of the day and collect all subsequent
urine for the next 24 hours, including the first urine sample of the
next day.
• Specimen must be refrigerated during the collection period.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected over a period other than 24 hours, unless
otherwise specifically instructed.
• Samples that are not adequately refrigerated or have potential
contamination.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated or improper
labeling.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Uric acid reagent kit (follow manufacturer's instructions for storage
and preparation)
• Calibrators and controls for uric acid (store as per manufacturer’s
recommendations)
• Urine containers, pipettes, and other standard laboratory
glassware/equipment
• Urinalysis analyzer capable of measuring uric acid
4. EQUIPMENT
• Urinalysis analyzer
• Centrifuge if necessary for sample preparation
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibrators: Run calibrators according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Ensure that the analyzer is calibrated and
documentation of calibration is maintained.
• Quality Control: Run quality control checks at the beginning of
each shift or batch. Use both high and low controls and record the
results. Ensure controls fall within the acceptable range before
processing patient samples. If control results fall outside the
acceptable range, troubleshoot and resolve issues before
proceeding.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Specimen Preparation and Handling:
◦ Ensure the 24-hour urine specimen is well-mixed.
◦ Measure and record the total volume of the urine sample.
◦ Aliquot a sufficient volume of the urine specimen into a
suitable container for analysis.
2. Analysis:
◦ Set up the urinalysis analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s specifications for uric acid testing.
◦ Pipette the prepared urine sample into the analyzer’s
sample cup or other designed receptacles.
◦ Follow the analyzer’s instructions to initiate the uric acid
testing procedure.
◦ Monitor the analysis process to ensure accurate operation
and troubleshoot any errors as needed.
3. Interpretation and Verification:
◦ Once the analysis is complete, obtain the uric acid
concentration results from the analyzer.
◦ Verify that the results fall within the specified limits for
patient results.
◦ If the results are flagged by the analyzer, follow the
instrument's troubleshooting procedures and rerun the
sample if necessary.
4. Recording and Reporting:
◦ Document the uric acid test results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure all pertinent details such as patient ID, specimen ID,
date, and time of collection, total urine volume, and uric acid
concentration are accurately recorded.
◦ If any critical or significantly abnormal results are obtained,
follow the laboratory protocol for notification.
7. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Reference intervals for uric acid in timed urine should be
established by the laboratory according to population-specific
data and validated reference studies. Typically, uric acid
concentration in a 24-hour urine collection is expected to be in the
range of x - y mg/24 hours. Consult published guidelines for more
specific intervals.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure proper documentation of all steps, including calibration,
quality control results, patient test results, and any corrective
actions taken.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Review and assess QC data periodically to ensure the reliability
and accuracy of test results.

• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for urinalysis analyzer and
uric acid reagent kits.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Analytical protocols as per laboratory and regulatory standards.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
Common troubleshooting steps for flagged or inconsistent results
include:
• Re-calibrating the analyzer
• Running quality controls to verify the system is functioning
properly
• Checking for clogs or contamination in the sample or analyzer
• Contacting technical support if the issue persists
This draft protocol is intended for use by laboratory personnel trained
to carry out uric acid analysis in urine and should be used in
accordance with good clinical laboratory practices and manufacturer
guidelines.
