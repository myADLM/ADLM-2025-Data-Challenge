Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Uridine Diphosphate-Galactose 4'
Epimerase (UDP-Galactose 4' Epimerase), Blood
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps to be followed in the
analytical phase of generating results for Uridine Diphosphate-
Galactose 4' Epimerase (UDP-Galactose 4' Epimerase), to ensure
accuracy and reliability of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All trained laboratory personnel are responsible
for following this SOP to perform UDP-Galactose 4' Epimerase
analysis accurately and consistently. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to this SOP and to
address any discrepancies or issues that may arise during the
analysis.
3. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
• 3 mL whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled.
• Specimens received more than 72 hours after collection.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
Specimen Handling:
• Store specimens refrigerated at 2-8°C upon receipt.
• Maintain specimens at controlled room temperature (15-25°C)
during analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System or
Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) System
• Specific Reagents and Standards for UDP-Galactose 4'
Epimerase detection (as specified by the manufacturer)
• Calibrated Pipettes and Tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Disposable Gloves and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
1. Confirm the specimen meets the acceptance criteria detailed in
section 3.
2. Allow refrigerated specimens to come to room temperature.
3. Vortex the specimen for 10 seconds to ensure thorough mixing.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Pipette 200 µL of whole blood into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
2. Add 200 µL of lysis buffer to the tube and vortex for 10
seconds.
3. Centrifuge the lysed specimen at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
4. Carefully transfer supernatant to a new clean microcentrifuge
tube.
C. Calibration and QC
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run at least one blank, a set of calibration standards, and
quality control samples at the beginning and end of each batch
analysis or after every 10 patient samples.
D. Analysis
1. Inject 50 µL of the sample, calibrator, and QC into the HPLC/CE
system.
2. Run the method according to the immobilized enzyme's
standard assay program.
3. Monitor the chromatogram or electropherogram, noting the
peaks corresponding to UDP-Galactose 4' Epimerase.
E. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare sample peak areas to calibration curve to determine
UDP-Galactose 4' Epimerase concentration.
2. Validate results with quality control samples:
◦ If QC falls within the expected range, proceed with
reporting.
◦ If QC is outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines and repeat analysis if
necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS Enter and verify the results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) ensuring adherence to reporting
guidelines:
• Include test name, result, units, reference range, and any relevant
interpretive comments.
• Flag any critical or out-of-range values and immediately notify the
requesting physician as per critical values policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform and document daily instrument calibration and
maintenance.
• Run internal quality controls at the beginning of the shift, after
calibration, after reagent change, and after every 10 specimens.
• Investigate and resolve any discrepancies in QC results before
processing clinical specimens.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Specimens older than 72 hours may give inaccurate results.
• Hemolyzed specimens can interfere with the assay.
9. REFERENCES Refer to the manufacturer’s manual and reagent
kit inserts for detailed procedural steps and troubleshooting
guidance.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING Maintain all logs,
worksheets, and digital files relating to specimen analysis, calibration,
quality control, and maintenance according to the laboratory’s
documentation policy. All records should be kept in compliance with
CLIA requirements and institutional policies.
