STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Generating Results for Uroplakin II
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for Uroplakin II
immunostain, ensuring consistent, reliable, and accurate results
for diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques are responsible for
performing the staining procedure, recording the results, and
ensuring quality control measures are met.
3. DEFINITION Uroplakin II is a protein used as a biomarker in the
identification and diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. This
procedure involves the technical staining process prior to the
pathologist's interpretation of the results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Acceptable specimen containers:
• Glass slides with appropriately labeled FFPE tissue sections.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens that are not properly fixed or processed.
• Slides with improperly labeled or mismatched identifiers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS Equipment:
• Automated IHC stainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark, Dako
Autostainer)
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Light microscope
• Timer
Reagents:
• Primary antibody against Uroplakin II
• Secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting media
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Slides
• Section FFPE tissue blocks at 3-4 microns using a microtome.
• Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and pick up onto
positively charged glass slides.
• Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour or overnight at 37°C.
6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Place slides in a staining rack.
• Deparaffinize sections in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes
each.
• Rehydrate through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5
minutes each.
• Rinse in distilled water.
6.3 Antigen Retrieval
• Perform antigen retrieval using appropriate buffer (e.g., citrate, pH
6.0) in a pressure cooker, microwave, or steamer for 20 minutes.
• Cool slides to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
6.4 Immunostaining
• Load slides onto the automated IHC stainer.
• Apply primary antibody against Uroplakin II and incubate
according to the manufacturer's instructions (typically 30-60
minutes).
• Apply secondary antibody conjugated with HRP and incubate per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Apply DAB substrate to develop the stain and monitor under a
microscope until appropriate staining intensity is achieved
(typically 3-10 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.5 Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
• Dehydrate through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%) for 2
minutes each.
• Clear in xylene and mount with a coverslip using mounting media.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive control slides with known Uroplakin II expression
to ensure the staining process is working correctly.
• Include negative control slides where the primary antibody is
omitted to rule out non-specific staining.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record staining results in a logbook or laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Deliver the stained slides along with the control slides to the
pathologist for interpretation.
• Document any issues or deviations from the protocol in the quality
control log.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak staining: Check antigen retrieval conditions, primary
antibody concentration, and incubation time.
• Excessive background staining: Ensure proper washing steps and
check antibody dilutions.
• No staining: Verify reagents are within expiration, and antigen
retrieval was performed correctly.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS Not applicable. Interpretation of
results will be performed by a qualified pathologist.
2. SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including wearing
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents according to manufacturer’s Material Safety
Data Sheets (MSDS).
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for antibodies and detection kits.
• Relevant histology or immunohistochemistry textbooks and
literature.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure
accurate and consistent technical staining results for Uroplakin II
immunostain procedures in the diagnosis and research of urothelial
carcinoma.
