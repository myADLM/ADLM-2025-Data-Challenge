STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Uroporphyrinogen
Decarboxylase, Washed Erythrocytes
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity measurement in
washed erythrocytes. These procedures ensure accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
The laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting the
analysis according to this procedure. The supervisor is responsible
for ensuring overall compliance and addressing any discrepancies or
issues that may arise during the analysis.
1. DEFINITION
Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase: An enzyme involved in the heme
biosynthesis pathway that converts uroporphyrinogen to
coproporphyrinogen by decarboxylation.
Washed Erythrocytes: Red blood cells (RBCs) that have been
separated from plasma and other components, then washed with
saline to remove plasma proteins and other contaminants.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements
Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
Specimen Handling: - Process the specimen immediately or
refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. - Avoid hemolysis; hemolyzed
samples are not acceptable. - Label each sample with a unique
identification number, date, and time of collection.
3.2 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment: - Centrifuge with cooling capability - Microcentrifuge
tubes - Pipettes (variable volumes) - Incubator set at 37°C -
Spectrophotometer
Reagents: - Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) - Enzyme
substrate solution (prepared as per assay kit instructions) - Lysis
buffer (prepared as per assay kit instructions) - Assay buffer
(prepared as per assay kit instructions) - Detection reagent (prepared
as per assay kit instructions)
Supplies: - Wash buffer (PBS) - Microcentrifuge tubes - Assay plates
or cuvettes - Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
3.3 Pre-Analytical Phase: Washing of Erythrocytes
1. Collect whole blood in an EDTA tube.
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 1000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma from erythrocytes.
3. Carefully remove the plasma and buffy coat, leaving the
erythrocytes intact.
4. Add an equal volume of PBS to the erythrocyte pellet and
gently resuspend.
5. Centrifuge the erythrocyte suspension at 500 x g for 5 minutes
at 4°C.
6. Discard the supernatant and repeat the washing step 2-3 times
to ensure clean erythrocytes.
3.4 Analytical Phase: UROD Activity Assay
1. Prepare the lysate: a. Resuspend the washed erythrocyte pellet
in the lysis buffer (consult assay kit instructions for precise
buffer volumes). b. Incubate the suspension on ice for 15
minutes. c. Centrifuge the lysate at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C. d. Transfer the supernatant (contains soluble proteins) to a
clean microcentrifuge tube for analysis.
2. Enzyme Reaction Setup: a. Dilute the enzyme substrate
solution if necessary (consult assay kit instructions). b. In a
microcentrifuge tube or 96-well plate, add the appropriate
volume of assay buffer, sample lysate, and substrate solution.
c. Mix gently to ensure proper mixing of contents.
3. Incubation: a. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the
enzyme reaction time specified in the assay kit instructions
(usually 30-60 minutes).
4. Detection: a. Add the detection reagent to the reaction mixture
as specified in the assay kit instructions. b. Incubate the
solution at room temperature or as otherwise specified for color
development.
5. Reading the Result: a. Measure the absorbance of the samples
using a spectrophotometer set to the wavelength specified in
the assay kit instructions. b. Record the absorbance readings
and calculate the enzyme activity using the provided standards
and calibration curve.
3.5 Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to ensure the assay's integrity.
2. Reagents must be used within their expiration dates and stored
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
3.6 Reporting Results
1. Calculate the UROD activity using the readings obtained from
the spectrophotometer and the calibration curve.
2. Express the enzyme activity in units as per assay kit guidelines.
3. Report the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and verify the data before finalizing the report.
3.7 Critical Values
There are no established critical values for UROD activity; however,
significantly deviating results should be reviewed, and potential pre-
analytical issues must be ruled out.

should be documented in revision history.
