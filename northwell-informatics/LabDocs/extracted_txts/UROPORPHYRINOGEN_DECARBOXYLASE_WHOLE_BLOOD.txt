Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase
(UROD) Activity in Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of testing
for Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase (UROD) activity in whole blood.
The intent is to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all staff members involved in performing
UROD activity assays in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory staff performing the assay is responsible for ensuring
that all steps are carried out according to this SOP. Any deviations or
problems encountered must be reported to the laboratory supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Specimen Type: Whole blood
- Collection Container: EDTA tube (lavender top) or Heparin tube (green top)
- Volume Required: Minimum 5 mL
- Specimen Stability: Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be delayed for more than 4 hours. Do not freeze.
5. PRINCIPLE OF THE TEST
Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase (UROD) is an enzyme involved in
the heme synthesis pathway. The assay for UROD activity is based
on the measurement of the rate of decarboxylation of
uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen.
6. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
- Uroporphyrinogen Substrate
- Reaction buffer (pH 7.4)
- Stop Solution (trichloroacetic acid, TCA)
- Fluorescence spectrophotometer
- Centrifuge
- Vortex mixer
- Pipettes and tips
- Cooling centrifuge
- Standard laboratory glassware
- Control samples (high and low activity)
7. PROCEDURE
**7.1 Preparation of Reagents**
- Prepare reaction buffer and uroporphyrinogen substrate according to manufacturer’s instructions.
- Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature before use.
**7.2 Sample Preparation**
- Centrifuge whole blood at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
- Wash red blood cells (RBCs) three times with isotonic saline.
- Hemolyze washed RBCs by adding an equal volume of distilled water and vortex mixing.
**7.3 Enzyme Assay**
- In a test tube, mix:
- 0.1 mL hemolysate
- 0.9 mL reaction buffer
- 0.1 mL uroporphyrinogen substrate
- Incubate at 37°C for exactly 30 minutes.
- Stop the reaction by adding 0.5 mL of 20% TCA.
- Centrifuge the mixture at 3,000 x g for 5 minutes to remove any precipitate.
- Measure the fluorescence of the supernatant using a fluorescence spectrophotometer set to excitation at 405 nm and emission at 595 nm.
8. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
- Perform calibration of the fluorescence spectrophotometer using known standards before running the assay.
- Include high and low activity control samples with each batch of tests to ensure the accuracy and precision of the assay.
- Record and monitor control results. If control values fall outside of specified ranges, troubleshoot the assay and do not report patient results until the issue is resolved.
9. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
- Calculate the UROD activity by comparing the fluorescence intensity of the sample with the standard curve generated from known concentrations of coproporphyrinogen.
- Express results in units of enzyme activity per volume of whole blood (U/mL).
10. REPORTING RESULTS
- Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
- Validate results according to laboratory quality control procedures.
- Report results to the healthcare provider along with reference intervals and any necessary interpretive comments.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
- Normal: 1.0 - 4.0 U/mL (may vary depending on the laboratory's specific validation)
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Ensure proper sample handling to avoid hemolysis or contamination.
- Delays in processing or improper storage can affect enzyme activity.
- Presence of interfering substances in the blood may lead to inaccurate results.
13. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
- Handle all human specimens as potentially infectious.
- Follow standard laboratory biosafety guidelines.
- Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
- Dispose of all waste according to laboratory protocols for hazardous materials.
14. REFERENCES
- UROD Activity Assay Kit manufacturer’s insert.
- Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
- Relevant scientific literature for UROD activity measurement.
15. REVISION HISTORY
- Document control and update history with dates and changes made.
This completes the SOP for the analytical phase of generating
Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase (UROD) activity results in whole
blood. Ensure all staff are trained and follow this procedure to
maintain accuracy and consistency in testing.
