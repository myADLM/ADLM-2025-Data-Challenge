Protocol: Analytical Phase for Uroporphyrinogen III
Synthase (CO-Synthase) Activity in Erythrocytes
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of the
Uroporphyrinogen III Synthase (CO-Synthase) activity assay in
erythrocytes. This includes the preparation, processing, and analysis
of specimens to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the Uroporphyrinogen III
Synthase assay are responsible for adhering to this procedure. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff
are adequately trained and competent in this procedure.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer
• Centrifuge
• Water bath (37°C and ice bath)
• Vortex mixer
• pH meter
• Pipettes and tips (adjustable)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Reagent-grade water
• Hemolysis buffer: 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4
• Substrate buffer
• Uroporphyrinogen III standard (for calibration curve)
• Red blood cells lysate
4. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure that specimens (whole blood) have been collected,
received, and accessioned according to the standard operating
procedures for specimen handling.
2. Store whole blood specimens at 4°C if not processed
immediately. Process specimens within 24 hours of collection.
B) Erythrocyte Lysate Preparation
1. Prepare Hemolysis Buffer:
◦ Dissolve 1.21 g of Tris-HCl in 1 L of reagent-grade water
and adjust the pH to 7.4. Sterilize by filtration or autoclaving
and store at 4°C.
2. Isolation of Erythrocytes:
◦ Centrifuge 3 mL of the whole blood specimen at 1000 x g for
10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Carefully remove the plasma and the white blood cell layer
(buffy coat).
◦ Wash the erythrocytes three times with 1 mL of cold PBS,
centrifuging at 1000 x g for 5 minutes between each wash.
3. Hemolysis:
◦ Suspend the washed erythrocytes in 1 mL of hemolysis
buffer.
◦ Vortex gently and incubate at 4°C for 30 minutes to ensure
complete lysis.
◦ Centrifuge the hemolysate at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes at
4°C to pellet cell debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant (erythrocyte lysate) into a clean
microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice until analysis.
C) Enzymatic Assay
1. Reaction Mixture Preparation:
◦ Prepare the substrate buffer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ In a microcentrifuge tube, mix 100 µL of the erythrocyte
lysate with 200 µL of substrate buffer.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes in a water bath.
3. Reaction Termination:
◦ Stop the reaction by placing the tubes in an ice bath for 5
minutes.
4. Measurement:
◦ Transfer the reaction mixture to a clean cuvette.
◦ Measure the fluorescence or absorbance at the appropriate
wavelength using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
◦ Record the readings.
D) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using Uroporphyrinogen III
standards.
◦ Plot the fluorescence or absorbance values against the
concentration of Uroporphyrinogen III.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include internal quality control samples with known
Uroporphyrinogen III Synthase activity levels in each batch
of samples.
◦ Ensure that QC results fall within the established control
range before validating patient results.
E) Data Analysis
1. Determine the Uroporphyrinogen III Synthase activity in each
sample by comparing the sample’s fluorescence or absorbance
readings to the calibration curve.
2. Record the final results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and ensure proper documentation.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be automatically transmitted and reviewed for
technical accuracy.
• Verify the results in the LIS and report according to the site-
specific guidelines.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Low/High Readings: Recheck calibration curve and QC results.
Repeat the assay if necessary.
• Instrument Errors: Follow the manufacturer's troubleshooting
guide or contact technical support.
7. SAFETY
• Follow institutional guidelines for handling biological specimens.
• Utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
