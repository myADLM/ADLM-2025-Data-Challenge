UROVYSION FISH TEST FOR RECURRENT BLADDER CANCER
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the procedures for the
analytical phase of the UroVysion Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) test used for detecting recurrent bladder
cancer. This test identifies chromosomal abnormalities
associated with bladder cancer to provide accurate diagnostic
information.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the UroVysion FISH test according to this protocol. All
staff must ensure that procedures are followed precisely and that any
deviations or issues are reported to a supervisor immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• UroVysion Bladder Cancer Kit (Abbott Molecular)
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets
• Hybridization chamber
• Slide warmer or incubator
• Coplin jars
• Wash buffer (Abbott Molecular)
• Ethanol (70%, 85%, and 100%)
• Xylene
• DPX mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Clean microscope slides
• Disposable gloves
• Pipettes and pipette tips
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT Specimen Type: Urine sediment
from freshly voided urine Specimen Collection:
• Collect 50-60 mL of freshly voided urine in a sterile container.
• Transport to the lab within 1 hour at room temperature.
Specimen Processing:
• Centrifuge the urine sample at 600 x g for 10 minutes.
• Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
• Prepare a slide with the cell suspension by cytospin.
1. PROCEDURE A) Slide Preparation:
2. Place the slide on a flat surface and allow it to air dry
completely.
3. Fix the slides by immersing in a Coplin jar containing 2:1
methanol:acetic acid for 5 minutes.
4. Air dry the fixed slides.
B) Denaturation and Hybridization:
1. Prewarm the slides to 72°C for 2 minutes on a slide warmer.
2. Apply 10 µL of the UroVysion probe mixture onto each target
area on the slide.
3. Cover with a coverslip and seal the edges with rubber cement.
4. Place the slide in a hybridization chamber and incubate at 73°C
for 5 minutes for DNA denaturation.
5. Transfer the hybridization chamber to a 37°C incubator and
hybridize overnight (minimum of 16 hours).
C) Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Remove the coverslip carefully and place the slide in 0.4X SSC/
0.3% NP-40 wash buffer preheated to 73°C for 2 minutes.
2. Transfer the slide to room temperature 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40
wash buffer and agitate gently for 1 minute.
3. Rinse the slide in distilled water and air dry in the dark.
D) Counterstain and Mounting:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to the target area and cover
with a coverslip.
2. Allow the slide to sit in the dark for at least 10 minutes.
3. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS
4. Using a fluorescence microscope, analyze the slides under
appropriate filters (DAPI, FITC, Texas Red, and Aqua).
5. Examine at least 100 non-overlapping, intact nuclei for the
presence of 3 Chromosome enumeration probes (CEP 3 [Red],
CEP 7 [Green], CEP 17 [Aqua]), and the LSI locus-specific
identifier (LSI 9p21 [Gold]).
6. Criteria for a positive result:
◦ Gain of two or more of the CEP probes (3, 7, or 17) in 10%
or more of cells analyzed.
◦ Homozygous deletion of LSI 9p21 in 20% or more of cells
analyzed.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
8. Perform UroVysion FISH test only with validated lot numbers of
reagents and approved control slides.
9. Include a positive control sample with known chromosomal
abnormalities and a negative control each time the UroVysion
FISH test is performed.
10. Results of quality control samples must fall within the specified
ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
12. Enter the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
13. Results should include:
◦ Description of normal and abnormal signal patterns.
◦ Interpretive comments regarding the presence or absence
of chromosomal abnormalities.
14. All results must be reviewed and verified by an authorized
technologist before being released.
