UROVYSION FOR DETECTION OF BLADDER CANCER, URINE -
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the analytical phase of the UroVysion
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) test used to detect bladder
cancer in urine specimens.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel trained in FISH techniques to perform this assay according
to the established procedure. It is the responsibility of the supervisor
to ensure adherence to this procedure and to address any deviations
or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Urine specimens: 50-100 mL of freshly voided urine is collected in
a sterile container. Specimen must be processed within 48 hours
if refrigerated at 2-8°C or within 4 hours if kept at room
temperature (20-25°C).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in non-sterile containers.
• Urine specimens with excessive delay in processing beyond the
acceptable time frames as they may result in cell degradation.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• UroVysion FISH Probe Kit (including DNA probes specific for
chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and 9p21 locus probes)
• Fluorescence microscope
• Centrifuge
• Water bath (set to 37°C and 73°C)
• Slide warmer
• Microscope slides
• Fixative solution (Methanol: Acetone mixture)
• Hybridization buffer
• Counterstains (DAPI)
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Forceps
• Coverslips
• Incubator
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive and Negative Control slides provided with the FISH probe
kit.
Procedure:
• Run positive and negative controls each time the test is
performed.
• Document control results in the Quality Control Log and ensure
they fall within the specified range.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Specimen:
1. Centrifuge the urine samples at 600g for 10 minutes.
2. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL of
cold PBS. Repeat the centrifugation step.
3. Resuspend the cell pellet in a minimal volume (approximately
200 µL) of PBS.
Slide Preparation:
1. Pipette 50-100 µL of the concentrated cell suspension onto a
microscope slide.
2. Allow the slide to air dry completely.
3. Fix the dried cells by immersing slides in methanol-acetone
(3:1) fixative solution for 10 minutes at -20°C.
4. Air dry slides or place on a 37°C slide warmer for at least 10
minutes.
Hybridization:
1. Apply the FISH probe mixture (10 µL per slide) to the target
area on the slide.
2. Cover the sample area with a coverslip and seal the edges with
rubber cement.
3. Denature slides at 73°C for 5 minutes using a water bath or
slide heating system.
4. Immediately transfer the slides to a 37°C incubator and
hybridize overnight (minimum 14 hours).
Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Remove coverslips and rinse slides in post-hybridization wash
buffer (0.4X SSC/0.3% NP-40) at 73°C for 2 minutes.
2. Carry out a second wash in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 1 minute.
Counterstaining:
1. Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to the hybridized area and
cover with a coverslip.
2. Store slides in the dark to preserve fluorescence until ready for
analysis.
Analysis:
1. Use a fluorescence microscope equipped with filters
appropriate for the fluorophores used in the UroVysion kit.
2. Analyze at least 25 cells per slide to determine the presence of
chromosomal abnormalities.
3. Positive results are indicated by the presence of chromosomal
gains or losses as specified in the UroVysion FISH probe kit
instructions.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Record findings and interpretation on the Result Reporting
Form specific to the UroVysion FISH test.
6. Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and flag any abnormal results for review.
7. Forward the final report to the physician or requester following
the site-specific reporting protocol.
