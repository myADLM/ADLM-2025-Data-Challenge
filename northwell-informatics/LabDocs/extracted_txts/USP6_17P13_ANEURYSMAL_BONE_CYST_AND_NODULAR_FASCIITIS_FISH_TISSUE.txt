Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for USP6 (17P13), ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST, AND
NODULAR FASCIITIS, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for performing fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect USP6 (17p13) gene
rearrangements associated with aneurysmal bone cyst and nodular
fasciitis in tissue specimens. The purpose is to provide accurate,
reproducible, and timely results to support the diagnosis and
treatment planning for patients.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members trained and authorized to
perform FISH analysis in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for carrying out the
FISH analysis, including sample preparation, hybridization,
washing, and microscopic evaluation.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
quality control, and verifying final results.
• Quality Assurance Personnel: Ensure compliance with this SOP
and monitor quality control metrics.
4. DEFINITIONS
• FISH (Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization): A molecular
cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes to detect and
localize specific DNA sequences on chromosomes.
• USP6 (17p13): A gene involved in the development of
aneurysmal bone cysts and nodular fasciitis, which may exhibit
rearrangements detectable by FISH.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Fluorescence microscope
• Hybridization oven
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• USP6 (17p13) specific FISH probes
• Tissue samples (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded)
• Pretreatment reagents
• Hybridization reagents
• Washing buffers
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Paraffin Embedding and Sectioning:
◦ Obtain formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
◦ Cut 4-5 µm thick sections and place on positively charged
microscope slides.
◦ Dry slides overnight at 56°C.
2. Deparaffinization and Pretreatment:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%) 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Treat slides with pretreatment solution in a microwave or
pressure cooker following manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Cool slides and rinse in distilled water.
4. Enzymatic Digestion:
◦ Incubate slides in enzyme solution (e.g., pepsin) for the
recommended time.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water and then in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS).
B. Hybridization
1. Denaturation:
◦ Apply FISH probe mixture (USP6 (17p13)) to the target area
on each slide.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
◦ Denature slides at 75°C for 5 minutes on a hybridization
platform.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Transfer slides to a hybridization oven and incubate
overnight (12-18 hours) at 37°C.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Stringent Washing:
◦ Remove coverslips carefully in wash buffer.
◦ Perform sequential washes in pre-warmed 0.4x SSC/0.3%
NP-40 at 73°C for 2 minutes and 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at
room temperature for 1 minute.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Add DAPI counterstain to slides.
◦ Mount with an appropriate mounting medium.
D. Microscopic Analysis
1. Microscope Setup:
◦ Use a fluorescence microscope equipped with filters specific
for the fluorochromes of the FISH probes (e.g., FITC, Texas
Red).
2. Signal Enumeration:
◦ Evaluate at least 200 interphase nuclei per sample.
◦ Identify and record the presence or absence of USP6
(17p13) gene rearrangement, noting signal patterns such as
fusion signals or split/red-green signals indicating
rearrangement.
E. Reporting Results
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Record findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results include the following:
▪ Type of specimen
▪ Number of nuclei counted
▪ Signal patterns observed
▪ Interpretation of results (e.g., positive or negative for
USP6 rearrangement)
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls with each run.
◦ If controls fail, do not report patient results; repeat the
analysis.
3. Verification:
◦ Lab technologist submits preliminary results for supervisory
review and verification.
◦ Supervisor reviews and verifies results for accuracy and
consistency.
