Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Ustekinumab
Quantitation with Antibodies, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed protocol for the
quantitation of Ustekinumab levels and detection of anti-Ustekinumab
antibodies in serum samples. This procedure ensures the accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility of results, facilitating better clinical
decision-making.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting laboratory tests as outlined in this SOP. Supervisors
must ensure proper compliance with the protocol and address any
issues or discrepancies that may arise during the testing process.

5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Allow serum samples, standards, and reagents to reach room
temperature prior to analysis.
2. Prepare standards according to the manufacturer’s instructions
to generate a calibration curve.
3. Prepare quality control materials for the assay.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the serum separator tubes at 3,000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum.
2. Transfer the clear supernatant (serum) to fresh, appropriately
labeled tubes.
C. Assay Protocol
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Coat ELISA plates with the specific capture antibody for
Ustekinumab.
◦ Incubate at room temperature or as specified by the
manufacturer for optimal antibody binding.
◦ Wash plates 3 times with wash buffer.
2. Blocking:
◦ Add blocking buffer to each well to prevent non-specific
binding.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time specified by the reagent
manufacturer.
◦ Wash plates 3 times with wash buffer.
3. Sample and Standards Addition:
◦ Add 50-100 µL of prepared serum samples, standards, and
quality control materials to each well in duplicates.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for the duration specified by
the manufacturer.
◦ Wash plates 3 times with wash buffer.
4. Detection:
◦ Add secondary detection antibodies conjugated with
enzymes to each well.
◦ Incubate plates at room temperature as recommended by
the reagent manufacturer.
◦ Wash plates 3 times with wash buffer.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate until a
color change is visible.
◦ Monitor the reaction time carefully and avoid over-
incubation.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzyme reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using
an ELISA plate reader.
D. Calculation and Result Reporting
1. Generate standard curves using the absorbance readings of
the calibration standards.
2. Quantify the Ustekinumab levels in serum samples using the
standard curve.
3. Interpret the presence and levels of anti-Ustekinumab
antibodies based on the assay sensitivity and specificity criteria.
E. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples with each assay to ensure
instrument and reagent performance.
2. Follow corrective actions if QC results fall outside of acceptable
limits outlined by the laboratory.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations related to cross-
reactivity, sensitivity, and specificity.
7. DOCUMENTATION
1. Record the following in the laboratory information system:
◦ Sample identification
◦ Assay conditions
◦ Ustekinumab and anti-Ustekinumab antibody levels
◦ Quality control results
