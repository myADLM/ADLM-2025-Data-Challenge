Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for USTILAGO NUDA, MOLD GRAIN RUST, and
IGE (Immunoglobulin E), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the accurate and reliable
analysis of Ustilago nuda (barley smut pathogen), Mold Grain Rust,
and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of all Ustilago nuda,
Mold Grain Rust detections, and IgE serum assays conducted in this
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and documenting results as per the outlined protocol.
Supervisors ensure adherence to the guidelines and address any
discrepancies or issues that arise during the process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Ustilago nuda and Mold Grain Rust
◦ Specimen: Infected plant tissue or grain samples.
◦ Storage: Store samples at room temperature in a dry
environment.
◦ Handling: Samples must be handled with gloves to prevent
cross-contamination; work in a clean, designated area.
• IgE, Serum
◦ Specimen: Serum samples.
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL serum.
◦ Storage: Store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or freeze at -20°C for
long-term storage.
◦ Handling: Thaw frozen samples completely and mix well
before analysis. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Microscope (for pathogen identification).
◦ ELISA plate reader (for IgE quantification).
◦ Incubator.
◦ Microtiter plates.
• Reagents:
◦ Specific antisera for Ustilago nuda and Mold Grain Rust.
◦ ELISA kits for IgE.
◦ Appropriate buffers and substrates as specified by reagent
manufacturers.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Ustilago nuda and Mold Grain Rust Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Use a sterilized scalpel to cut small sections (approx. 1 cm²)
from infected areas of the plant tissue/grain.
◦ Place samples in sterile Petri dishes or on designated
slides.
2. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Prepare a wet mount of the sample using distilled water.
◦ Examine under the microscope at 10x and 40x
magnifications.
◦ Identify the characteristic spores of Ustilago nuda or Mold
Grain Rust based on morphology.
3. Serological Testing (if required):
◦ Homogenize a small tissue section in PBS (Phosphate
Buffered Saline).
◦ Apply homogenate to the microtiter wells coated with
specific antisera.
◦ Follow the reagent manufacturer’s instructions for
incubation, washing, and detection steps.
◦ Observe and document any color changes indicating the
presence of pathogens.
B. IgE, Serum Analysis (ELISA):
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples if frozen and bring to room
temperature.
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
2. ELISA Assay Procedure:
◦ Load 100 µL of serum sample or standards into respective
well positions on the ELISA plate.
◦ Add 100 µL of biotinylated anti-IgE reagent to all wells.
◦ Incubate the plate as per the manufacturer's instructions
(usually 1 hour at 37°C).
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with the provided wash solution.
◦ Add 100 µL of streptavidin-HRP solution to each well and
incubate further as specified.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times again.
◦ Add 100 µL of the chromogenic substrate to each well and
incubate in the dark as per the kit’s instructions, usually
15-30 minutes.
◦ Stop the reaction with 50 µL of stop solution.
◦ Read the plate at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ Generate a standard curve using the provided standards
with known IgE concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of IgE in serum samples by
extrapolation from the standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
For Ustilago nuda and Mold Grain Rust:
• Use known positive and negative control samples to validate each
batch of tests.
• Document and review control results to ensure they fall within the
expected range.
For IgE, Serum:
• Use both a high and low IgE control for each ELISA run.
• Ensure the quality control results fall within the specified range
provided by the kit.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Ustilago nuda and Mold Grain Rust:
• Document findings with images and detailed observations.
• Report the presence/absence of pathogens alongside
morphological characteristics.
IgE, Serum:
• Results should be automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) for verification.
• Review and verify results before releasing them into the patient’s
medical records.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgE, Serum Reference Interval:
◦ Typically, reference ranges will be provided in the ELISA kit
insert or determined as per lab-specific validated data.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Pathogen Detection:
◦ Microscopic identification may be subjective and requires
experienced personnel.
◦ Serological methods depend on the specificity of the antisera
used.
• IgE, Serum ELISA:
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination may affect
results.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully to avoid
reagent cross-reactivity and false results.
