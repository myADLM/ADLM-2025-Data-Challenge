Vaginitis Panel PCR Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The Vaginitis Panel PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test is
designed to detect and identify the DNA of pathogens commonly
associated with infectious vaginitis, including bacterial vaginosis
(Gardnerella vaginalis), yeast infection (Candida species), and
trichomoniasis (Trichomonas vaginalis). This procedure outlines the
analytical phase steps from specimen processing to result
generation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
carrying out the vaginitis panel PCR testing, ensuring the accuracy
and reliability of results, and adhering to quality control protocols.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Preferred/Acceptable:
• Vaginal swab samples collected using a sterile, dry cotton or
Dacron swab and placed in a transport medium recommended by
the PCR assay manufacturer.
• Ensure that swabs are appropriately labeled with patient
information and collection details.
2.2 Unacceptable:
• Swabs that are dry without transport medium.
• Samples without proper labeling or those received with delays
that compromise sample integrity.
• Swabs stored and transported outside the recommended
temperature range specified by the manufacturer.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument
• DNA extraction kit appropriate for the type of swab and transport
medium used
• PCR reagents specific for the vaginitis pathogens panel
• Sterile microfuge tubes and pipettes
• Control samples (positive and negative controls)
• Laboratory-grade water and other necessary buffers
1. PROCEDURE
A) SAMPLE PROCESSING:
1. Upon receipt, log all specimens and ensure they are properly
labeled and stored in accordance with the assay manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Extract DNA from the vaginal swab sample using the
recommended DNA extraction kit. Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for optimal DNA yield.
3. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the manufacturer’s
protocol, including all necessary reagents such as primers,
probes, and enzyme mix.
B) PCR SETUP:
1. Pipette the extracted DNA into the PCR master mix in individual
PCR tubes or wells of a PCR plate.
2. Include positive controls (known pathogen DNA) and negative
controls (water or buffer) in each run to ensure test accuracy
and validity.
3. Seal the PCR plate or close the tubes to prevent contamination.
4. Place the PCR plate or tubes in the real-time PCR instrument.
C) PCR AMPLIFICATION AND DETECTION:
1. Program the PCR instrument with the necessary cycling
conditions as per the assay manufacturer’s guidelines.
Typically, this involves an initial denaturation step, followed by
cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension.
2. Start the PCR run and ensure all relevant data is captured by
the instrument's software.
D) INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
1. Analyze the amplification curves generated by the PCR
instrument for the presence of specific pathogen DNA.
2. Consider the test valid only if controls perform as expected:
◦ Positive control should yield a positive amplification signal.
◦ Negative control should show no amplification signal.
3. Compare the sample amplification curves to the threshold set
by the manufacturer to determine positive or negative results
for the pathogens tested.
4. Record the cycle threshold (Ct) values for each pathogen in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
5. If a PCR inhibition is suspected (e.g., from an abnormal
amplification curve or high Ct value), repeat the test or consult
with a supervisor.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A) INTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Perform PCR using known positive and negative controls with
each batch of samples.
2. Verify results of controls and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before accepting any patient results.
B) EXTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Participate in external quality assessment programs for PCR as
mandated.
2. Maintain records of quality control results and actions taken for
any quality control failures.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Document all results, including controls, in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
B) Review the results for accuracy and completeness. Generate
patient reports that include the detected pathogens.
C) Notify appropriate clinical personnel in case of significant findings
(e.g., positive results for Trichomonas vaginalis).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The expected result for a healthy individual or absence of the
targeted pathogens should be negative for all pathogens tested.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
A) Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for limitations specific to
each marker in the vaginitis panel PCR.
B) Potential sources of error: - Inadequate sample collection. -
Incorrect or inefficient DNA extraction. - PCR contamination. - PCR
inhibitors in specimens.
C) Troubleshoot failed tests by re-extracting DNA or repeating the
PCR with fresh reagents, and consult with a molecular diagnostics
specialist if issues persist.
