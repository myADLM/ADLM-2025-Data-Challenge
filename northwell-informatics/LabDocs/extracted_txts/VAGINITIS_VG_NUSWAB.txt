1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase protocol for generating results for
Vaginitis (VG) using NUSWAB specimens in a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory. This SOP
ensures accurate and timely results for the detection and diagnosis of
vaginitis.
Responsibility:
Designated lab personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical phase protocol as defined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the designated personnel to identify any issues that
may affect the accuracy and reliability of laboratory test results and
notify a supervisor promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Vaginitis (VG) refers to inflammation of the vagina caused by
infections (e.g., bacterial, yeast, or trichomonas) or non-infectious
causes. The NUSWAB specimen is collected for laboratory analysis
to detect and identify the causative agents of vaginitis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
NUSWAB:
• Freshly collected swab inserted into a transport medium within the
recommended time frame.
• Swabs must be labelled appropriately with patient information,
date, and time of collection.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens received in the laboratory greater than the
recommended timeframe since collection.
• Specimens received without proper labelling (e.g., missing patient
information, collection date, or time).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• NUSWAB collection kits
• Vortex mixer
• Microbial culture media or molecular diagnostic kits (depending
on the method used)
• Incubators (temperature-specific)
• Laboratory centrifuges
• PCR machine (if applicable)
• Microscopes (for microscopy if necessary)
• Pipettes and tips
• Quality control materials
• Data recording software or log sheets
1. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Verify the proper labelling of the NUSWAB specimen.
2. Document receipt of specimen including date and time.
3. Assemble required equipment, reagents, and supplies.
NUSWAB processing:
1. Vortex the specimen swab in transport medium for 15 seconds
to ensure adequate mixing.
2. Depending on the employed analytical method (e.g., culture,
microscopy, or molecular diagnostics), follow the appropriate
procedure below:
A) Culture: a. Inoculate the specimen onto appropriate microbial
culture media. b. Incubate the cultures at designated temperatures. c.
Monitor and document incubation conditions (e.g., temperature,
duration). d. Identify and quantify microbial growth using biochemical
tests, microscopy, or gram staining. e. Document results in the
laboratory information system (LIS) or log sheets.
B) Microscopy: a. Prepare a slide with the specimen and perform
gram staining. b. Examine the slide under a microscope. c. Identify
microbial presence and morphology. d. Document results in the LIS
or log sheets.
C) Molecular Diagnostics (e.g., PCR): a. Extract DNA/RNA from the
NUSWAB specimen using extraction kits. b. Prepare the PCR
reaction mix with extracted nucleic acids. c. Run the PCR machine
according to manufacturer instructions. d. Analyze amplification
results to detect specific pathogens. e. Document results in the LIS or
log sheets.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials with each batch of specimens to
ensure proper function of the analytical method.
2. Document quality control results and take corrective actions if
quality control fails.
3. Reassess specimens in a failed batch if necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed by
the technologist.
• Any conflicting or unusual results are documented and brought to
a supervisor's attention for verification.
• All final results are reported according to site-specific reporting
guidelines in the LIS.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Results for vaginitis can be categorized as follows:
• Presence or absence of bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, and
trichomonas, based on identified pathogens.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for each employed analytical
method (culture, microscopy, molecular diagnostics) for specific
limitations and considerations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control procedures consistently and document
these processes.

literature for detailed analytical techniques and limitations.
