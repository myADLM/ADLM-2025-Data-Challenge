VALPROIC ACID, FREE AND TOTAL, SERUM - SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the measurement of free
and total valproic acid levels in serum samples. This includes
instructions for sample preparation, instrument calibration, quality
control, and result reporting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube (no gel)
or serum separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum samples should be separated from cells within 2
hours of collection. Samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 5
days or frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum collected in tubes with anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled with the patient's information
and collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Instrument: Automated analyzer capable of performing valproic
acid assays (e.g. Beckman Coulter AU680).
• Valproic acid reagent kits.
• Quality control materials (two levels: normal and high).
• Calibrators: Traceable to known standards.
• Sample cups.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Timer.
• Centrifuge.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the clear, serum supernatant to a properly labeled
sample cup.
3. Perform an assessment for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
B) Instrument Preparation and Calibration
1. Refer to the analyzer’s operational manual for loading reagents
and preparing the instrument.
2. Perform daily calibration using the provided calibrators.
3. Validation of calibration with control samples should be done
before starting routine analyses.
4. Document calibration results in QC log.
C) Quality Control
1. Ensure the instrument has sufficient reagent and is properly
calibrated.
2. Run internal QC material at the start of each batch of samples,
after calibration, and at set intervals during testing.
3. Acceptable ranges for QC materials should be referenced from
the manufacturer’s guidelines; document all QC results.
4. If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and
repeat QC. Do not proceed with patient sample analysis until
control results are validated.
D) Sample Analysis
1. Place prepared serum samples onto the analyzer for valproic
acid testing.
2. Ensure no sample contamination by changing pipette tips
between samples.
3. Follow the analyzer prompts and procedure for initiating the
valproic acid assay.
4. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts, and
resolve them promptly.
E) Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. After the completion of sample analysis, review the result data
for any discrepancies or anomalies.
2. Verify the results against QC data to ensure accuracy.
3. Enter and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Report results according to the site-specific guidelines including
high or low critical values.
5. If results are critically high or low, notify the concerned clinician
immediately as per the critical result notification policies.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Free Valproic Acid: 5-20 µg/mL
• Total Valproic Acid: 50-125 µg/mL (therapeutic range)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can affect assay
results.
• Cross-reactivity: Certain medications may influence valproic acid
levels; consult package insert for specific interferences.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's package insert for valproic acid reagent kits.
• Analyzer's operational manual.
• CLSI guidelines on therapeutic drug monitoring.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all reagents and controls are stored and handled per
manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform regular calibration and validation procedures as outlined.
• Maintain all documentation related to QC and calibration.
By following this standardized procedure, the laboratory ensures the
accurate and reliable measurement of free and total valproic acid
levels in serum samples, facilitating proper therapeutic monitoring
and patient care.
