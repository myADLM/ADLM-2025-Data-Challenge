Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Valproic Acid, Free, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analysis and generation
of results for Free Valproic Acid in serum samples. This ensures
accurate and reliable results to support clinical decision-making.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in the analytical
phase of Free Valproic Acid serum testing in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure as instructed. The supervisors are accountable for
ensuring compliance and addressing any deviations.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated microcentrifuge
• Refrigerated ultracentrifuge (if required)
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Valproic Acid Free reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls for Valproic Acid
• Pipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
• Water bath (if needed)
• HPLC or immunoassay analyzer suitable for Valproic Acid
analysis
• Centrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Handling
1. Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
2. Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 1,500 to 2,000 g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
4. If not immediately analyzed, store serum at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
B. Preparation of Reagents and Calibration
1. Prepare the Valproic Acid Free reagent kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare calibrators and controls. Ensure they are within the
expiration date and stored as recommended.
3. Bring all reagents, calibrators, and controls to room
temperature before use.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration using the calibrators provided with the
reagent kit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run at least two levels of Quality Control (QC) material daily
before patient sample analysis. Ensure that QC results are
within the acceptable range.
3. Document all QC data and take appropriate corrective actions if
QC results fall outside established limits.
D. Analytical Procedure
1. Program the HPLC or immunoassay analyzer for Valproic Acid
Free analysis following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into labeled reaction containers or appropriate
wells.
3. Load the prepared samples into the analyzer.
4. Run the analysis according to the analyzer's protocols.
5. After completion, retrieve the results from the analyzer.
E. Interpretation and Reporting of Results
1. Compare the patient results with the reference intervals
provided: Free Valproic Acid (Therapeutic Range: 5-15 µg/mL).
2. Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
3. Document any critical values and follow the laboratory protocol
for immediate notification to the healthcare provider.
F. Troubleshooting
1. If there are discrepancies or issues with results, repeat the
analysis from the serum sample.
2. Check for potential sources of error such as instrument
malfunction, reagent deterioration, or sample misalignment.
3. Address any unresolved issues with the supervisor for further
investigation.
4. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples may interfere with the
results.
• Specimen storage conditions (exceeding recommended times or
temperatures) may affect the reliability of results.
1. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
Ensure that all equipment used in the analysis is maintained and
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the
laboratory's maintenance schedule.
1. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain thorough records of all calibrations, QC results, patient
results, troubleshooting steps, and any deviations. Documentation
should comply with regulatory and accreditation requirements.
