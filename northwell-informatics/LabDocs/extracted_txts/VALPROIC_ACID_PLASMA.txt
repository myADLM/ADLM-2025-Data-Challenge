Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Valproic Acid,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To define the method for the analysis of Valproic Acid (VPA) in
plasma samples using a standardized and validated protocol to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the determination of Valproic Acid in
plasma samples within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure as outlined. Supervisors ensure compliance and address
any issues that arise during the performance of the procedures.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected in EDTA (lavender-top) or heparin (green-top)
tubes.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Clotted samples.
• Samples collected in tubes other than EDTA or heparin.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma samples are stable for up to 24 hours at room
temperature (15–25°C).
• Samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• For long-term storage, samples should be kept at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector
• Pipettes (adjustable volume)
Reagents:
• High purity water
• Methanol (HPLC grade)
• Acetonitrile (HPLC grade)
• Valproic Acid Standard
• Internal Standard (e.g., Valproate-d3)
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibration of the HPLC system should be performed daily using a
series of Valproic Acid standards prepared in plasma matrix.
• The calibration curve should have a minimum of five
concentration levels.
• Quality control samples (low, medium, and high concentrations)
will be analyzed with each batch of patient samples to ensure
method accuracy and precision.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the plasma samples at 1500xg for 10 minutes at
4°C.
◦ Carefully transfer the plasma to a new labeled tube to avoid
erythrocyte contamination.
2. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Pipette 200 µL of plasma into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add 600 µL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of internal standard.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 15000xg for 10 minutes at 4°C.
3. Supernatant Collection:
◦ Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to an HPLC vial for
analysis.
B) HPLC Analysis:
1. System Preparation:
◦ Ensure the HPLC system is calibrated according to the
manufacturer's specifications.
◦ Load the prepared calibration standards, quality control
samples, and patient samples into the autosampler.
2. Chromatographic Conditions:
◦ Column: C18 reverse-phase column (4.6x250 mm, 5µm).
◦ Mobile Phase: Isocratic mixture of water and methanol
(60:40 v/v).
◦ Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min.
◦ Detection Wavelength: 210 nm.
◦ Injection Volume: 20 µL.
3. Run the Samples:
◦ Initiate the HPLC run according to the established protocol.
◦ Ensure proper integration of peaks corresponding to
Valproic Acid and the internal standard.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Use the calibration curve to quantify Valproic Acid in patient
samples.
◦ Ensure quality control samples fall within the acceptable
range.
◦ Review and verify results before reporting.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) after verification by a qualified
technologist.
• Review for any potential issues regarding sample integrity (e.g.
hemolysis or lipemia):
◦ If potential integrity issues are identified, consult supervisory
staff before reporting results.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow laboratory safety protocols when handling chemicals and
biological specimens.
• Wear appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Dispose of waste according to hazardous waste disposal
guidelines.
