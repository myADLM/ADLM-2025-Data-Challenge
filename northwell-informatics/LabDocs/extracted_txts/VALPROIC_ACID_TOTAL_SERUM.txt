Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for VALPROIC ACID, TOTAL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a clear protocol for the accurate measurement and
reporting of valproic acid levels in serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow the
SOPs outlined below and ensure accurate and timely results
reporting. All staff must adhere to the procedure and reporting
guidelines, including any corrective actions required.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Valproic Acid Assay Kit (appropriate to the instrument being used)
• Calibrators
• Controls (low-level, high-level)
• Reagent grade water and solvents as required by the assay kit
• Disposable pipettes, tubes, and tips
• Serum samples
B. Pre-Analytical Requirements:
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST)
• Minimum Volume Required: 0.5 mL serum
• Stability: Serum samples must be stored at 2-8°C and tested
within 48 hours of collection or frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum sample to reach room temperature if
refrigerated.
2. Invert the tube gently to mix the serum before aliquoting.
3. Ensure all samples, standards, and controls are prepared
according to manufacturer's instructions.
C. Analytical Procedure:
Instrument Setup:
1. Power on the analyzer and allow it to complete initial self-tests
and warm-up procedures.
2. Check reagent and calibrator levels; replace if necessary.
Running the Assay:
1. Run daily instrument quality control checks using low and high
controls provided in the assay kit. Record the control results.
2. Calibrate the assay using the calibrators provided in the assay
kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Process serum samples, controls, and calibration standards
according to the protocol specified in the assay kit insert.
4. Load serum samples, controls, and calibrators into the
analyzer. Input relevant sample information into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
D. Quality Control
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples to
ensure the accuracy and precision of the assay.
• Record control results to monitor assay performance.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, take corrective action
based on manufacturer’s guidelines and rerun controls before
proceeding with patient samples.
E. Reporting Results:
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic Range: 50-100 µg/mL
• Toxic Level: >125 µg/mL
Reporting:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
2. Technologists must review and verify all results, ensuring that
any abnormal or critical values are flagged.
3. Notify attending physician or responsible healthcare provider
immediately for critical values (Toxic Level: >125 µg/mL).
Commenting on Unusual Result Circumstances:
• If hemolysis, lipemia, or other interference is suspected, note in
the report: “Result may be affected by interference due to [specify
interference].”
• For samples below detection limit, report as "<[Lower Limit of
Detection] µg/mL."
• For samples exceeding upper measurement limit, report as
">[Upper Limit of Detection] µg/mL."
F. Method Limitations:
• Interferences may occur from various substances; refer to the
assay kit insert for specific limitations and troubleshooting
guidelines.
• Results may be affected by improper specimen handling or
storage conditions.
G. Troubleshooting:
1. Follow manufacturer's instructions for resolving instrument
errors or assay issues.
2. Notify the supervisor in case of persistent issues or if additional
support is needed.
