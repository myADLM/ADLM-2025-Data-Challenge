Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Vancomycin-Resistant
Enterococcus, Molecular Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedures for the molecular detection of
Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) utilizing PCR techniques
in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
following the procedures outlined in this protocol to ensure accurate
and reliable molecular detection of VRE. Supervisory staff shall
oversee the adherence to these protocols and ensure corrective
actions in case of any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Rectal swab, stool sample, or clinical isolate (e.g., from wound or
urine), stored and transported in an appropriate transport
medium.
• Specimen should be received within 24 hours of collection,
maintained at 2-8°C if stored or transported for over 2 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens delivered to the laboratory more than 24 hours post-
collection without proper storage conditions.
• Specimens with no specified collection date or time.
• Specimens not stored in appropriate transport media or
conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• PCR thermocycler
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Biological safety cabinet
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit (validated for clinical samples)
• PCR master mix with specific primers for the detection of VRE
genes (vanA, vanB)
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative controls
Supplies:
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes
• Specimen transport medium
• Sterile swabs
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen labeling and acceptability criteria.
2. Perform DNA extraction using the designated DNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Assemble PCR reaction mix as follows:
◦ Add 25 µL PCR master mix to a PCR tube.
◦ Add 1-5 µL extracted DNA.
◦ Add 19-23 µL nuclease-free water to make up the total
volume of 50 µL.
◦ Include positive and negative controls.
PCR Amplification:
1. Program the PCR thermocycler:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
2. Load PCR tubes into the thermocycler and start the run.
Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Validate PCR products using gel electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
◦ Load 10 µL of PCR product mixed with 2 µL of loading dye
into gel wells.
◦ Include DNA ladder for size reference.
◦ Run electrophoresis at 100 volts for approximately 40
minutes.
2. Place gel under UV transilluminator and visualize bands.
3. Compare bands to positive control and marker to determine the
presence of VRE genes.
Quality Control:
1. Use positive and negative controls in each batch to ensure
PCR accuracy.
2. If positive control fails to amplify or negative control shows
amplification, troubleshoot and repeat PCR.
Reporting Results:
1. Positive detection – Presence of specific bands matching VRE
genes.
2. Negative detection – Absence of amplification bands.
3. Report findings to LIS according to site-specific guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
• Not applicable (qualitative detection).
Method Limitations: Refer to the PCR kit insert for individual reagent
and procedural limitations.
