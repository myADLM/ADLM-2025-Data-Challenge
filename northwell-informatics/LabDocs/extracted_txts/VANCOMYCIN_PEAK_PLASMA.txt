Protocol for Analytical Phase of Vancomycin Peak Plasma
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analytical
phase of processing and generating results for Vancomycin
Peak Plasma levels in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
◦ Plasma from EDTA or lithium heparin tubes.
Collection Time:
◦ Peak plasma levels are typically collected 1 hour post-
infusion of vancomycin.
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Plasma sample that has been collected and sent to the
laboratory within 4 hours of collection.
◦ Specimen should be centrifuged immediately upon arrival if
not already done, and plasma separated for analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected outside the 1-hour post-infusion
window.
◦ Hemolyzed specimens.
◦ Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 4 hours
post-collection.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Vancomycin assay kit (manufacturer instructions to be
followed).
◦ Calibrators and quality control material specific to the assay.
◦ Centrifuge for plasma separation.
◦ Refrigerated storage for plasma samples if required.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
◦ Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated.
◦ Allow reagents and controls to reach room temperature
before use unless stated otherwise by the manufacturer.
Analysis:
◦ Calibration should be performed as per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Quality controls must be run before sample analysis to
ensure accuracy and reliability of test results.
◦ Load plasma samples in accordance with assay
instructions.
◦ Follow the specific steps outlined in the assay kit for
processing the plasma samples.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use two levels of quality control material (e.g., low and high
concentration) with every new batch of reagents, and at
predetermined intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
◦ Record all results of quality control checks along with date,
time, and initials of the technologist performing the test.
◦ Any out-of-range control results must be investigated, and
corrective actions recorded.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Peak Vancomycin Levels:
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) once confirmed.
◦ Technologist must review and verify results before reporting.
Reference Intervals:
◦ Therapeutic Range: Peak plasma levels typically range
between 25-40 µg/mL.
◦ Results that fall outside the therapeutic range must be
flagged, and critical values communicated to the responsible
clinician according to laboratory policy.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Interferences such as lipemia, hemolysis, and icterus may
affect the result accuracy.
◦ Ensure correct timing of specimen collection to accurately
assess peak levels.
◦ Detailed limitations should be referenced in the vancomycin
assay kit insert.
8. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
◦ In the event of out-of-range quality control or calibration
results, recalibrate the instrument and recheck the quality
controls.
◦ If continuous deviations occur, consult the supervisor and
review instrument maintenance protocols.
9. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain all quality control logs, calibration records, and
specimen tracking logs.
◦ All corrective actions taken should be documented with
reason, steps taken and outcome.
10. REFERENCES
◦ Specific assay kit instructions (Product insert).
◦ Laboratory internal protocols for specimen handling and
equipment maintenance.
◦ CLIA guidelines for waived and non-waived testing.
End of Protocol
Ensure all trained personnel adhere to this protocol to maintain
consistent and reliable results for Vancomycin Peak Plasma level
testing.
