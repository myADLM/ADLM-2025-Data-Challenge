Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Vancomycin, Peak, Serum
1. Purpose
This procedure specifies the steps required for the analysis of peak
serum vancomycin levels to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Any designated laboratory staff performing vancomycin peak
serum analysis are responsible for following this procedure
meticulously.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring this SOP is adhered to
and for addressing any issues related to test performance or
equipment functionality.
1. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type: Peak serum specimens.
Preferred Collection:
• Collect blood sample 1 hour after intravenous infusion of
vancomycin is completed.
• Use a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes, then centrifuge to separate
the serum.
Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for analysis.
Stability:
• Serum specimens should be analyzed as soon as possible after
collection.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, store the serum at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
or citrate).
• Samples not properly labeled or without collection date/time
indicated.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system:
◦ Column: C18 reverse-phase.
◦ Mobile phase: Acetonitrile-water (70:30, v/v) containing 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).
• Vancomycin assay kit, reagents, and controls.
• Calibrators and quality control materials.
• Centrifuge.
• Serum separator tubes (SST).
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
1. Procedure
Specimen Processing:
1. Verify specimen labeling and collection information.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube for 10 minutes at 1500 x g to separate
the serum.
3. Pipette the serum into a labeled microtube for analysis.
Sample Analysis:
1. Calibrate the HPLC system using vancomycin calibrators at the
beginning of each day or after any maintenance.
2. Prepare calibration curve covering the expected range of
vancomycin concentrations in serum.
3. Load 100 µL of prepared serum sample into the HPLC system.
4. Run the HPLC analysis program as per the instrument's
manufacturer instructions.
5. The auto-sampler will inject the sample into the HPLC system
conditioned with the mobile phase.
6. The system will separate vancomycin, and the detector will
measure its concentration.
7. Review chromatograms and identify peaks corresponding to
vancomycin in each sample.
Quality Control:
• Run low, medium, and high concentration quality control samples
alongside patient samples.
• Accept results only if quality control samples fall within the
specified limits.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
1. Reporting Results
• Vancomycin peak serum levels are typically reported in
micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL).
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Results are to be reviewed by the technologist prior to final
validation and release.
• Ensure any critical values are reported according to the
laboratory’s critical value policy.
1. Reference Intervals
• Therapeutic range for vancomycin peak serum levels: typically
20-40 µg/mL, but consult specific site or clinical guidelines.
1. Method Limitations
• Interference may occur from other co-administered medications;
ensure accurate patient medication records.
• Quality control assessments must be strictly followed to ensure
integrity and accuracy.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for vancomycin assay kit and HPLC.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on vancomycin therapeutic
monitoring.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate
determination of peak serum vancomycin levels, thus enabling
appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring for improved patient care
outcomes.
