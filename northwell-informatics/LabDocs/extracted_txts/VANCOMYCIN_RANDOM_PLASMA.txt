Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Vancomycin, Random, Plasma
1. Purpose: This SOP describes the analytical process for
determining plasma levels of Vancomycin in random samples.
This ensures consistent and accurate testing, documentation,
and result reporting.
2. Responsibility: All designated laboratory technologists are
responsible for following the procedures outlined in this SOP. It
is the responsibility of the laboratory manager or lead
technologist to ensure this SOP is followed and that all
laboratory personnel are trained on the procedures.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Calibrated micropipettes and tips
◦ Plasma-specific Vancomycin assay kit (e.g., immunoassay,
HPLC)
◦ Calibration standards and quality control materials specific
to Vancomycin
◦ Controls (low, medium, and high)
◦ Analyzer/instrumentation for Vancomycin measurement
(e.g., automated analyzer, HPLC system)
◦ Laboratory timer
◦ Plasma separation tubes (PST) or EDTA tubes
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred specimen: Non-hemolyzed plasma specimens
collected in plasma separation tubes (PST) or EDTA tubes.
◦ Volume: Sufficient to run the assay as specified by the
assay manufacturer (typically 0.5–1 mL).
◦ Storage: Specimens must be stored at 2–8°C and analyzed
within 48 hours of collection. If longer storage is necessary,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C and thawed at room
temperature before analysis.
◦ Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic
specimens. Specimens with labels containing incomplete or
mismatched information.
5. Procedure: A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
◦ Verify specimen identification and ensure that all specimens
are properly labeled with patient details and collection time.
◦ Centrifuge specimens at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Carefully
transfer the plasma into a clean, labeled tube, avoiding the
transfer of any cellular components.
◦ Store or proceed with analysis based on the assay
manufacturer's guidelines.
B. Analytical Phase:
• Prepare the analyzer or HPLC system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibrate the instrument using the provided calibration standards.
Calibration should be verified daily or according to the assay kit
requirements.
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) to ensure the
instrument is functioning correctly. All QC results must fall within
the specified range before proceeding with patient samples.
• Pipette the appropriate volume of plasma, standards, and controls
into the labeled reagent containers or wells, as described in the
assay procedure.
• Load the samples onto the analyzer or HPLC system.
• Initiate the analysis, ensuring that the instrument settings,
including incubation times, temperatures, and detection
parameters, are set according to the assay protocol.
• Review the instrument readouts and ensure that QC results are
within the acceptable range. If QC fails, troubleshoot according to
the instrument manual and repeat QC testing.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
• Evaluate the generated patient results. Review for consistency
and flag any values outside the expected therapeutic range (10–
20 mcg/mL for Vancomycin).
• Document any critical or out-of-range results and follow the
laboratory's protocol for critical value reporting.
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review and final verification by a designated technologist or
pathologist.
• Ensure all documentation, including calibration, quality control
data, and patient results, are recorded and stored according to
laboratory protocol.
1. Method Limitations: Refer to the assay kit insert for specific
limitations related to the Vancomycin assay, including possible
interferences and cross-reactivity.
2. Quality Control: Quality control is crucial. Run quality controls
with each assay batch:
◦ Record each level of control with the date, time, and
technologist's initials.
◦ Investigate and document any QC failures, and take
necessary corrective actions before resuming patient
testing.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ All results must be reviewed and formally verified before
being released.
◦ Log any critical results that are reported immediately to the
clinician, including the date, time, and individual contacted.
4. References:
◦ Manufacturer's instrument and reagent inserts for
Calibration Standards, Quality Controls, and Assay Kits.
◦ Laboratory's quality management manual and laboratory
information system protocols.

By following this SOP, we ensure that the determination of
Vancomycin levels in plasma is accurate, reliable, and consistent with
laboratory standards.
