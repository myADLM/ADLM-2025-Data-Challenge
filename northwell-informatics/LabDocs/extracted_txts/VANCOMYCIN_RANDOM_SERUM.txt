Standard Operating Procedure: VANCOMYCIN, RANDOM,
SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedures for the analysis of
Vancomycin levels in random serum samples to ensure accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility of results in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of generating results for
Vancomycin, random, serum, within the biochemistry department.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance, training
personnel, and resolving any discrepancies.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain red top
tube.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge at 3000 rpm
for 10 minutes.
• Separate the serum from the clot as soon as possible.
• For optimal stability, analyze the serum within 2 hours of
separation or store at 2-8ºC for up to 7 days or freeze at -20ºC for
longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in EDTA, citrate, or heparin tubes.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott Architect, Roche
Cobas).
• Vancomycin reagent kits (appropriate for the specified analyzer).
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high).
• Calibrators for Vancomycin.
• SST or plain red top tubes.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Run quality control (QC) materials (low, medium, high) at the
beginning of each shift, with each batch of samples, and when
changing reagent lots.
• QC materials must be stored and handled as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Procedure:
• Verify that all QC results are within the acceptable range prior to
reporting patient results.
• In case of QC failure, troubleshoot as per the manufacturer’s
guide. Document all corrective actions taken.
7. PROCEDURE
Calibrating the Analyzer:
1. Load the Vancomycin calibrators onto the analyzer.
2. Perform calibration according to the analyzer’s manual and the
reagent kit insert.
3. Verify calibration by running QC materials.
Analyzing Patient Samples:
1. Load patient serum samples onto the sample rack in the
analyzer.
2. Enter or scan sample identification and order information into
the LIS or analyzer's software.
3. Ensure the reagent cartridges are correctly loaded and the
analyzer is primed.
4. Start the analysis.
5. Review the generated data for any flags or errors. Investigate
and resolve as necessary.
6. Document all procedural steps, particularly any deviations and
corrective actions.
Troubleshooting:
• Check for common issues such as clogs, empty reagent packs, or
software errors.
• Refer to the analyzer’s user manual for specific troubleshooting
steps.
• Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Verification:
• Check that all QC results are within acceptable limits before
releasing patient results.
• Manually verify any results flagged by the analyzer for review.
Result Entry:
• Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure accurate transcription by cross-checking entries.
Critical Results:
• Notify the appropriate clinical personnel immediately for any
critical Vancomycin levels as per the laboratory’s policy.
• Document the notification process according to the laboratory’s
critical value protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 10-20 µg/mL
• Toxic range: >20 µg/mL
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other medications or substances.
• Interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Ensure proper sample collection, handling, and storage to
minimize pre-analytical errors.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all analytical data, including QC, calibrations, patient
results, and any deviations from the SOP in the appropriate
logbooks or electronic records.
• Maintain equipment maintenance logs.
