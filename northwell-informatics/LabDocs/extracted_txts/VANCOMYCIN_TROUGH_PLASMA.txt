SOP: Analytical Phase Procedure for Vancomycin, Trough,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for vancomycin trough levels in plasma. Monitoring vancomycin
trough levels is essential to ensure therapeutic efficacy and to avoid
toxicity in patients receiving vancomycin therapy.
1. DEFINITION
Vancomycin trough levels are determined from plasma samples
collected just prior to the patient’s next dose of vancomycin. The
concentration of vancomycin in the plasma at this time is typically at
its lowest, which helps in assessing whether dosing adjustments are
required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Plasma collected into a Lithium Heparin (green top) or EDTA
(purple top) tube.
• Collection Timing:
◦ Draw the sample approximately 30 minutes before the next
scheduled dose of vancomycin.
• Stability:
◦ Plasma samples are stable for 24 hours at room temperature.
◦ Samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instrument: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(HPLC) or Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Abbott Architect).
• Control materials: Commercially available high and low
vancomycin controls.
• Reagents: Calibrators, quality control materials, and vancomycin
reagents supplied by the instrument manufacturer.
• Supplies: Pipettes, plasma separation tubes, sample cups, and
personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Checks:
1. Verify patient identification and confirm that the sample
collection time corresponds with the specimen's labeling.
2. Ensure samples are free from hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia as
these can interfere with the results.
B. Instrument Preparation:
1. Turn on the instrument and perform a system check using the
manufacturer’s specific recommendations.
2. Ensure the reagents, calibrators, and control materials are
within their expiration dates and have been stored correctly.
C. Calibration:
1. Run a full calibration if it is the first run of the day, after
maintenance, or if a new lot of reagents has been introduced.
2. Apply the calibration curve as instructed by the manufacturer’s
guidelines and ensure calibration fits acceptability criteria.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at high and low levels before
processing patient samples.
2. Verify that QC results fall within the predefined acceptable
range.
3. Document QC results and any corrective actions taken if QC is
out of range.
E. Sample Analysis:
1. Centrifuge the plasma samples at 1,500-2,000 g for 10-15
minutes to ensure cell-free plasma.
2. Pipette the required volume of plasma into the sample cups or
directly into the instrument as required.
3. Load the samples onto the instrument.
4. Start the analysis sequence ensuring all conditions (like
temperature and instrumentation settings) are set according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
5. Monitor the instrument and record any error messages and
troubleshooting steps if necessary.
6. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE:
7. Allow the instrument to complete the run.
8. Confirm that the instrument’s internal quality controls (internal
system checks, blanks) comply with acceptable limits for each
run/batch.
9. POST-ANALYTICAL:
A. Result Validation:
1. Once analysis is complete, review the results in accordance
with the laboratory's criteria.
2. Verify that all controls have passed and there are no flagged
issues with the sample results.
B. Reporting Results:
1. Validate the results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
2. Document any critical values or notes for the healthcare
provider.
3. Release the results following laboratory protocol and document
the date and time of reporting.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Vancomycin Trough Levels: 10-20 µg/mL (may vary depending on
the clinical condition).
• NOTE: Adjust reference intervals based on the laboratory’s
specific protocols or physician guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Daily, or as often as stated in the manufacturer’s guidelines,
quality control for vancomycin assays should be verified using
commercially available quality control materials.
• Document and review QC results in the QC log. Investigate and
resolve any QC failures before analyzing patient samples.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING:
• Ensure that all steps of the process, from sample receipt,
analysis, QC results, and final validation, are diligently recorded.
• Properly document any corrective actions or deviations from
SOPs.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for use (IFU) of reagents and
instruments.
• CLSI Guidelines for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM).
• Internal laboratory policies and quality management
documentation.
