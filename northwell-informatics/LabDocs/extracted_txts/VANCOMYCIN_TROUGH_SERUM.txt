Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for Vancomycin, Trough, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and generation
of results for Vancomycin, Trough, Serum levels in the laboratory.
Ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of patient results to
guide therapeutic decisions.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
perform and document the analysis following the SOP requirements.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
addressing any issues that may arise during the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITION
Vancomycin is an antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections.
The trough serum level of Vancomycin refers to the lowest
concentration of the drug in a patient's bloodstream, typically
measured just before the next dose is administered.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Serum • Collection Time: Trough level, sample
collected 30 minutes before the next scheduled dose. • Container:
Serum separator tube (SST, gold stopper) or plain red-top tube. •
Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum. • Stability: Specimen is
stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature, 48 hours refrigerated
(2-8 °C), and longer term if frozen (-20 °C or colder).
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 6000) • Vancomycin assay
reagents (specific to analyzer) • Calibrators and Quality Control
materials (appropriate for Vancomycin analysis) • Pipettes and tips •
Centrifuge
C) Quality Control:
• Run quality control (QC) samples before patient specimens and
after every 20 patient samples or at least once per shift. • Use two
levels of QC (low and high) with target values provided by the
manufacturer. • Record QC results and take corrective actions if QC
fails (recalibrate analyzer, re-run QC, notify supervisor).
D) Calibration:
• Follow manufacturer's instructions for calibration. • Perform
calibration upon reagent lot changes or as recommended by the
manufacturer. • Document calibration activities in the calibration log.
E) Analytical Procedure:
1. Preparation: • Ensure all reagents are within their expiration
dates. • Set up the chemistry analyzer and verify functionality.
2. Specimen Processing: • Centrifuge collected serum samples at
3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate serum. • Aliquot serum
into labeled test tubes if necessary. • Load serum samples into
the analyzer according to the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Analysis: • Select the Vancomycin assay on the analyzer. •
Follow the on-screen instructions for sample loading. • Ensure
proper identification of specimens in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). • Run the Vancomycin trough level analysis
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Result Generation: • Review results generated by the analyzer.
• Verify results against QC and calibration standards. • Ensure
data entry into the LIS. • Flag any critical values according to
lab policy.
F) Reporting Results:
• Document results in patient records accurately. • Inform the treating
physician of any critical values immediately following lab protocols. •
Utilize LIS to ensure results are communicated efficiently and
reviewed by the responsible technologist before final verification.
G) Reference Intervals:
Vancomycin Trough (Serum): • Desired therapeutic range: 10-20 µg/
mL (may vary slightly based on institutional guidelines). • Toxic level:
>20 µg/mL
H) Method Limitations:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can interfere with the assay – observe
specimens for abnormalities and reprocess if needed. • Results
should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical status and
alongside other laboratory parameters.

Review: This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated in
accordance with new guidelines or upon implementation of new
technology.
