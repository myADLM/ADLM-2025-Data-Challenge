Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for VANILLA, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose: To provide detailed instructions on the analytical
process for generating results for VANILLA, IGE, SERUM,
ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of test results.
2. Scope: This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel
involved in the analysis of VANILLA, IGE, SERUM within the
laboratory.
3. Responsibilities:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as stated in this SOP.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and for addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
process.
1. Definitions:
• VANILLA: Refers to specific tests identifying the presence of
vanillin or related compounds in serum.
• IGE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody measured in serum.
• SERUM: The liquid part of the blood after coagulation, devoid of
cells and clotting factors.
1. Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) reader or other
relevant analyzers
• Refrigerators and freezers (temperature-monitored)
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (temperature-monitored)
1. Reagents and Supplies:
• VANILLA test kits
• IGE test kits (e.g., ELISA kits specific for human IgE)
• Serum separation tubes
• Calibration and control materials
• Pipette tips
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• 70% ethanol or appropriate disinfectant for cleaning
1. Specimen and Sample Preparation:
• Acceptable specimens include serum collected in serum
separation tubes.
• Unacceptable specimens include hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
• Upon receipt, record specimen details and ensure conformity with
acceptance criteria.
• Centrifuge the serum separation tubes at 1500g for 10 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the serum into appropriately labeled sample
cups for analysis.
1. Procedure: A) VANILLA:
2. Preparation:
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Perform according to the specific instructions provided in the
VANILLA test kit insert.
◦ Add required volume of standards, controls, and samples
into respective wells.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate at the specified temperature and
duration.
◦ Wash the plate as instructed.
◦ Add the appropriate substrate solution and incubate.
◦ Add stop solution and read the results using an ELISA plate
reader.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of vanillin in the samples by
comparing to the standard curve.
B) IGE (Immunoglobulin E):
1. Preparation:
◦ Equilibrate all reagents, controls, and specimens to room
temperature.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the specific instructions of the IgE ELISA kit.
◦ Pipette standards, quality controls, and patient samples into
designated wells.
◦ Incubate the plate as per the kit instructions.
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly.
◦ Add enzyme-labeled antibodies and incubate.
◦ Add the substrate solution, incubate, and add the stop
solution.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) using an ELISA reader.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ Plot the standard curve and determine IgE concentration in
samples by extrapolation.
C) Data Entry and Quality Control:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly.
• Review quality control data for each batch to verify accuracy.
• Log any deviations or issues encountered along with corrective
actions taken.
1. Reporting Results:
• Results must be verified by a qualified technologist before
reporting.
• For VANILLA and IgE results, adhere to the interpretation
guidelines specified by the test kit and reference ranges.
1. Quality Control:
• Use control samples with every batch of tests performed.
• Calibrate equipment as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Document each step of the process, including sample
identification and handling.
1. Corrective Actions:
• If results fall outside control limits, retest the samples.
• Check for potential sources of error, such as reagent validity,
instrument performance, and sample quality.
• Document any corrective measures taken.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the VANILLA test kit.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the IgE ELISA kit.
• Laboratory-specific quality control and calibration logs.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the reliability
and accuracy of the VANILLA, IGE, SERUM test results, thereby
maintaining the highest standard of patient care and diagnostic
accuracy.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to comply
with any changes in procedures, instruments, or quality standards.
