Vanilla Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Testing Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedure for the analysis of Vanilla Immunoglobulin G
(IgG) levels in serum samples using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for complying
with this SOP and for quality control (QC) procedures.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report and document any
anomalies or issues in the assay process to the laboratory
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL blood collected in a serum separator
tube (SST) or a plain red-top tube.
◦ Serum should be separated from cells and collected within 2
hours of blood draw.
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus should be avoided as these
conditions can interfere with assay results.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection if not
refrigerated.
◦ Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
◦ Specimens received without proper identification or collection
date/time.
Storage:
• Serum samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower and are stable for up to 6 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA microplate reader
• Microplate washer or manual washing tools
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• IgG ELISA kit (including coated plates, standards, controls,
enzyme conjugate, substrate solution, and stop solution)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory bench protection supplies
1. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Ensure that all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Set up the ELISA reader to the appropriate wavelength as
specified by the ELISA kit manufacturer (commonly 450 nm).
• Label all microplate wells and pipette tips appropriately to prevent
cross-contamination.
A) Sample and Reagent Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples and bring them to room temperature if
previously stored frozen.
2. Vortex samples and standards to ensure even mixing.
3. Prepare the standard curve by serial dilution of the provided
IgG standard as per the kit instructions.
4. Prepare any controls as specified by the kit and ensure
inclusion of at least one positive and one negative control in
each assay run.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and sample to the
designated wells in the ELISA microplate.
2. Cover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate as specified by
the manufacturer (typically 1-2 hours at room temperature or
37°C).
3. Wash the plate 3-5 times using the wash buffer provided in the
kit, ensuring complete removal of liquid at each step.
◦ Note: Wash steps should be performed rigorously to
minimize background noise.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate
again as per kit instructions (typically 30 minutes - 1 hour at
room temperature).
5. Wash the plate again 3-5 times as described above.
6. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well and incubate
in the dark for the time specified by the manufacturer (typically
10-30 minutes). Do not exceed the incubation time.
7. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
8. Immediately read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using
the microplate reader.
Quality Control:
• Run the assay with both positive and negative controls in each
plate.
• Verify that the control values are within the expected range before
accepting the assay results.
• Repeat assays that fail to meet QC criteria.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
2. Calculate the concentration of Vanilla IgG in each sample using
the standard curve. Ensure that the calibration curve includes at
least five calibration points.
3. Manually or electronically log and verify all results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Include relevant clinical comments if applicable.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Internal reference intervals should be established based on validated
data from healthy controls.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure samples are free of significant hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus to avoid interference with reading.
• Ensure proper washing of plates to avoid high background
readings.

guidelines.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will be able to
accurately measure Vanilla IgG levels from serum samples and
ensure reliable, reproducible results.
