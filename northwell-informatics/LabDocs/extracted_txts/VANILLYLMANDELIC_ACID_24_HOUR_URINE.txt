Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Vanillylmandelic
Acid (VMA), 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA) in 24-hour urine
samples. The procedure ensures accurate, reliable and
reproducible results for the detection of VMA, indicative of
catecholamine metabolism disorders.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to perform the analysis following the guidelines outlined in
this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff competency
and adherence to this SOP, and for addressing any procedural issues
or deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Collection:
• Collect urine over a 24-hour period in a container provided by the
laboratory.
• Ensure the collection container has the appropriate preservative
(e.g., 10-15 mL of 6N HCl) to maintain urine pH below 3.
Specimen Transport:
• Ensure the urine container is labeled with the patient's
information, total volume, collection start and end times, and the
preservative used.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory promptly in a sealed,
original container.
Specimen Storage:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C prior to testing. If testing is to be
delayed for more than 24 hours, aliquot and freeze samples at
-20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without preservative.
• Specimens with incorrect collection volume or duration.
• Specimens with visible signs of contamination.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Standard VMA solution for calibration.
• Mobile Phase Solution: Ensure composition as required by
analytical protocol.
• Internal Standard solution.
• Extraction solvents.
• Acid and base solutions for pH adjustment as specified.
Equipment:
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector.
• Analytical balance.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Glassware including volumetric flasks, centrifuge tubes, and
sample vials.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Prepare calibration standards according to manufacturer's
instructions and laboratory specifications.
• Run calibration standards at the beginning of each batch and
ensure a calibration curve is established before sample analysis.
Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of quality control (QC) samples in each
batch (one low concentration and one high concentration).
• Run QC samples after calibration and periodically throughout the
batch.
• Verify that QC results fall within acceptable limits; take
appropriate corrective action if these limits are exceeded.
1. SAMPLE PREPARATION
Preparation:
• Measure the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection and
record.
• Pipette a representative aliquot (e.g., 5-10 mL) into a centrifuge
tube.
• Add the internal standard to each aliquot.
• Adjust pH of urine aliquots to specific range required by
methodology using acid/base solutions.
• Perform an extraction procedure using suitable solvents (e.g.,
solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction).
• Vortex and centrifuge samples as specified by extraction
procedure.
• Transfer the extract to clean, labeled sample vials for HPLC
analysis.
1. HPLC ANALYSIS
System Preparation:
• Prepare and load the HPLC system with necessary mobile
phases.
• Condition the column according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Set the HPLC parameters (e.g., flow rate, gradient elution,
detection wavelength).
Sample Analysis:
• Inject calibration standards, QC samples, and prepared urine
samples onto the HPLC system.
• Run the analysis according to method parameters.
• Record chromatograms and analyze peaks corresponding to VMA
and internal standard.
1. REPORTING AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Data Analysis:
• Calculate the concentration of VMA in the samples using the
calibration curve and internal standard normalization.
Reporting:
• Report VMA results in mg/24 hours.
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by the responsible
technologist before release.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered, and take
corrective action as per protocols.
1. NOTES ON INTERPRETATION AND REFERENCE
INTERVALS
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals for VMA may vary based on age and other
factors; provide values in the context of clinically relevant
reference intervals.
Interpretation:
• Elevated VMA levels may indicate potential disorders of
catecholamine metabolism such as pheochromocytoma or
neuroblastoma.
• Interpret findings in conjunction with clinical observations and
other laboratory results.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Quality Assurance:
• Participate in proficiency testing as available.
• Conduct regular instrument maintenance and performance
verification.
Troubleshooting:
• If HPLC system malfunctions, follow diagnostic procedures
outlined in the instrument manual.
• Address sample preparation issues (e.g., poor extraction
efficiency) by reviewing and adjusting method parameters.
