Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
for the Determination of Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA) and
Homovanillic Acid (HVA) in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for
analysis of Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA) and Homovanillic Acid (HVA)
in random urine specimens in order to ensure consistent and
accurate results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel in the laboratory conducting
the analysis of VMA and HVA in random urine specimens, utilizing
specific HPLC or LC-MS/MS methods.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analytical procedure
according to this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure that appropriate quality control
is maintained and documented. Verify that calibration and
maintenance of instruments are up-to-date.
• Quality Control/Assurance Staff: Review and verify QC and
proficiency testing results, provide resolutions for any
discrepancies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Calibrated pH meter
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
• VMA and HVA standards
• Internal standards (if required)
• Reagent grade methanol
• Mobile phase solutions (specific to the analysis method)
• Urine collection containers (sterile)
• 0.2 µm filters
• Standard preparation solvents: water, methanol, and formic acid
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
1. Preparation of Mobile Phase:
◦ Prepare the mobile phase solutions as per the specifications
in the HPLC/LC-MS/MS method.
◦ Filter and degas the mobile phase before use.
2. Preparation of Standards:
◦ VMA and HVA standards should be prepared at desired
concentrations using reagent grade methanol or another
specified solvent.
◦ Use calibrated pipettes for preparation and ensure
appropriate labeling and storage conditions.
B. Specimen Prepation
1. Receiving and Logging Samples:
◦ Record sample receipt and accession number in the
laboratory information system.
◦ Check that samples are sealed and labeled correctly.
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ Aliquot the random urine sample (typically 2-5 mL) into a
sample tube.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3500 rpm for 15 minutes to remove
particulates.
◦ Filter the supernatant through a 0.2 µm filter to ensure
clarity.
3. Internal Standards (if required):
◦ Add the specified volume of internal standard to each
aliquot of urine sample before analysis.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. HPLC/LC-MS/MS Set-Up:
◦ Prime and calibrate the instrument according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Load standards, quality controls, and urine samples onto the
autosampler tray.
◦ Set the sample run sequence, ensuring QC samples are
included at defined intervals between unknown samples.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Follow the instrument’s software instructions to start the run.
◦ Ensure appropriate instrument settings - flow rate, column
temperature, injection volume, and gradient conditions.
◦ Monitor the run to ensure proper operation and data
acquisition.
D. Data Analysis and Recording
1. Data Processing:
◦ Utilize the instrument software for data analysis.
◦ Identify and quantify VMA and HVA peaks against the
calibration curve.
2. Quality Control Checks:
◦ Verify that QC samples fall within acceptable ranges.
◦ Investigate and document any QC failures, taking
appropriate corrective actions if necessary.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Review the results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Generate and validate a report for each patient sample.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens analyzed.
• Internal Quality Control: Run control samples at the beginning,
middle, and end of each batch.
• External Quality Control: Participate in proficiency testing
exercises as required.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA): Refer to laboratory-specific
reference ranges.
• Homovanillic Acid (HVA): Refer to laboratory-specific reference
ranges.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are free from contamination.
• Samples with significant hemolysis or other visible contamination
should be noted, and analysts should use judgment on the validity
of results.
1. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to institutional
guidelines.
