Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA), Random,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and generation of results
for Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA) in random urine samples to maintain
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
and document the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all personnel are trained and compliant with this procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Random urine.
• Preferred Collection Container: Clean, plastic, leak-proof urine
container.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 10 mL.
• Transport Requirements: Specimens should be transported to
the laboratory as soon as possible.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in containers with preservatives.
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated or not adequately
labeled.
• Specimens that have remained at room temperature for more
than 24 hours.
3. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with UV
detection.
• Standard solutions of Vanillylmandelic Acid.
• Internal standard (if applicable).
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, buffer solutions).
• Calibration standards.
• Quality control (QC) materials.
• Polypropylene vials.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
4. PROTOCOL
A) Preparation of Reagents and Standards:
1. Mobile Phase: Prepare mobile phase according to the specific
requirements of the HPLC system (typically a mixture of
acetonitrile and water with buffer).
2. Calibration Standards: Prepare calibration standards of VMA
at various concentrations from the stock solution.
3. Quality Control Samples: Prepare quality control samples at
low, medium, and high concentrations of VMA.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge urine samples at 1,500 x g for 10
minutes to remove particulate matter.
2. Aliquot: Aliquot supernatant into polypropylene vials.
3. Internal Standard Addition (if applicable): Add internal
standard to each urine sample, calibration standard, and QC
sample.
C) HPLC Analysis:
1. System Setup: Set up the HPLC system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure the column and detector
are properly equilibrated with the mobile phase.
2. Calibration Curve: Run calibration standards to generate a
calibration curve. Ensure all points are within the linear range of
the detector.
3. QC Samples: Run quality control samples at the beginning,
middle, and end of the analytical run.
4. Sample Injection: Inject urine samples into the HPLC system
sequentially. Ensure the sample injector is clean and operating
correctly.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Peak Identification: Identify VMA peaks in the chromatograms
based on retention time compared to calibration standards.
2. Quantification: Quantify VMA concentrations in urine samples
using the calibration curve.
3. Internal Standard Correction (if applicable): Use the internal
standard to correct for any variations in sample preparation or
instrument variability.
E) Quality Control:
1. QC Review: Verify that all QC samples fall within acceptable
ranges. If any QC results are out of range, investigate and
resolve the issue before proceeding.
2. Recalibration: If QC samples fail, recalibrate the HPLC system
and reanalyze samples as necessary.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify results for consistency and accuracy before reporting.
• Attach any relevant comments or notes regarding sample
condition or analytical challenges.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Typically, reference ranges for VMA in random urine should be
established based on the laboratory’s validation data.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Specimen preparation and handling can impact the accuracy of
results.
• Analytical interferences (e.g., medications, food components)
should be considered.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of specimen receipt, analysis, QC results, and any
corrective actions.
• Ensure all documentation is complete, accurate, and stored
according to laboratory policies.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer instructions for the HPLC system and reagents.
• Laboratory-specific quality control and calibration protocols.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever significant
changes in procedures, equipment, or reagents occur.
• Document revision history and approvals.
