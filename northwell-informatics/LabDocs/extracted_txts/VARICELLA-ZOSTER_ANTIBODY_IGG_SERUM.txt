VARICELLA-ZOSTER ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for determining the presence and
concentration of Varicella-Zoster antibody (IgG) in serum samples
utilizing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). This test is used for
evaluating immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and diagnosis of
previous or current VZV infection.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
verifying the assay results. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
staff to ensure that all quality control measures are adhered to, and
any discrepancies are reported and resolved.
1. DEFINITION
Varicella-Zoster antibody (IgG) testing involves the detection and
quantification of specific antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus
in human serum.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Materials and Reagents
• Varicella-Zoster IgG assay kit (ELISA or CLIA)
• Microtiter plate reader (for ELISA)
• Chemiluminescent assay system (for CLIA)
• Serum samples
• Calibrators and controls as provided in the assay kit
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Deionized water
• Plate washer
3.2 Equipment
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Incubator (35-37°C)
• Timer
3.3 Specimen Requirements
• Serum: Collect blood in a plain red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot at room temperature, then
centrifuge to separate the serum. Transfer the serum to a clean,
labeled tube if necessary.
• Specimen stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at
2-8°C. For long-term storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C
or colder.
3.4 Quality Control
• Run appropriate positive and negative controls provided in the kit
with each batch of tests.
• Document all quality control results, ensuring they fall within the
specified range provided by the manufacturer.
3.5 Assay Procedure (ELISA)
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (15-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare the microtiter plate with the appropriate number of
wells.
3. Pipette the specified volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into the designated wells, according to the kit
instructions.
4. Add the enzyme conjugate solution to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 35-37°C for the time specified in the kit
instructions.
6. Wash the wells with the wash buffer included in the kit as
instructed (typically 3-5 times).
7. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
if required.
8. After the specified incubation period, add the stop solution to
each well to halt the enzymatic reaction.
9. Read the absorbance of each well at the specified wavelength
using a microplate reader.
3.6 Assay Procedure (CLIA)
1. Follow the reagent preparation instructions provided in the kit.
2. Load the calibrators, controls, and samples into the respective
positions on the CLIA analyzer.
3. Follow the instrument-specific instructions to set up the assay
run, ensuring the appropriate assay protocol is selected.
4. The CLIA analyzer will automatically perform all steps including
sample and reagent addition, incubation, washing, and
detection.
5. Verify that the instrument completes the run without errors.
6. Retrieve the results from the analyzer.
3.7 Interpretation of Results
• Compare the sample absorbance or signal values to those of the
calibrators to determine the concentration of Varicella-Zoster IgG
antibodies in the samples.
• Results are typically reported in a qualitative format (e.g.,
Positive, Negative, or Indeterminate) and/or quantitative units
(e.g., IU/mL).
• Positive results indicate immunity/exposure to VZV.
• Negative results suggest no immunity or past infection.
3.8 Reporting Results
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a competent
technologist before reporting.
• Report results via the laboratory information system (LIS). If
critical values or unexpected patterns are observed, notify the
healthcare provider promptly according to laboratory protocol.
3.9 Method Limitations
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect test results and
should be avoided.
• Cross-reactivity with other herpesvirus antibodies may occur;
clinical correlation is necessary.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all results, controls, and calibrations for a
minimum required duration, typically 2 years, or as per the
laboratory and regulatory requirements.
