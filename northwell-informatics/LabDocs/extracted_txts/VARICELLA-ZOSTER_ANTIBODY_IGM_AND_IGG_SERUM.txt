Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for
Generating Results for VARICELLA-
ZOSTER ANTIBODY, IGM AND IGG,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps necessary to accurately test for
Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) antibodies (IgM and IgG) in serum
specimens. Proper execution ensures reliable detection of immune
status or recent infection of VZV.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists trained in
serological testing are responsible for performing and documenting
this procedure. Supervisors ensure adherence to the protocol and
address any deviations or technical issues that arise.
2. DEFINITION
Varicella-Zoster Virus IgM & IgG Antibody Test: A serological
assay used to detect VZV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in a
patient’s blood serum to discern current or past infection or
immunization status.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: 5-10 mL of serum from a venipuncture
collection, stored in a serum-separator tube (SST) or red-top tube.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
◦ Specimens that are not adequately labeled with patient
identification information.
Note: Ensure correct centrifugation and serum separation; avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3.2. Reagents and Supplies:
• VZV IgM and IgG ELISA or Chemiluminescent immunoassay kits.
• Calibrators and controls specific to the assay kit.
• Microtiter plates (if ELISA), pipettes, multichannel pipettes, and
pipette tips.
• Plate reader (for ELISA) or analyzer specific to the chosen assay.
• Timer, wash buffer, substrate solutions, and stop solutions.
3.3. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibration: Follow manufacturer’s instructions for calibration of
the assay. Perform calibration using provided calibrators to ensure
accuracy.
• Quality Control (QC): Run two levels of controls (positive and
negative) at the beginning of each run, after every 20 samples,
and at the end of the run. Document QC results for analysis.
3.4. Testing Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, controls, and patient samples to room
temperature (20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
◦ Label microtiter plate wells or appropriate machinery wells
accordingly.
2. Assay Steps (General guideline; refer to manufacturer protocol
for specific assay):
◦ ELISA-Based Procedure:
1. Add patient serum, controls, and calibrators to
designated wells.
2. Incubate for the time specified by the kit (typically
30-60 minutes) at room temperature.
3. Wash the wells thoroughly with provided wash buffer
(usually 3-5 times).
4. Add enzyme-conjugate reagent and incubate.
5. Wash the wells again.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate as specified.
7. Add stop solution and read the plate on a microplate
reader at the specified wavelength (usually 450 nm).
◦ Chemiluminescent-Based Procedure:
1. Load serum samples, controls, calibrators, and
reagents into the analyzer.
2. Program the machine to run the VZV IgM and IgG
assay according to manufacturer instructions.
3. Monitor the analyzer for completion and review initial
results.
3.5. Interpretation and Validation of Results:
• Compare the optical density (OD) or signal output of samples to
calibrators to determine antibody concentrations.
• Positive criteria:
◦ IgM: Indicates a recent infection.
◦ IgG: Suggests past infection or immunization.
• Note: Refer to the kit’s specific guidelines for cut-off values and
interpretative criteria.
3.6. Reporting Results:
• Results are reviewed and validated by a trained technologist.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Report any critical findings promptly to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Control Failure: If quality controls are out of range, do not report
patient results. Investigate potential issues such as reagent
expiration, instrument malfunction, or procedural error. Repeat the
analysis once corrections are made.
• Unexpected Results: Review patient history and potential
interference. Repeat analyses if needed and ensure sample
integrity.

6. DOCUMENTATION
• Log all procedures, reagent lot numbers, patient sample
identifications, and results in the respective logs.
• Record calibration and quality control data regularly in the
appropriate QC logs.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
7. QC AND CALIBRATION RECORDING
• Consistently update and maintain QC and calibration logs.
• Ensure traceability of reagents and instruments used in testing.
