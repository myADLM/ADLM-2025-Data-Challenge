Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Varicella-Zoster
Antibody (VZV), IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of Varicella-Zoster Antibodies (VZV), IgG in serum
samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the testing of
Varicella-Zoster Antibodies (VZV), IgG in serum in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this protocol
accurately to ensure consistent, reproducible, and accurate results.
The supervisor is responsible for oversight and ensuring adherence
to the protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a plain red-top or SST
(serum separator tube). Allow blood to clot and then centrifuge to
separate the serum from cells.
• Storage: Specimen should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 7 days. For longer storage, keep at –20°C or
cooler.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ELISA or CLIA instrument
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated microplate reader or analyzer, specific for the assay
method
• Reagent kit for VZV IgG detection (Ensure it is within the expiry
date)
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration and quality control checks as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document all quality control results, and take corrective actions if
controls do not fall within the acceptable range.
7. PROCEDURE
Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare all reagents, calibrators, controls, and samples as per the
manufacturer's instructions provided in the kit insert.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples to room temperature if previously
frozen. Mix thoroughly but gently.
◦ Label all necessary wells or tubes for standards, controls,
and patient samples as per the assay layout.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient serum samples into their respective wells or tubes
according to the kit’s protocol.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for adding reagents,
incubating, washing steps, and any other assay-specific
directions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate plates or tubes at the specified temperature and
duration as stipulated by the reagent kit protocol.
◦ Ensure all samples are incubated uniformly to avoid
discrepancies.
4. Detection and Measurement:
◦ Upon completion of the incubation period, measure the
absorbance (for ELISA) or luminescence (for CLIA) using
the microplate reader or analyzer.
◦ Ensure that readings are taken at the appropriate
wavelength or settings recommended by the kit
manufacturer.
8. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of VZV IgG antibodies in the test
samples by comparing the absorbance/luminescence readings
to a standard curve prepared through the assay.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for constructing the
standard curve and interpreting the sample results.
• Interpretation:
◦ Results are generally interpreted as positive, negative, or
equivocal based on the cutoff values provided by the assay
manufacturer.
◦ A positive result indicates the presence of IgG antibodies
against Varicella-Zoster virus, suggesting past infection or
immunity due to vaccination.
◦ Equivocal results should be retested or followed up with
additional patient samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all results meticulously in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Review and verify all results before releasing.
• Critical results should be communicated to the requesting
healthcare provider promptly.
Reference Intervals:
• Positive: VZV IgG detected, indicative of immunity or past
infection.
• Negative: No VZV IgG detected, susceptible to VZV infection.
• Equivocal: Borderline result, retest or follow up with additional
testing.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
performance and should be avoided.
• Cross-reactivity with antibodies from other herpesviruses may
occur; interpret results in clinical context.
