Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS ANTIBODY, IGG, CSF
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the analytical
process for generating results for Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)
Antibody, IgG, CSF using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). This ensures that results are accurate, reliable, and
consistent.
1. DEFINITION
Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Antibody, IgG, CSF test is used to
measure the IgG antibodies specific to the Varicella-Zoster Virus in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can indicate current or past infection
with the virus or difference between vaccine and natural antibody
response.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the test,
ensuring sample integrity, maintaining quality control, and
documenting results according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing and addressing any deviations or issues
that arise during testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• ELISA washer (optional)
• Reagent kit for VZV IgG Antibodies (including standards, controls,
conjugates, substrate solutions, and stop solutions)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge CSF samples at 1200-1500 rpm for 5-10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Transfer clear supernatant to a clean, appropriately labeled
tube, avoiding any pellet or debris.
B) Test Procedure
1. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare the ELISA plate by adding the standards, controls, and
CSF samples in duplicate wells according to the plate layout
provided in the kit insert.
3. Add X μL of the provided conjugate to each well (refer to kit
insert for specific volume).
4. Incubate the plate for the time specified in the kit insert
(generally 30-60 minutes) at room temperature or as specified.
5. Wash the plate 3-5 times using an automated plate washer or
manually with wash buffer to remove unbound conjugate.
6. Add Y μL of the substrate solution to each well and incubate it
in the dark at room temperature according to the time specified
by the kit instructions (generally 15-30 minutes).
7. Add Z μL of the stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. This will often result in a change of color.
8. Read the plate using an ELISA reader at the appropriate
wavelength (typically 450 nm with a reference wavelength of
620-650 nm).
C) Quality Control
1. Run internal controls (positive and negative) with each batch to
ensure the validity of assay results.
2. Ensure that all control results fall within the established range
provided by the manufacturer. If controls are out of range, do
not report patient results and perform troubleshooting as
necessary.
D) Calculating Results
1. Calculate the average absorbance for each standard, control,
and sample.
2. Use software or manually plot the standard curve, and
interpolate VZV IgG concentration from the curve for sample
absorbances.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review and confirm that all quality control criteria are met.
5. Results are reported in numeric units (Antibody Index, AI, or
according to specific kit instructions).
6. Validate and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) before final reporting.
7. Critical results should be immediately reported to the requesting
physician or relevant clinical team.
8. REFERENCES
Include references to the kit insert, and any additional quality control
and equipment maintenance documentation required.
1. NOTES
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of equipment
according to the manufacturer's instructions to maintain the
integrity of test results.
• Adhere to all laboratory safety guidelines and protocols when
handling reagents and specimens.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the assay
and report them to the supervisor for review.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for the VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS
ANTIBODY, IGG, CSF test.
