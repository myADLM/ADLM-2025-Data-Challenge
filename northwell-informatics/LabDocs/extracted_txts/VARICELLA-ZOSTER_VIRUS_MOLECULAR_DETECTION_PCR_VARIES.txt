Draft Protocol for VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the molecular detection of Varicella-
Zoster Virus (VZV) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinical
specimens. This procedure will ensure the accurate identification of
VZV DNA in patient samples for diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in molecular
diagnostics using PCR techniques for the detection of VZV DNA in
specimens such as vesicular fluid, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
or tissue biopsies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the PCR analysis according to this procedure. It is also
their responsibility to report any inconsistencies or issues with the
test results to a supervisor immediately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Vesicular fluid, blood, CSF, or tissue biopsy samples collected in
sterile containers.
• Specimens must be collected aseptically and transported to the
laboratory within 24 hours of collection, stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or lack collection date/
time.
• Specimens stored longer than 24 hours without refrigeration or
hemolyzed blood samples.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• VZV specific primers and probes
• Nucleic acid extraction kits
• PCR reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffers, etc.)
• Sterile pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Laboratory timer
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Perform nucleic acid extraction using commercial extraction
kits.
2. Label extracted DNA tubes with patient identification, date, and
time.
PCR Setup:
1. Prepare a master mix for the PCR reaction, including Taq
polymerase, dNTPs, specific primers, and probes for VZV, and
necessary buffers.
2. Aliquot the master mix into individual PCR tubes or wells of a
PCR plate.
3. Add extracted DNA to each tube. Include positive controls (VZV
DNA) and negative controls (no DNA) in the run.
4. Seal the tubes or plate and place in the thermal cycler.
Thermal Cycling Conditions:
1. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes.
2. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds, 40 cycles.
3. Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds.
4. Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds.
5. Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
6. Hold: 4°C until analysis.
Detection and Interpretation:
1. Analyze PCR products using appropriate detection systems
(e.g., real-time PCR detection system).
2. Document the presence of VZV DNA based on fluorescence
signal.
3. Compare patient sample results with positive and negative
control results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Record and analyze quality control results to ensure assay
validity.
• Perform periodic review and validation of primers, probes, and
reagents to ensure accuracy and sensitivity of the assay.
8. RESULT REPORTING
• Results are automatically recorded by the detection system and
transmitted to the laboratory information system.
• Review and verify results before reporting.
• Report positive VZV results to the attending physician with
detailed comments if necessary.
• Include the following in the report: sample type, testing date, PCR
result (positive or negative for VZV), and comments on sample
integrity if issues were identified.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Potential limitations include:
• Low viral load in specimen may result in a false-negative result.
• Contaminated specimens may lead to incorrect results.
• PCR inhibitors present in the sample can affect test sensitivity and
specificity.
