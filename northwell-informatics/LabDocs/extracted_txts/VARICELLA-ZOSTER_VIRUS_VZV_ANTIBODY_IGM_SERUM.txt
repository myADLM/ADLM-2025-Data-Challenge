VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS (VZV) ANTIBODY, IgM, SERUM SOP
1. PURPOSE: To establish the protocol for generating analytical
results for Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Antibody, IgM in serum
samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the test, documenting results, and ensuring proper quality
control measures. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
deficiencies in the testing process which may affect the results and
bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN: Preferred/acceptable: - 1-2 mL serum from a blood
sample collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST). Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C if not immediately processed.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric. -
Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 48 hours after
collection unless frozen. - Specimens without proper labeling or
requisition information.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
◦ ELISA equipment including microplate reader and washer
◦ VZV IgM ELISA kit (including reagents and controls)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Multichannel pipettes
◦ Incubators (37°C)
◦ Timer
◦ Required plasticware (tubes, bottles, etc.)
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE: Sample Preparation:
1. Allow collected serum samples to come to room
temperature prior to testing.
2. Ensure samples are properly labeled and logged into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
ELISA Testing:
1. Prepare reagents as instructed in the VZV IgM ELISA kit
insert.
2. Dispense required volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient serum samples into designated wells of the ELISA
plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C as per specified time in the kit
insert.
4. Wash the plate with the wash buffer provided in the kit as
per the washing protocol.
5. Add the detection antibody to each well and incubate the
plate at 37°C as directed by the kit insert.
6. Wash the plate again as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
7. Add the substrate solution to the wells and incubate at
room temperature for the specified duration.
8. Stop the reaction with the stop solution provided in the kit
when required.
Reading Results:
1. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
an ELISA microplate reader.
2. Calculate the concentrations of VZV IgM antibodies in the
patient samples by plotting a standard curve using the
calibrators and controls provided in the ELISA kit.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Run positive and negative controls as specified in the ELISA
kit insert with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Document control results in a Quality Control log.
◦ Ensure results fall within the acceptable range as provided
by the manufacturer. If controls fall outside the range,
troubleshoot according to kit instructions and consult a
supervisor.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Enter data into LIS for analysis and reporting.
◦ Review results to ensure accuracy before verification.
◦ Critical values should be flagged and reported according to
site-specific procedures.
◦ Verify results and release official report, noting any
discrepancies or issues encountered during testing.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Refer to VZV IgM ELISA kit insert for specific limitations of
the assay.
◦ Post-analytic variables such as improper specimen handling
and storage can affect results.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Negative: No detectable VZV IgM antibodies present in the
serum.
◦ Positive: Detectable levels of VZV IgM antibodies indicating
active or recent infection.
8. REFERENCES:
◦ VZV IgM ELISA kit insert for detailed reagent, procedure,
quality control, and limitation information.
◦ Site-specific reporting guidelines.
This SOP ensures consistent and accurate testing for VZV IgM
antibodies in serum samples while adhering to quality control
standards.
Note: It is essential that every designated laboratory staff member
reads and understands this SOP prior to performing any VZV IgM
testing.
