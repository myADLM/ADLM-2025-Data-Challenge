Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for VARICELLA-ZOSTER
VIRUS (VZV) DNA DETECTION BY PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to describe the detailed steps for the
detection of Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) DNA in clinical specimens
using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This SOP ensures reliable
and consistent results are generated.
Responsibility: The designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing VZV DNA detection according to this SOP. They must
ensure accurate results and follow proper documentation practices.
1. DEFINITION
The PCR-based method for VZV DNA detection involves nucleic acid
amplification of the viral DNA followed by analysis to determine the
presence or absence of VZV DNA in the specimen.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Specimens: Acceptable sample types include:
▪ Swabs from vesicular fluid, lesion crusts, or throat swabs
▪ CSF
▪ Blood, Serum, or Plasma
◦ Storage: Samples can be stored at 4°C for up to 72 hours
before testing or frozen at -70°C for longer storage. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Acceptance Criteria: Samples must be properly labeled
and accompanied by a requisition form with patient details
and collection information.
2. Reagents and Supplies
◦ PCR reagents: Taq DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, VZV-
specific primers, and probe
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive control (VZV DNA)
◦ Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
◦ Extraction kit for nucleic acid extraction
◦ 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, PCR tubes, and pipette tips
with filters
3. Equipment
◦ Real-time PCR machine
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes (adjustable volume)
◦ Thermal cycler (if needed for initial PCR setup)
◦ Vortex mixer
B) Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Follow the nucleic acid extraction kit protocol specific to the
sample type.
2. Ensure the complete transfer and proper labeling of samples.
3. Include both positive and negative extraction controls to monitor
potential contamination and extraction efficiency.
C) PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix in a clean area free from DNA
contamination:
◦ 10 µL Master Mix
◦ 1 µL specific primers (final concentration 0.4 µM each)
◦ 1 µL specific probe (final concentration 0.2 µM)
◦ 2 µL extracted DNA as template
◦ Nuclease-free water to make up the total volume to 25 µL
for each reaction
2. Load the master mix into PCR tubes or plate wells, followed by
careful addition of template DNA, positive control, and negative
control.
D) PCR Amplification
1. Program the real-time PCR machine according to the following
cycling parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds
2. Ensure correct placement of controls:
◦ Positive control verifies the amplification process works
correctly.
◦ Negative control ensures no contamination during the PCR
setup.
E) PCR Analysis
1. After the reaction is complete, examine the amplification plots
and cycle threshold (Ct) values.
◦ Positive specimen: detectable amplification with Ct value
lower than the control threshold.
◦ Negative specimen: no amplification or amplification
observed beyond the control threshold.
◦ Inconclusive results due to contamination or technical errors
must be repeated.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
3. Include controls for each run:
◦ Positive control (known VZV DNA)
◦ Negative control (nuclease-free water)
4. Document all controls and results. Record any deviations or
problems encountered during the PCR process and report them
to the supervisor.
5. Monitor real-time PCR data for consistency. Investigate any
anomalies in control results or multiple invalid runs.
6. Regularly maintain and calibrate equipment according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
8. Positive Result: Presence of VZV DNA with appropriate Ct
values.
9. Negative Result: Absence of VZV DNA (no Ct value).
10. Inconclusive Result: Invalid run or control failure necessitates
repeat testing.
11. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
12. Report results following site-specific reporting guidelines,
ensuring to include relevant clinical information and
interpretation.
13. DOCUMENTATION
14. Keep detailed records of each PCR run, including:
◦ Specimen details
◦ Reagent lot numbers
◦ Control results
◦ Any deviations from SOP
15. Store all data securely in the laboratory's information
management system.
