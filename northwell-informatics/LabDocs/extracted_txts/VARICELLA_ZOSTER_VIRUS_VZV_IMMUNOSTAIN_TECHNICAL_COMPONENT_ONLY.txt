Protocol for VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS (VZV) IMMUNOSTAIN,
TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized methods and procedures for the technical
processing and immunostaining of specimens for the detection of
Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) utilizing immunohistochemical
techniques.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all personnel involved in the
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of specimens for VZV detection
within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel (Histotechnologists) are
responsible for carrying out the procedures described in this
protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed correctly and any discrepancies or issues are
documented and addressed.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Positive and negative control specimens
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol (100%)
• Graded ethanol series (95%, 70%)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• VZV primary antibody (validated for IHC use)
• Secondary antibody solution
• Enzyme conjugate/substrate-chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting media
• Microscope
• Humidified chamber
5. SPECIMEN
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
mounted on positively charged slides (4-5 microns thick).
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Results are qualitative and will be reported as "Positive" or
"Negative" based on the presence or absence of VZV antigen
staining.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of slides to
ensure staining accuracy and reliability.
• Document the usage and lot numbers of primary and secondary
antibodies.
• Ensure that the equipment (e.g., microtome, water bath) is
calibrated and maintained as per manufacturer instructions.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Bake slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes to melt the paraffin.
2. Deparaffinize in xylene for 2 changes of 5 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate in graded ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 changes of 3 minutes each.
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes.
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a heat-resistant staining dish containing antigen
retrieval solution.
2. Heat the solution in a microwave or pressure cooker as per
retrieval solution manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution at room temperature
for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in PBS or TBS buffer for
5 minutes.
C. Immunostaining
1. Encircle the specimen area with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating the slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes.
4. Apply blocking solution (e.g., normal serum) to the tissue
sections and incubate in the humidified chamber for 20
minutes.
5. Drain the blocking solution (do not rinse), then apply VZV
primary antibody and incubate per manufacturer’s
recommendation (usually 60 minutes at room temperature).
6. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes.
7. Apply secondary antibody solution and incubate per
manufacturer’s instructions (usually 30 minutes).
8. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes.
9. Apply enzyme conjugate/substrate-chromogen solution (e.g.,
DAB) and monitor the development of color (usually about 5-10
minutes).
10. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
D. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate in graded ethanol series (95%, 100%) for 2 minutes
each.
4. Clear in 2 changes of xylene for 2 minutes each.
5. Mount coverslip using a permanent mounting medium.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Review and interpret stained slides under a microscope by a
qualified pathologist.
• Positive control should exhibit specific brown cytoplasmic staining
in VZV-infected cells.
• Negative control should display absence of non-specific staining.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Pathologist documents findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and reports "Positive" if VZV antigen is detected or
"Negative" if no virus is observed.
• Any discrepancies or issues with the staining procedure are to be
documented and addressed promptly by laboratory personnel and
supervisors.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If staining is weak or absent in controls, repeat staining protocol
and review antigen retrieval and antibody incubation steps.
• Ensure antibody and reagent lots are not expired and stored
according to manufacturer instructions.
12. REFERENCES
• VZV primary antibody datasheet
• DAB substrate-chromogen datasheet
• Antigen retrieval solution datasheet
• Manufacturer’s guidance on IHC staining procedures
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all quality control results, antibody and
reagent lot numbers, staining batches, and any procedural
deviations.
• Ensure slide interpretation and reporting are documented in the
LIS.
This protocol ensures the consistent and accurate technical staining
for the presence of VZV in clinical specimens.
