Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantification of
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in plasma samples,
ensuring accuracy, reproducibility, and compliance with CLIA
regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
VEGF analysis as outlined in this protocol. All staff members are
responsible for reporting any discrepancies or issues encountered
during the procedure to their supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma obtained from a sample collected in
an EDTA (lavender-top) tube.
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL of plasma.
• Stability: Plasma samples should be processed and frozen within
2 hours of collection and stored at -80°C until analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit for VEGF (e.g.,
R&D Systems Human VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit, Cat. #
DVE00)
• Microplate reader with a 450 nm filter
• Calibration and control materials included with the ELISA kit
• Multichannel pipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Plate sealers
• LabTimer
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated centrifuge capable of 3000 RCF
• Deionized water
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, safety
glasses
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation of Reagents and Samples
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(approximately 20-25°C) before starting the assay.
• Prepare wash buffer, standard dilutions, and all other reagents
according to the manufacturer's instructions included in the ELISA
kit.
• Thaw plasma samples on ice and mix thoroughly by gentle
inversion. Do not vortex.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare the set of standards provided in the ELISA kit, ensuring
that serial dilutions are accurate. These standards will form the
calibration curve.
• Prepare quality control samples to cover the expected range of
the assay. These should include at least one low, one mid, and
one high concentration control.
5.3 Assay Procedure
1. Sample Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, sample, and control into
appropriate wells. Ensure determinations are performed in
duplicate.
◦ Seal the plate with a plate sealer and incubate for 2 hours at
room temperature on a horizontal orbital microplate shaker
set at 500 ± 50 rpm.
2. Washing
◦ Wash the plate using the provided wash buffer. Manual
washing involves aspirating the contents and filling each
well with wash buffer, followed by dumping the contents.
Automated plate washers may also be used if available.
Perform at least 4 wash cycles.
3. Detection Antibody Addition
◦ Add 200 µL of VEGF conjugate solution to each well. Reseal
the plate and incubate for 2 hours at room temperature on
the microplate shaker.
4. Substrate Incubation and Reaction
◦ Wash the plate as described above before adding 200 µL of
Substrate Solution to each well. Incubate for 30 minutes at
room temperature, avoiding direct light.
5. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 50 µL of Stop Solution to each well. The color will
change immediately to yellow.
6. Reading Plate
◦ Measure the optical density of each well within 30 minutes
using a microplate reader set to 450 nm. A reference
wavelength of 540 nm may be subtracted to correct for
optical imperfections.
5.4 Calculation of Results
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the average absorbance for
each standard versus the concentration of VEGF in pg/mL.
• Determine the concentration of VEGF in each sample and control
from the standard curve.
• If samples exceed the highest standard, dilute them accordingly
and re-assay.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure all quality control samples fall within the established
acceptable ranges. If any controls are out of range, investigate
potential causes, including reagent preparation, sample handling,
or equipment malfunction.
• Common sources of error include improper pipetting, inadequate
washing, and expired or improperly stored reagents.
• Document any corrective actions taken in the laboratory’s quality
control log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are recorded and reviewed for accuracy.
• Data is entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical or unexpected results are verified and, if necessary, repeat
testing is performed.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for plasma VEGF levels will be provided in the
assay kit insert and should be verified based on the laboratory’s
population and specific testing conditions. Typical reference intervals
for plasma VEGF in humans can range but are commonly from 62 to
707 pg/mL in healthy adults.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may affect the assay
results.
• Cross-reactivity and interference from other plasma proteins
should be minimal but are detailed in the ELISA kit insert.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions included with the ELISA kit (e.g., R&D
Systems Human VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit)
• [Additional papers or sources pertinent to the VEGF analysis may
be referenced]
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps are well-documented, including reagent lot
numbers, calibration curves, quality control results, and any
deviation from the SOP.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure reliable
and accurate analysis of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
in plasma samples, providing crucial data for patient diagnosis and
management.
