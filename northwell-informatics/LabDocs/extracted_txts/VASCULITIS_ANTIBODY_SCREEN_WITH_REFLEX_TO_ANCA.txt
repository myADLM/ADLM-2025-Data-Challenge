Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Vasculitis
Antibody Screen with Reflex to ANCA
1. PURPOSE: To standardize the process for the analytical phase
of generating results for vasculitis antibody screening with
reflex to Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures accuracy, consistency,
and reliability of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Certified medical laboratory scientists
(MLS) are responsible for performing the analysis, ensuring the
accuracy of the results, and documenting all necessary
information as outlined in this SOP. Supervisory staff are
responsible for oversight and ensuring all protocol steps are
followed.
3. SPECIMEN: Specimen requirements:
• Acceptable samples: Serum collected in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable samples: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly labeled
specimens.
• Handling and storage: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if not
tested immediately. Serum should be separated from cells within
2 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or indirect
immunofluorescence (IIF) setup
• Reagents provided in the ANCA assay kit (e.g., conjugate,
substrate, controls)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Plate reader or fluorescence microscope
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run internal and external quality controls with every batch of
tests.
• Document the lot numbers, expiration dates, and results of control
materials.
• Quality control failures must be investigated, and corrective
actions must be documented.
1. PROCEDURE: A. Initial Vasculitis Antibody Screen:
• Label all tubes and plates with the correct patient identification.
• Prepare specimens and control samples according to the specific
assay instructions.
• For ELISA: Coat microtiter wells with antigen, add patient sera,
and incubate as per manufacturer instructions. Wash wells
according to protocol, then add secondary antibodies conjugated
to an enzyme. Develop with substrate, and measure the optical
density (OD) using a plate reader.
• For IIF: Coat slides with substrate, add patient sera, and incubate
as specified. Wash slides and add fluorescein-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Examine under a fluorescence microscope.
B. Reflex to ANCA:
• If the initial vasculitis antibody screen is positive, reflex to specific
ANCA testing.
• Process samples for anti-PR3 (Proteinase 3) and anti-MPO
(Myeloperoxidase) as follows:
1. Perform ELISA or IIF specific for PR3-ANCA and MPO-
ANCA.
2. Follow the same procedural steps as the initial screen.
3. Record and evaluate results.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Utilize calibration curves for quantitative assays and reference
values for qualitative assays.
• Positives in ELISA/IIF screen and further confirmed in ANCA-
specific tests will be interpreted as indicative of vasculitis.
• Report results as per laboratory's reporting guidelines and
reference range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document all results accurately into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing.
• For critical results, notify the clinician immediately as per
laboratory policy.
1. SAFETY:
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste according to regulations.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for all test kits and reagents used.
• CLIA regulations.
• Laboratory's internal quality assurance and control manuals.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain detailed records of all processes, including sample
handling, assay performance, quality control results, and
corrective actions.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and the reason for it.
This protocol will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
comply with new regulations, research findings, or technological
advancements.
