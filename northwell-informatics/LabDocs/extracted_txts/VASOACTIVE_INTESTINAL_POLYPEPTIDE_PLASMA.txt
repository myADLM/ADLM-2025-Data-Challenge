Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP),
Plasma
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Vasoactive Intestinal
Polypeptide (VIP) in plasma specimens. It includes guidelines
on sample preparation, assay performance, quality control, and
result reporting.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing this
assay, monitoring quality control, and ensuring accurate and timely
reporting of results. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring all
procedures are adhered to and appropriate corrective actions are
taken if necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Acceptable specimens: Plasma collected using EDTA or lithium
heparin as anticoagulants.
• Specimens must be centrifuged within 1 hour of collection.
• Plasma must be separated and frozen immediately at -20°C or
lower if analysis is delayed beyond 24 hours.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens collected in tubes without
anticoagulants or received beyond 24 hours without freezing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) ELISA kit or equivalent
• Microplate reader compatible with the assay
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Freezer capable of maintaining -20°C or lower
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
• Assay buffer, standards, and controls provided by the assay kit
1. PROCEDURE
2. Thaw plasma samples on ice and mix gently to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Pipette the required volume of plasma samples, standards, and
controls into the designated wells of the microplate.
5. Add the appropriate volume of assay buffer provided in the kit
to each well.
6. Incubate the plate according to the manufacturer's instructions
(typically involving multiple steps of washing, incubation at
specific temperatures, adding detection antibodies, etc.).
7. After the final wash, add the substrate solution to each well and
incubate for the specified time.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
9. Read the plate using the microplate reader at the appropriate
wavelength according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
10. Record the absorbance values for each well.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run appropriate control samples on each assay plate (e.g.,
known concentrations of VIP, blank wells).
• Ensure controls fall within the manufacturer's recommended
range. If controls are out of range, investigate and repeat the
assay.
• Calibrate pipettes regularly and verify accuracy.
1. CALCULATING RESULTS
• Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
VIP standards.
• Calculate sample concentrations by comparing sample
absorbance values to the standard curve.
• Verify the calculated concentrations are within the assay's
dynamic range. Dilute samples and re-assay if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all assay details including sample identification,
reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and temperatures.
• Verify results for accuracy and consistency.
• Enter the final VIP concentrations into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Ensure timely review and verification by a qualified technologist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed specimens may interfere with assay results. Handle
such specimens according to SOP for handling hemolyzed
samples.
• Non-standard specimen collection or processing may affect assay
accuracy. Collect specimens per the guidelines outlined above.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the VIP ELISA kit.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards for plasma assays.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If quality control results are outside acceptable limits, investigate
for possible causes such as reagent issues, equipment
malfunction, or sample handling errors.
• Correct any identified issues and repeat the assay if necessary.
• Document all corrective actions taken in the event log.
By adhering to these structured procedures, we ensure the accuracy
and reliability of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plasma assay
results.
