Standard Operating Procedure for VASOACTIVE INTESTINE
POLYPEPTIDE (VIP), TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analysis,
quality control, and reporting protocols for the measurement of
Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase starting from sample
preparation to result transmission in the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel with appropriate training are
responsible for performing VIP assay, quality control measures, and
data entry. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure that VIP test
procedures are performed accurately and consistently, and that any
issues are promptly addressed and escalated as per the laboratory’s
protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS & STABILITY
a. Specimen Type: Plasma, collected in EDTA-treated collection
tubes. b. Collection: Ensure proper collection technique to avoid
hemolysis. c. Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma is required for the
analysis. d. Handling: Immediately separate plasma from cells by
centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. e. Storage: Store
plasma samples at -20°C for up to one month or at -70°C for
extended storage. Avoid repeat freeze-thaw cycles. f. Transport:
Ensure specimens are transported on dry ice to maintain a
temperature below -20°C.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
a. Immunoassay Kit: VIP ELISA kit (commercially available from
qualified suppliers). b. Reagents: Reagents as provided within the
immunoassay kit and additional laboratory reagents as required (e.g.,
buffers, wash solutions). c. Equipment: Plate reader capable of
reading at 450 nm, micropipettes, centrifuges, vortex mixer, and
refrigeration units.
6. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation: * Bring all reagents and samples to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use. * Prepare all required reagents as
mentioned in the kit insert. * Calibrate pipettes and ensure all
equipment is clean and functional.
b. **Assay Procedure**:
1. Pipette the provided standards, controls, and samples into the appropriate wells, following the arrangement specified in the plate map.
2. Add the appropriate volume of assay buffer to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time specified by the kit’s protocol.
4. Wash the wells as per instructions using the provided wash solution.
5. Add secondary antibody and incubate as per kit instructions.
6. Add the substrate solution and allow the development of color as per the kit protocol.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided.
8. Read the optical density at 450 nm using the microplate reader.
c. **Quality Control**:
* Run quality control samples with each batch of tests.
* Ensure QC samples fall within acceptable ranges defined by the kit instructions.
* Perform calibration verification as per laboratory requirements and kit instructions.
d. **Result Calculation**:
* Construct a standard curve by plotting the known concentrations of VIP standards versus their optical densities.
* Determine the VIP concentration in samples from the standard curve by interpolating sample optical densities.
* Verify that the values obtained fall within the measurable range. Reassay or dilute samples if values fall outside this range.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
* Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by the assigned laboratory technologist. *
Ensure that critical values are communicated following laboratory
protocol. * Confirm that the patient identifiers on the report match
those on the specimen label.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
* Adult Reference interval: As specified by the assay kit manufacturer,
typically varies (e.g., <50 pmol/L) Note: Reference intervals may
need to be validated or established according to the local population
served.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
* Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
results. * Ensure proper handling and processing of specimens to
prevent degradation of VIP.
10. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
* Handle all biological samples and materials in accordance with
laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE. * Dispose of all
used assay components and biological materials in compliance with
hospital and environmental regulations.
