Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for VDRL Testing on Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide a reliable procedure for the performance of Venereal
Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) testing on spinal fluid to detect
the presence of reagin antibodies associated with syphilitic infections.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to VDRL testing performed on spinal fluid
specimens received in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying out the VDRL
test as outlined in this SOP, recording results, and ensuring that
quality control measures are adhered to.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid - CSF)
Specimen Collection:
• Aseptic lumbar puncture to collect CSF.
• A minimum of 0.5 mL of CSF in a sterile container is required.
• Specimens must be labeled with patient identification and
collection date/time immediately after collection.
Specimen Handling:
• Transport and process specimens promptly. If delay is
unavoidable, the specimen should be stored at 2-8°C and tested
within 24 hours.
• Do not store CSF specimens at room temperature for extended
periods.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in tubes with anticoagulants or preservatives.
• Specimens with visible blood contamination.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection if not
stored appropriately.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• VDRL antigen
• Physiological saline solution
• 18-20 gauge needles are required for mixing antigen (not for
testing)
• Sterile glass slides
• Mechanical rotating device, ensuring consistent rotation at 180
rpm
• Micropipettes and tips
• Test tubes
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Humidified hood or humidified cover for slides
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare VDRL antigen according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Mix antigen suspension thoroughly (not foaming).
Test Procedure:
1. Preparation of CSF: a. Allow CSF specimens and controls to
reach room temperature. b. Mix the specimen gently by
inversion.
2. Antigen-Serum Mixture: a. Use a micropipette to add 0.05 mL
of the CSF specimen onto each test circle of a glass slide. b.
Add 0.05 mL of the VDRL antigen suspension to the specimen
on the slide. c. Using the flat part of the needle, mix carefully by
spreading in a circular motion throughout the test area.
3. Rotation: a. Place the slides on the mechanical rotating device.
b. Rotate the slides at 180 rpm for 4 minutes.
4. Reading the Results: a. After 4 minutes of rotation,
immediately read the slides under a light microscope at 100x
magnification. b. Look for flocculation (clumping specific to
reagin-antibody reactions) in the CSF specimen.
Interpretation of Results:
• Non-reactive: No clumping or flocculation, indicating a negative
result for reagin antibodies.
• Weakly Reactive: Slight clumping, indicative of a low level of
reagin antibodies.
• Reactive: Distinct clumping, indicating a positive result for reagin
antibodies.
Controls:
• Positive Control: Must show a reactive result.
• Negative Control: Must show no clumping or flocculation. If
control samples do not perform as expected, the test is
considered invalid and must be repeated.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform VDRL testing with control specimens daily to ensure test
accuracy.
• Ensure adequate documentation of reagent lot numbers and
expiration dates.
• Maintain records of temperature and humidity of the testing
environment.
8. RECORDING AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented immediately after observation.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
patient records.
• Include interpretive comments as necessary.

reflect current best practices and regulatory requirements.
