Standard Operating Procedure for VDRL Titer in Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for performing a Venereal Disease Research
Laboratory (VDRL) test on spinal fluid to determine the presence and
titer of reagin antibodies, which are indicative of syphilis infection.
Responsibility: The procedure can be performed by trained Medical
Lab Scientists or Technicians as outlined in this SOP. The records of
the performance of this test shall be maintained properly, ensuring
the accuracy and reliability of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen Type: • Spinal Fluid (CSF)
Preferred/Acceptable Volume: • Minimum of 1 mL CSF.
Specimen Handling: • Avoid hemolysis and contamination during
collection. • Transport and store specimens at 2-8°C if not tested
immediately. • Samples should not be frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Specimens with bacterial contamination,
severe hemolysis, or significant lipemia. • Specimens received in
inappropriate containers. • Specimens not properly labeled or with
mismatched identifiers on requisition and container.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents: • VDRL Antigen Reagent • VDRL Buffered Saline – PBS
(phosphate-buffered saline) • Positive and Negative Controls for RPR
• Sorbent • Distilled Water
Equipment: • VDRL slide test rotator • Micropipettes with tips • Test
tubes and rack • Microscope • Glass slides • Serological Pipettes •
Timer
Supplies: • Gloves, laboratory coat, safety goggles • Control materials
(positive and negative) • CSF samples (adequately labeled) •
Calibrated pipettes and pipette tips • Cover slips • Mixing sticks
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Reagents: • Prepare VDRL Antigen and PBS
according to the manufacturer's instructions. • Allow reagents to
come to room temperature before testing.
4.2 Quality Control: • Perform quality control with each batch of tests
or at a minimum of once per day. • Use Positive and Negative
controls to ensure test performance is accurate.
4.3 Sample Preparation: • Bring the CSF sample to room
temperature. • Mix the sample gently but thoroughly before testing.
4.4 Test Procedure:
1. Label glass slides with patient identification and control sample
identifiers.
2. Using micropipettes, add 50 µL of CSF sample to a well on the
labeled slide.
3. Add 50 µL of positive control and negative control to designated
wells.
4. Add 50 µL of VDRL antigen to each well containing the sample
or control.
5. Mix the contents of each well gently using a mixing stick.
6. Place the slide on the rotator and rotate at 180 rotations per
minute for 4 minutes.
7. At the end of the rotation period, remove the slide and place it
on the microscope stage.
8. Using 10x objective lens, examine the slide microscopically and
look for characteristic clumping (flocculation).
4.5 Titration (if initial VDRL test is positive):
1. Perform serial dilutions of the CSF sample using PBS. Prepare
at least 4 dilutions (e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16).
2. Place 50 µL of each dilution on a separate well of the slide.
3. Perform the test as described in section 4.4.
4. The highest dilution displaying reactivity determines the
endpoint titer.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS • Negative: Absence of
flocculation in CSF sample. • Positive: Presence of flocculation
in CSF sample, signaling reactive antibodies indicative of
syphilis. • Report titer as the reciprocal of the highest dilution
that gives a positive result.
6. CALCULATIONS Not applicable.
7. REPORTING RESULTS • Document results in the laboratory
reporting system following the site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by the
performing technologist before releasing them. • Positive results
and titers should be communicated according to the site’s
protocol, ensuring confidentiality and accuracy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the product insert for each
specific reagent for limitations.

10. DOCUMENTATION Ensure all test results, including the quality
control results, are recorded properly in logbooks, including
date, time, and initials of the scientist performing the test.
11. REVISION HISTORY Review and amend the SOP periodically
to ensure it reflects the current laboratory practices and
compliance requirements.
