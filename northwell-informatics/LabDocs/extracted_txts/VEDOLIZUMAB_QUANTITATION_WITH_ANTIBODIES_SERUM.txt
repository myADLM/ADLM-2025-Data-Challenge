STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES: VEDOLIZUMAB
QUANTITATION WITH ANTIBODIES, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures involved in the analytical phase for the
quantification of Vedolizumab levels and detecting antibodies
against Vedolizumab in serum specimens.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing Vedolizumab quantitation and antibodies detection
according to this protocol. All personnel involved are responsible for
ensuring that results are accurate, documented, and any abnormal
results are reported promptly. Supervisors are responsible for
reviewing and validating the results and addressing any issues that
arise during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: Preferred Specimen: Serum
collected in a red/gray top vacutainer tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens collected in non-serum
collecting tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin, citrate tubes). Samples
with visible hemolysis or lipemia. Specimens with insufficient
volume or improperly labeled. Specimens not transported or
stored appropriately.
Specimen Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
are stable for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C
or colder.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES: Immunoassay
analyzer specific for Vedolizumab quantitation. Vedolizumab-
specific reagents and antibodies detection kits. Pipettes and
micropipettes. Calibrators and controls specific for Vedolizumab
assay. Analytical grade water and buffers. Personal protective
equipment (PPE).
3. PROCEDURE: A) Sample Preparation: 1. Allow the serum
specimens to reach room temperature before analysis. 2.
Ensure specimens are well mixed by gentle inversion.
B) Calibration: 1. Perform calibration of the immunoassay
analyzer with calibrators specific for Vedolizumab. 2. Verify the
calibration curve with quality control materials before
proceeding with specimen assay.
C) Vedolizumab Quantitation: 1. Load specimens into the
immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions. 2. Follow the step-by-step protocol provided in the
assay kit for quantitating Vedolizumab levels. 3. Record results
for each specimen, including any flagging due to values outside
the reportable range.
D) Antibodies Detection: 1. Set up the antibodies detection
assay as per the manufacturer's instructions. 2. Load
specimens and perform the analysis using the immunoassay
analyzer. 3. Record and interpret results as per the guidelines
provided in the antibodies detection kit insert.
4. QUALITY CONTROL: A) Internal Quality Control: 1. Perform
quality control tests using low, medium, and high concentration
controls for Vedolizumab. 2. Verify the accuracy and precision
of the immunoassay analyzer using Internal QC material. 3.
Document and review QC results daily. Investigate and correct
any QC failures before proceeding with patient samples.
B) External Quality Control: 1. Participate in external proficiency
testing programs for Vedolizumab quantitation and antibodies
detection. 2. Review and address any discrepancies highlighted
by external QC programs.
5. REPORTING RESULTS: A) Review Results: 1. Verify results
using the immunoassay analyzer’s software before manual
review. 2. Cross-check that all results fall within expected
ranges and are not flagged.
B) Documentation: 1. Report results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). 2. Ensure all results are entered
accurately, and any abnormal results are flagged.
C) Critical Values: 1. Contact the referring physician if critical
values are found. Document the communication properly. 2.
Follow the repeat critical values protocol if necessary.
6. REFERENCES: • Manufacturer instructions for Vedolizumab
quantitation and antibodies detection kits. • Internal laboratory
quality control guidelines. • External proficiency testing provider
protocols.
7. SAFETY AND PPE: Ensure that all steps are performed using
appropriate PPE, including gloves, lab coats, and eye
protection. Follow all applicable laboratory safety protocols.
This SOP is to ensure accuracy, reliability, and timeliness in the
quantitation of Vedolizumab levels and detection of antibodies,
creating reliable clinical data for patient care.
