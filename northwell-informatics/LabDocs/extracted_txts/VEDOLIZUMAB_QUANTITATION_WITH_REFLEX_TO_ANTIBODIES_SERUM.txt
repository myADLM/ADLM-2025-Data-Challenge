Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Vedolizumab Quantitation with Reflex to
Antibodies, Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the specific steps and quality control measures for the
quantitation of vedolizumab in serum samples with reflex testing for
anti-vedolizumab antibodies if vedolizumab levels are below the
detection limit.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory technologists involved in the
analysis of vedolizumab levels in serum and subsequent testing for
anti-vedolizumab antibodies. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable,
and timely results for patient management.
3. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
Vedolizumab Quantitation and Reflex to Antibodies according to this
SOP. Supervisors must ensure compliance and address any
procedural issues.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred: 2 - 5 mL of serum, collected in a red-top tube.
• Acceptable: Serum separator tube (SST) (gold-top).
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly labeled
specimens.
5. Reagents and Supplies
• Vedolizumab Quantitation Kit
• Anti-Vedolizumab Antibody Detection Kit (if reflex testing required)
• Calibrators and Controls for both quantitation and antibody
detection
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Microcentrifuge Tubes
• Plate Reader
• Micropipette
• Timer
• Refrigerator for reagent storage (2-8°C)
6. Equipment
• ELISA or alternative immunoassay platform as per the kit
instructions
• Incubator
• Refrigerated centrifuge
7. Procedural Steps
A) Vedolizumab Quantitation
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature.
◦ Prepare the required number of wells on the ELISA plate.
◦ Establish a calibration curve using the provided calibrators.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ Centrifuge serum specimens at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any cellular debris.
◦ Load samples, calibrators, and controls into the designated
wells according to the kit instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate as per the kit-specific temperature and
time requirements (typically at 37°C for 60 minutes).
4. Washing:
◦ Wash each well as per the kit instructions to remove
unbound material, typically using a washer system or
manual wash with PBS-Tween buffer.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the detection reagent (e.g., HRP-conjugated antibody)
and incubate as per kit instructions.
◦ Add the substrate solution and allow color development as
specified.
6. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Stop the reaction using the stop solution.
◦ Read the absorbance on a plate reader within the specified
wavelength range (typically 450 nm).
◦ Generate a calibration curve and determine vedolizumab
concentration in the serum samples.
7. Documentation:
◦ Record all results, including any calibrator and control
values, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Verify that control values fall within the specified ranges.
B) Reflex Testing for Anti-Vedolizumab Antibodies
1. Determination for Reflex Testing:
◦ Reflex testing is triggered if serum vedolizumab levels are
below the detection limit or as defined by clinical criteria.
2. Anti-Vedolizumab Antibody Test:
◦ Prepare reagents and samples as detailed in the Anti-
Vedolizumab Antibody Detection Kit.
◦ Process samples according to kit instructions - this typically
involves similar steps of incubation, washing, and detection
as described for vedolizumab quantitation.
3. Incubation and Detection:
◦ Incubate and wash the plates following the kit's provided
instructions.
◦ Add the detection system-specific for antibodies, often
involving secondary antibodies conjugated to detection
enzymes and substrates.
4. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Read the results on a plate reader at the designated
wavelength.
◦ Interpret results based on the provided cut-off values to
determine the presence or absence of anti-vedolizumab
antibodies.
5. Documentation:
◦ Enter antibody detection results in the LIS.
◦ Ensure that all controls meet quality standards and
document any out-of-range findings.
8. Quality Control
• Run controls with each batch of tests to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of results.
• Maintain records of control results and calibration curves.
• Repeat any assays where controls or sample results fall outside
acceptable limits.
9. Reporting Results
• Report results according to the standard laboratory reporting
procedures.
• Vedolizumab quantitation and, if applicable, anti-vedolizumab
antibody results should be reviewed and verified by a technologist
before being released.
• Critical or unexpected results should be communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider immediately.
