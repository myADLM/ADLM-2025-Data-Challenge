Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Velvet Leaf, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE To establish a standard protocol for the analysis and
result generation of Velvet Leaf-Specific Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) levels in serum samples using the ImmunoCAP system.
The objective is to ensure accurate, repeatable, and timely
results.
Responsibility: Designated and trained laboratory technicians/
medical laboratory scientists are responsible for carrying out the
protocol as detailed. Supervisors must ensure adherence to this SOP
and address any deviations or issues promptly.
1. SCOPE This protocol covers all steps involved from the setup
of the assay to result generation for Velvet Leaf, IgE, Serum. It
does not encompass specimen collection, receipt, or
accessioning, which are managed in separate SOPs.
2. DEFINITIONS ImmunoCAP: A highly sensitive fluorescence
enzyme immunoassay used to quantify allergen-specific IgE
levels. IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with
allergic reactions.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ImmunoCAP 250/1000 Analyzer
• ImmunoCAP Specific IgE reagents and controls
• Pipettes (single-channel and multi-channel)
• Micropipette tips
• Calibrated incubator (37°C)
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Clean lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles
• Positive and negative IgE controls specific to Velvet Leaf allergen
• Readable and verified calibration curves
• Serum samples (received and properly accessioned)
1. REAGENT STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store ImmunoCAP reagents and controls at 2-8°C.
• Do not use reagents past their expiration dates.
• Allow reagents to come to room temperature before use.
• Ensure all reagents are prepared and used as per manufacturer
instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preliminary Checks:
• Ensure the ImmunoCAP Analyzer is calibrated and in proper
working condition.
• Verify the presence and integrity of all required reagents and
controls.
• Verify that serum samples are stored at 2-8°C and are
appropriately labeled.
B) Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge serum samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to achieve
clear serum.
• Properly label sample tubes and include patient identifiers.
C) Assay Setup:
1. Power up the ImmunoCAP analyzer and allow it to initialize.
2. Load the specific IgE reagents, the relevant Velvet Leaf
allergens, and calibration standards into the analyzer.
3. Add patient serum samples to the sample wells on the assay
plate.
4. Include positive and negative controls for quality assurance.
5. Input and verify sample information in the analyzer software.
D) Running the Assay:
1. Initiate the run by following the ImmunoCAP analyzer
instructions.
2. The analyzer will perform all steps including sample dispensing,
incubation, washing, and fluorescence reading.
3. The total running time for the ImmunoCAP assay typically
ranges from 2-3 hours. Ensure all steps are followed
automatically by the analyzer.
E) Quality Control:
1. Validate assay run by ensuring control results fall within the
appropriate ranges.
2. Investigate and troubleshoot any out-of-range controls
according to manufacturer guidelines and laboratory protocol.
3. Document all control results and any corrective measures
performed.
F) Data Review and Result Generation:
1. Review the assay data and identify any anomalies.
2. Calibrate analyzer results with the validated calibration curves.
3. Manually verify positive and negative control results.
4. Generate patient results from the ImmunoCAP analysis.
G) Result Reporting:
1. Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
patient report generation.
2. Ensure reports are verified and signed off by designated
laboratory personnel before being released.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there are discrepancies in control results or calibration,
reassess and re-run controls.
• Ensure proper laboratory conditions (temperature, humidity) are
maintained as documented.
• Record and report any technical issues encountered with the
ImmunoCAP analyzer to the technical supervisor.
1. DOCUMENTATION Maintain detailed logs of all assay runs,
including control results, patient sample results, equipment
maintenance records, and any corrective actions taken.
