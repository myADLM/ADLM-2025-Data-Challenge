Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measurement of
Venison-Specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the quantitative measurement
of venison-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in human
serum or plasma, using an automated immunoassay analyzer. These
measurements aid in the diagnosis of venison allergy.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel in the clinical chemistry and
immunology laboratories responsible for testing venison-specific IgE.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated technical staff to perform the
venison-specific IgE test according to this SOP and to document the
results accurately. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
ensuring that all personnel are trained and competent.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Human serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin, or
citrate).
• Specimen Collection: Blood should be collected by venipuncture
following standard phlebotomy procedures. Ensure proper
labeling of the specimens.
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL of serum/plasma.
• Storage Conditions: Serum/plasma must be stored at 2-8°C if
tested within 48 hours, or frozen at -20°C or colder for longer
storage. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly
labeled specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia™ 250
Immunoassay Analyzer).
• Phadia™ Venison-Specific IgE reagent kit.
• Calibrators and Controls.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Disposable gloves and laboratory coats.
• Sample tubes and racks.
• Timer.
• Disposable wipes and disinfectants for cleaning.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)/Laboratory notebook.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves and lab coat.
2. Ensure that the analyzer calibration is up to date, as per the
instrument's user manual.
3. Allow reagents and controls to reach room temperature before
use.
B. Specimen and Reagent Handling
1. Thaw frozen specimens completely and mix well before
analysis.
2. Load the serum/plasma specimens, controls, and calibrators
into the analyzer as per manufacturer's instructions.
3. Prepare the analyzer for the run by ensuring that all reagents,
calibrators, and controls are properly loaded and identified by
the analyzer.
C. Running the Assay
1. Follow instrument-specific start-up procedures.
2. Select venison-specific IgE assay from the instrument menu.
3. Initiate the test run on the analyzer, ensuring to record the run
ID and start time.
4. The analyzer automatically processes the samples and
performs the assay.
D. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens as per
the laboratory’s policy.
2. Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges. If QC
results are out of control, troubleshoot the issue according to
the analyzer's troubleshooting guide and do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved.
E. Calculating and Reporting Results
1. Review all test results on the analyzer screen, ensuring that
results are within the reportable range of the assay.
2. Validate the results based on quality control outcomes.
3. Transfer results automatically to the LIS for review and
verification, or manually enter results if necessary.
4. For manual entry, record the run ID, sample ID, IgE levels, and
any relevant comments.
5. Electronic results should be reviewed and verified before
releasing them into the patient’s electronic health record.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
• Reference ranges for venison-specific IgE:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.35 - 0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: >0.70 kU/L
All results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and patient history by a qualified healthcare provider.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Phadia™ Venison-Specific IgE reagent kit insert for
detailed information on assay limitations, such as potential
interferences and cross-reactivity.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
It is critical to adhere to the laboratory's quality control procedures.
Include appropriate calibrators and controls during each run, and
document all corrective actions taken for out-of-range QC results.

11. DOCUMENTATION
All records of specimen handling, assay procedures, quality control
results, and patient results should be maintained in a laboratory
notebook or electronically in the LIS, following documentation and
record retention policies.
