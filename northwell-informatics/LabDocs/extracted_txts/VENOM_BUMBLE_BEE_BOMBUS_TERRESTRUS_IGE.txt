Standard Operating Procedure: VENOM BUMBLE BEE (BOMBUS
TERRESTRUS) IGE
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps for analyzing
samples for Venom Bumble Bee (Bombus terrestrus) IgE levels. The
objective is to ensure accurate and timely results for diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all staff trained and authorized to
perform Venom Bumble Bee (Bombus terrestrus) IgE testing in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to follow this protocol accurately:
• Designated staff will perform the testing.
• Supervisors will ensure compliance and take corrective actions as
necessary.
4. PRINCIPLE OF ANALYSIS The test for Venom Bumble Bee
(Bombus terrestrus) IgE is performed using a specific ImmunoCAP
assay. The procedure includes preparing the specimen, loading the
specimen onto the ImmunoCAP instrument, and interpreting the
results using the defined reference ranges.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
• Specimen Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum or plasma is
required.
• Handling and Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if
analyzed within 7 days or at -20°C for long-term storage. Thaw
frozen specimens thoroughly and mix prior to analysis.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP instrument
• Venom Bumble Bee (Bombus terrestrus) IgE ImmunoCAP kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Specimens:
1. Verify patient identification on the sample label.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to obtain
clear serum or plasma without hemolysis.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform instrument calibration according to the ImmunoCAP
instrument manual.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each assay run.
Acceptable control ranges must be determined prior to test
analysis.
Testing Protocol:
1. Load the ImmunoCAP instrument with the appropriate Venom
Bumble Bee (Bombus terrestrus) IgE ImmunoCAP kit.
2. Prepare the reagents as per the kit instructions.
3. Pipette 40 µL of patient sample, calibrators, and controls into
separate wells on the assay plate.
4. Follow the instrument instructions to load the assay plate and
start the run.
Analyzing Results:
1. After completion of the run, the instrument will provide IgE
levels for the samples.
2. Ensure that the results of quality controls are within acceptable
limits before proceeding to analyze patient results.
3. Review the generated patient results for any potential errors or
issues.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Range:
◦ IgE level < 0.10 kU/L: Negative
◦ IgE level 0.10 – 0.34 kU/L: Low positive
◦ IgE level 0.35 – 0.69 kU/L: Moderate positive
◦ IgE level > 0.70 kU/L: Strong positive
• Results are transferred automatically to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) and must be verified and reviewed by a
laboratory technologist prior to release.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the ImmunoCAP
instrument as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Address any quality control failures by repeating the test and
investigating potential sources of error.
• In the event of persistent instrument issues, contact technical
support for guidance and intervention.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves
and lab coats.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious materials
and dispose of waste according to biohazard disposal guidelines.
