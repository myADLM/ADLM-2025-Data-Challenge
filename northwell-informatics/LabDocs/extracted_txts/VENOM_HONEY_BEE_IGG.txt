Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
VENOM HONEY BEE IGG Testing
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for generating and reporting results for
Venom Honey Bee IgG testing in the laboratory. This protocol
ensures accuracy, precision, and consistency in test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Venom Honey Bee IgG test following this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
the procedures and for addressing technical issues that arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or plain red-
top tube
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL of serum
• Storage Conditions:
◦ Stability at room temperature: up to 24 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): up to 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): long-term storage, ensure no freeze-
thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Venom Honey Bee IgG standard kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Microtiter plates (if using ELISA)
• Incubator (if using ELISA)
• Wash solution
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Laboratory timer
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient
specimens are at room temperature before use.
◦ Follow the kit insert instructions for reagent preparation.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer or ELISA reader as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch
or as per laboratory policy. Verify that QC results are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Manual ELISA Method:
1. Label microtiter plate wells for calibrators, controls,
and patient samples.
2. Add appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and
serum samples to respective wells.
3. Add conjugate reagent as specified by the kit
instructions.
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature or in an
incubator as specified.
5. Wash the plates thoroughly to remove unbound
materials.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate the plates for the
recommended time.
7. Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
8. Read the plate using the ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength.
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer Method:
1. Load the prepared specimens, calibrators, and
controls into the analyzer as instructed.
2. Select the Venom Honey Bee IgG test method.
3. Start the assay run and monitor system performance.
4. Ensure all specimens are processed, and initial QC
results are within acceptable limits.
4. Result Calculation and Analysis:
◦ For ELISA: Generate a standard curve from the optical
density readings of the calibrators. Interpolate the IgG
concentrations of the controls and patient samples from this
curve using software or manual calculations.
◦ For automated systems: Ensure the results are
automatically calculated and review them for consistency.
5. Data Review and Validation:
◦ Compare control results against established ranges.
Investigate and resolve any deviations before reporting
patient results.
◦ Validate patient results by confirming they fall within the
assay's linearity and detection range.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
accurately. Review and verify results before releasing them.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verified results must be entered and transmitted into the LIS.
• Critical values should be communicated to the appropriate clinical
personnel immediately according to laboratory policy.
• Include relevant comments if hemolysis, lipemia, or other
interferences are observed that may impact the results' integrity.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Document all control and calibration results.
• Address any out-of-range quality control results by recalibrating
the instrument, running new controls, or troubleshooting
equipment issues as needed.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration checks on
equipment used in testing.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s kit insert for Venom Honey Bee IgG test.
• Laboratory’s quality control and calibration procedures.
DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all steps, observations, and actions taken for each batch
of tests in the laboratory's logbook or electronic records system.
Verify that all results have been reviewed, initialed, and dated by
the responsible laboratory personnel.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inaccurate results may occur from improper sample handling,
dilution errors, or reagent issues. Any deviations must be
documented and rectified according to laboratory protocol.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay.

quality control procedures.
This protocol ensures that the process for Venom Honey Bee IgG
testing is standardized, reliable, and accurate, providing clinicians
with critical information for patient diagnosis and treatment.
