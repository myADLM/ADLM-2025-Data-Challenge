STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR VENOM W-F
HORNET IGG ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the steps for the analytical phase of generating results for
Venom W-F Hornet IgG antibody testing. This includes the
preparation, analysis, and reporting of test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff follow these
procedures and for addressing any issues that arise during the
process.
• All staff are responsible for reporting deficiencies and non-
conformities to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Venom W-F Hornet IgG test is used for the quantitative determination
of IgG antibodies against the Venom W-F Hornet in human serum.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Preparation
1. Specimen Type:
◦ Human serum is required for this test.
2. Specimen Collection and Handling:
◦ Collect blood specimens in a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
and then centrifuge for 10 minutes at approximately
2000-3000 x g.
◦ Carefully remove the serum, avoiding the cellular layer, and
transfer into a labeled aliquot tube.
◦ Refrigerate serum samples at 2-8°C if they are to be tested
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C
or lower.
3. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Samples with heavy hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
◦ Samples received in incorrect containers.
◦ Samples without proper labeling or associated
documentation.
B) Reagents and Equipment
1. Reagents:
◦ Venom W-F Hornet IgG ELISA Kit (includes coated
microplates, conjugate, substrate, buffers, and standards).
◦ Distilled water, wash buffer, stop solution.
2. Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450
nm.
◦ Microplate washer.
◦ Precision pipettes and tips.
◦ Calibrated laboratory timer.
◦ Vortex mixer.
C) Assay Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents, controls, and calibrators as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Bring all kit components and specimens to room
temperature before use.
2. Assay Steps:
1. Label the required number of microplate wells for
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples to
the designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. Wash the plate 4 times with the wash buffer, ensuring
complete removal of liquid after each wash.
5. Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for another 30
minutes.
7. Wash the plate 4 times with the wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 15
minutes.
10. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader within 15 minutes of stopping the
reaction.
D) Quality Control
1. Run internal quality control samples alongside patient samples.
2. Controls must fall within the manufacturer-provided acceptable
ranges. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and rerun the
assay as required.
E) Result Calculation and Reporting
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
standards against their concentrations.
3. Calculate the concentration of Venom W-F Hornet IgG in patient
samples by interpolating their absorbance values from the
standard curve.
4. Record and verify the results as per laboratory protocol.
5. Report the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
clinical review.
F) Method Limitations
1. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
results.
2. Ensure strict adherence to timing and procedural steps to avoid
deviations affecting results.
3. Refer to the ELISA kit insert for detailed limitations of the assay.
