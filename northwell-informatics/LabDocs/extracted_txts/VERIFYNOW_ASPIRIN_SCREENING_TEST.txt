VERIFYNOW ASPIRIN SCREENING TEST
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing the VerifyNow
Aspirin Screening Test to determine the effectiveness of aspirin
therapy in inhibiting platelet aggregation.
Responsibility:
The designated lab personnel are responsible for performing the
VerifyNow Aspirin Screening Test as per standard laboratory
procedures. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure tests are
conducted accurately and promptly, and to bring any issues or
abnormalities to the attention of the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 2.7 mL of whole blood collected in a VerifyNow Collection Tube
(containing 3.2% sodium citrate).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than sodium citrate.
• Specimens that have clotted.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than VerifyNow Collection
Tubes.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure specimens are stored at room temperature (20-25°C) and
tested within 4 hours of collection.
• Avoid vigorous shaking of the tube to prevent platelet activation
and aggregation.
• Do not refrigerate or freeze specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• VerifyNow System Analyzer
• VerifyNow Aspirin Test Cartridges
• VerifyNow Control Kit
Reagents & Supplies:
• Sodium citrate collection tubes (VerifyNow Collection Tubes)
• Pipettes and tips
• Control reagents provided by VerifyNow Control Kit
Storage:
• Store VerifyNow Test Cartridges and Control Kit components at
room temperature (20-25°C) as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Do not use reagents and cartridges past their expiration dates.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, consumables, and instruments are at room
temperature.
• Verify the calibration status of the VerifyNow System Analyzer and
confirm the analyzer is functioning correctly.
Testing Procedure: 1. Collect the whole blood specimen using the
VerifyNow Collection Tube. 2. Gently invert the tube 4-5 times to
ensure proper mixing of the citrate with the blood. 3. Allow the blood
to stand at room temperature for 2 minutes. 4. Insert the VerifyNow
Aspirin Test Cartridge into the VerifyNow System Analyzer. 5. Use a
pipette to transfer 0.5 mL of the whole blood specimen to the sample
port on the Cartridge. • Ensure no bubbles are present in the sample
before transferring. 6. Press "Start" on the analyzer to begin the test.
7. The analyzer will process the specimen and provide results within
5-10 minutes.
Quality Control: • Run external control samples from the VerifyNow
Control Kit prior to patient samples to assess system functionality. •
Record control results and ensure they are within specified limits
before proceeding with patient testing. • Recalibrate the analyzer if
control results fall outside acceptable ranges.
Reporting Results: • Results will be automatically processed and
displayed by the VerifyNow System Analyzer. • Record results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) and verify with the technologist.
• Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
• Aspirin Response Units (ARU): Results interpretation based on
ARU values: • ≥ 550 ARU: Aspirin therapy likely ineffective. •
450-549 ARU: Aspirin therapy partially effective. • < 450 ARU:
Aspirin therapy effective.
Method Limitations: • Refer to VerifyNow Aspirin Test cartridge insert
for individual reagent limitations.
