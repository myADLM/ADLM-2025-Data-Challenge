Protocol for VERIFYNOW CLOPIDOGREL (P2Y12) SCREENING
TEST
1. PURPOSE
The VERIFYNOW CLOPIDOGREL (P2Y12) screening test is used to
measure platelet response to clopidogrel therapy in patients. This
standard operating procedure provides guidance for the analytical
phase of generating results for VERIFYNOW CLOPIDOGREL
(P2Y12) screening tests.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff perform the VERIFYNOW
CLOPIDOGREL (P2Y12) screening test according to this procedure.
It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure adherence to this protocol
to maintain accurate and reliable results.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• VERIFYNOW system (e.g., instrument, cartridges)
• VERIFYNOW P2Y12 Test cartridges
• Control materials (Quality control reagents provided by
manufacturer)
• Disposable pipettes or syringes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Standard laboratory supplies (e.g., gloves, wipes)
Reagent Storage:
• Store VERIFYNOW Test cartridges at 2-8°C until use.
• Do not use expired cartridges or those stored improperly.
• Review package insert for specific reagent requirements and
handling precautions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in Greiner Bio-One
sodium citrate (light blue top) tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL.
• Transport: Transport specimens at room temperature to the
laboratory immediately after collection.
• Stability: Whole blood samples are stable for up to 4 hours at
room temperature (20-25°C).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing additives other than
sodium citrate.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens received more than 4 hours after collection.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure that the instrument is calibrated and clean.
• Ensure that controls and reagents have not expired.
Testing Steps:
1. Verification of Specimen:
◦ Verify specimen integrity and properly labeled with correct
patient information.
◦ Perform necessary prechecks by visually inspecting the
sample for any abnormalities. Reject unacceptable
specimens.
2. Pre-equilibration:
◦ Allow VERIFYNOW Test cartridge to equilibrate at room
temperature for at least 10 minutes but not more than 3
hours before use.
3. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on VERIFYNOW system and ensure it reads "Ready."
◦ Insert cartridge into system, following instrument prompts.
4. Specimen Handling:
◦ Gently invert the blood collection tube several times to
ensure uniform mixing of anticoagulant.
◦ Use a disposable pipette or syringe to draw 2 mL of the well-
mixed whole blood.
5. Loading Specimen:
◦ Load whole blood into the sample port of the VERIFYNOW
Test cartridge following manufacturer instructions.
◦ Ensure that blood is deposited into the cartridge without
bubbles and at the accuracy marks.
6. Starting the Test:
◦ Initiate test on the VERIFYNOW system.
◦ Close the lid and ensure the system begins the analysis.
7. Running the Test:
◦ Monitor the system as it processes the sample, following
prompts displayed on the VERIFYNOW screen.
8. Result Generation:
◦ Results are displayed on the VERIFYNOW instrument after
analysis.
◦ If errors or flags occur, follow troubleshooting steps outlined
by the manufacturer.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Checks:
• Run quality control according to VERIFYNOW manufacturer
recommendations before patient testing.
• Use the appropriate control materials provided; ensure controls
are within acceptable ranges.
• Document all control results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
Troubleshooting:
• In the event of QC failure, repeat QC tests.
• Review control material integrity and instrument calibration.
• Follow specific troubleshooting and corrective action steps
outlined in the manufacturer guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Validation and Verification:
• Review results from the VERIFYNOW system for accuracy and
completeness.
• Cross-check results against patient records and control material
outcomes.
• Document and verify results in the LIS, ensuring the removal of
any errors or flagged results.
Critical Values:
• Critical values as specified by the manufacturer should be
communicated immediately to the requesting clinician.
• Document all critical value notifications.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to the VERIFYNOW system package insert for specific
reference intervals.
Sample Integrity:
• Should sample integrity be compromised (e.g., hemolysis, clotted
samples), use best judgment and document in LIS.
• Recollect sample if required.
1. LIMITATIONS
Refer to the VERIFYNOW package insert for testing limitations and
reagent pad-specific limitations.
