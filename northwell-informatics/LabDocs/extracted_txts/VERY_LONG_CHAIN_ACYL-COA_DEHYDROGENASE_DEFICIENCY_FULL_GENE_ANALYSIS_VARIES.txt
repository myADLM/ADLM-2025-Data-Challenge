phase of generating results for Very Long Chain Acyl-CoA
Dehydrogenase Deficiency (VLCAD), full gene analysis.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel with adequate training in molecular
diagnostics are responsible for performing the analysis according to
this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 2-5 mL of whole blood in EDTA (lavender-top) tube.
• Buccal swabs if blood draw is not possible.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed blood specimens.
• Specimens without proper labeling or those collected without
proper documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated DNA extractor (e.g., Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL)
• Thermal cyclers (e.g., ABI 9700)
• SeqStudio Genetic Analyzer or equivalent
• Vortex mixer
Reagents and Chemicals:
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR master mix
• Primers specific for VLCAD gene (ACADVL gene)
• BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
• Sequencing buffer
• Molecular grade water
Supplies:
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipette tips with barriers
• PCR plates and seals
• Sequencing plates
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to extract genomic DNA
from whole blood or buccal swabs using the automated DNA
extractor.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a fluorometer (e.g., Qubit)
and record the DNA concentration.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix according to the following
components:
◦ 25 µL PCR Master Mix
◦ 1 µL of each primer (forward and reverse, final concentration
10 µM)
◦ 1-2 µL genomic DNA (approx. 50 ng)
◦ Nuclease-free water to final volume of 50 µL
2. Amplify targeted regions of the VLCAD gene using appropriate
thermal cycling conditions: - Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3
minutes - 35 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C (primer-specific) for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
- Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
1. Run a 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the presence and size of
PCR amplicons.
C) Sequencing Reaction:
1. Purify PCR products using a suitable kit (e.g., ExoSAP-IT).
2. Prepare sequencing reactions using BigDye Terminator v3.1.
Follow manufacturer's recommendations for the reaction setup.
◦ 1 µL BigDye Terminator
◦ 1-2 µL purified PCR product
◦ 1 µL sequencing primer (forward or reverse, final
concentration 3.2 µM)
◦ Sequencing buffer and water to a final volume of 10 µL
3. Perform cycle sequencing using the following thermal cycling
conditions: - Initial denaturation: 96°C for 1 minute - 25 cycles
of:
◦ Denaturation: 96°C for 10 seconds
◦ Annealing: 50°C for 5 seconds
◦ Extension: 60°C for 4 minutes
4. Purify the sequencing reactions using ethanol precipitation or
equivalent method.
5. Load purified products on the SeqStudio Genetic Analyzer or
equivalent.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Use appropriate software for sequence alignment and variant
analysis (e.g., Variant Reporter or equivalent).
2. Compare sequences to a reference VLCAD gene sequence.
3. Identify and annotate variations following established guidelines
(e.g., ACMG/AMP).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing batch.
• Process a known VLCAD positive DNA sample alongside patient
samples to ensure assay performance.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs annually.
• Review and document results to ensure laboratory accuracy and
consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Sequence:
• Use NM_000018.3 (ACADVL) as the reference sequence.
Interpretation:
• Variants are classified into categories (Pathogenic, Likely
Pathogenic, Uncertain Significance, Likely Benign, Benign) using
established criteria.
Documentation and Sign-Out:
• Results are recorded in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Reports are reviewed and signed out by a certified laboratory
director or authorized personnel.
• Critical findings and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are
discussed with referring physician or genetic counselor.

1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
Lab personnel must adhere to standard biosafety and chemical
safety guidelines while handling human specimens, and during
nucleic acid extraction and amplification. Dispose of all waste as per
regulatory requirements.
Note: This protocol is to be reviewed annually or as needed for
accuracy and updated per the latest scientific and procedural
advancements in the analysis of VLCAD deficiency.
