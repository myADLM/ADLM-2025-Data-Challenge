SOP for Analytical Phase of VHL Gene, Erythrocytosis Mutation
Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to describe the
procedure for the analytical phase of VHL gene mutation
analysis associated with erythrocytosis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis, interpreting the results, and documenting the
findings as per this procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
staff to ensure all steps are completed accurately and any
discrepancies are reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN
• Type: Whole blood or DNA extracted from blood.
• Collection: Specimens should be collected in sterile EDTA
Vacutainer tubes.
• Transportation: Specimens must be kept at 2-8°C during
transportation and must reach the laboratory within 72 hours of
collection.
• Storage: DNA specimens can be stored at -20°C until analysis.
Whole blood should not be stored longer than 72 hours at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Agarose Gel Electrophoresis System
• DNA Extraction Kit (licensed and validated for medical use)
• VHL gene-specific Primers
• PCR Master Mix
• DNA Ladder (100 bp increments)
• Ethidium Bromide or SYBR Safe for gel staining
• Qubit Fluorometer or NanoDrop Spectrophotometer
• Multichannel Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Gel Imaging System
1. PROCEDURE 4.1 DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA following the manufacturer's instructions using a
validated DNA Extraction Kit.
• Quantify the DNA concentration using a NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer or Qubit Fluorometer.
• The A260/A280 ratio should be between 1.8-2.0 for quality DNA.
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not proceeding directly to PCR.
4.2 PCR Amplification
• Prepare a PCR Master Mix containing the following components
for each reaction:
◦ 10 µL of 2X PCR Master Mix
◦ 1 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1-5 µL of template DNA (20 ng total)
◦ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 20 µL
• Mix the components thoroughly by vortexing and then centrifuge
briefly to collect contents at the bottom of the tube.
• Load the PCR Master Mix into PCR tubes or plates.
4.3 PCR Conditions
• Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
• Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
• Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (depending on the primer Tm)
• Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
• No. of Cycles: 35 cycles
• Hold: 4°C until samples are retrieved
4.4 Gel Electrophoresis
• Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or SYBR Safe
for DNA staining.
• Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with 1 µL of loading buffer into
each well.
• Include a DNA ladder (100 bp increments) in one well to
determine the size of PCR products.
• Run the gel at 100 V for 60 minutes.
• Visualize the gel using a Gel Imaging System.
4.5 Interpretation of Results
• Compare the bands of the PCR products to the DNA ladder.
• Identify bands corresponding to the expected size of the VHL
gene mutation.
• Document and interpret the results.
4.6 Sequencing (Optional)
• If necessary, amplify the DNA for sequencing.
• Purify the PCR products using a commercially available
purification kit.
• Send purified products for Sanger Sequencing to confirm the
mutations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control (known VHL mutation) and a negative
control (no DNA template) in each PCR run.
• Validate the new batch of consumables and reagents periodically.
• Perform bi-weekly verification of equipment calibration.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify the results with a senior technologist or
supervisor.
• Report the genetic test results to the referring physician or genetic
counselor.
• Adhere to laboratory policies for result documentation and patient
confidentiality.
