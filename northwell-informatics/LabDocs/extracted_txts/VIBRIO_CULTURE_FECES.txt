Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Vibrio Culture,
Feces
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for isolating and identifying Vibrio species
from fecal specimens. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable
results, minimizes contamination risk, guarantees reproducibility, and
standardizes the culture process.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
accurately and report any deviations to the laboratory supervisor
immediately. Lab Technologists must ensure proper handling of the
specimens, media, and equipment.
2. DEFINITION
Vibrio species are gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria found in
marine and brackish environments that can cause gastrointestinal
illnesses. This protocol aims to identify pathogenic Vibrio species
from fecal samples, particularly Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio
parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus.
3. PROCEDURE
A) EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Standard laboratory equipment (incubator, Bunsen burner,
inoculating loops, etc.)
• Vibrio isolation agar (Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salt Sucrose - TCBS
agar)
• Alkaline Peptone Water (APW) for enrichment
• MacConkey agar
• Oxidase reagent
• API 20E or other commercial biochemical identification system
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE - gloves, lab coat, goggles)
B) SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Collect fecal specimens in clean, sterile containers.
• Transport within 2 hours at 2-8°C, or use suitable preservative if
delays expected.
• Unacceptable specimens: dry swabs, heavily mixed with urine,
leaked samples, specimens older than 24 hours without transport
medium.
C) SPECIMEN HANDLING
• Receive and log each sample promptly upon arrival.
• Label samples with patient ID, date, and time of collection.
• Evaluate specimen acceptability (liquid consistency preferred).
D) CULTURE AND ISOLATION PROCEDURE
1. Pre-enrichment in APW
◦ Aseptically transfer 1-2 g of fecal sample to 10 mL of APW.
◦ Incubate at 35°C for up to 18 hours.
2. Primary Plating
◦ Following enrichment, inoculate a loopful of the APW onto
TCBS agar.
◦ Streak for isolation to obtain distinct colony morphology.
◦ Incubate plates at 35°C for 24-48 hours.
◦ Concurrently inoculate MacConkey agar for comparisons.
3. Examine Plates
◦ After incubation, observe TCBS for characteristic Vibrio
colonies:
▪ V. cholerae: Large, yellow colonies.
▪ V. parahaemolyticus: Green, blue-green colonies.
▪ V. vulnificus: Yellow/green colonies with flat
appearance.
4. Subculture
◦ Pick isolated colonies from TCBS plates and subculture on
non-selective media (e.g., Sheep Blood Agar – SBA) for
purity and further testing.
5. Oxidase Test
◦ Perform oxidase test on suspect colonies; Vibrio species are
oxidase-positive.
6. Biochemical Identification
◦ Utilize the API 20E identification system or equivalent
commercial kits following manufacturer instructions.
◦ Reference the appropriate species’ biochemical profiles for
accurate identification.
7. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (if required)
◦ Conduct according to CLSI guidelines for isolated
pathogenic strains.
E) QUALITY CONTROL
• QC each batch of media and verify with known positive and
negative control strains.
• Record daily equipment performance checks (incubator
temperature, etc.).
• Document each step in the laboratory logbook for traceability.
• Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons
when available.
F) DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• All results, including preliminary and confirmed identities, are
recorded in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical values or preliminary findings implicating Vibrio pathogens
are immediately reported to the healthcare provider.
G) REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No Vibrio species isolated.
• Positive: Identification of specific Vibrio species noted in the final
report.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
• No growth on TCBS: Verify specimen quality and re-incubate.
Consider potential inhibitory agents.
• Non-characteristic colony morphology: Repeat subculture and
biochemical testing; confirm with serological methods if
necessary.
• Discrepancies in oxidase results: Include quality control testing
and reagent integrity check.
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Follow biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) guidelines.
• Ensure appropriate disposal of biohazard waste.
