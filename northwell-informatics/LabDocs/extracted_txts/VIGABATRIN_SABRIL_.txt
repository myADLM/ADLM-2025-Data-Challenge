Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Vigabatrin (Sabril)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate
and efficient analysis of Vigabatrin (Sabril) levels in patient
specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Users of this SOP must
consistently follow the outlined protocol to ensure data accuracy,
reliability, and the integrity of patient results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel,
including laboratory technicians, technologists, and supervisors, to
adhere to the procedures outlined in this SOP. The designated
personnel must ensure proper documentation of all steps and any
deviations from the established protocol must be immediately
addressed and corrected.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
• Preferred Specimen Type: Serum or plasma collected in a plain
tube or a lithium-heparin tube.
• Specimen Volume: At least 1 mL of serum or plasma.
• Stability: Specimens should be analyzed within 48 hours if kept
at 2-8°C. For longer storage, specimens can be frozen at -20°C
for up to 3 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric should be rejected. Specimens in tubes with
other anticoagulants such as EDTA, citrate, or oxalate are
unacceptable.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
suitable analytical method
• Vigabatrin standards and quality control material
• Mobile phase and reagents for HPLC as specified by the
instrument manufacturer
• Appropriate pipettes and volumetric flasks
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Calibration
1. Prepare Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare a series of calibration standards of Vigabatrin in
serum or plasma at concentrations covering the clinically
relevant range.
2. Prepare Quality Control Samples:
◦ Utilize commercially available or in-house prepared quality
control materials at low, medium, and high concentrations
relevant to clinical decision points.
3. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Run the prepared calibration standards on the HPLC
system.
◦ Generate a calibration curve by plotting peak area/height
against the concentration of standards.
◦ Ensure the calibration curve meets acceptance criteria (e.g.,
correlation coefficient R² ≥ 0.99).
B) Specimen Analysis
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge serum or plasma specimens at 2000 x g for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
◦ Pipette the clear supernatant into clean tubes for analysis.
2. HPLC Procedure:
◦ Inject an aliquot (usually 10-20 µL) of the prepared
specimen into the HPLC system.
◦ Follow the instrument-specific protocol for the mobile phase
composition and flow rate.
◦ Record the chromatographic data for each specimen.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Include quality control samples in each analytical run.
◦ Evaluate the quality control results to ensure they are within
the established control limits before accepting patient
results.
C) Data Analysis and Result Reporting
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Analyze the chromatographic data using the software
provided with the HPLC system.
◦ Determine the concentration of Vigabatrin by comparing the
sample peak areas to the calibration curve.
2. Results Review:
◦ Review patient results and ensure they fall within the
clinically relevant analytical range.
◦ Any specimens with concentrations outside the calibration
range should be re-analyzed after appropriate dilution or re-
injection.
3. Result Documentation:
◦ Document all findings accurately in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure that results are verified by a qualified technologist or
supervisor before releasing them to the requesting clinician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run quality control samples at the beginning, mid, and end of
each analytical batch.
• Investigate and resolve any quality control failures before
continuing with sample analysis.
• Maintain proper documentation for calibration, quality control, and
instrument maintenance logs.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure all patient results, including those of quality control
samples, are entered accurately in the LIS.
• Notify the clinician of any critical or unusual results as per
laboratory protocol.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manuals and inserts for HPLC system and
reagents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of
Vigabatrin.
9. REVISION HISTORY
• This SOP will undergo regular review and updates as deemed
necessary by laboratory management to ensure compliance with
the latest industry standards and regulations.
