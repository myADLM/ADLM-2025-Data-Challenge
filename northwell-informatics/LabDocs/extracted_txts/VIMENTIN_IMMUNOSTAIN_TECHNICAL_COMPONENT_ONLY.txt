Vimentin Immunostain, Technical Component Only SOP
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps and responsibilities required for
performing Vimentin immunostaining on tissue sections in order to
identify vimentin expression for further diagnostic evaluation by a
pathologist.
Responsibility:
• Designated histotechnologists are responsible for performing the
immunostaining procedure as defined in this protocol.
• Laboratory supervisors ensure that the procedure is followed and
any discrepancies or issues are addressed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections
• Unacceptable: Frozen tissue sections, improperly fixed tissue, or
improperly processed paraffin blocks
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) stainer (e.g., Ventana
Benchmark XT, Leica Bond, Dako Autostainer)
• Vimentin primary antibody
• Detection kit (e.g., secondary antibody, DAB chromogen)
• Positive and negative control slides
• Xylene and ethanol series for deparaffinization and rehydration
• Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for antigen retrieval
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Mounting media and coverslips
• Incubation chambers
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Slides:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place FFPE tissue sections in a xylene bath for three
cycles, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate sections through a graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 70%, 50%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in preheated citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA
buffer (pH 8.0) and place in a microwave or pressure
cooker. Follow the antigen retrieval protocol specific to the
primary antibody and the equipment used.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse with
buffer solution.
B) Immunostaining:
1. Perform staining using an automated IHC stainer according to
the manufacturer's instructions. a. Load slides onto the stainer.
b. Add primary antibody (Vimentin) to slides; incubate as per
antibody datasheet (typically 30-60 minutes at room
temperature). c. Apply detection kit reagents (secondary
antibody and DAB chromogen). d. Use appropriate wash steps
between reagent applications to avoid cross-reactivity.
2. Counterstaining and Mounting:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
◦ Dehydrate slides through ethanol series and clear in xylene.
◦ Apply mounting media and coverslips.
C) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each staining run.
2. Verify staining quality and specificity by examining control
slides.
3. Document any deviations from expected staining patterns and
report to the supervisor.
D) Documentation and Reporting:
1. Record all relevant information in the staining log, including
date, time, antibody lot number, duration of staining, and any
observations.
2. Final stained slides will be sent to the pathologist for diagnostic
review and interpretation.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure proper antigen retrieval technique is used to avoid
insufficient staining.
• Monitor antibody and reagent expiration dates.
• If non-specific staining occurs, review washing steps and antibody
concentrations.
• If weak staining is observed, reassess antigen retrieval conditions
and antibody dilution.
• Document any issues and corrective actions taken in the staining
log.

This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
comply with current standards and procedures. It is the responsibility
of all laboratory staff to adhere to these guidelines to ensure
consistent and accurate immunostaining results.
