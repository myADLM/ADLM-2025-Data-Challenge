Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Viral Susceptibility, Defects in Intrinsic and Innate Immunity,
Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This document provides a detailed protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for viral susceptibility, defects in
intrinsic and innate immunity, gene panels, and other varied
genetic analyses in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologists and
supervisory staff to follow this SOP accurately to ensure valid,
reproducible, and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated staff performing the
analytical phase of viral susceptibility tests, defect analysis in
intrinsic and innate immunity, and gene panels testing.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms
• Real-Time PCR systems
• Thermocyclers
• DNA/RNA extraction kits and systems
• Quantitative and qualitative analysis kits
• Appropriate pipettes and tips
• Buffer solutions
• Bioinformatics software for sequence analysis
• Calibration and control materials
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 PRE-ANALYTICAL CHECKS:
◦ Ensure the sample has been correctly accessioned and
labelled.
◦ Verify that the sample meets the acceptance criteria (e.g.,
volume, type, integrity).
◦ Confirm that all required reagents and consumables are
prepared and labeled correctly.
4.2 NUCLEIC ACID EXTRACTION:
◦ Prepare the extraction reagents by following the protocol
provided in the kit's insert.
◦ Extract nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) from specimens using
automated or manual extraction methods.
◦ Measure nucleic acid concentration using a
spectrophotometer or fluorimeter.
◦ Store nucleic acids at -20°C or -80°C until further analysis.
4.3 AMPLIFICATION (PCR/RT-PCR):
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix as per the protocol guidelines.
◦ Allocate nucleic acid samples into PCR or RT-PCR reaction
wells/tubes.
◦ Load the reaction onto the PCR/RT-PCR thermocycler and
run the program according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.
4.4 SEQUENCING (for gene panels):
◦ Prepare the DNA library using appropriate library
preparation kits.
◦ Quantify and normalize the DNA library.
◦ Load the DNA library into the NGS instrument and run the
sequencing program.
◦ Collect raw sequencing data from the instrument.
4.5 DATA ANALYSIS:
◦ Transfer the raw data to the bioinformatics system.
◦ Perform primary data analysis including sequence
alignment, variant calling, and quality control checks.
◦ Use bioinformatics pipelines to annotate variants and
interpret the potential impact on viral susceptibility and
intrinsic/innate immunity.
◦ Ensure all detected variants are reviewed according to
internal guidelines or clinical database references.
4.6 QUALITY CONTROL (QC):
◦ Include positive and negative controls for each batch of
tests.
◦ Ensure the quality control of each run by comparing the QC
sample results against reference standards.
◦ If QC samples do not meet the expected criteria,
troubleshoot and rerun as necessary.
4.7 INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING:
◦ Summarize the results by highlighting significant variants
linked to viral susceptibility and defects in intrinsic and
innate immunity.
◦ Review the genetic data against clinical significance
databases (e.g., ClinVar, OMIM).
◦ Draft a comprehensive report for clinical interpretation and
reference.
◦ Notify the supervisor for result verification and final approval
before releasing the report.
◦ Enter final verified results into the Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS) for record-keeping.
2. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING:
• Document all procedural steps, controls used, and observations in
the laboratory logbook.
• Maintain electronic records of sequencing data and analysis
results securely on the laboratory’s server.
• Ensure all reports are signed, dated, and meet the regulatory
requirements of CLIA.
1. REPORTING CRITICAL VALUES:
• Alerts for critical results must be escalated immediately to the
ordering physician as per laboratory policy.
• Document the name of the reporting technologist and the date/
time of result notification within the LIMS.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Refer to the instrument’s user manual or troubleshooting guide for
issues encountered during nucleic acid extraction, amplification,
or sequencing.
• Consult with supervisors or technical support teams for persistent
issues beyond routine troubleshooting steps.
1. DEGREE OF RELIABILITY:
Tools and reagents must be validated and controlled with
measures that demonstrate reliability and reproducibility per
relevant guidelines. Regular proficiency testing and inter-
laboratory comparisons should be performed to maintain high-
quality standards.
2. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow the laboratory's biosafety guidelines while handling
biological specimens.
• Use appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) at all
stages.
• Dispose of reagents, consumables, and biological waste as per
the safety protocols established by the laboratory.
