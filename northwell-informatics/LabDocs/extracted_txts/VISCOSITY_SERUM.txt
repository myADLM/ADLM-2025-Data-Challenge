Analytical Phase SOP for Generating Results for VISCOSITY,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
accurate and precise VISCOSITY, SERUM results in
compliance with CLIA standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
responsible for performing serum viscosity analysis using the
specified viscometer equipment.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory Technologist: Perform and document serum
viscosity tests, ensure equipment accuracy, conduct quality
control, and adhere to outlined procedures.
◦ Lab Supervisor: Oversee adherence to the procedure,
validate results, address corrective actions, and ensure
compliance with quality control standards.
◦ Quality Assurance Team: Monitor overall compliance,
audit processes periodically, and update procedures as
necessary.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ Automated viscometer (ViscoQC 100 or equivalent)
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Serum sample tubes
◦ Quality control materials (Low, Normal, High)
◦ Calibration standard solutions
◦ Appropriate cleaning solvents
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
◦ Ensure that the viscometer is properly calibrated using the
manufacturer’s protocols.
◦ Inspect viscometer and ensure it is free from any
contaminants or residual material from previous tests.
◦ Confirm that all reagents and solutions are within their
expiration dates.
B. Sample Requirements
◦ Acceptable samples: Serum from SST or red top tubes.
◦ Volume required: Minimum of 1.0 mL.
◦ Samples must be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C and test within 24 hours of
collection.
C. Quality Control
◦ Conduct quality control checks with low, normal, and high
viscosity control materials before testing patient samples.
◦ Record QC results in the QC logbook and verify that all QC
materials are within acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, recalibrate the
viscometer and re-check QC before proceeding with patient
samples.
D. Testing Process
◦ Pipette 500 µL of serum into a pre-washed and dried
viscometer tube.
◦ Follow equipment-specific instructions on operating the
viscometer.
◦ Ensure that the viscometer is set to the accurate speed and
time parameters as outlined in the equipment’s manual
(e.g., spindle number and RPM selection).
◦ Record the viscosity reading displayed on the viscometer.
◦ Clean the viscometer tube thoroughly after each test to
avoid cross-contamination.
E. Data Recording and Interpretation
◦ Enter the viscosity results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Cross-verify the results manually to ensure the accuracy of
the data recorded.
◦ Interpret results based on reference intervals established by
the laboratory and note any deviations.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal Serum Viscosity: 1.4 – 1.8 mPa·s (millipascal-
second)
7. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the
accuracy of viscosity measurement.
◦ Samples must be within the appropriate volume (1.0 mL) to
ensure accurate readings.
◦ Temperature fluctuations can affect viscosity measurements;
ensure the test environment is stable.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform internal quality control checks daily and record in
the logbook.
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs bi-annually to
ensure the reliability of testing results.
◦ Maintain thorough records of all calibration, maintenance,
and quality control activities.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
◦ Review and validate results before releasing them to ensure
accuracy.
◦ Flag any critical values per lab policy and notify the
appropriate healthcare provider immediately.
10. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If the sample does not meet criteria (e.g., sample hemolysis,
inadequate volume), reject and request a new specimen.
• Address any equipment malfunction by performing recalibration or
maintenance as required.
• Document all corrective actions taken in response to QC failures
promptly.
