STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Vitamin A and
Vitamin E, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Vitamin A and
Vitamin E in serum samples to ensure consistently accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
a. The laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis according to the procedure outlined. b. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP and
verifying results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Acceptable Specimen: Serum b. Collection: Blood should be
collected in a SST (serum separator tube), allowed to clot, and then
centrifuged within 2 hours of collection. c. Volume: A minimum of 0.5
mL serum is required. d. Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if
analysis will be performed within 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze
serum samples at -20°C or below.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
a. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with UV detector b. HPLC column suited for Vitamin A and
Vitamin E analysis c. Mobile phase: Methanol and water (95:5, v/v) d.
Calibration standards for Vitamin A and Vitamin E e. Internal standard
solution (e.g., Retinyl acetate for Vitamin A, Tocopherol acetate for
Vitamin E) f. Sample vials g. Micropipettes and tips h. Centrifuge i.
Refrigeration and freezer units j. Water bath set to 37°C
1. PROCEDURE
a. PREPARATION OF STANDARDS AND QUALITY CONTROLS
i. Prepare calibration standards of Vitamin A and Vitamin E at known
concentrations (e.g., 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32 mg/L) using serum
as the matrix. ii. Prepare Quality Control (QC) samples (low, medium,
and high concentrations) for inclusion in each run. iii. Store prepared
standards and QCs at -20°C.
b. SAMPLE PREPARATION
i. Thaw frozen serum samples, standards, and QC samples at room
temperature. ii. Vortex all samples to ensure thorough mixing. iii. Add
0.5 mL of serum sample, standard, or QC to a sample vial. iv. Add
0.25 mL of internal standard solution to each vial. v. Vortex the vials
for 30 seconds. vi. Incubate the vials at 37°C water bath for 30
minutes to allow for the reaction to proceed. vii. Centrifuge the vials
at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to precipitate proteins. viii. Carefully
transfer the supernatant to HPLC sample vials.
c. HPLC ANALYSIS
i. Ensure the HPLC system is calibrated and the column has been
conditioned according to manufacturer specifications. ii. Set the
method parameters: - Column temperature: 25°C - Flow rate: 1.0 mL/
min - Injection volume: 20 µL - Detection wavelength: 325 nm for
Vitamin A, 295 nm for Vitamin E iii. Inject calibration standards,
followed by QC samples and serum samples. iv. Ensure a blank run
(mobile phase only) is included.
1. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
a. Generate calibration curves for Vitamin A and Vitamin E using the
peak area ratio of analyte to internal standard. b. Determine the
concentration of analytes in serum samples using the calibration
curves. c. Ensure all QC samples fall within ±15% of the expected
concentration. If not, re-calibrate or troubleshoot the HPLC system. d.
Verify all results and report serum Vitamin A and Vitamin E
concentrations in mg/L.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Include at least one QC sample at each concentration level (low,
medium, high) in every batch of samples analyzed. b. Record all QC
results and monitor trends over time. c. If QC results fall outside
acceptable limits, initiate troubleshooting procedures and re-analyze
affected samples after resolving issues.
1. MAINTENANCE
a. Clean the HPLC column regularly according to manufacturer
instructions. b. Replace mobile phase solvents weekly or as needed
to maintain consistent system performance. c. Calibrate the HPLC
system bi-weekly, and document calibration results.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
a. If peak shapes are abnormal, check for column clogging and
perform column maintenance as needed. b. If there is a baseline drift,
ensure the mobile phase mixture is fresh and the system is
equilibrated properly. c. Consult manufacturer support for persistent
technical problems with the HPLC system.
1. SAFETY
a. Follow laboratory safety protocols at all times. b. Wear appropriate
PPE including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection. c. Handle all
reagents and samples in accordance with MSDS guidelines to
minimize exposure.
