Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase -
Vitamin A, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized procedure
for the analysis of Vitamin A (Retinol) in serum samples. This SOP
includes specific guidelines for specimen handling, instrumentation,
quality control, and result reporting to ensure accuracy and
consistency in generating and interpreting results.
Responsibility:
1.1 Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analytical procedures for Vitamin A, Serum. 1.2 It is the
responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify any deficiencies or
problems encountered during the analysis and report them to a
supervisor. 1.3 Supervisory staff are responsible for ensuring that
quality control procedures are followed and documented and that
results are reviewed and verified before reporting.
1. DEFINITION
Vitamin A (Retinol) is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for vision, growth,
and immune function. Deficiency or excess of Vitamin A can lead to
various health issues which necessitate accurate and timely
measurement.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Specimen Type: Serum 3.2 Collection: Blood should be collected
in a red-top or serum-separator tube (SST). SST tubes should be
allowed to clot for 20-30 minutes before centrifugation. 3.3 Volume:
Minimum volume required is 0.5 mL of serum. 3.4 Handling: Serum
should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection. 3.5
Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
24 hours; otherwise, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
3.6 Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric might interfere
with the assay results and should be reported to a supervisor if
detected.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System
equipped with a UV-Vis detector. 4.2 HPLC Column: C18 column (or
the column specified by the manufacturer). 4.3 Mobile Phase:
Methanol and water mixture (typically 95:5 v/v). 4.4 Vitamin A
Standard: Certified standard for calibration and quality control. 4.5
Other Reagents: - Retinol-free serum for matrix calibrators -
Carotene-free extraction solvent - Internal standard (if required by
method)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Calibration of HPLC: - Prepare a series of Vitamin A standards in
the mobile phase. - Inject each standard to generate a calibration
curve. - Ensure all function tests meet the manufacturer's guidelines
before sample analysis.
5.2 Sample Preparation: - Thaw frozen samples at room temperature
and mix well. - Pipette 200 µL of serum into a microcentrifuge tube. -
Add an equal volume of the internal standard solution (if used) and
vortex for 30 seconds. - Add 400 µL of the carotene-free extraction
solvent and vortex again for 1 minute. - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for
10 minutes to separate the phases. - Transfer the upper organic
phase into a clean HPLC vial using a pipette, avoiding the
precipitated protein layer.
5.3 HPLC Analysis: - Set the HPLC conditions as per the method
protocol (e.g. flow rate: 1.0 mL/min; UV detection at 325 nm). - Inject
50 μL of the extract into the HPLC system. - Record and integrate
peak areas of Vitamin A and internal standard (if applicable).
5.4 Calculation and Quality Control: - Calculate the concentration of
Vitamin A in the serum samples using the calibration curve. - Run
quality control samples with known concentration before and after the
sample set to ensure accuracy and precision. - Acceptable results for
QC should be within ±2 standard deviations of the known value.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Results should be reported in µg/dL or µmol/L, consistent with the
laboratory's reporting standards. 6.2 Verify the results by a second
technologist before releasing them to the LIS (Laboratory Information
System). 6.3 Any abnormal or critical findings should be flagged and
reviewed by a supervisor before clinical reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Serum Vitamin A (Retinol) reference range for adults: 20-80 µg/dL
(0.70-2.80 µmol/L).
• Clinical interpretation should consider additional patient-specific
information and consultation with clinical staff as needed.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
8.1 Ensure samples are protected from light during collection,
handling, and analysis to prevent photodegradation of Retinol. 8.2
Interferences from other serum constituents should be duly noted;
e.g., very high levels of carotenoids or certain medications may
interfere with the assay.

protocols.
10. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
10.1 All raw data, calibration curves, QC results, and maintenance
logs should be documented and retained as per laboratory policy.
10.2 Annual review of the SOP should be performed, and updates
should be made as necessary based on new guidelines or
technological advancements.
By following this SOP, the laboratory will ensure consistent, accurate,
and reliable results for the analysis of Vitamin A in serum samples.
