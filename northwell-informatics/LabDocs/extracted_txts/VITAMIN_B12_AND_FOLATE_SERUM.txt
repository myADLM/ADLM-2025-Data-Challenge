Vitamin B12 and Folate, Serum Testing Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Vitamin B12 and Folate
levels in serum specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are required to follow this SOP to
perform the Vitamin B12 and Folate, Serum testing. It is the duty of
the designated personnel to perform, monitor, and document all steps
involved in the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube, or serum separator tube (SST).
• Separate serum from cells as soon as possible or within 2 hours
of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than red-top or
SST.
• Serum exposed to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzers: Automatic immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Cobas e411,
Roche Elecsys).
• Serum separator tubes (SST), red-top tubes.
• Calibrators and controls as per manufacturer instructions.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Laboratory timer.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment, reagents, and supplies are prepared and
ready for use.
• Calibrate the analyzer using the manufacturer-provided
calibrators if required.
• Ensure all quality control (QC) materials are ready.
5.2 Assay Procedure:
5.2.1 Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum samples to clot completely at room temperature
before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the SST at 1000-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
5.2.2 Assay Setup:
• Load the serum samples, calibrators, and QC materials into the
analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Program the analyzer with the appropriate settings for Vitamin
B12 and Folate assays.
• Verify that the analyzer is set to measure both Vitamin B12 and
Folate concurrently.
5.2.3 Analysis:
• Initiate the assay on the analyzer.
• Monitor the progress of the assay to ensure there are no
instrument errors or malfunctions.
• Document any anomalies or instrument alerts encountered during
the run.
5.2.4 Post-Analysis:
• Carefully remove the samples, calibrators, and QC materials from
the analyzer.
• Store any remaining serum specimens at -20°C for any repeat
testing if required.
5.3 Result Review and Verification:
• The analyzer automatically generates results for Vitamin B12 and
Folate concentrations.
• Review all results for consistency and acceptability based on QC
performance.
• Any values outside the acceptable limits must be rechecked and
validated.
• Critical values must be double-checked and promptly reported to
the attending physician.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
6.1 Quality Control Materials:
• Use the QC materials (both positive and negative controls)
provided with or recommended for use with the assay.
• QC materials stored at 2-8°C and prepared as per manufacturer
specifications.
6.2 QC Procedure:
• Perform quality control checks with every assay run.
• Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range.
• In case of QC failure, troubleshoot the issue following the
manufacturer’s guidelines, and repeat the assay as necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
Refer to the laboratory’s protocol for reporting results, including
necessary documentation on the LIS systems. Flag any critical or
abnormal results for immediate attention.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Vitamin B12:
• Normal Range: 200 - 950 pg/mL
• Low: < 200 pg/mL
• High: > 950 pg/mL
Folate:
• Normal Range: 3.1 - 20.5 ng/mL
• Low: < 3.1 ng/mL
• High: > 20.5 ng/mL
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia in the samples can interfere with
the assay.
• Vitamin B12 and Folate degradation may occur if samples are not
promptly processed and stored correctly.
1. REFERENCES:
• Instrument manuals and package inserts for Vitamin B12 and
Folate reagents.
• Consult relevant scientific literature and regulatory guidelines for
additional information on handling and processing serum for
Vitamin B12 and Folate assays.
Document the procedure regularly following any updates or revisions,
and ensure all laboratory staff are adequately trained in any changes
to the method or protocols.
