STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Vitamin B12 Assay, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the determination of Vitamin
B12 levels in serum samples. This SOP aims to ensure accuracy,
precision, and consistent results in the measurement of Vitamin B12.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel responsible
for the analytical phase of Vitamin B12 assays in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible for
performing the assay as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with this procedure and
to address any issues or discrepancies that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred specimen: Serum obtained from a clotted blood sample.
• Collect 3-5 mL of blood in a red or gold top tube (serum separator
tube).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes
but not longer than 1 hour.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1100-1300 g for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum.
Specimen storage:
• Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C if analyses are performed
within 8 hours of collection.
• For longer storage, serum can be frozen at –20°C or colder. Avoid
multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Siemens Advia Centaur)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Traceable thermometer (for monitoring storage temperatures)
Reagents:
• Vitamin B12 assay reagent kits (specific to the immunoassay
analyzer being used)
• Quality control materials (commercially available with defined
levels of Vitamin B12)
• Calibrators (traceable to international standards)
• Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and quality
controls are run and fall within acceptable ranges.
2. Prepare reagents and materials according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Verify that all reagents are within expiration and have been
stored properly.
B. Sample Processing:
1. Identify patient specimens and label appropriately.
2. If serum samples are frozen, thaw at room temperature and mix
gently by inverting the tube.
3. Load patient specimens, controls, and calibrators onto the
analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
C. Instrument Operation:
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for running the Vitamin B12
assay. Refer to the specific analyzer’s user manual for detailed
instructions.
2. Perform the assay by loading the analyzer with the required
number of samples, reagents, controls, and calibrators.
3. Verify that the analyzer runs appropriately and monitor for any
errors or flags during the assay.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, after
each calibration, and whenever reagent lots are changed.
2. Ensure that quality control results fall within the manufacturer’s
specified ranges before reporting patient results.
3. Document all quality control results in the QC log.
E. Result Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
2. Compare assay results with patient historical data, if available,
to identify any anomalies.
3. Verify, and if necessary, validate the results before reporting.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Transmit results from the analyzer to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review results for any critical values that need immediate
attention or action (e.g., values indicating severe deficiency).
3. Report non-critical results following standard laboratory
procedures and timelines.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference intervals for Vitamin B12 levels:
• Normal range: 200-900 pg/mL
• Deficiency: <200 pg/mL
• Possible deficiency: 200-300 pg/mL
8. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Hemolysis: Avoid hemolysis as it can interfere with the assay
results. If hemolysis is suspected, a repeat collection may be
necessary.
2. Lipemia/ Icterus: These conditions can affect the assay. If
detected, report with a disclaimer or repeat the test.
3. Interfering substances: Certain medications or intrinsic
factors may affect Vitamin B12 levels. Consult the reagent
insert for known interferences.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Assay should not be used as the sole basis for clinical diagnosis.
Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic tests.
• Any kit-specific limitations or interferences are specified by the
manufacturer and should be reviewed regularly.
10. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions and package inserts
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
11. DOCUMENTATION:
Ensure proper documentation of assay runs, including:
• Patient identification
• Run times and dates
• Quality control results
• Calibration data
• Maintenance logs for equipment
• Corrective actions taken (if any)
12. REVISION HISTORY:
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or when changes in
procedures or equipment occur.
