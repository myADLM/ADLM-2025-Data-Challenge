Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Vitamin B12, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and efficient determination
of vitamin B12 levels in plasma specimens in the laboratory. This
SOP ensures consistent, reliable, and reproducible results that aid in
the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency and associated clinical
conditions.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP.
Designated staff are responsible for performing, documenting,
reviewing results, and carrying out quality control measures as
specified in this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
- Plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
- Minimum volume of 1 mL plasma.
- Specimens should be centrifuged, and plasma separated within 2 hours of collection.
- Plasma specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 72 hours or frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA or heparinized tubes.
- Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
- Specimens that do not have collection time or date indicated.
- Specimens that are not centrifuged and plasma separated within 2 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Automated chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
Roche Cobas e411)
◦ Vitamin B12 reagent kit (procure specific manufacturer's kit
insert for detailed reagent information)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to vitamin B12 assay
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
- Ensure all reagents and controls have not expired.
- Calibrate the analyzer according to manufacturer instructions using vitamin B12 calibrators.
- Perform quality control checks prior to running patient specimens.
Testing:
1. Verify specimen integrity and acceptability according to the criteria specified in section 2.
2. Apply the barcode label to the specimen tube if not already done.
3. Load the specimen into the analyzer according to manufacturer's instructions.
4. Select the vitamin B12 assay protocol on the analyzer.
5. Start the analytical run and monitor the process until completion.
Result Interpretation:
- Review results generated by the analyzer for validity.
- Compare patient results with established reference intervals.
Reference Intervals:
- Normal range:
- Adults: 200 - 900 pg/mL
- Children: Reference intervals may differ, refer to age-specific reference values
Quality Control:
- Run control samples (low, normal, and high vitamin B12) with each batch and document results.
- Ensure control results are within acceptable ranges before validating patient results.
- If control results are not within acceptable ranges, re-run controls and patient samples if necessary.
Reporting Results:
1. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) automatically if interfaced.
2. Review and verify results in LIS.
3. Report verified results following site-specific reporting guidelines.
Critical Values:
- Vitamin B12 levels below 200 pg/mL are considered low and may indicate deficiency requiring clinical intervention.
- Contact the ordering physician immediately if critical values detected.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific reagent kit insert for limitations on the individual
reagent components and potential interferences.
