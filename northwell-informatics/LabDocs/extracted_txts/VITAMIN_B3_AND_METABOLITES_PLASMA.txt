Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for VITAMIN B3 AND
METABOLITES, PLASMA
1. Purpose:
To provide a consistent and reliable method for the analytical phase
of generating results for Vitamin B3 (Niacin) and its metabolites in
plasma.
2. Scope:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
and reporting of Vitamin B3 and its metabolites in plasma samples.
3. Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that the analysis is performed accurately and in accordance
with this SOP. The laboratory manager or supervisor is responsible
for overseeing the process and ensuring compliance.
4. Definitions:
Vitamin B3 (Niacin): A water-soluble vitamin that is part of the
vitamin B complex found in food and used as a dietary supplement.
Metabolites: These may include nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and
their respective metabolites within the plasma.
5. Equipment and Supplies:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or LC-
MS/MS
• Plasma separation tubes (PST) with EDTA
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagent grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, methanol)
• Standard solutions for Vitamin B3 and its metabolites
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
• Data analysis software
6. Reagents:
• Acetonitrile (HPLC grade)
• Methanol (HPLC grade)
• Distilled Water
• Ammonium acetate buffer
• Calibration standards for Vitamin B3 and metabolites
• QC materials
7. Procedure:
A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards for Vitamin B3 and its metabolites
at multiple concentration levels in plasma.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations in plasma.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature if frozen.
2. Vortex each sample to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette an appropriate volume (typically 200-500 µL) of plasma
sample into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add equal volume of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
5. Vortex samples for 30 seconds.
6. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
7. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new clean tube without
disturbing the pellet.
C. Instrument Setup and Method:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to
manufacturer recommendations.
2. Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase (ammonium
acetate buffer and acetonitrile/methanol mixture).
3. Load the prepared standards, QC samples, and plasma
samples onto the system.
4. Set the detection method based on the specific metabolites
being tested.
◦ Typical detection parameters may include:
▪ Niacin detection at a specific wavelength (e.g., 262 nm
for HPLC)
▪ Mass-to-charge ratios for LC-MS/MS
5. Run a blank sample to ensure no carry-over or contamination
before running standards or samples.
D. Data Analysis and Quality Control:
1. Analyze the chromatograms or spectra generated by HPLC or
LC-MS/MS.
2. Ensure the retention times and peak shapes match the
calibration standards for accurate identification of compounds.
3. Use the calibration curve to quantify the concentration of
Vitamin B3 and its metabolites in each sample.
4. Evaluate the QC samples to confirm the accuracy and precision
of the analysis.
◦ Results within ±20% of the nominal values for QC samples
are considered acceptable.
5. If there are discrepancies, review sample preparation,
calibration, and instrument performance and repeat the analysis
if necessary.
8. Reporting Results:
1. Report the concentrations of Vitamin B3 and metabolites in
plasma (e.g., in ng/mL).
2. Review the results and ensure all QC criteria are met before
result verification.
3. Enter approved results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Include any comments on sample integrity or analysis issues if
necessary.
9. Quality Control:
1. Perform periodic calibration and maintenance of HPLC/LC-MS/
MS equipment.
2. Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
3. Document all QC results and corrective actions taken if any
issues arise.
4. Ensure compliance with CLIA standards and laboratory quality
assurance protocols.

11. Review and Revision:
This SOP should be reviewed and revised annually or more
frequently if necessary, to ensure compliance with new regulations or
improvements in methodology.
