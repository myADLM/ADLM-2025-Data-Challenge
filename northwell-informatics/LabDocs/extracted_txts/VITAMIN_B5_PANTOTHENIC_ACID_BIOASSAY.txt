Standard Operating Procedure for the Measurement of Vitamin
B5 (Pantothenic Acid) by Bioassay
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required to
accurately measure Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) in serum and
plasma samples using a bioassay method. This protocol ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability in reporting Vitamin B5 levels.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The responsibility for implementing and following this SOP lies with
all designated laboratory personnel performing the vitamin B5
bioassay. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to the SOP and training personnel.
3. PRINCIPLE
The bioassay involves the growth response of a Vitamin B5-
dependent microorganism to the plasma or serum sample. The
degree of microorganism growth is directly proportional to the
concentration of Vitamin B5 in the sample.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum: 3-5 mL sample collected in a red-top tube without
anticoagulants.
• Plasma: 3-5 mL sample collected in a green-top heparin tube.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Lipemic samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulants that may interfere with the
assay.
• Samples collected in inappropriate tubes or those with incorrect
labeling.
Storage and Stability:
• Samples should be analyzed as soon as possible.
• If storage is necessary, samples should be kept at -20°C and can
be stored for up to one month.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Standard Vitamin B5 solution (for creating calibration curve).
• Vitamin B5-dependent microorganism culture.
• Bioassay media (specific to the microorganism used).
• Test tubes/microplates.
• Incubator set to the optimal temperature for the microorganism.
• Spectrophotometer or plate reader capable of measuring optical
density at appropriate wavelength (typically 600 nm).
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Standards and Samples:
1. Prepare a series of Vitamin B5 standards with known
concentrations (e.g., 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 ng/mL) for the
calibration curve.
2. Treat samples by adding an equal volume of bioassay medium
to the sample volume, typically 200 µL each.
3. Add appropriate volume of each standard and sample to test
tubes or microplate wells.
Inoculation:
1. Inoculate the bioassay medium containing samples and
standards with the Vitamin B5-dependent microorganism.
2. Incubate under optimal culture conditions (e.g., 37°C for 18-24
hours).
Measurement of Growth Response:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) at 600 nm using a
spectrophotometer or plate reader. This determines the extent
of the microorganism’s growth.
2. Plot the OD values of the standards to generate the standard
curve.
Calculation of Results:
1. Use the standard curve to determine the Vitamin B5
concentration in the samples.
2. Ensure the absorbance values for samples fall within the linear
range of the standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control (QC) samples with known concentrations of
Vitamin B5 alongside test samples.
2. Follow appropriate protocol for QC sample preparation.
3. Ensure QC results fall within established acceptable ranges
before accepting results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter data and calculated results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Verify and review results according to laboratory protocols.
3. Report any significantly abnormal findings immediately to the
clinician or designated authority.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If QC results fall outside of acceptable range, verify reagent
preparation, instrument calibration, and assay conditions.
2. Re-run samples, standards, and QC if issues persist.
3. Document and report any deviations from procedures,
unexpected results, or equipment malfunction.
10. REFERENCES
Include references to any established guidelines, manuals, or
publications related to this assay, such as those provided by the
Bioassay media and microorganism culture suppliers.
11. EQUIPMENT AND MAINTENANCE
Ensure regular calibration and maintenance of spectrophotometer/
plate reader and other equipment used in this assay according to
manufacturer's guidelines.
12. SAFETY AND HANDLING
1. Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols when handling
biological specimens and reagents.
2. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (lab coat,
gloves, safety glasses).
3. Dispose of all biohazardous materials in compliance with
laboratory safety standards.
This SOP provides an outline for the measurement of Vitamin B5
using bioassay techniques. Adhering strictly to these steps ensures
high-quality, reliable, and accurate results are generated for clinical
and research purposes.
