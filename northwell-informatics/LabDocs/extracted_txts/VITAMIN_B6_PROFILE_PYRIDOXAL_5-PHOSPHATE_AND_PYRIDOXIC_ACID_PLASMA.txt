Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Vitamin B6 Profile (Pyridoxal 5-
Phosphate and Pyridoxic Acid) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the accurate and precise
quantification of Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (PLP) and Pyridoxic Acid
(PA) in plasma samples.
Responsibility:
Designated medical laboratory scientists are responsible for following
this SOP to ensure reliable results. It is imperative to adhere to this
procedure to ensure consistent and valid assessments of Vitamin B6
levels in plasma.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all personnel conducting Vitamin B6 profile
analysis within the laboratory.
1. PROCEDURES
A) Preparation of Equipment and Reagents
1. Ensure the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
system is calibrated and functional.
2. Verify that all standards, reagents, and solvents are within
expiry dates.
3. Prepare mobile phase solvent as per manufacturer's guidelines.
4. Filter the mobile phase solvent through a 0.45 µm filter before
use.
5. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples.
B) Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Acceptable: Plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
◦ Unacceptable: Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or
collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes.
2. Aliquot 0.5 mL of plasma sample into labeled centrifuge tubes.
3. Centrifuge specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
4. Transfer the supernatant into clean, labeled vials.
5. Store plasma samples at -20°C until ready for analysis.
C) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards covering the expected range of
PLP and PA concentrations.
2. Perform quality control using commercially available control
material.
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) at the
beginning and end of each run.
3. Validate calibration curves with a minimum of five standards
(two replicates each).
D) Analytical Procedure
1. Inject blank (mobile phase) into the HPLC to verify the absence
of contamination.
◦ Run-time and method parameters as per manufacturer's
specifications.
2. Inject calibration standards and verify correct retention times
and peak shapes.
3. Inject quality controls to confirm system suitability.
4. Inject sample plasmas in sequence.
◦ Each injection should include an internal standard if
applicable.
◦ Record the peak area and retention time of each analyte.
5. Analyze peaks and calculate concentrations using the
calibration curve.
E) Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Calculate concentrations of PLP and PA from peak areas using
validated calibration curves.
2. Review the quality control results to confirm assay
performance.
3. Verify and transmit results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Document results according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
F) Quality Control and Maintenance
1. Perform instrument maintenance as per manufacturer's
recommendations.
2. Run laboratory control samples with each batch of patient
specimens to ensure accuracy.
3. Record any deviations or instrument issues in the maintenance
log and troubleshoot as necessary.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (PLP): 5-50 ng/mL
• Pyridoxic Acid (PA): 2-20 ng/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with assay results.
3. Ensure avoidance of sample contamination and degradation.
