Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for VITAMIN B7, H (BIOTIN)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the analysis of Vitamin B7 (Biotin) in clinical specimens. This ensures
consistent, accurate, and reliable results in compliance with CLIA
regulations.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top (no additive) or SST (serum
separator tube).
Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL of plasma collected in lithium heparin, EDTA, or heparinized
vacutainer (dark green or PST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Grossly hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride/oxalate, or sodium citrate
tubes
• Specimens with significant clot or improper labeling
Specimen Stability and Storage:
• Store serum/plasma specimens at 2–8°C if not analyzed within 8
hours of collection.
• For extended storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Mass Spectrometry (MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample tubes and racks
• Disposable gloves
• Calibrated Biotin standards
• Mobile phase reagents (HPLC grade)
4. REAGENTS
• Vitamin B7 (Biotin) assay kit (manufacturer specific)
• Mobile phase solvents: Methanol, Water, Acetonitrile
• Calibration standards (traceable)
• Quality control materials (Kenlor Industries or equivalent)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is clean and functional before analysis.
• Set up HPLC or MS system according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Prepare mobile phase solvents and calibration standards.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge collected blood samples at 2000-2500 RPM for
10-15 minutes to separate serum/plasma.
2. Transfer serum/plasma into appropriately labeled tubes.
3. If frozen, allow samples to thaw at room temperature.
4. Aliquot the sample, 2 mL for HPLC/MS analysis
C) Analysis:
1. Vortex mix the sample briefly.
2. Load the sample into the HPLC or MS system.
3. Input the parameters for Vitamin B7 analysis as specified by the
assay kit inserts.
4. Start the analytical run and monitor the system for any
abnormalities.
D) Calibration and Quality Control:
• Run calibration standards at the beginning, middle, and end of
each batch.
• Perform quality control checks with positive and negative controls,
recording values.
• Acceptable ranges for quality control must comply with
manufacturer guidelines.
E) Data Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Verify that the system-generated data meets acceptable criteria
before releasing results.
2. Review calibration and quality control results for the batch.
3. Utilize laboratory information system (LIS) to report validated
results.
4. In case of abnormal results, re-testing may be conducted based
on predefined guidelines.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If an analyte fails, consult HPLC/MS manual for guidance.
• Use traceable recommended calibration standards for verification.
• Inform the supervisor of any persistent issues affecting test
results.
• Document all troubleshooting steps taken.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use two levels of QC materials: Negative QC and Positive QC.
• Follow storage and preparation guidelines for QC materials.
• Record QC results as per the site-specific guidelines in the
laboratory logbook.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Use gloves and personal protective equipment at all times.
• Dispose of waste following biohazard protocols.
• Avoid direct skin contact with reagents and solvents.
• Ensure good ventilation within the laboratory.
