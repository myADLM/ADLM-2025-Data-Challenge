Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for VITAMIN D, 25-HYDROXY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy levels in serum or plasma
samples using automated immunoassay analyzers or other suitable
analytical instruments.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure accurate and reliable results. All designated personnel
are required to adhere to quality control standards and troubleshoot
any issues according to this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a plain red-top
tube or plasma collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. Samples collected in tubes with anticoagulants
other than those specified.
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Room Temperature: 24 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C or below): 30 days
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott Architect,
Roche Elecsys)
◦ Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy reagent kit (specific to the instrument
in use)
◦ Calibrators and Controls provided by the reagent
manufacturer
◦ Sample tubes and pipettes
◦ Centrifuge for sample preparation
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verify the specimen type and integrity. Reject
unacceptable samples and document reasons.
2. Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to obtain a clear serum or plasma sample.
3. Aliquot serum or plasma into appropriately labeled
secondary tubes if necessary.
B. Instrument Preparation
1. Turn on the analyzer and allow it to complete its self-
checks and initializations.
2. Load Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy reagent kits, calibrators, and
controls onto the analyzer as per manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Verify that all reagents are within their expiration dates.
4. Perform daily maintenance and calibration according to
the instrument's maintenance protocol.
C. Analysis
1. Load the prepared samples into the designated sample
racks or sample entry point of the analyzer.
2. Ensure that the patient and sample identification are
correctly entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Start the run and monitor the analyzer for any error
prompts or alerts during the process.
4. Upon completion, review the results generated by the
analyzer.
D. Quality Control
1. Run the quality control materials at the beginning of each
shift or batch and after any critical maintenance or
recalibration of the instrument.
2. Review and document the control results to ensure they
are within acceptable ranges defined by the manufacturer.
3. If any control results fall outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's guidelines
and rerun the controls before proceeding with patient
samples.
E. Result Verification and Reporting
1. Verify all results by cross-checking with quality control
data and instrument flags.
2. Evaluate any outliers or results falling outside the
reference ranges and rerun the sample if necessary.
3. Submit the verified results to the LIS for documentation
and further clinical interpretation.
4. For critical or significantly abnormal results, follow the
lab's protocol for urgent communication to the requesting
clinician.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy Level:
▪ Deficiency: <20 ng/mL (<50 nmol/L)
▪ Insufficiency: 20–29 ng/mL (50–74 nmol/L)
▪ Sufficiency: 30–100 ng/mL (75–250 nmol/L)
▪ Toxicity: >100 ng/mL (>250 nmol/L)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use commercially available quality control materials to
ensure assay accuracy and precision.
◦ Run at least two levels of controls (normal and abnormal)
with each batch of samples.
◦ Document all control results and take corrective actions if
control runs are outside of the specified acceptance criteria.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer's instrument manual for
troubleshooting common issues. In case of persistent problems,
contact the technical support team of the instrument
manufacturer.
7. REFERENCE
◦ Manufacturer’s reagent kit insert and user manual for
Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy assay.
◦ Current laboratory quality control guidelines.
Documentation Changes: All changes to this SOP must be
reviewed and approved by the laboratory supervisor or designee.
Note: Adherence to biosafety and handling guidelines will be
maintained rigorously to prevent any personal, environmental, or
cross-specimen contamination.
