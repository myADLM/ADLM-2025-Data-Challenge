Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Vitamin E, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the proper procedures for
performing the analytical phase of generating results for Vitamin E
levels in serum samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This is
essential to ensure accurate and reliable Vitamin E measurements,
which are critical for diagnosing and monitoring various medical
conditions.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to the
specified procedures and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the
test results. It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to report any
inconsistencies or errors to a supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the measurement of Vitamin E (Alpha-
Tocopherol) levels in serum samples using High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC).
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Preferably fasting sample collected in red-stopper or
serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens in non-serum collection tubes such as EDTA, heparin
or citrate.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ HPLC system with UV detector
◦ Analytical Balance
◦ Serological Pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex Mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Water Bath or heating block set at 40°C
◦ Glassware (volumetric flasks, test tubes, etc.)
◦ Solvents: Methanol, Hexane, Anhydrous Sodium Sulfate
◦ Standards and Controls: Vitamin E Standard, Internal
Standard (Tocol)
◦ Reagent Kit (if available): Reagent preparation as per kit
insert.
2. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare mobile phase (Methanol, Water, and Ethanol
mixture) as per the standard operating concentration.
◦ Prepare the internal standard solution of Tocol using the
analytical balance.
2. Equipment Setup:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure the UV detector is set to the appropriate wavelength
(usually 292 nm).
B. Sample Preparation
1. Sample Identification:
◦ Confirm the identification and integrity of serum samples.
◦ Centrifuge the blood collection tubes at 1500 g for 10
minutes immediately upon receipt. Transfer the serum to
clean labeled tubes.
2. Extraction Procedure:
◦ Pipette 200 µL of serum into a clean test tube.
◦ Add 100 µL of internal standard solution (Tocol) to each
sample.
◦ Vortex the serum samples for 1 minute to ensure thorough
mixing.
◦ Add 1.0 mL of Hexane and vortex again for 2 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 1500 g for 5 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the upper (organic) layer to a new test
tube, avoiding the aqueous layer.
C. HPLC Analysis
1. Injection:
◦ Using auto-sampler or manual injection, inject 20 µL of the
prepared sample into the HPLC system.
2. Chromatography:
◦ Run the standard and control samples following the same
procedure to ensure calibration and validation.
◦ Ensure the system is running stable mobile phase and
monitor the retention time for the Vitamin E peak.
3. Quantitation:
◦ Calculate the Vitamin E concentration using the peak area
ratio of Vitamin E to the internal standard.
◦ Compare the sample peak areas to the standard curve for
quantitation.
D. Quality Control
1. Controls:
◦ Run low, medium, and high-quality control standards at the
beginning and end of each batch or as specified by lab
policy.
◦ Verify control results are within acceptable ranges prior to
reporting patient results.
2. Troubleshooting and Maintenance:
◦ If any control standards fall outside acceptable ranges,
review and reprocess samples as necessary.
◦ Perform maintenance and troubleshooting of the HPLC
system as needed following manufacturer guidelines.
E. Reporting Results
1. Review and Verification:
◦ Technologists must review the generated data for
correctness and ensure adherence to quality control checks.
◦ Verify the integrity of sample and result consistency prior to
result entry.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Include any pertinent comments if technical issues or
deviations occurred.
3. REFERENCE RANGES
Expected normal ranges for Vitamin E:
• Adults: 5.5 - 17 µg/mL
• Reference ranges may vary; refer to the kit insert or literature
sources.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed or severely lipemic samples may interfere with
accurate measurements.
◦ Adhere to standard sample handling procedures to ensure
sample quality.
2. REFERENCES
◦ HPLC system user manual.
◦ Vitamin E Standard Product Insert.
◦ Relevant Clinical Laboratory Standards (CLSI guidelines).
This concludes the Standard Operating Procedure for measuring
Vitamin E in serum samples using HPLC. All laboratory personnel
must be familiar with and adhere to this procedure to ensure reliable
and accurate test results.
