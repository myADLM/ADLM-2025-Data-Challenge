Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Vitamin K1, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed procedure for the accurate
and precise analysis of Vitamin K1 levels in serum samples.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform,
document, and validate the analysis of Vitamin K1.
• Staff must follow all safety and quality control procedures as
outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION Vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is a fat-
soluble vitamin essential for the synthesis of proteins involved
in blood clotting.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred specimen: Serum (collected in a red or gold top tube).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 8 hours at room
temperature and up to 14 days when refrigerated at 2-8°C. For
long-term storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Containers without proper labeling (patient identification,
collection date and time).
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
etc.).
• Samples received beyond the stability period without appropriate
storage conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Calibrators and internal standards specific for Vitamin K1
analysis.
• Quality control materials: Known concentrations at two levels (low
and high).
• Mobile phase solvents: Methanol, acetonitrile, water (HPLC/LC-
MS grade).
• Solid phase or liquid-liquid extraction cartridges (depending on
the extraction method used).
• Centrifuge, vortex mixer, pipettes, and glassware.
1. PROCEDURE A. Serum Sample Preparation: - Centrifuge
blood collection tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum. - Transfer 1 mL of serum into a clean glass or
polypropylene tube.
B. Extraction: - Add appropriate volume of internal standard to
the serum sample. - Perform either solid phase or liquid-liquid
extraction as per method SOP. - If using solid phase extraction
(SPE): o Condition the SPE cartridge with methanol, followed
by water. o Apply the serum sample to the cartridge. o Wash
the cartridge with water followed by methanol. o Elute Vitamin
K1 with an appropriate solvent (e.g., hexane). - If using liquid-
liquid extraction (LLE): o Add extraction solvent (e.g., hexane)
to the serum sample. o Mix thoroughly and centrifuge to
separate layers. o Transfer the upper organic layer to a new
tube. - Dry the extracted solvent under nitrogen or vacuum.
C. HPLC/LC-MS/MS Analysis: - Reconstitute the dried residue
in mobile phase solvent (as specified in the instrument's
method). - Inject an aliquot of the reconstituted sample into the
HPLC or LC-MS/MS system. - Run analysis according to the
instrument's operating parameters. - Utilize appropriate
calibration curves and internal standards for quantification.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials (low and high levels) at the
beginning and end of each batch of samples to ensure accuracy
and precision.
• Record quality control results and take corrective actions if any
values fall outside of acceptable ranges.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the HPLC/LC-MS/
MS system as per manufacturer instructions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) from the instrument.
• Technologist must review and verify results in the LIS before
releasing.
• Critical values (if any) must be communicated to a designated
healthcare provider immediately and documented as per
laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be determined based on the
laboratory’s population data or provided by assay kit
manufacturer.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that patients do not consume Vitamin K1 supplements
prior to sample collection to avoid skewed results.
• Cross-reactivity with other vitamin K derivatives and analogs
should be defined and considered when interpreting results.
1. REFERENCES
• Instrument manufacturer's operating manual.
• Peer-reviewed journals and articles related to Vitamin K1 analysis
by HPLC/LC-MS/MS.
• Relevant clinical laboratory guidelines and standards.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the reliable
and consistent analysis of Vitamin K1 levels in serum samples,
providing vital information for patient diagnosis and care.
