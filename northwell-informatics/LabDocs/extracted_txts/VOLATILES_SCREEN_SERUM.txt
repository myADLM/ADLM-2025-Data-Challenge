Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Volatiles Screen,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of volatile compounds in serum samples. This includes alcohols
(ethanol, methanol, isopropanol), acetone, and other volatile organic
substances. This information is critical for diagnosing various
conditions, such as poisoning or metabolic disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated staff to follow this SOP when
performing volatiles screening to ensure accurate and reliable
results. Quality control measures must be followed, and any issues
identified during the procedure should be reported to a supervisor
immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A) Specimen Collection:
• Preferred/acceptable specimens include venous blood collected
in glass tubes without anticoagulants or preservatives.
• Blood specimens should be allowed to clot and be centrifuged to
obtain serum.
• Specimens should be collected and stored in sealed, air-tight
glass containers to prevent the loss of volatile compounds.
B) Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples collected in plastic containers.
• Specimens with evidence of hemolysis or contamination.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled with the patient's
identification information and collection date/time.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph (GC) with flame ionization detector (FID)
• Serum separator tubes (SSTs)
• Glass storage vials with airtight seals
• Headspace sampler (if available)
• Calibration standards for ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and
acetone
• Quality control material for volatiles
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Calibration:
1. Ensure the gas chromatograph is set up and in optimal working
conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare calibration standards for ethanol, methanol,
isopropanol, and acetone at known concentrations.
3. Calibrate the GC system using the prepared standards.
Calibration curves should include multiple concentrations to
ensure accuracy across the detection range.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum samples to come to room temperature before
analysis.
2. If using a headspace sampler, place an aliquot of serum into a
headspace vial and seal it immediately.
3. For direct injection, carefully transfer a measured volume of
serum into a glass vial and seal it immediately.
C) Analysis:
1. Inject the prepared serum samples into the gas chromatograph.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for injection volume and
method.
2. Ensure that all sample and standard injections are performed in
duplicate to confirm reproducibility and accuracy.
3. Record the retention times and peak areas for the analytes of
interest as they elute from the column.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Quality Control Measures:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each analytical run.
2. Compare quality control results against established acceptance
criteria. If the QC results fall outside acceptable limits,
investigate and rectify the issue before proceeding with the
analysis.
3. Maintain detailed records of all quality control activities,
including lot numbers of control materials and calibration
standards.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Calculate the concentration of volatiles in each serum sample
using the calibration curve generated during the calibration
phase.
2. Document all results, including any calculations performed.
Verify results for accuracy before reporting.
3. Transmit the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and verification by the responsible technologist.
8. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
Reference Intervals:
• Ethanol: Negative (<10 mg/dL)
• Methanol: Negative (<5 mg/dL)
• Isopropanol: Negative (<5 mg/dL)
• Acetone: Negative (<5 mg/dL)
Any result that falls outside of the reference intervals should be
considered significant and reported as such. Consult with clinical staff
as necessary for interpretation and further action.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are handled properly to avoid evaporation of
volatile compounds.
• Contaminated or improperly stored samples may yield inaccurate
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other volatile substances present in the
sample may interfere with results.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for use of gas chromatograph and
headspace sampler.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for blood
gas and pH analysis.

biological fluids.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate, reliable, and timely reporting of volatile screens in serum
samples. Document any deviations from this SOP and consult a
supervisor for guidance.
