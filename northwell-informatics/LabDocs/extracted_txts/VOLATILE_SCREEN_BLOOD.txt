Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Volatile Screen, Blood
(Analytical Phase)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for conducting a
volatile screen on blood specimens. This will ensure the accurate and
efficient detection of volatile substances such as ethanol, methanol,
isopropanol, and acetone using gas chromatography.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in a gray-top
potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride vacutainer.
◦ Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL.
◦ Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 14 days when
refrigerated at 2-8°C. Specimens can also be frozen at
-20°C for up to 1 month.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Gas Chromatograph (equipped with a Flame Ionization
Detector)
◦ Autosampler
◦ Headspace vials with septum caps
◦ Internal standard solution (e.g., n-propanol)
◦ High purity carrier gas (e.g., Helium)
◦ Certified reference standards for ethanol, methanol,
isopropanol, and acetone
◦ Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
◦ Prepare certified reference standards for each volatile
component at known concentrations.
◦ Prepare positive and negative control samples.
◦ Prepare an internal standard solution using n-propanol.
B. Sample Preparation:
◦ Aliquot 0.5 mL of the blood specimen into a headspace vial.
◦ Add 0.1 mL of the internal standard solution to the vial.
◦ Seal the vial with a septum cap.
◦ Prepare calibration standards and quality controls in the
same manner.
C. Instrument Setup:
◦ Calibrate the gas chromatograph according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load headspace vials into the autosampler.
◦ Program the autosampler to inject a specific volume of
vapor from each vial into the gas chromatograph.
D. Chromatographic Conditions:
◦ Carrier Gas: Helium
◦ Injector Temperature: 200°C
◦ Oven Temperature Program:
▪ Initial Temperature: 40°C
▪ Hold for 2 minutes
▪ Ramp at 10°C/min to 200°C
▪ Hold for 5 minutes
◦ Detector Temperature: 250°C
◦ Injection Volume: Defined by instrument parameters
◦ Run Time: Approximately 20 minutes
E. Analysis:
◦ Analyze calibration standards to establish a calibration
curve for each volatile substance.
◦ Analyze quality control materials to ensure the performance
of the method.
◦ Analyze the patient samples to detect and quantify the
volatile compounds.
4. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
◦ Integrate chromatograms and quantify the volatile
compounds using the calibration curve.
◦ Ensure the internal standard peak area is consistent across
all samples.
◦ Verify positive results using quality control material and
instrument performance criteria.
◦ Review and report the results according to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and
end of each batch of samples.
◦ Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable
ranges.
◦ Recalibrate the instrument if quality control results fall
outside the acceptable range.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify and validate results in the LIS before release.
◦ Notify the appropriate parties of any critical values according
to the procedure.
7. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the
analysis of volatile compounds.
◦ Proper specimen collection and handling are critical to
ensure the stability of the analytes.
