Standard Operating Procedure for Volatile Screen, Chain of
Custody, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To establish the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results
for volatile screen, while ensuring chain of custody (COC)
requirements are maintained.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the analysis,
documentation, and reporting of volatile screens performed on blood
specimens. It is their duty to follow chain of custody procedures to
maintain the integrity of the specimen and results.
1. DEFINITION
Volatile substances: Ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetone, and
other volatile organic compounds that can be present in a blood
specimen.
Chain of Custody (COC): A procedure to document the handling of
the specimen from the point of collection, through the analytical
process, to the final disposition of the specimen. This ensures that
the specimen has not been tampered with or otherwise
compromised.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Blood samples must be collected in gray-top tubes containing
potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride to preserve the integrity of the
volatile compounds.
• The specimen should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as
possible. If there is a delay, the sample should be refrigerated at
2-8°C.
Chain of Custody:
• Each sample must be accompanied by a COC form, which is
signed and dated by each person handling the specimen.
• Ensure COC documentation is complete, accurate, and
accompanies the sample throughout all stages of transport and
analysis.
• Assign a unique identifier to each sample and its associated
documentation.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Headspace Gas Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS)
equipped with appropriate columns for volatile identification.
• Certified calibrators and controls for ethanol, methanol,
isopropanol, acetone, and any other volatiles to be analyzed.
• Serological pipettes and tips.
• Automated or manual sample preparation stations.
• Certified alcohol wipes and gloves.
Pre-Analytical Procedure:
1. Receive and log the specimen in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Verify the COC documentation, ensuring it is accurately filled
out and signed.
3. Store the specimen at 2-8°C until ready for analysis.
4. Perform a visual inspection of the specimen for any signs of
tampering or compromise.
Analytical Procedure:
1. Ensure all instruments are properly calibrated and quality
control checks are within acceptable limits prior to analysis.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples
according to manufacturer and laboratory guidelines.
3. Prepare the blood sample by transferring an aliquot to a
headspace vial using a calibrated serological pipette.
4. Seal the headspace vial with a crimp cap ensuring a tight fit to
prevent volatile loss.
5. Load the prepared vials into the headspace GC-MS
autosampler.
6. Analyze the samples using the headspace GC-MS method
specifically developed for volatiles. Ensure compliance with all
instrument parameters and settings as per SOP.
Post-Analytical Procedure:
1. Review all chromatograms and mass spectra for the presence
and quantification of volatiles.
2. Compare results against the calibration curve and verify that all
internal control results are within acceptable limits.
3. Document and interpret all findings, recording results in the LIS.
4. Ensure that the COC form is fully completed and that results
are linked to the specimen's unique identifier.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each batch to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Document all quality control results and take corrective actions
if any control results fall outside the established acceptable
limits.
Reporting Results:
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
technologist.
• Generate a report summarizing the findings and include all
relevant COC documentation.
• Reports should be securely transmitted to the requesting party
and copies maintained as per laboratory retention policies.
Sample Retention:
• Retain any tested samples and associated COC documents as
required by legal or regulatory guidelines.
• Store samples at 2-8°C for potential reanalysis or disputation
purposes.
References:
This procedure conforms to the laboratory’s established guidelines
and regulatory requirements, including manufacturer’s instructions for
the use of the GC-MS and associated reagents.
By adhering to this SOP, we ensure the reliability and integrity of the
volatile screen blood testing while maintaining rigorous chain of
custody documentation to support legal and clinical use of the
results.
