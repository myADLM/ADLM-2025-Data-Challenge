Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Volatile Screen, Chain of Custody,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for analyzing
urine samples for volatile compounds under chain of custody
conditions. This SOP ensures the integrity, accuracy, and
reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated personnel, who have been trained and are competent
in accordance with laboratory policies, will follow and document
procedures as defined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all personnel to report any deviations
from this protocol to their supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
• Volatile compounds: Substances such as ethanol, methanol,
isopropanol, and acetone are classified as volatile organic
compounds frequently found in forensic, clinical, and
employment-related toxicology screenings.
• Chain of Custody: A process to maintain and document the
chronological history of the sample from collection to reporting of
the results, ensuring sample integrity and legally defensible
results.
• Random: Refers to samples collected without prior notice to the
individual being tested.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph with Flame Ionization Detector (GC/FID) or
equivalent
• Headspace sampler or equivalent
• Certified reference standards for ethanol, methanol, isopropanol,
and acetone
• Internal standards (e.g., n-propanol)
• Control samples (positive and negative controls)
• Urine collection containers (with proper tamper-evident seals)
• Chain of custody forms and labels
• Vials and caps for headspace analysis
• Temperature-sensitive storage units (refrigerators)
1. PROCEDURE
A. SAMPLE RECEIPT AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY
1. Verify receipt of the sample and ensure all chain of custody
forms are properly filled and signed by all parties handling the
sample.
2. Check the integrity of the sample container and seals.
Document any discrepancies and notify the supervisor
immediately.
3. Label the samples with unique identification numbers if not
already done by the collection site.
4. Store the samples at 2-8°C in the designated refrigerator if
analysis is not immediately performed.
B. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Allow the urine samples to come to room temperature before
analysis.
2. Prepare working standards and quality control samples by
diluting certified reference standards in synthetic urine to cover
the expected concentration range.
3. Prepare samples for headspace analysis by transferring an
aliquot (e.g., 1-2 mL) of urine into headspace vials and adding
an appropriate amount of internal standard.
4. Cap the vials securely and ensure each vial is labeled with the
corresponding sample identification.
C. HEADSPACE SAMPLING AND GC/FID ANALYSIS
1. Load the vials into the headspace sampler according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set up the headspace sampler and GC/FID with validated
method parameters.
3. Run a series of blanks, standards, and controls to ensure the
system is operational and within acceptable performance
criteria.
4. Analyze the urine samples alongside control samples and
standards in a single run to ensure consistent analytical
conditions.
5. Document any deviations from the method and take appropriate
corrective actions if the system does not meet performance
criteria.
D. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
1. Using the GC/FID software, identify and quantify the volatile
compounds in the urine samples based on retention times and
peak areas.
2. Use the internal standard method to improve the precision and
accuracy of the quantification.
3. Compare the results with the quality control samples to validate
each analytical run. Investigate and document any deviations
and reanalyze affected samples if necessary.
4. Calculate the concentration of volatiles in the unknown
samples.
E. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Compile all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Review each result for accuracy and consistency with the
quality control data.
3. Verify and authorize the final results following the laboratory’s
standard verification procedures.
4. Document the chain of custody, including a detailed record of all
persons handling the samples and analyzing the results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
A. Internal Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Document and investigate any control failures before proceeding
with the analysis of patient samples.
B. External Quality Control
• Participate in external proficiency testing as per the laboratory’s
accreditation requirements.
