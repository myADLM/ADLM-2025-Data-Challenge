Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for VOLATILE SCREEN, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure aims to provide a standardized method for analyzing
volatile substances in random urine specimens. This ensures reliable
results, maintains quality control, and adheres to the testing protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Random urine sample
Specimen Volume:
• 10-20 mL of urine
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect random urine in a clean, leak-proof container.
• Label the container with patient identification, collection date, and
time.
Specimen Storage and Stability:
• Refrigerate samples at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Store samples in a secure area to prevent potential contamination
and ensure chain of custody.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection if not
refrigerated.
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens lacking proper identification and labeling.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument
• Disposable pipettes
• Volatile substances testing kits
Reagents:
• Certified reference standards for volatile substances
• Calibration curves
• Control materials for quality checks
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Verify all specimens are properly labeled and match the
accessioning records.
• Inspect specimens for any signs of contamination and suitability.
• Ensure the GC-MS instrument is calibrated and has undergone
necessary maintenance checks.
Analysis:
• Set up the GC-MS following the manufacturer’s instructions for
volatile substances analysis.
• Prepare calibration curves using certified reference standards for
volatile substances.
• Measure each urine sample using disposable pipettes to avoid
cross-contamination.
• Inject the urine sample into the GC-MS instrument and start the
analysis per the predetermined protocol.
• Monitor the instrument for any anomalies during the analysis
process.
Quality Control:
• Run control materials at the start of the day and after every 20
samples or batch to confirm the accuracy.
• Ensure calibration checks are performed daily using certified
reference standards.
• Record quality control results in a logbook along with date, time,
sample ID, and initials of the technologist.
Post-Analysis:
• Review the chromatograms and mass spectra generated by the
GC-MS.
• Compare peaks against reference standards to identify and
quantify volatile substances.
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and label any abnormal results per site-specific guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Report Format:
• Include patient details, collection date, and time.
• Provide quantitative values of identified volatile substances with
units.
• Include any necessary flags for abnormal or critical results.
Critical Results:
• Promptly notify the requester of any critical results per laboratory
policy and document the notification.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
Quality Assurance:
• Regular calibration and maintenance of GC-MS.
• Internal and external quality control checks.
• Continuing education for staff on updates related to volatile
substance analysis.
Method Limitations:
• Cross-reactivity and interferences should be checked using
reference materials.
• Samples with extremely low concentrations may require
advanced methods for accurate detection.
