Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
VOLATILE SCREEN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps necessary for the analysis and reporting of
volatile and toxic substances in serum samples. This protocol
ensures accurate identification and quantification of volatiles,
applying appropriate quality control measures, and correct handling
of specimens and equipment.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing and documenting all
analytical procedures as defined in this protocol. Supervisors must
ensure that staff are adequately trained and that the analysis is
performed and documented following this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Volatile screen refers to the analysis of serum samples for the
presence of volatile substances such as ethanol, methanol,
isopropanol, and acetone.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum from a blood sample collected in a
red-top (no anticoagulant) or SST tube.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed samples or samples with
significant clot formation.
Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure that the serum is free from clots and hemolysis. If
necessary, centrifuge the sample to separate serum from cells.
2. Label the serum samples appropriately with patient ID, date,
and time of collection.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Gas Chromatograph (GC) equipped with Flame Ionization
Detector (FID)
• Headspace auto-sampler (if applicable)
• Serum vials and appropriate caps
• Internal Standard Solution (e.g., n-propanol)
• Calibration Standards for ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and
acetone
• Quality Control (QC) materials
Steps:
1. Preparation of the GC System:
◦ Ensure that the GC system, including the column and
detector, is calibrated according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Perform a system suitability test using calibration standards
to ensure accurate and reliable performance.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Pipette a precise volume (typically 500 µL) of serum into a
headspace vial.
◦ Add an internal standard solution (typically n-propanol) to
each vial to ensure consistency and accuracy in
quantitation.
◦ Seal the vials securely with appropriate caps to prevent
sample loss.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared samples into the headspace auto-
sampler or manually inject the sample into the GC system.
◦ Set the GC parameters following the system’s operational
guidelines for volatiles analysis.
◦ Start the analysis run, ensuring that each sample undergoes
appropriate thermal treatment in the headspace auto-
sampler prior to GC injection.
◦ Monitor the chromatographic run to confirm peak separation
and identification.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the chromatographic data using appropriate
software.
◦ Quantify the concentrations of volatiles by comparing the
sample peak areas with the calibration standards.
◦ Ensure that all quality control checks (including calibration
verification and internal standard response) are within
acceptable limits before accepting the results.
Quality Control:
• Perform QC checks using known standards at the beginning,
middle, and end of each analytical run.
• Document any deviations from expected QC values and take
corrective actions as necessary before reporting results.
Reporting Results:
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
entry into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical results, such as elevated toxicant levels, must be
immediately reported to the appropriate healthcare provider as
per the established protocol.
Reference Intervals and Critical Values:
• Ethanol: 0-0.05 g/dL (legal intoxication limit in many regions >0.08
g/dL)
• Methanol, Isopropanol, Acetone: Typically undetectable in healthy
individuals
Method Limitations:
• Hemolysis or contamination of samples can affect the accuracy of
the volatile screen.
• Ensure proper sample collection and handling to avoid false
results.

Document Control:
• This SOP is effective as of [Date].
• Review and updates are to be carried out annually or as required,
with the next review due in [Month, Year].
This protocol ensures that the volatile screen for serum samples is
conducted consistently and accurately, maintaining the highest
standards of laboratory practice and patient safety.
