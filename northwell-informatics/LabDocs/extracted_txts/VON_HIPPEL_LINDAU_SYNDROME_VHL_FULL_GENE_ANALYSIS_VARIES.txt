Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for VHL Full Gene Analysis
Test: Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome (VHL) Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the full gene sequencing
analysis of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene to identify pathogenic
variants associated with VHL syndrome. It details analytical
procedures from DNA extraction to data interpretation, ensuring
accuracy and consistency in results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: 3-5 mL of whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
Specimen Handling:
• Store whole blood specimens at 2-8°C. Specimens should be
processed within 72 hours of collection. For longer storage,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C.
Specimen Stability:
• Whole blood specimens are stable at 2-8°C for 72 hours post-
collection.
• DNA extracted from blood can be stored at -20°C for extended
periods.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microcentrifuge and tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• DNA extraction kits/reagents (commercially available)
• Thermal cycler
• PCR reagents (including DNA polymerase, dNTPs, primers)
• Sequencing reagents (Sanger sequencing kit or NGS kit)
• Capillary electrophoresis or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
system
• Bioinformatics software for sequence analysis
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Whole Blood Specimen Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge whole blood at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate plasma and buffy coat.
◦ Transfer the buffy coat to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
2. Buffy Coat Processing:
◦ Add lysis buffer according to DNA extraction kit instructions.
◦ Incubate and perform additional steps as specified in the
protocol of the DNA extraction kit.
3. DNA Extraction:
◦ Obtain DNA using a commercial DNA extraction kit,
following the manufacturer's instruction carefully.
◦ Quantify and assess purity of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometer (A260/A280).
B. PCR Amplification of VHL Gene:
1. Design primers encompassing coding regions and regulatory
regions of VHL gene.
2. Set up PCR reaction mixture, including extracted DNA, primers,
dNTPs, buffer, and DNA polymerase.
3. Program thermal cycler for PCR conditions, including initial
denaturation, annealing, and extension steps.
4. Verify amplification via gel electrophoresis.
C. Sequencing:
1. Sanger Sequencing:
◦ Prepare PCR products for sequencing by purification or
clean-up methods.
◦ Set up sequencing reaction following specific sequencing kit
protocols.
◦ Perform capillary electrophoresis.
2. NGS Sequencing:
◦ Prepare library according to the NGS kit protocol.
◦ Quantify libraries using a fluorometer and validate using
electrophoresis.
◦ Load libraries into NGS system and run sequencing
workflow.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Sanger Sequencing Analysis:
◦ Use sequencing software to align sequences and identify
variants.
◦ Compare sequences to reference VHL gene sequence.
2. NGS Analysis:
◦ Use bioinformatics pipelines for sequence alignment, variant
calling, and annotation.
◦ Utilize software tools for variant interpretation and
classification.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Control:
• Run positive controls (known VHL mutations) and negative
controls (no DNA template) alongside patient samples to ensure
assay performance.
• Maintain documentation of control results and instrument
calibration.
External Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing and quality assurance
programs for genetic testing.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Use LIS to review and verify all results.
• Document all identified variants, including potential pathogenicity
based on ACMG guidelines.
• Generate report with comprehensive interpretation by board-
certified genetics professional.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal: No variants identified in the coding regions or regulatory
regions of the VHL gene.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inference of variant pathogenicity requires consideration of clinical
history.
• Some intronic or deep regulatory region variants may be missed.
• PCR amplification may be hindered by GC-rich or repetitive
regions of the VHL gene.
8. REFERENCES
