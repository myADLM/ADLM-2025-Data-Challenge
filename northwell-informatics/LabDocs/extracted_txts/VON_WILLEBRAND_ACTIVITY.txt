Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Von Willebrand Factor
(VWF) Activity Assay
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
performing the Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) Activity Assay in order
to quantify the activity of VWF in patient specimens. The results will
assist in diagnosing and managing patients with bleeding disorders,
including Von Willebrand Disease (VWD).
Responsibility:
• The Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) is responsible for
performing the assay and ensuring quality control.
• The Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for reviewing results
and ensuring the procedure is followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types:
• Preferred: Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate)
• Collection: Blood should be collected via venipuncture, avoiding
prolonged tourniquet application and hemolysis.
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL plasma
• Storage: Plasma should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection and stored at -20°C or colder until testing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens that are clotted or not properly anticoagulated
• Samples not stored or transported under appropriate conditions
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) from patient samples
• Assay reagents (e.g., VWF:GPIbM assay kit)
• Standard controls and calibrators specific for VWF activity
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microtiter plate
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 405 nm
• Timer
• Centrifuge capable of achieving 2500 x g
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Thaw PPP samples, control plasmas, and the calibrator at
37°C in a water bath, mix gently but thoroughly before use.
◦ Prepare reagents as specified in the VWF:GPIbM assay kit
instructions.
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning correctly.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of calibrator, controls, and
patient plasma to the designated wells of the microtiter
plate.
◦ Follow the kit instructions to add assay reagents
sequentially.
◦ Incubation times and temperatures must be adhered to as
precisely as directed by the kit manufacturer.
4. Measurement:
◦ Upon completion of the incubation, measure absorbance of
each well at 405 nm using the microplate reader.
◦ Ensure that all measurements are taken immediately after
the final incubation to avoid degradation of the assay signal.
5. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the VWF activity in patient samples using the
calibration curve generated from the calibrator wells.
◦ Compare results to the control and reference ranges to
ensure assay validity.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run low, medium, and high controls with each assay batch.
• Control values must fall within the specified acceptable range
provided by the control manufacturer.
• If control results are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat the
assay. Document the issue and corrective actions taken.
• Participate in an external quality assessment program.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report VWF activity results as a percentage of normal activity,
referencing the established laboratory range.
• Immediate critical results must be communicated to the clinician
and documented accordingly.
• Include any pertinent comments related to sample integrity, assay
conditions, or unusual findings.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or hyperbilirubinemia may interfere with the
assay and lead to inaccurate results.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical
picture and other coagulation parameters.
• Storage and transport conditions of plasma can significantly affect
the stability of VWF activity.

coagulation assays and sample handling.
• Latest literature and publications relevant to VWF activity testing
and interpretation.
1. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as needed to
comply with new regulations, guidelines, or advancements in
technology.
