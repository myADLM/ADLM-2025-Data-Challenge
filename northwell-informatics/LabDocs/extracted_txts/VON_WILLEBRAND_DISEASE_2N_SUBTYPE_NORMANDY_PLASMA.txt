Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Von Willebrand Disease 2N (Subtype
Normandy), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the effective and accurate
analysis of plasma samples for the diagnosis of Von Willebrand
Disease 2N (Subtype Normandy). This ensures that all laboratory
personnel are consistently and correctly performing the steps to
generate reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to the
steps outlined in this procedure.
• Staff members must report any deviations from the SOP to their
supervisors immediately.
• Supervisors will provide oversight and ensure all procedures are
followed accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Samples: Plasma from blood collected using a plasma
preparation tube (PPT) or blue top (sodium citrate) tube.
• Volume: At least 5 mL of plasma.
• Storage Conditions: Plasma samples should be kept on ice
immediately after collection and processed within 2 hours. If
delayed, the plasma should be frozen at -80°C and transported on
dry ice if sent to another facility.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP or equivalent)
• Pipettes and tips
• Plasma preparation tubes (PPT) or sodium citrate tubes
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Storage vials
• Von Willebrand Factor (VWF): Factor VIII Interaction ELISA Kit
• Distilled water
• Calibrated timers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma.
◦ Carefully transfer the plasma into a labeled storage vial
without disturbing the buffy coat.
2. Storage:
◦ Immediate analysis: Keep the plasma at 4°C and proceed
with testing within 2 hours.
◦ Delayed analysis: Freeze the plasma at -80°C and label
appropriately including date and time.
B. Reagent Preparation:
• Reconstitute all reagents and controls as per the manufacturer’s
instructions provided with the VWF: Factor VIII Interaction ELISA
Kit.
• Equilibrate reagents to room temperature prior to use.
C. VWF: Factor VIII Binding Assay:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Ensure the ELISA plate and all reagents are at room
temperature before starting.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and plasma samples
into the appropriate wells in duplicate.
2. Incubation and Washing:
◦ Incubate the plate as indicated by the kit instructions (e.g.,
60 minutes at room temperature).
◦ Wash the plate using a calibrated plate washer as per the kit
instructions for the required number of washes.
3. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of substrate solution to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for the recommended duration
(e.g., 30 minutes at room temperature).
4. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well as indicated in the
protocol.
◦ Measure absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (e.g.,
450 nm) using a microplate reader.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Data Management:
◦ Using the microplate reader software, analyze the optical
density (OD) values obtained from the samples.
◦ Generate a standard curve from the OD values of known
standards.
2. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the VWF: Factor VIII binding levels in the plasma
samples using the standard curve.
◦ Document the final results for each sample.
E. Quality Control:
1. Controls:
◦ Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of
assays. Ensure the control values fall within the
manufacturer's specified ranges to validate the test run.
2. Reproducibility:
◦ All tests should be run in duplicate to ensure consistency
and reliability of results.
◦ Review the duplicate values to ascertain that they are within
acceptable ranges of deviation.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter validated results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure the results are reviewed by a qualified technologist
before final release.
2. Critical Results:
◦ If critical results are detected, notify the clinician
immediately as per laboratory policy.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
• Normal VWF: Factor VIII binding assay results typically range
from 50% to 150%.
• Values below 50% may indicate Von Willebrand Disease Type 2N.
• Refer to the clinical guidelines and the manufacturer’s product
insert for specific criteria used in diagnosing Von Willebrand
Disease Type 2N.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the assay
results and should be noted.
• Samples must be adequately centrifuged to avoid contamination
with cellular components.

REVIEW
• This protocol should be reviewed and updated annually or
whenever new methodologies or equipment are introduced.
