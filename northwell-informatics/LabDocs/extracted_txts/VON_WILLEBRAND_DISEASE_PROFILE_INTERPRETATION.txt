Standard Operating Procedure
VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE PROFILE INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the interpretation of von Willebrand Disease
(VWD) profile test results in order to ensure accurate and consistent
laboratory reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform von
Willebrand factor (VWF) testing, interpret results according to this
SOP, and report findings. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing
the interpreted data and ensuring its adherence to the protocol.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Fresh venous blood
• Collection Tube: 3.2% sodium citrate (blue top)
• Volume: At least 5 mL of whole blood
• Stability: Plasma separated and kept at -70°C if testing not
performed within 4 hours
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated coagulation analyzer
• VWF antigen assay kits
• Ristocetin Cofactor assay kits
• Factor VIII assay kits
• VWF collagen binding assay kits (optional)
• Quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Instrument Calibration
1. Begin by consulting the calibration status of the automated
coagulation analyzer. Ensure the device is calibrated according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare and ensure quality control materials are within the
acceptable range as per laboratory guidelines.
B. Assays
1. VWF Antigen (VWF:Ag) Assay:
◦ Run the assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Record the VWF:Ag results.
2. Ristocetin Cofactor Activity (VWF:RCo) Assay:
◦ Perform the assay following standard laboratory protocols.
◦ Record VWF:RCo results.
3. Factor VIII (FVIII:C) Assay:
◦ Conduct this test using the specified reagent kit.
◦ Record the FVIII:C activity levels.
4. VWF Collagen Binding Assay (Optional):
◦ Use this assay to further characterize VWD in complex
cases where VWF multimer analysis is not available.
◦ Record results as appropriate.
C. Calculation and Ratio Determination
1. Calculate the ratio of VWF:RCo to VWF:Ag.
2. Calculate the ratio of FVIII:C to VWF:Ag.
3. Use these ratios to help classify the type of von Willebrand
Disease.
◦ The reference ranges should be determined by laboratory
standards based on validation studies.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING GUIDELINES
• Type 1 VWD: Generally characterized by proportionately low
levels of VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo.
◦ Typical: VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo both <30 IU/dL, ratio
VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag is about 1.
◦ FVIII:C may be reduced but typically correlates with VWF:Ag.
• Type 2A VWD: Defined by reduced VWF:RCo despite normal or
slightly reduced VWF:Ag.
◦ VWF:Ag mildly-moderately reduced, VWF:RCo significantly
reduced.
◦ Ratio VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag < 0.6
• Type 2B VWD: Characterized by increase in VWF:RCo upon
using high-dose ristocetin.
◦ Consider increased VWF:RCo in presence of normal/mildly
reduced VWF:Ag.
◦ Ratio of VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag can be near to 1 or >1.
• Type 2M VWD: Similar to Type 2A, but without defect in multimer
pattern.
◦ VWF:Ag mildly-moderately reduced, VWF:RCo significantly
reduced.
◦ Ratio VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag << 0.6.
• Type 2N VWD: Characterized by reduced FVIII:C, normal
VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo.
◦ VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo are within normal ranges.
◦ Typical FVIII:C significantly reduced, FVIII:C/VWF:Ag ratio <<
0.5.
• Type 3 VWD: Near absence of VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo,
correspondingly low FVIII:C.
◦ All assays show undetectable or very low levels.
D. Documentation
1. Document all assay results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Use interpretative comments standardized for the
corresponding type of VWD.
3. Ensure that all interpretations are verified by a qualified
laboratory supervisor before the final report is issued.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Three levels of QC material should be run in parallel with
patient samples for each assay.
2. Ensure that the QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.

VWF testing.
2. Manufacturer’s instructions for use (IFU) for all assay kits.
3. Literature references on VWD subtypes and their biochemical
profiles.
