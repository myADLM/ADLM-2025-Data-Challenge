1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for the analytical phase of generating results for
Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) Profile, Plasma. This includes
procedures for testing plasma for Von Willebrand Factor Antigen
(vWF:Ag), Von Willebrand Factor Activity (vWF:Act), Factor VIII
(FVIII) activity, and Ristocetin Cofactor Activity (RCo).
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the specialized laboratory personnel responsible
for performing Von Willebrand Disease profile tests on plasma
samples within the laboratory.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred Specimen: Sodium citrate anticoagulated plasma (blue
top tube).
• Collection: Ensure the tube is filled to the indicated fill line to
maintain the correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio.
• Stability: Plasma samples must be processed within 4 hours of
collection. If not possible, centrifuge and aliquot plasma into
labeled polypropylene tubes and freeze at -70°C. Thawed plasma
is stable for 2 hours at room temperature.
3.2 Required Materials
• Reagents and Calibrators:
◦ vWF:Ag ELISA Kit
◦ vWF:Act Ristocetin Cofactor Assay
◦ FVIII:C Chromogenic Assay
◦ RCo Activity Assay
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ ELISA Reader
◦ Aggregometer
◦ Incubator
◦ Refrigerator and Freezer (-70°C)
• Supplies:
◦ Disposable pipette tips
◦ Polypropylene tubes
◦ Calibration and Control Plasmas
3.3 Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge whole blood at 2000-2500g for 15 minutes at room
temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
• Transfer plasma using a plastic transfer pipette to a labeled
polypropylene tube.
• If testing is not immediate, freeze plasma at -70°C.
3.4 Assay Procedures
A. Von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF:Ag) ELISA
• Thaw the frozen plasma samples at 37°C for 5 minutes and mix
gently.
• Prepare the ELISA plate as per manufacturer instructions.
• Add standards, controls, and patient samples in duplicate.
• Add the primary antibody and incubate at the recommended
temperature and time.
• Wash the plate as per manufacturer instructions.
• Add the secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme.
• Add the substrate and stop solution sequentially and read the
optical density at the specified wavelength.
B. Von Willebrand Factor Activity (vWF:Act) Ristocetin Cofactor
Assay
• Reconstitute ristocetin and other reagents as per manufacturer’s
protocol.
• Perform the assay using platelets or lyophilized platelet reagents.
• Add patient plasma, calibrators, and controls.
• Measure the agglutination using an aggregometer.
• Calculate the vWF activity based on the standard curve.
C. Factor VIII Activity (FVIII:C) Chromogenic Assay
• Thaw plasma samples rapidly at 37°C.
• Prepare reagents and calibrators as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Pipette reagents, controls, and patient samples in duplicates into
appropriate wells of the microplate.
• Incubate at specified time and temperature.
• Develop color using the chromogen, stop the reaction with stop
solution, and read at 405 nm using an ELISA reader.
• Calculate the factor VIII activity from the standard curve.
D. Ristocetin Cofactor Activity (RCo)
• Prepare platelets, Ristocetin, and other required reagents.
• Mix the reagents as per protocol.
• Measure platelet agglutination using an aggregometer.
• Calculate RCo activity based on standard curve.
3.5 Reporting Results
• Review and verify the data obtained from the assays.
• Calculate results using software or manual calculations based on
standard curves.
• Input the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify.
• Document results in the patient record and prepare the final report
for validation by the appropriate supervisory staff.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that all calibrators and controls fall within the acceptable
ranges.
• If the quality control results are not within the expected range, re-
run the controls and check the instrumentation and reagent
integrity.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
5. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat,
gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Follow all biosafety regulations for handling and disposing of
clinical specimens and biological reagents.
