Von Willebrand Disease Profile Technical Interpretation SOP
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Von Willebrand Disease Profile, ensuring
accuracy, consistency, and appropriate interpretation of test results.
This SOP is critical for diagnosing and managing patients with von
Willebrand Disease (vWD).
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained and qualified laboratory personnel to
perform and document the analysis according to this SOP. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the procedure and
ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
2. DEFINITION
The Von Willebrand Disease Profile includes a series of assays that
assess the levels and function of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) in the
blood. This profile typically includes:
• von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF:Ag)
• von Willebrand Factor Activity (vWF:RCo, vWF:GPIbM or
vWF:CB)
• Factor VIII Coagulant Activity (FVIII:C)
• von Willebrand Disease Multimer Analysis (vWF:M)
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 Equipment and Reagents
• Automated Coagulation Analyzer or Platelet Aggregometer
• vWF Antigen and Activity Kits
• Factor VIII Coagulant Activity Assay Kits
• Multimer analysis reagents and Electrophoresis apparatus
• Quality Control materials
• Calibration standards
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
3.2 Performance of Assays
A) von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF:Ag)
1. Calibrate the Coagulation Analyzer using the manufacturer's
calibration standards.
2. Reconstitute vWF:Ag reagent kits as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Load patient plasma samples, controls, and calibrators into the
designated sample cups.
4. Run the vWF:Ag assay according to manufacturer’s protocol.
5. Document assay results including calibration and quality control
data.
B) von Willebrand Factor Activity (vWF Activity)
1. Select the appropriate activity assay (Ristocetin Cofactor Assay
- vWF:RCo, GPIbM Assay - vWF:GPIbM, or Collagen Binding
Assay - vWF:CB).
2. Calibrate the activity assay using the manufacturer's standards
and controls.
3. Reconstitute activity reagents as specified in the assay kit
instructions.
4. Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the analyzer.
5. Run the vWF activity assay as per manufacturer’s protocol.
6. Record activity levels and review quality control results.
C) Factor VIII Coagulant Activity (FVIII:C)
1. Perform calibration using the Factor VIII assay standards.
2. Prepare the Factor VIII reagent according to the kit instructions.
3. Load patient samples, controls, and calibrators into the
analyzer.
4. Run the Factor VIII assay as specified by the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
5. Document the results and ensure quality control is within
acceptable ranges.
D) von Willebrand Disease Multimer Analysis (vWF:M)
1. Prepare reagents for multimer analysis following standard
electrophoresis procedures.
2. Load prepared patient plasma samples and controls onto a gel.
3. Perform electrophoresis and develop using appropriate staining
protocol.
4. Visualize and interpret the multimer pattern by comparing with
control patterns.
5. Record results and ensure accuracy in interpretation.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
A comprehensive assessment of von Willebrand Disease involves
integrating the results from the assays performed:
• Correlate von Willebrand Factor Antigen levels with vWF Activity
to determine the type of vWD.
• Assess Factor VIII levels in conjunction with vWF assays to
distinguish between different subtypes.
• Interpret vWF Multimers to confirm the structural abnormalities
characteristic of different types of vWD.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
• Run quality controls with each batch of assays to ensure assay
integrity. Acceptable ranges should meet manufacturer
specifications.
• Document all calibrations, quality controls, and any deviations in
the logbook.
• Conduct periodic proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons to maintain high testing standards.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Complete the laboratory information system entry with patient
results, including vWF:Ag, vWF Activity, FVIII:C, and vWF
Multimer analysis.
• Verify and authorize results by a qualified laboratory supervisor.
• Report consistent and clinically relevant interpretations for
physician review.
