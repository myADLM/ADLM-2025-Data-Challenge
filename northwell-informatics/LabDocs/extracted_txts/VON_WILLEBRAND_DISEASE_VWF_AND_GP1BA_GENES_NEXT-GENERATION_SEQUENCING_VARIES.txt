Standard Operating Procedure for Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) Analysis of VWF and GP1BA Genes for Von Willebrand
Disease
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard protocol for the analytical phase of Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) for the VWF and GP1BA genes in
patients suspected of having Von Willebrand Disease. This protocol
ensures accurate and systematic generation of results, making
optimal use of NGS technology.
Responsibility: All designated staff must adhere to this SOP to ensure
quality and accuracy of data generated. The lead molecular
technologist is responsible for overseeing the analytic phase and
ensuring compliance with the SOP.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• NGS library preparation kits
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR machine
• Thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Gel electrophoresis unit
• Quantification tools (e.g., Qubit, Bioanalyzer)
• Pipettes and tips
• Consumables (e.g., tubes, plates)
• Software for data analysis
1. PROTOCOL
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from patient samples using a commercially
available extraction kit.
2. Verify DNA quality and quantity using spectrophotometry (e.g.,
NanoDrop) and fluorometry (e.g., Qubit).
3. Store DNA samples at -20°C until library preparation.
B) NGS Library Preparation:
1. Use appropriate library preparation kits for target enrichment of
VWF and GP1BA genes.
2. Perform PCR amplification of target regions according to kit
instructions.
3. Purify PCR products using a column or magnetic bead-based
system.
4. Quantify and assess the quality of prepared libraries using
fluorometry and capillary electrophoresis (e.g., Bioanalyzer).
C) Sequencing:
1. Load the purified libraries onto the NGS sequencer and follow
the manufacturer's instrument protocol.
2. Monitor sequencing run for quality and completeness.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics software.
2. Perform quality control on raw data (e.g., FASTQ files) to
ensure sequencing accuracy.
3. Align reads to reference genome and identify variants using
appropriate software tools (e.g., GATK, BWA).
4. Annotate identified variants with relevant databases (e.g.,
dbSNP, ClinVar).
E) Validation and Interpretation:
1. Confirm variants of interest using secondary validation methods
(e.g., Sanger sequencing).
2. Interpret results using clinical criteria and guidelines for Von
Willebrand Disease.
3. Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing findings.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include appropriate positive and negative control samples in
each run of the NGS process.
6. Ensure consistent performance of equipment and reagents
through regular maintenance and calibration.
7. Document all steps meticulously, including any deviations from
the protocol.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Review generated reports for accuracy.
10. Validate critical results before dissemination.
11. Submit the report to the ordering physician through the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
12. Document any discrepancies or unexpected findings.
13. REFERENCES
