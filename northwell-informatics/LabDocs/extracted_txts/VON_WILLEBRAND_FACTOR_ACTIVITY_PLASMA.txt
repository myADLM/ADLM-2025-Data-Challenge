Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Von Willebrand Factor Activity (VWFA),
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and reliable assessment of
Von Willebrand Factor Activity (VWFA) in plasma samples. This SOP
ensures that analytical processes are performed consistently
following established laboratory standards, thereby ensuring quality
and integrity of the results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing VWFA
testing according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify and report any deficiencies immediately to the supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with these
procedures and addressing any issues that arise during testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred/acceptable: Citrated plasma collected in a 3.2% sodium
citrate tube.
• Unacceptable: Specimens collected in tubes containing heparin,
EDTA, or any other anticoagulant.
Stability:
• Plasma specimens must be separated from cells within 4 hours of
collection.
• Citrated plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 4 hours following
centrifugation.
• For longer storage, plasma samples can be frozen at -20°C or
below. Ensure samples are thoroughly thawed and mixed before
analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Plate reader/spectrophotometer
• VWFA assay kits (appropriate kit validated for laboratory use)
• Controls (High and Low)
• Calibrator(s)
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is in proper working condition and
calibrated if necessary.
2. Prepare reagents and controls according to manufacturer
instructions, ensuring they reach the required temperature
before use.
3. Aliquot patient plasma and controls as per assay requirements.
Assay Protocol:
1. Pipette appropriate volume of plasma sample, control, and
calibrator into respective wells or tubes as per manufacturer
instructions.
2. Add reagents sequentially as specified in the VWFA assay
protocol.
◦ Ensure thorough mixing and allow any required incubation
times.
3. Monitor assay reactions at specified intervals using the plate
reader/spectrophotometer.
4. Record all data promptly, noting any anomalies or instrument
error messages.
Quality Control:
1. Run the high and low controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Ensure controls fall within specified ranges to validate test run.
3. Document control results, ensuring any out-of-range results are
investigated and resolved.
6. RESULTS AND REPORTING
Calculation of Results:
• Perform calculations using the absorbance values recorded for
samples, controls, and calibrators as per the manufacturer's
protocol.
• Verify calculation accuracy against expected control values.
Results Review and Verification:
1. Review all results for completeness and consistency.
2. Flag any anomalies for further investigation.
3. Verify results and enter into Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for final reporting.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
VWFA activity:
• Normal range: 50-150% Note: Reference intervals may vary
slightly based on population studies and assay-specific
validations.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples can interfere with assay results.
• Lipemic or icteric samples may lead to inaccurate readings. Refer
to the assay kit insert for detailed limitations specific to individual
reagent components and reaction conditions.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Check reagent integrity and expiration dates.
• Verify pipette calibration.
• Ensure correct procedural adherence.
• For instrument errors, refer to manufacturer's manual for
troubleshooting steps.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Maintain detailed records of:
• Patient sample information
• Control and calibrator batch numbers and results
• Equipment calibration and maintenance logs
• Any deviations from SOP and corrective actions taken
