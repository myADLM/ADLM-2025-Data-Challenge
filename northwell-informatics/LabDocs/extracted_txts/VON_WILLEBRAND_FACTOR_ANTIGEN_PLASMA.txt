Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for von Willebrand Factor Antigen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for measuring von Willebrand
Factor Antigen (vWF:Ag) in plasma samples. It includes guidelines on
reagent preparation, instrument calibration, sample handling, and
result interpretation to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained medical laboratory scientists to follow
and document each step in this protocol. Any anomalies or deviations
should be reported to the laboratory supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma from blood collected in sodium citrate anticoagulant tubes
(light blue stopper).
• Sample should be centrifuged at 1500×g for 15 minutes at 4°C to
separate the plasma.
• Collect at least 2 mL of plasma for analysis.
Stability:
• Plasma specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 4 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -70°C and are
stable for up to 6 months. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than sodium citrate.
• Plasma stored for more than 4 hours at 2-8°C without freezing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Platelet aggregometer or an ELISA reader.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
Reagents:
• von Willebrand Factor Antigen ELISA Kit (including standards,
controls, and detection reagents).
• Sodium citrate anticoagulant.
• Dilution buffer.
• Washing buffer.
• Substrate solution.
• Stop solution.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents:
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions provided in the ELISA kit.
2. Allow reagents to reach room temperature before use.
3. If using, calibrate pipettes before starting the assay to ensure
accurate volume delivery.
B. Sample Handling:
1. Allow frozen plasma specimens to thaw at room temperature.
2. Mix specimens gently by inversion or gentle vortexing before
testing.
3. Avoid creating foam or bubbles.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Add the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and patient
plasma samples to designated wells in duplicate.
2. Add the detection antibody as instructed by the ELISA kit
protocol.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the incubation time specified in
the kit.
4. Perform washing steps as specified, ensuring thorough removal
of washing buffer between each wash.
5. Add the substrate solution and incubate the plate in the dark for
the time specified in the ELISA kit.
6. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction,
observing a color change indicative of the presence of von
Willebrand factor antigen.
D. Measurement:
1. Read the optical density of each well using an ELISA reader set
to the appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm).
2. Record and analyze the absorbance values.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Analysis:
• Refer to the standard curve generated using the provided
standards to determine the concentration of vWF:Ag in patient
samples.
• Acceptable range for standard curve R² value must be ≥ 0.98.
Calculation:
• Results should be expressed in IU/dL or as per applicable units
provided by the manufacturer's kit.
Critical Values:
• Values significantly deviating from the established reference
ranges should be reviewed by a senior technologist and reported
immediately to the clinician.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Ensure at least one normal and one abnormal control sample is
included with every batch of samples.
• Results of control samples must be within the manufacturer's
acceptable range before patient results are reported.
Inter-Instrumental Quality Control:
• Compare instrument results periodically with external controls to
maintain accuracy.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions provided with the von Willebrand
Factor Antigen ELISA kit.
• Laboratory internal reference guidelines for analytical chemistry
procedures up to October 2023.
1. NOTES
• Maintain all records of calibration, sample handling, and QC
checks in laboratory logbooks.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste safely following the laboratory's
waste disposal policies.
By following this SOP, the analytical process for von Willebrand
Factor Antigen in plasma ensures accuracy and reliability in clinical
diagnostics.
This SOP forms the standard procedure to be followed by all trained
laboratory personnel for the analytical phase of testing vWF:Ag in the
provided plasma samples. Adaptations to the protocol should be
documented and approved by supervisors before implementation.
