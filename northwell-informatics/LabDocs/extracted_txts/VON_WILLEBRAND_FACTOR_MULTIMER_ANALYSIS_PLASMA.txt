Standard Operating Procedure: Von Willebrand Factor Multimer
Analysis, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analysis of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) multimers in plasma. The
analysis is utilized to evaluate the structure of the vWF multimers to
differentiate types and subtypes of von Willebrand Disease (vWD).
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff responsible for conducting von
Willebrand Factor Multimer Analysis in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all staff
are adequately trained and adhere to this procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
• vWF: von Willebrand Factor
• vWD: von Willebrand Disease
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulated plasma.
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL plasma.
• Collection: Plasma should be separated from cells within 2 hours
of collection and frozen immediately at -70°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Electrophoresis apparatus and power supply
• Precast agarose gels or prepared polyacrylamide agarose
composite gels
• SDS-PAGE reagent kit
• Electrophoresis buffer solution
• Protean transfer membrane (PVDF or nitrocellulose)
• Blocking buffer
• Primary antibody against human vWF
• Secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme or fluorescent
marker
• Substrate for enzyme reaction (if applicable)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Laboratory freezer (-70°C)
• Gel documentation system
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run normal and abnormal control plasma samples with each
batch of patient samples.
• Record all control results and ensure they fall within
predetermined acceptable ranges.
• Perform maintenance and calibration of electrophoresis
equipment as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
1. PROCEDURE
8.1 Sample Preparation
1. Thaw the frozen plasma samples at 37°C for approximately 5
minutes.
2. Vortex samples gently to mix and aliquot required volume for
analysis.
3. Dilute plasma samples and control samples with an equal
volume of electrophoresis buffer.
8.2 Gel Preparation
1. Prepare or obtain precast agarose gels suitable for vWF
multimer analysis.
2. Assemble the electrophoresis apparatus and fill with the
appropriate buffer.
8.3 Electrophoresis
1. Load the diluted plasma samples, control samples, and
molecular weight markers into the wells of the gel.
2. Run electrophoresis according to the established protocol (e.g.,
100 volts for 2 hours or as per specific gel requirements).
8.4 Transfer to Membrane
1. Following electrophoresis, transfer the separated proteins from
the gel to a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry
or wet transfer system.
2. Block non-specific sites on the membrane using a blocking
buffer.
8.5 Detection
1. Incubate the membrane with a primary antibody specific for
human vWF.
2. Wash the membrane to remove unbound antibody.
3. Incubate with a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme
or fluorescent marker.
4. Wash the membrane again to remove unbound secondary
antibody.
5. Develop the membrane using an appropriate substrate if an
enzyme conjugated secondary antibody was used.
8.6 Imaging and Interpretation
1. Capture the image of the developed membrane using a gel
documentation system.
2. Compare the patient sample lanes with control lanes to
evaluate the distribution and size of vWF multimers.
3. Record observations regarding the presence, absence, or
alteration of high, intermediate, and low molecular weight vWF
multimers.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• All findings are to be reviewed and verified by a designated
technologist.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include interpretation in the context of vWD types and subtypes.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Inadequate sample quality or improper handling can affect
multimer patterns.
• Certain conditions and treatments (e.g., DDAVP treatment) may
modify vWF multimer distribution in plasma.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the electrophoresis and transfer
apparatus.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory guidelines for von Willebrand
Disease diagnosis and management.
This document should be reviewed and updated as necessary to
remain compliant with new research, technological advancements, or
regulatory changes.
