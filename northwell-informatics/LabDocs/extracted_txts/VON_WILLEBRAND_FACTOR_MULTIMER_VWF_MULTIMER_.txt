Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): VON WILLEBRAND
FACTOR MULTIMER (VWF MULTIMER) ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to provide
a detailed protocol for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
assessment of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers in the plasma
of patients. This test is used to evaluate patients with suspected or
known von Willebrand disease and other bleeding disorders.
Responsibility:
• Designated qualified personnel with appropriate training will
conduct VWF multimer analysis.
• It is the responsibility of all staff members to ensure that samples
and reagents are handled properly and that any inconsistencies
or issues are reported to a supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers refer to the different
multimeric forms (sizes) of von Willebrand factor present in the
plasma. VWF multimer analysis is essential for diagnosing and
distinguishing between types of von Willebrand disease.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Handling
1. Preferred Specimen:
◦ Freshly collected plasma in citrate anticoagulated tubes
(light blue top).
◦ The sample should be processed and the plasma separated
within 4 hours of collection.
◦ For delayed processing: Plasma should be frozen at -70°C
or below. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, clotted, or lipemic samples.
◦ Specimens not appropriately labeled with patient details and
collection time.
◦ Plasma samples received at room temperature beyond the
recommended processing time.
B. Reagents and Supplies
1. High-resolution Agarose Gel
2. Electrophoresis Buffer Solution
3. Fixing Solution
4. Staining Solution (e.g., Coomassie Brilliant Blue)
5. Destaining Solution
6. Controls (normal plasma control, low molecular weight VWF control)
7. Equipment for immunoblotting (e.g., nitrocellulose membrane, transfer buffer, VWF antibody, enzyme-labeled secondary antibody, and detection reagents)
C. Equipment
1. Electrophoresis apparatus
2. Gel imaging system
3. Refrigerated centrifuge
4. Water bath
5. Precise pipettes and tips
6. -70°C or lower freezer for plasma storage
D. Procedure
1. **Electrophoresis**
a. Prepare the high-resolution agarose gel following the manufacturer's instructions.
b. Prepare the electrophoresis buffer solution and fill the electrophoresis tank.
c. Thaw plasma samples and controls at 37°C, mix well, and then prepare sample loading buffer.
d. Load equal volumes of patient plasma samples, controls, and molecular weight markers into the designated wells of the agarose gel.
e. Run the electrophoresis under appropriate conditions (typically at 4°C).
2. **Immunoblot Transfer**
a. Following electrophoresis, carefully transfer the separated VWF multimers from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane using an appropriate transfer buffer system.
b. After transfer, block the membrane with a suitable blocking solution to reduce non-specific binding.
3. **Immunostaining**
a. Incubate the membrane with a primary antibody specific to VWF (following the manufacturer’s instructions for concentration and duration).
b. Wash the membrane thoroughly to remove unbound primary antibodies.
c. Incubate the membrane with an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody and wash as required.
4. **Detection and Analysis**
a. Develop the membrane using a suitable substrate for the enzyme-labeled secondary antibody.
b. Visualize and document the VWF multimer patterns using a gel imaging system.
c. Compare the VWF multimer patterns of patient samples to controls to identify the presence of high molecular weight multimers and other relevant features.
E. Quality Control
• Include normal plasma control and a low molecular weight VWF
control in each assay run.
• Ensure all reagents and controls fall within their expiration date
and stored per manufacturer’s recommendations.
F. Documentation and Reporting
• Results are interpreted based on the presence or absence of
specific VWF multimer patterns, such as lack of high molecular
weight multimers indicative of certain types of von Willebrand
Disease.
• Report findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
ensure results are reviewed and verified by the senior
technologist or pathologist.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure and corrective actions taken.
G. Record Keeping
• Maintain logs of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and quality
control results.
• Store gel images and immunoblots in digital or physical archives
along with corresponding patient and control details for future
reference and quality assurance.

• Manufacturer guidelines for electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and
detection reagents.
