Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for VORICONAZOLE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for generating
accurate and reliable voriconazole serum levels, ensuring consistent
quality and compliance with regulatory standards during the
analytical phase.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed and for verifying results.
• All staff must report any issues or deviations during the analytical
process to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube (no gel) or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 1.5 mL serum.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 7 days post-collection or at
-20°C for long-term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with incomplete labeling or documentation.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than specified.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC or LC-MS/MS system
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., centrifuge, pipettes, SPE
cartridges)
• Voriconazole standard solutions and quality control materials
• Mobile phase reagents
• Laboratory notebook/electronic system for recording data
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Prepare and calibrate the HPLC or LC-MS/MS equipment
according to the manufacturer's instructions and laboratory
SOPs.
2. Confirm that all reagents and standards are within their
expiration dates and have been prepared correctly.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge all serum samples, calibrators, and controls for 10
minutes at 3000 rpm to separate the serum.
3. Pipette an aliquot (typically 100 µL) of serum into a clean
sample tube.
Extraction Process (for LC-MS/MS Method):
1. Add an appropriate volume of internal standard to each sample,
calibrator, and control.
2. Utilize solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges to clean and
concentrate the samples: a. Condition the SPE cartridge with
methanol and water. b. Load the serum sample onto the
cartridge. c. Wash the cartridge with an aqueous wash solution.
d. Elute the voriconazole with an organic elution solution.
3. Evaporate the eluate under nitrogen and reconstitute with a
mobile phase before injecting into the LC-MS/MS system.
HPLC Method (if used):
1. Add the serum sample to a mixture of protein precipitant
reagent.
2. Mix the solution and centrifuge to precipitate proteins.
3. Collect the supernatant for HPLC injection.
Instrument Analysis:
1. Inject the prepared sample into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
system.
2. Run the appropriate chromatographic method dedicated to
voriconazole.
3. Ensure the instrument is appropriately calibrated and quality
control standards are within the accepted range before
analyzing patient samples.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform quality control at the beginning and end of each run,
and at regular intervals throughout the batch analysis.
6. Use at least two levels of control material (low and high
concentrations of voriconazole).
7. Document all quality control results.
8. If quality control values fall outside of the acceptable range,
troubleshoot, and resolve issues before proceeding with further
analysis.
9. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT GENERATION
Calculation:
• Utilize the instrument software to generate the voriconazole
concentration from the instrument response.
• Verify that calculations are based on a validated calibration curve.
Result Documentation:
1. Review and verify the results for accuracy.
2. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Ensure results are within the therapeutic range: 1 - 5.5 µg/mL
for trough levels.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Technologists must review, validate, and release results according
to site-specific guidelines.
• Critical values must be reported immediately to the appropriate
healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 1 - 5.5 µg/mL for trough levels.
• Critical values: < 1 µg/mL or > 6 µg/mL.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Hemolyzed specimens may interfere with accurate
voriconazole measurements.
• Cross-reactivity: Ensure method validation accounts for potential
cross-reactivity with similar compounds.
