Standard Operating Procedure for VORICONAZOLE
SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for performing voriconazole
susceptibility testing on clinical isolates to determine antifungal
resistance.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform and
document the voriconazole susceptibility testing procedure according
to this SOP. Lab staff and supervisors must ensure the protocol is
followed accurately, and any deviations or anomalies must be
addressed and documented appropriately.
3. DEFINITIONS
Antifungal susceptibility testing: A procedure to determine the
effectiveness of voriconazole against fungal pathogens.
4. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical fungal isolates requiring voriconazole
susceptibility testing.
5. SPECIMENS
• Use freshly cultured fungal isolates.
• Maintain the specimens under appropriate storage conditions as
per laboratory guidelines until testing is initiated.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB)
• RPMI 1640 medium with L-glutamine, without bicarbonate, with
MOPS
• Voriconazole powder
• Sterile 0.85% saline
• Sterile microtitre plates (96-well)
• Incubator set at 35°C
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Sterile disposable loops
• Spectrophotometer
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing Stock Solutions
1. Prepare a voriconazole stock solution at a concentration of
1280 µg/mL by dissolving the appropriate amount of
voriconazole powder in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as specified
by the manufacturer.
2. Sterile filter the solution and store it at -20°C.
B. Preparing Working Solution and Serial Dilutions
1. On the day of testing, thaw a portion of the stock solution.
2. Prepare serial dilutions of voriconazole in RPMI 1640 medium
to achieve the desired testing range (e.g., 0.03 to 16 µg/mL).
C. Inoculum Preparation
1. Using a sterile loop, pick 5 distinct colonies of similar
morphology from a pure culture plate.
2. Suspend the colonies in 0.85% sterile saline to achieve a
turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard (approximately
1 x 106 to 5 x 106 CFU/mL).
3. Vortex the suspension thoroughly.
D. Setting up the Microtitre Plate
1. Add 100 µL of RPMI 1640 medium to each well of a sterile 96-
well microtitre plate.
2. Add 100 µL of the voriconazole working solutions to the
designated wells.
3. Add 100 µL of fungal suspension to each well, ensuring a final
inoculum concentration of 0.4 x 10^4 to 5 x 10^4 CFU/mL in the
well.
4. Include control wells with only RPMI 1640 medium (negative
control) and RPMI 1640 medium plus fungal suspension
without voriconazole (positive control).
E. Incubation
1. Seal the plate with a breathable film to prevent contamination
and evaporation.
2. Incubate the plate at 35°C for 24-48 hours.
F. Reading and Interpretation
1. After the incubation period, read the optical density (OD) of
each well at 450-600 nm using a spectrophotometer.
2. Determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) as the
lowest concentration of voriconazole that prevents visible
growth (compared to the positive control).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control strains with known voriconazole
susceptibility patterns along with each batch of isolates tested.
2. Record the results of quality control strains to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
3. Document any deviations from expected QC results and take
corrective actions as necessary.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the MIC values into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Interpret the results based on established clinical breakpoints in
accordance with CLSI or EUCAST guidelines.
3. Report the resistance or susceptibility of the clinical isolates to
voriconazole to the requesting healthcare provider.
4. Any critical or unusual results must be verified by a second
technologist or a supervisor.

11. RECORD-KEEPING
1. Maintain all records related to the preparation of stock
solutions, serial dilutions, inoculum preparation, and quality
control.
2. Archive microtitre plate readings and results for future reference
and review.
