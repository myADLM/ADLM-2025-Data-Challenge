Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for WALL EYED PIKE (Sander Vitreus)
(Stizostedion Vitreum) Immunoglobulin E (IGE)
1. PURPOSE
The objective of this SOP is to outline the processes and procedures
for the analytical phase of generating results for Wall Eyed Pike
(Sander Vitreus)(Stizostedion Vitreum) Immunoglobulin E (IGE) in a
clinical laboratory setting. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and
reproducibility of results, complying with CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory staff are responsible for performing IGE testing
according to the outlined procedures.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring compliance with standard protocols.
1. DEFINITION
Immunoglobulin E (IGE) is an antibody associated with allergic
reactions. Measurement of IGE specific to Wall Eyed Pike (Sander
Vitreus)(Stizostedion Vitreum) helps diagnose allergy to this allergen.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection: Blood is drawn using standard venipuncture technique
and collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-top tube.
• Volume: Approximately 5 mL of blood
• Stability: Serum should be separated and refrigerated within 2
hours of collection if not immediately processed. Samples are
stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C and can be stored at -20°C for
longer periods.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in an anticoagulant tube (e.g., EDTA,
heparin)
• Specimens that are clotted
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• ELISA reader (or automated immunoassay analyzer)
• WALL EYED PIKE (Sander Vitreus)(Stizostedion Vitreum) IGE
ELISA kit or equivalent immunoassay reagent kit
• Microplates or compatible reaction vessels
• Controls and calibrators as provided in the ELISA kit or from an
approved source
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibration: Perform calibration with each new lot of reagents or
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Controls: Run a low, medium, and high control with each assay
batch. Ensure control values fall within the established range
before proceeding with sample analysis.
• External QC: Participate in external proficiency testing programs
for IGE as available.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation
• Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
• Label microplates or reaction vessels with sample identification
numbers.
6.2. Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge blood samples to separate serum (10 minutes at 1500
rpm).
• Carefully pipette the serum into labeled tubes for testing, avoiding
hemolysis.
6.3. Assay Procedure (Based on ELISA Method)
• Pipette the required volume of standard, controls, and patient
samples into appropriate wells.
• Add the specified amount of biotinylated antibody reagent to each
well.
• Incubate the microplate for the time specified in the kit protocol at
room temperature.
• Wash the microplate as per the kit instructions to remove
unbound reagents.
• Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate.
• Perform additional washes as necessary.
• Add the substrate solution and incubate in the dark (usually 15-30
minutes or as specified).
• Add the stop solution to halt the enzyme reaction.
• Read optical density (OD) values using an ELISA reader at the
specified wavelength (typically 450 nm).
6.4. Calculation
• Construct the standard curve by plotting the known
concentrations of the standards versus their OD values.
• Determine the IGE concentration in patient samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
• Apply any necessary dilution factors.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Cross-check results for potential errors or deviations.
• Validate results against quality control and calibration data.
• Report results in IU/mL or the relevant unit specified by the assay
kit.
• Ensure that all critical values are flagged and followed up
according to laboratory policies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly contaminated
specimens are not processed.
• Refer to the manufacturer's product insert for specific limitations
regarding reagent storage, handling, and any known cross-
reactivity or interference.
