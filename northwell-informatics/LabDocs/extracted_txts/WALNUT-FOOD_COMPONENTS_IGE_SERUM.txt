Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: WALNUT-FOOD COMPONENTS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for accurate and consistent
analysis of serum samples for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to
walnut allergens in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
(CLIA)-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the IgE
testing specific to walnut allergens, documenting the results, and
ensuring that proper quality control procedures are followed.
2. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top Vacutainer tube.
• Serum must be separated from cells, ideally within 2 hours of
collection. Store and transport serum at 2-8°C; if testing is
delayed beyond 48 hours, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or lipemic.
• Specimens that have been subjected to repeated freeze/thaw
cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-sensitivity IgE assay kits specific for walnut allergens.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerated storage units (-20°C and 2-8°C).
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP).
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls).
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning according to
manufacturer specifications.
2. Retrieve serum samples from refrigeration/freezer and bring to
room temperature.
3. Prepare reagents and controls according to the kit instructions.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15
minutes.
2. Aliquot the required volume of serum for the test setup.
3. If multiple tests are ordered, ensure proper aliquot labeling to
avoid mix-ups.
C) Assay Setup:
1. Label all necessary wells for patient samples, controls, and
calibrators on the assay plate.
2. Load the serum samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
assay plate according to the assay kit instructions.
3. Add the appropriate reagents to each well as directed by the kit
insert.
4. Incubate the assay plate for the specified duration at the
recommended temperature.
D) Analysis:
1. Load the assay plate into the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Follow the analyzer's instructions to run the IgE test specific for
walnut allergen.
3. Ensure the results are properly documented by the analyzer,
including sample ID and concentration of IgE.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Document all QC results in the appropriate log.
3. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, investigate and
resolve the issue before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
Validation:
1. Verify the results against established reference intervals
provided by the assay kit.
2. Perform correlation studies between instruments if applicable.
Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify the results generated by the immunoassay
analyzer.
2. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Reference intervals for IgE specific for walnut allergens must be
included in the patient report.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations related to the
walnut IgE test. Note any potential interferences, such as high levels
of rheumatoid factor, lipids, or bilirubin, that could affect results.

• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert for walnut IgE testing.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory testing and quality control.
8. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain a comprehensive log of all serum samples, controls, and
results. Record the date, time, and initials of the performing
technologist for each assay run.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
timely generation of results for walnut-food components, IgE, serum,
in compliance with CLIA standards.
