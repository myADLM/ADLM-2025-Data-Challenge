Protocol for Quantifying WALNUT-FOOD, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To quantify Walnut-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results
can greatly aid in diagnosing walnut allergy and implementing
effective dietary plans for patients.
Responsibility:
Designated lab personnel will perform the ELISA assay, document
results, and initiate required corrective actions according to this SOP.
All lab personnel should adhere to quality control standards and
report any deviations to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
WALNUT-FOOD, IGE, SERUM assay quantifies the concentration of
specific IgE antibodies against walnut allergens in the patient's
serum.
1. PROCEDURE
Step A: Preparation and Equipment • ELISA plate reader • Calibrated
micropipettes • Vortex mixer • Incubator set at 37°C • Refrigerated
centrifuge • Timer
Reagents and Chemicals: • Coated ELISA plates with walnut
antigens • Dilution buffer • Enzyme conjugate • Substrate solution •
Stop solution • Positive and negative controls
Specimen: • Preferred Specimen: Serum collected via venipuncture
stored in a red top tube. • Specimen Stability: Serum samples should
be kept frozen at -20°C if not immediately tested, and should be
thawed completely before use. • Unacceptable samples: Hemolyzed
or lipemic samples, serum stored unfrozen for more than 24 hours.
Step B: Serum Sample Processing
1. Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Prepare optimal dilution (usually 1:5 or 1:10) of the serum
sample using the provided dilution buffer.
3. Vortex the diluted samples to ensure uniformity.
Step C: ELISA Assay
1. Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples to respective wells coated
with walnut antigens followed by positive and negative control
wells.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash the plate adequately using washing buffer to remove any
unbound antibodies.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for another hour.
6. Perform another washing step to remove unbound enzyme
conjugate.
7. Add 100µL of substrate solution and incubate the plate at room
temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
9. Read the absorbance at the optimal wavelength specified in the
kit insert using an ELISA plate reader.
Step D: Calculation and Interpretation
1. Calculate the concentration of Walnut-specific IgE antibodies in
the serum samples based on the absorbance using the
standard curve generated with known concentrations of IgE.
2. Use controls to ensure the accuracy of the results. If controls
fall outside recommended thresholds, repeat the assay.
Step E: Reporting Results
1. Document all results accurately in the designated lab
information system (LIS).
2. Report all test results following site-specific reporting
guidelines.
3. Flag and report critical values to the attending physician
immediately.
Step F: Quality Control
1. Run quality control serum samples (positive and negative) with
each batch of ELISA tests.
2. Verify the ELISA plate reader's calibration monthly.
3. Maintain documentation of all equipment used including serial
numbers and calibration dates.
