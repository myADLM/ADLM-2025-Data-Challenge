Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for WALNUT-FOOD, IGE, WITH REFLEX TO
WALNUT-FOOD COMPONENTS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
Walnut-Food IgE levels in serum, with reflex testing for Walnut-Food
components IgE when appropriate.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory technologists will perform the analysis and
documentation of results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
that technologists follow the procedures and for reviewing and
authorizing reported results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
A. Specimen Type: - Serum.
B. Collection and Handling: - Preferred: Collect blood into a serum
separator tube (SST). - Centrifuge at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to
separate serum. - Aliquot serum into a clean tube if not using SST. -
Store and transport serum at 2-8°C if processed within 48 hours,
otherwise freeze at -20°C or lower.
C. Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. - Specimens not stored or transported under specified
conditions. - Specimens containing obvious particulate material.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
A. Equipment: - Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Analyser
A123).
B. Reagents: - Specific IgE reagent kits for Walnut-Food and Walnut-
Food components. - Calibrators and controls specific to the
immunoassay platform.
C. Supplies: - Micropipettes and tips. - Tubes for sample aliquots. -
Labeled storage containers.
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Initial Analysis – Walnut-Food, IgE: 1. Prepare the immunoassay
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Load patient
serum samples along with appropriate calibrators, controls, and
reagents onto the analyzer. 3. Follow the specified immunoassay
procedure for total Walnut-Food IgE determination. 4. Upon
completion, review and record results.
B. Reflex Testing (If Total Walnut-Food IgE is Positive): 1. If the initial
Walnut-Food IgE test is above the predefined threshold indicating a
positive result, prepare to run reflex tests for Walnut-Food component
IgE. 2. Load new reagent kits for Walnut-Food component IgEs onto
the analyzer. 3. Process the same serum samples for specific
Walnut-Food component IgEs. 4. Follow the specific assay
procedures and guidelines for the identification of individual Walnut-
Food component IgEs.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
A. Internal Quality Control: - Run daily quality controls (high, medium,
and low) before patient samples. - Verify that control results fall within
the specified range. - Document all control results and take corrective
actions if controls are out of range.
B. External Quality Assurance: - Participate in external proficiency
testing programs. - Review and compare proficiency testing results to
ensure analytical performance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
A. Reporting Total Walnut-Food IgE: - Enter results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). - Values are reported in kUA/L.
B. Reflex Testing and Reporting: - If reflex testing is conducted, report
individual Walnut-Food component IgEs. - Annotate results in the LIS,
recording values in kUA/L.
C. Critical Results: - Immediate notification of critical positive IgE
levels to the requesting clinician. - Document communication
according to laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Total Walnut-Food IgE: < 0.35 kUA/L (negative)
• Individual Walnut-Food components IgE reference intervals are
provided with the reagent kit insert.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the immunoassay kit insert for specific conditions and
limitations of the test.
• Consider potential cross-reactivity with other nut allergens.
