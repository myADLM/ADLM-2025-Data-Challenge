Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) WALNUT COMPONENT
RJUG R 1 ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures
for the analytical phase of generating results for the WALNUT
COMPONENT RJUG R 1 assay. This SOP ensures consistency,
accuracy, and regulatory compliance during the analytical testing of
medical laboratory samples containing walnut allergen components.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this SOP to analyze samples and generate results
accordingly. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to
ensure that staff members are adequately trained and comply with
the SOP.
3. SPECIMEN The WALNUT COMPONENT RJUG R 1 assay is
designed to analyze serum samples. Ensure specimens are properly
accessioned and prepared before starting the analytical procedure.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Calibrators, Controls, and Reagents specific to WALNUT
COMPONENT RJUG R 1
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Required Quality Control (QC) materials
5. PROCEDURE
A) Instrument Setup
1. Power on the Automated Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Ensure that all necessary reagents, calibrators, and controls for
WALNUT COMPONENT RJUG R 1 are available and not
expired.
3. Perform a daily instrument check following the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Calibrate the instrument using designated calibrators.
Calibration must be performed daily or as recommended by the
manufacturer.
B) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge serum separator or plain red-top tubes at 3000 x g
for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean labeled tube.
3. Ensure that the sample is free of hemolysis, lipemia, or
particles that could interfere with the assay.
C) Quality Control
1. Run QC materials alongside patient samples to monitor assay
performance.
2. Use at least two levels of QC materials (normal and abnormal).
3. Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results. Document findings.
D) Analytical Procedure
1. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and QC
materials into the designated slots on the Automated
Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Select the WALNUT COMPONENT RJUG R 1 assay from the
test menu.
3. Start the assay run, following the manufacturer's detailed
operational procedures.
4. Monitor the assay progress and ensure that no error messages
are displayed.
E) Troubleshooting
1. Investigate any error messages or faulty results by referring to
the manufacturer's troubleshooting manual.
2. If QC results are out of range, recalibrate the instrument and
rerun the QC.
3. If the problem persists, contact technical support for the
equipment and notify the supervisor.
6. RESULT REPORTING
1. Once the assay is completed, review and verify the results
generated by the Automated Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
3. Any critical results must be promptly communicated to the
physician or clinical team following laboratory policy.
4. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's assay insert for specific limitations and
potential interferences associated with the WALNUT COMPONENT
RJUG R 1 assay.
