Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for WALNUT COMPONENT RJUG R 3
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for the WALNUT
COMPONENT RJUG R 3 test to ensure accuracy and
consistency. This procedure encompasses all steps from
preparing the sample to recording results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel
to follow this SOP precisely to ensure accurate and reliable results.
All laboratory staff must be acquainted with this SOP and perform all
tasks accordingly.
1. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
• Blood/plasma sample previously collected and stored according
to sample collection SOP (include specific sample type and
storage requirements if necessary).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are poorly labeled, incorrect type, improperly
stored, or past the stability time frame.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• WALNUT COMPONENT RJUG R 3 reagent kit (stored as
specified by the manufacturer)
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Appropriate incubation units
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
2. Thaw frozen samples to room temperature before beginning the
assay.
3. Mix samples gently by vortexing briefly to ensure homogeneity.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare reagents as specified in the WALNUT COMPONENT
RJUG R 3 reagent kit insert.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the equipment as per manufacturer's
guidelines if required.
2. Run quality control samples to verify the accuracy and precision
of the reagents and assay procedure. Follow manufacturer’s
instructions for minimum and maximum acceptable QC results.
D) Test Procedure:
1. Label all necessary tubes/plates for the number of samples and
controls to be run.
2. Pipette the specified amount of reagent into each tube/plate as
instructed in the reagent kit.
3. Add the prepared sample to the tubes/plates, ensuring correct
volumes and avoiding cross-contamination.
4. Vortex the tubes/plates briefly to mix the contents.
5. Incubate the tubes/plates at the specified temperature and
duration as per the reagent kit instructions.
6. Following incubation, proceed with the next steps as provided
by the reagent kit, such as washing and developing stages.
E) Detection:
1. Perform detection using the prescribed instrument settings for
the WALNUT COMPONENT RJUG R 3 assay.
2. Ensure that the instrument is properly calibrated and that
detection parameters are set according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. After completion of the assay, read and interpret the results as
specified by the WALNUT COMPONENT RJUG R 3 assay kit.
5. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
following the standard reporting guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
7. Ensure that control samples fall within the acceptable range
before validating patient results.
8. If control results are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the guidelines provided by the kit manufacturer,
then repeat the assay if necessary.
9. Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
10. MAINTENANCE
11. Clean and maintain all equipment as per the manufacturer's
instructions after each batch of tests.
12. Replace any worn-out or expired reagents and supplies.
13. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
14. Always follow laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
PPE.
15. Handle all samples and reagents according to biosafety
regulations to prevent contamination and ensure personal
safety.
