Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for WALNUT FOOD (JUGLANS SPP) IgG
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the measurement of IgG
antibodies specific to walnut food allergens (Juglans spp) in serum or
plasma samples. This document aims to ensure consistent and
reliable test results and adherence to all relevant laboratory
regulations and standards.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel who operate the necessary
equipment and conduct these tests are responsible for following this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the supervisors to ensure that all
personnel are adequately trained and that all testing procedures
comply with this SOP.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of the workflow, following
specimen collection, reception, accessioning, and prior to post-
analytical reporting.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader or CLIA
instrument)
• Microplate washer
• Precision pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Incubator
Reagents and Supplies:
• Walnut (Juglans spp) IgG-specific assay kit (e.g., ELISA kits)
• Control samples (positive and negative)
• Quality control materials
• Calibrators/Standards
• Dilution buffers
• Wash buffers
• Substrate reagents
• Stop solution
• Sample tubes for serum or plasma
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Fresh serum or plasma sample
• Minimum volume: 200 µL
• Collection tubes (serum separator tube, lithium heparin tube for
plasma)
Unacceptable:
• Specimen with excessive hemolysis
• Clotted specimens for plasma samples
• Samples not properly labeled or lacking collection details
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Ensure that all equipment is properly calibrated and ready for
use.
2. Bring samples, controls, and reagents to room temperature
before use.
3. Label all plates and tubes correctly to prevent mix-ups.
5.2 Assay Procedure (Using ELISA method as an example):
1. Pipette 100 µL of standard, controls, and diluted samples into
their respective wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Dilute serum or plasma samples 1:100 in provided sample
diluent.
2. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Wash the plate three times with provided wash buffer using a
plate washer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugate into each well.
5. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Wash the plate seven times with wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution into each well.
8. Incubate in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution into each well to end the reaction.
10. Read the optical density (OD) values at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
5.3 Data Analysis:
1. Generate the standard curve using the OD values of the
standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of walnut (Juglans spp) IgG in each
sample using the standard curve.
3. Ensure that control samples fall within their respective ranges.
4. Report sample results in arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) or
other appropriate units as defined by the assay kit used.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Include positive and negative control samples in each run.
7. Run quality control tests at the beginning of each shift and
when there is a change in reagent lot numbers.
8. Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for acceptable ranges of
control values.
9. Document all quality control data in compliance with laboratory
practices.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Enter all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review.
12. Verified results should be reported according to laboratory
protocol to ensure data integrity.
13. Critical or unexpected results should be reviewed by a
supervisor.
14. Use appropriate flags or comments for samples with potential
interference or abnormal findings.
15. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Evaluate sample integrity before analysis (e.g., check for
hemolysis).
• Use best judgment in reporting results, particularly in cases of
flagged or questionable results.
• If necessary, request a repeat sample or additional testing to
ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions provided with the testing kit.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines.
• CLIA regulations and other relevant laboratory standards.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can consistently produce
accurate and reliable results for walnut food (Juglans spp) IgG
analysis. This ensures that the laboratory maintains high standards of
practice and compliance with regulatory requirements.
Note: This document should be reviewed and approved by the
laboratory supervisor and/or quality assurance manager before
implementation.
