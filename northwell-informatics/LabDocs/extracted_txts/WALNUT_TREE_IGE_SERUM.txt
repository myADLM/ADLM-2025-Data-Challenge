Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase
WALNUT TREE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
determination of Walnut Tree-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels
in serum specimens using immunoassay techniques. This protocol
ensures consistent and accurate results, contributing to the diagnosis
and management of patients with walnut tree allergies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel involved in this
procedure to adhere to the steps outlined below and to ensure the
quality and accuracy of test results.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250,
ImmunoCAP 250)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• Walnut Tree-specific IgE assay kit (e.g., ImmunoCAP Walnut Tree
IgE)
• Calibration reagents
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high controls)
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Sample cups/vials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
Serum collected in SST from venous blood.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for 7 days at 2-8°C post-collection.
• For longer storage, specimens can be frozen at -20°C for up to 1
month. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens stored improperly or not labeled correctly.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Check the expiration date and lot numbers of the assay kit and
reagents.
2. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer following the
manufacturer’s instructions, including priming, calibration, and
running any required maintenance procedures.
Sample Processing:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature if stored at
2-8°C.
2. Centrifuge the SST tubes for 10 minutes at 2,000-3,000 rcf
(relative centrifugal force) to separate serum from blood cells.
3. Transfer the serum to appropriately labeled sample cups/vials.
Assay Execution:
1. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and quality
control materials into the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay settings for
Walnut Tree-specific IgE detection.
3. Start the assay run and monitor the analyzer for any error
messages or alerts during the process.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials (low, medium, and high) with each
batch of samples.
2. Ensure that the control values fall within the acceptable range
as specified by the manufacturer and internal laboratory
guidelines.
3. Document quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
Result Generation:
1. Review all results generated by the immunoassay analyzer for
discrepancies or alerts.
2. Reanalyze any sample with error messages or unexpected
results.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Verification:
1. Verify all results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) where available.
2. Ensure correct input of sample identification, collection dates,
and any relevant patient information.
Documentation:
1. Record results in the patient’s electronic health record or
laboratory report.
2. Document any deviations, problems, or corrective actions taken
in the assay run.
Reference Intervals: Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for the
specific assay kit reference intervals for Walnut Tree-specific IgE.
Critical Results: Immediately notify the requesting physician for IgE
levels indicating severe allergic sensitivity according to predefined
critical values.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Regularly conduct comparisons between different batches of assay
kits to ensure consistency in results. Participate in internal and
external proficiency testing programs.

insert for detailed limitations of the Walnut Tree-specific IgE assay.
9. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or upon introduction of new
equipment, reagents, or methods.
