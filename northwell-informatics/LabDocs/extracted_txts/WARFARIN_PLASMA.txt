Warfarin Testing Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of warfarin concentrations
in plasma samples, ensuring accurate and reliable results for patient
management.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform,
monitor, and document all procedures related to warfarin analysis
according to this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). All staff must
report any deviations or issues encountered during the analysis to a
supervisor immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
• Warfarin Calibrators.
• Quality Control (QC) materials.
• Analytical grade methanol, acetonitrile, and water.
• Plasma sample collection tubes with anticoagulant (e.g., EDTA or
citrate).
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• HPLC vials or LC-MS/MS sample vials.
• Analytical balance.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Plasma Preferred Collection Tube: EDTA or Citrate
plasma tubes Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL plasma Stability:
Plasma samples are stable for up to 72 hours when stored at 4°C.
For long-term storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples that have been hemolyzed.
• Plasma that has not been properly separated from cells within 2
hours of collection.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA or Citrate.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Upon receipt, verify that the specimen corresponds to the
patient's details and requisition form.
2. Centrifuge the plasma collection tubes at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate plasma.
3. Carefully transfer the plasma to a clean, labeled tube.
4. If the sample cannot be analyzed immediately, store at 4°C or
freeze at -20°C or lower for future analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Run appropriate warfarin calibrators at multiple concentrations
to establish a calibration curve.
2. Prepare and run QC materials at low, medium, and high
concentrations to verify the calibration curve's accuracy.
3. Calibrators and QC materials should be analyzed at the
beginning and end of each batch of samples.
C) Analysis
1. Prepare standard solutions of warfarin in suitable solvents (e.g.,
methanol or acetonitrile).
2. Prepare samples by adding a specified volume of plasma to an
appropriate mixture of extraction solvents as per the HPLC or
LC-MS/MS method.
3. Vortex mix the samples for at least 1 minute.
4. Centrifuge the samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
5. Transfer the supernatant to HPLC or LC-MS/MS vials.
6. Load the vials into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system, ensuring
proper alignment and order according to the instrument's
capacity and software.
D) Instrumentation
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for operating the HPLC
or LC-MS/MS systems.
2. Ensure that the instrument parameters, such as flow rate,
column temperature, and detection wavelength or ion source
parameters, are set according to the validated method for
warfarin analysis.
3. Run the sample sequence, including blanks, calibrators, QC
materials, and patient samples.
4. Monitor the analysis to ensure no deviations or errors occur.
E) Data Analysis
1. Review the chromatograms or spectral data for each sample.
2. Calculate the warfarin concentrations using the established
calibration curve.
3. Compare the results of QC materials to their expected
concentrations to ensure accuracy.
4. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, identify and resolve
the issue before reporting patient results.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Results should be reviewed and verified by designated
personnel.
7. Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8. Notify the appropriate clinical staff of critical results, including
results that indicate a significantly high or low warfarin level.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
10. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the HPLC or
LC-MS/MS system as specified by the manufacturer.
11. Document all quality control activities, including calibrations,
QC material runs, and instrument maintenance.
12. Participate in external proficiency testing programs as available
to validate the accuracy and reliability of warfarin testing.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
14. In the event of instrument malfunction or unexpected results,
refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by the equipment
manufacturer.
15. Document all troubleshooting steps taken and any corrective
actions implemented.
16. Notify a supervisor of any unresolved issues.
17. REFERENCES
18. Manufacturer's instructions for HPLC or LC-MS/MS systems.
19. Scientific literature regarding warfarin pharmacokinetics and
analytical methods.
20. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
guidelines.
21. Related SOPs for sample handling, instrument operation, and
quality control.
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to
ensure accuracy and compliance with regulatory standards.
