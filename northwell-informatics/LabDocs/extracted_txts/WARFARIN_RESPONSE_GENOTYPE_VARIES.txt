STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Warfarin Response Genotype Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardized procedure for
performing Warfarin Response Genotype analysis to predict patient
response to warfarin therapy. The results of this test are intended to
guide healthcare providers in tailoring warfarin doses to optimize
therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable test results. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for confirming that procedures are
followed and quality control measures are implemented.
1. DEFINITION
Warfarin Response Genotyping tests for genetic variations that affect
the metabolism and sensitivity to warfarin. Key genes analyzed
include:
• CYP2C9: Cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme involved in the
metabolism of warfarin.
• VKORC1: Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1, the
target enzyme for warfarin.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Whole blood, collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen Volume: A minimum of 3 mL.
• Stability: Specimens should be refrigerated (2-8°C) and
processed within 7 days of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (validated for use in clinical laboratories).
• Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents.
• Genotyping assay kit for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 (e.g., TaqMan
SNP Genotyping Assays).
• PCR thermal cycler.
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus or real-time PCR analyzer.
• Labeled microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and sterile water.
• TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Label microcentrifuge tubes with patient identifiers.
2. Add 200 µL whole blood into a labeled tube.
3. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol.
4. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
5. Store DNA at -20°C until ready for use in downstream
genotyping.
B) Genotyping Assay:
1. Prepare the master mix according to the genotyping assay kit
instructions.
◦ Include PCR buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2, primers specific for
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms, and DNA
polymerase.
2. Add 1 µL of extracted DNA to each reaction well.
3. Seal wells and load the samples onto the PCR thermal cycler.
4. Run the PCR program as specified in the assay kit manual.
C) Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Analyze the amplification products using either gel
electrophoresis or real-time PCR detection:
◦ For gel electrophoresis, load PCR products on an agarose
gel, run the gel, and visualize the bands under UV light.
◦ For real-time PCR, follow the equipment instructions to read
fluorescence signals from the amplification plots.
2. Interpret the genotype based on the presence or absence of
specific SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms).
D) Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples to
ensure test validity.
2. Document all quality control results and monitor for any
deviations from expected outcomes.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results as Wild-type (WT), Heterozygous (Het), or
Homozygous Variant (Var) for each polymorphism in CYP2C9 and
VKORC1.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include an interpretation of the results in the final report, indicating
predicted warfarin sensitivity or resistance.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATIONS
• Results should indicate the presence of specific alleles that
influence warfarin metabolism and sensitivity.
◦ CYP2C9:
▪ Normal function (WT: *1/*1)
▪ Reduced function (Het: *1/*2, Var: *2/*2, *1/*3, etc.)
◦ VKORC1:
▪ Normal sensitivity (WT: G/G)
▪ Increased sensitivity (Het: G/A, Var: A/A)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure bi-weekly and monthly quality control checks for
equipment and reagents.
• Perform periodic inter-laboratory comparisons to maintain
accuracy and precision.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kit and genotyping
assay kits.
• Relevant literature and guidelines on warfarin pharmacogenetics.
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs of specimen receipt, DNA extraction, PCR assay
runs, and quality control results.
• Ensure entries are initialed and dated by laboratory personnel
performing the tasks.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all safety protocols and wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle blood specimens and reagents in accordance with
biosafety guidelines to prevent contamination.
