Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure for
Quantification of Serum IgE Specific to Wasp Venom
1. PURPOSE To outline the step-by-step procedure for the
quantitative determination of serum IgE antibodies specific to
wasp venom using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the assay for quantification of IgE specific to wasp
venom using serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the assay, documenting the results, and ensuring all equipment is
calibrated and functioning correctly.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying the accuracy of results
and addressing any issues or deviations from the standard
protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STORAGE
• Specimen: Serum collected from venous blood.
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-top tube.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature and then
centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
• Separate the serum and store at 2-8°C if the assay will be
performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze the serum
at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader with appropriate filters
• Microplate washer
• Calibrated pipettes and pipette tips
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Wasp venom IgE ELISA kit (including microtiter plate, standards,
controls, conjugate, substrate, and other necessary reagents)
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
2. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
3. Prepare the microtiter plate according to the ELISA kit
instructions, ensuring proper labeling of wells for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum samples
to the designated wells.
2. Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at room temperature.
3. Aspirate and wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer to
remove unbound material.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Aspirate and wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the optical density (OD) at the appropriate wavelength
(typically 450 nm) using the ELISA reader within 30 minutes of
adding the stop solution.
C. Calculation of Results
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their corresponding concentrations using a
suitable software or manually.
2. Determine the IgE concentration of the patient samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
3. Report the results in IU/mL (International Units per milliliter).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the assay with both positive and negative controls to ensure
the validity of the results.
• If controls do not fall within the specified range, the assay is
invalid, and the samples must be retested.
• Document all control results in the assay log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the results in IU/mL with a reference interval for the
specific IgE concentration to wasp venom.
• Any results outside the reference interval should be flagged and
reviewed by the laboratory supervisor.
• Document any anomalies or issues encountered during the assay.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Samples with high levels of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may
interfere with assay results.
• Ensure that serum samples are free from any visible particulates
before use.
