Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for WATERMELON, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for Watermelon-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum,
ensuring accurate and reliable outcomes that inform clinical
decisions.
Responsibility: All laboratory technologists and personnel involved in
the analysis of Watermelon IgE in serum are responsible for adhering
to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the designated staff to ensure
quality control, proper documentation, and timely reporting of results.
1. DEFINITION
Watermelon-specific IgE refers to the immunoglobulin E antibodies
present in the serum that is specific to antigens found in watermelon.
Elevated levels indicate an allergic response to watermelon.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen: Serum
Minimum Volume: 1 mL
Collection: Collect blood via venipuncture and allow it to clot. Centrifuge and separate the serum within 2 hours of collection.
Storage: Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be done within 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
- Hemolyzed specimens
- Contaminated specimens
- Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or heparin tubes
3.2 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250)
Calibrators and controls specific for Watermelon IgE
Microtiter plates
Pipettes and tips
Wash buffer
Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
Stop solution
Sample diluent
Disposable gloves and lab coat
3.3 Testing Procedure
3.3.1 Sample Preparation
Ensure the specimen is at room temperature (20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
For spefici assays ensuring the usage of appropriate diluent if specified in the kit insert.
3.3.2 Assay Setup
1. Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Label the microtiter plate with appropriate patient identifiers and control labels.
3. Add 100 µl of sample diluent to each well.
4. Add 10 µl of calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples to the designated wells.
5. Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at room temperature.
6. Wash the wells 3 times with 300 µl of wash buffer, ensuring complete removal of liquid after each wash.
3.3.3 Detection
1. Add 100 µl of enzyme-conjugated antibody to each well and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Wash the wells 3 times with 300 µl of wash buffer.
3. Add 100 µl of substrate solution to each well and incubate for 15 minutes in the dark.
4. Add 50 µl of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
3.3.4 Measurement and Analysis
1. Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
2. Generate standard curves using the OD values from the calibrators.
3. Calculate the concentration of Watermelon IgE in each patient's serum from the standard curve.
3.4 Quality Control
Include controls (both positive and negative) in each run to ensure assay validity.
Results for controls should be within the acceptable range as specified by the control manufacturer.
Any run that does not meet quality control criteria must be repeated. Document any deviations or anomalies.
3.5 Reporting Results
Transmit results automatically to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) following verification by the technologist.
Ensure results are accurately recorded and documented in the patient file.
Results must be interpreted by a qualified clinician.
