STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Watermelon IgG
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the analytical phase in the generation of
results for Watermelon IgG testing, ensuring accuracy, consistency,
and compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the procedures outlined in this SOP and to ensure the quality and
integrity of Watermelon IgG test results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader
• Incubators (set at 37°C)
• Microplate washer
• Adjustable micropipettes (volumes 20-200 µL and 200-1000 µL)
• Multichannel pipette (if available)
Reagents:
• Watermelon IgG ELISA test kit (including coated microplates,
standards, controls, enzyme conjugate, substrate reagent, stop
solution, wash buffer, and sample diluent)
• Calibrators and Quality Control samples (provided in the ELISA
kit)
• Deionized water
Supplies:
• Disposable pipette tips
• 96-well ELISA plates
• Absorbent paper
• Laboratory timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Quality Control:
• Ensure all reagents and controls are within their expiration date
before use.
• Run control samples to verify the system's accuracy and precision
per the QC section.
1. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw patient sera and control samples at room temperature. Mix
gently by inversion.
• Prepare samples and controls according to manufacturer's
instructions, typically diluting the sera 1:100 with the provided
sample diluent.
B. Assay Steps
1. Plate Setup:
• Arrange standards, controls, and patient samples as per the plate
layout provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
1. Addition of Reagents:
• Pipette 100 µL of each standard, control, and diluted sample into
the appropriate wells.
• Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
• Cover the plate with adhesive sealing film to prevent evaporation.
1. Incubation:
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes in the incubator.
1. Washing:
• After incubation, remove the sealing film and wash the plate with
wash buffer. This typically involves 5 successive washes (consult
the kit manual for specific instructions).
• Ensure wells are filled completely and aspirated properly each
time.
1. Substrate Addition:
• Add 100 µL of the substrate reagent to each well.
• Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes (consult kit instructions).
1. Stopping Reaction:
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well. The solution will change
color, indicating the reaction has been halted.
1. Reading the Plate:
• Read the plate immediately at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.
C. Data Analysis
1. Determine Standard Curve:
• Plot the optical density (OD) values of the standards against their
corresponding concentrations to establish the standard curve.
1. Calculate Concentrations:
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
Watermelon IgG in patient samples and controls.
D. Interpretation and Verification
1. Reference Ranges:
• Establish reference ranges using historical data or provided kit
instructions.
1. Quality Control:
• Review control samples to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range.
• Investigate any outliers or irregular results.
1. Verification:
• Peer review by a second technologist or verification by
supervisory staff before reporting results.
E. Reporting Results
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
patient reports.
• Verify that all results are accurate and properly documented
before final submission.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Materials:
• Include normal and high-level control samples from the kit or an
external QC program.
1. Frequency:
• Perform quality control at the beginning of each run and at regular
intervals as defined in the kit instructions.
1. Corrective Actions:
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable ranges, troubleshoot to
identify sources of error (e.g., reagent integrity, technique,
equipment functionality).
• Re-run controls and samples as necessary before reporting
patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Interpret results based on the established reference ranges for
Watermelon IgG.
• Report results in compliance with laboratory standards and
procedures, including proper documentation in patient records.
1. REFERENCES
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions included in the Watermelon
IgG ELISA kit.
• Relevant literature and regulatory guidelines (e.g., CLIA, ISO).
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Ensure all steps, observations, and deviations are recorded
accurately.
• Review and update the SOP annually or as needed for changes in
regulations or methodologies.
Note: Specific details, such as incubator temperatures, timing, and
reagent volumes, may vary depending on the kit manufacturer.
Always refer to the kit instructions for the most accurate and relevant
details for conducting the test.
