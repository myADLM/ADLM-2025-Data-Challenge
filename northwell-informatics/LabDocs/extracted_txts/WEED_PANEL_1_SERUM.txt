Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase: WEED PANEL # 1, SERUM
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase procedures
for generating results for the WEED PANEL # 1, SERUM test. This
panel is used for detecting and quantifying levels of specific
cannabinoids in serum samples.
1. Scope
This procedure applies to all serum samples received in the
laboratory for WEED PANEL # 1 testing.
1. Responsibilities
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
test, interpreting the results, and documenting according to this
SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure all staff are
adequately trained and the procedure is followed properly.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 5 mL of serum collected via venipuncture, preferably using a
red-top tube without additives or a serum separator tube
(SST).
◦ Serum should be separated from clot within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C if not immediately processed.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
◦ Specimens collected in tubes labeled with incorrect patient
identification or collection date/time.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass
Spectrometry)
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Calibration standards for cannabinoids
• Mobile phase reagents
• Extraction solvents
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. Procedure
Sample Preparation
1. Ensure serum samples are properly labeled and have no visible
hemolysis or lipemia.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain
clear serum.
3. Transfer the serum to appropriately labeled aliquot tubes.
Extraction
1. Add internal standards to the serum aliquots.
2. Vortex the samples for thorough mixing.
3. Perform solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction,
following the specified protocol for cannabinoids.
4. Evaporate the solvents under nitrogen at room temperature.
Instrument Setup and Calibration
1. Prepare calibration standards for each cannabinoid analyte.
2. Set up the LC-MS/MS with appropriate columns and mobile
phases.
3. Run initial calibration using prepared standard curves.
4. Validate the calibration curves prior to running patient samples.
Sample Analysis
1. Load extracted patient samples onto the LC-MS/MS.
2. Follow the LC-MS/MS operational protocols for analysis.
3. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
ensure precision and accuracy.
Result Interpretation
1. Evaluate and interpret the chromatograms using the
instrument's software.
2. Confirm the identification and quantification of cannabinoid
levels in patient samples.
3. Flag any abnormal or critical results according to laboratory
guidelines.
4. Quality Control
• Run high, medium, and low concentration quality control samples
with each batch of patient samples.
• Document control results and ensure they fall within established
acceptable ranges.
• Perform equipment maintenance and calibration checks as
scheduled.
1. Reporting Results
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include a full interpretation of the cannabinoid levels detected in
the serum.
• Report critical results immediately to the ordering clinician
following the protocol for communication of critical values.
1. Reference Intervals
Refer to assay-specific reference intervals provided in the method
validation documentation.
1. Method Limitations
Refer to LC-MS/MS instrument manual and reagent inserts for any
limitations. Factors such as sample hemolysis or the presence of
interfering substances can affect the accuracy of results.
1. Safety Considerations
• Wear PPE at all times in the laboratory.
• Handle all solvents and samples with care, following safety
protocols.
• Dispose of waste according to laboratory safety guidelines.
