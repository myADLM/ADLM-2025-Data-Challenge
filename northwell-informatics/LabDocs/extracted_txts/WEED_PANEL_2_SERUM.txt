Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for WEED PANEL #2,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analysis and
reporting of results for WEED PANEL #2 in serum specimens
using appropriate methodologies ensuring accuracy, precision,
and compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
◦ Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
◦ Specimen must be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection
and the serum separated from cells.
Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Clotted specimens
◦ Hemolyzed specimens
◦ Specimens not centrifuged within the required time frame.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer or Tandem Mass
Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific for WEED PANEL #2.
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Laboratory information system (LIS)
◦ Reagents:
▪ Extraction solvents (if applicable)
▪ Specific antibodies/probes for targeted analytes in
immunoassay
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use certified and traceable calibration standards.
◦ Perform calibration with each new batch of reagents and at
set intervals.
◦ Run quality control samples at multiple levels (e.g.,
negative, low positive, high positive) with each batch of
patient samples according to laboratory policy.
◦ Document all QC data and review for out-of-range results
before proceeding with patient testing.
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow the serum tubes to reach room temperature.
◦ If serum separator tubes are used, verify the absence of gel
leakage into the serum.
For Immunoassay Analysis:
◦ Load the appropriate calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into the instrument.
◦ Program the assay into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure the instrument is in calibration and quality controls
are within established ranges before analyzing patient
specimens.
◦ Follow the analyzer’s instructions for the assay procedure,
including any necessary temperature controls and
incubation steps.
For LC-MS/MS Analysis:
◦ Prepare calibrators, controls, and patient samples as per
validated extraction method (e.g., protein precipitation, solid-
phase extraction).
◦ Load prepared extracts into the LC-MS/MS along with
appropriate parameters/settings pre-determined for WEED
PANEL #2.
◦ Ensure instrument calibration and appropriate settings (e.g.,
internal standards, ion transitions).
◦ Run the samples in accordance with the validated method
protocols.
6. ANALYTE SPECIFIC PARAMETERS:
Each analyte in the WEED PANEL #2 (e.g., THC, CBD, other
cannabidiols) has specific parameters:
◦ Specified retention times for LC-MS/MS or appropriate
antibody interactions in immunoassay.
◦ Acceptable ranges for control and patient sample results as
outlined in the assay package insert or validated protocol.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS once
validated in the system.
◦ Review and verify each result for individual analytes against
the reference intervals.
◦ Communicate critical results as defined in the laboratory’s
critical results policy to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider immediately.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ THC: Negative
◦ CBD: Negative
◦ 11-OH-THC: Negative
◦ Carboxy-THC: Negative
◦ Additional cannabidiols: Negative
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert and validated
protocol for specific method limitations and cross-reactivity.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW:
◦ Ensure all steps, from sample receipt, preparation, analysis,
QC, and result entry, are documented in the laboratory
information system.
◦ Regular review and audit of results, instrumentation, and
methodologies should be performed, addressing any
discrepancies or deviations.
11. REFERENCES:
◦ Analyzer or LC-MS/MS Manufacturer’s manual and product
inserts
◦ Package inserts of kits and reagents used for WEED PANEL
#2
◦ Laboratory’s internal validation documents.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory aims to ensure consistent,
accurate, and timely analysis of WEED PANEL #2, SERUM
specimens, maintaining the highest standards of quality and
compliance with regulatory requirements.
