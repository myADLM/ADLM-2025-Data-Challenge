STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Weed Panel #3, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed
instructions for the analysis and reporting of Weed Panel #3 in
serum samples. This protocol ensures the accurate and
consistent detection of specific analytes in marijuana testing,
maintaining compliance with regulatory standards and
laboratory quality requirements.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the
analytical testing phase for Weed Panel #3 in serum samples
within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
and ensure that testing is conducted according to established
guidelines.
• Designated staff are responsible for the documentation and
validation of results.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing adherence to the
SOP, addressing deficiencies, and ensuring corrective actions are
taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL serum in a red-top tube without
anticoagulants.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens must be processed and tested
within 72 hours of collection. If specimens cannot be tested
immediately, they should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or
frozen at -20°C for long-term storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Certified reference standards for targeted cannabinoids (e.g.,
THC, CBD, CBN)
• Calibration curves for each analyte
• Reagent grade chemicals and solvents (e.g., methanol,
acetonitrile, deionized water)
• Laboratory glassware and pipettes
• Centrifuge
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily calibration of the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS using
certified reference standards.
• Run quality control samples alongside patient samples, using
negative and positive controls covering a range of expected
concentrations for each analyte in the panel.
• Internal standards should be included in each run to monitor
instrument performance and data integrity.
• Calibration curves should be established for each analyte using at
least five calibration points encompassing the range of the assay.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples to room temperature and allow
refrigerated samples to equilibrate.
2. Centrifuge serum specimens at 1500-2000 g for 10
minutes to remove particulates.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled tube.
B. Extraction:
1. Add an equal volume of acetonitrile to the serum sample to
precipitate proteins.
2. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
3. Centrifuge at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
vial for analysis.
C. Instrumental Analysis:
1. Load samples, calibration standards, and quality control
materials into the autosampler.
2. Set up and run the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS following
manufacturer’s instructions, using appropriate method
parameters for the detection of cannabinoids.
3. Analyze data, and verify the presence and concentration of
target analytes.
4. DATA ANALYSIS
• Raw data should be processed using appropriate software to
quantify concentrations of each analyte versus established
calibration curves.
• Ensure that each target analyte falls within the linear range of the
calibration curve.
• Review chromatograms for any irregularities or artifacts.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented and reviewed for accuracy.
• Reference intervals should be clearly specified in the final report.
• Any anomalous results or interferences should be noted, and an
additional comment should be included in the report if unable to
obtain a definitive result.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Follow the laboratory’s established quality control program,
addressing any quality control failures by reviewing and possibly
reanalyzing problematic samples.
• Maintain regular maintenance logs for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
equipment used in the analysis, ensuring adherence to calibration
and maintenance schedules.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps taken in the analysis, including sample
handling, instrument settings, data analysis, quality control
results, and final reporting.
• Records must be kept organized and readily available for review
or in case of audit.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manual and calibration certificate for GC-MS or
LC-MS/MS.
• Regulatory guidelines and laboratory quality management
policies.
• Certified reference standard documentation for cannabinoids.
