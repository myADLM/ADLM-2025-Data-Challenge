Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for WEED
PANEL # 4, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the accurate
and timely analysis of serum samples for the Weed Panel # 4,
ensuring that all results are generated with the highest degree of
precision and reliability following Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) guidelines.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, validating results, and documenting the process following
this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
adherence to this SOP and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
2. DEFINITIONS
Weed Panel # 4: A toxicology panel designed to detect the presence
and concentration of cannabinoids and related substances in a
serum sample.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatograph-Tandem Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Automated pipettes and tips
• Serum sample tubes
• Calibrators and controls specific to the Weed Panel # 4
• Mobile phase reagents
• Internal standards
• Data management system (LIS)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Pre-Analytical Checks:
• Confirm sample identification and accession number.
• Check for proper sample volume and integrity.
• Store samples in appropriate conditions until analysis.
4.2 Calibrators and Controls:
• Prepare calibrators and quality controls according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Quality control materials must be stored at 2-8°C and brought to
room temperature before use.
• Calibrators and controls should encompass the expected
concentration range of the analytes.
4.3 Instrument Preparation:
• Check and document the readiness of the GC-MS/LC-MS/MS,
including carrier gas levels, column conditions, and detector
functioning.
• Prepare the mobile phase solutions and reagent blanks.
4.4 Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum samples to reach room temperature if previously
refrigerated.
• Vortex the sample tube to ensure homogeneity.
• Aliquot a specified volume of the serum sample into a clean
preparation tube.
• Add internal standard to the serum sample according to the
protocol.
• Perform any necessary extraction procedure (such as solid-phase
extraction) to prepare the samples for analysis.
4.5 Calibration Curve Generation:
• Run a full calibration curve with calibrators.
• Ensure that all quality control checks fall within acceptable ranges
as defined by the method's criteria.
• Document the calibration data and ensure calibration curve meets
the acceptance criteria before proceeding with sample analysis.
4.6 Sample Analysis:
• Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
the autosampler.
• Sequence the run starting with calibrators, followed by samples
and then controls.
• Monitor the run to ensure that the instrument is functioning
correctly.
• Document any interventions or unusual occurrences during the
run.
4.7 Data Analysis and Review:
• Review chromatograms and mass spectra for each sample,
calibrator, and control.
• Compare sample peak areas with those from calibrators to
quantify analytes.
• Validate quality controls before accepting sample results.
• Confirm that all results fall within predetermined acceptance
criteria.
• Document and address any out-of-range results.
4.8 Reporting Results:
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Attach comments regarding any sample or analytical anomalies
detected during the process.
• Verify results by senior technologist or designated personnel.
4.9 Post-Analytical Procedures:
• Dispose of the serum samples according to laboratory biohazard
protocols.
• Perform routine maintenance on the analytical instrument.
• Review and archive all analytical data as per laboratory policy for
traceability.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily running of internal and external quality controls.
• Regularly participate in proficiency testing.
• Calibrate and maintain equipment following manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Document any corrective actions taken for quality control failures.
6. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete Temperature Logs for reagent storage.
• Maintain Calibration and Quality Control Logs.
• Use Laboratory Information System (LIS) to track specimens and
results.
• Archive instrument printouts and data records as per regulatory
requirements.
