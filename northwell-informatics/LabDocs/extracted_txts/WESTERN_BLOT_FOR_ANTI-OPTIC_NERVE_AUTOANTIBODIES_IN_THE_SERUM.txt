Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Western Blot for Anti-
Optic Nerve Autoantibodies in Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for
detecting anti-optic nerve autoantibodies (against optic nerve
proteins) in the serum using the Western Blot technique. This
protocol ensures that the procedure is conducted accurately and
consistently, guaranteeing reliable and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel performing the
Western Blot procedure are responsible for adhering to this SOP and
properly documenting each step. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Western Blot: An analytical technique used to detect specific
proteins in a sample.
• Anti-Optic Nerve Autoantibodies: Autoantibodies directed
against proteins of the optic nerve, indicating an autoimmune
response.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection Container: Use a red-top (serum) tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 5 mL of blood.
• Stability: Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis will be done within 48
hours. For long-term storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ SDS-PAGE apparatus.
◦ Western Blot transfer unit.
◦ Blotting membrane (PVDF or nitrocellulose).
◦ Incubation trays.
◦ Shaker or rocker.
◦ Chemiluminescent detection system.
◦ Gel documentation system.
• Reagents:
◦ Optic nerve protein extract or recombinant proteins.
◦ SDS-PAGE running buffer.
◦ Transfer buffer.
◦ Blocking buffer (e.g., 5% non-fat dry milk or BSA in TBS-T).
◦ Primary antibody (patient's serum).
◦ Secondary antibody (goat anti-human IgG HRP conjugated).
◦ Chemiluminescent substrate.
◦ TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20).
◦ Sample loading buffer.
◦ Prestained protein ladder.
6. PROCEDURE A) Protein Electrophoresis
1. Prepare protein samples and controls in sample loading buffer;
heat at 95°C for 5 minutes.
2. Load the protein samples, controls, and the prestained protein
ladder onto an SDS-PAGE gel.
3. Run the gel at a constant voltage (e.g., 100V) until the dye front
reaches the bottom of the gel.
B) Protein Transfer
1. Prepare the transfer sandwich for the blotting membrane and
gel in the transfer buffer.
2. Transfer the proteins from the gel to the blotting membrane
using a transfer unit at 100V for 1 hour or overnight at 30V at
4°C.
C) Blocking
1. Incubate the membrane in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room
temperature with gentle agitation.
D) Antibody Incubation
1. Incubate the membrane with the patient's serum diluted
appropriately in blocking buffer (e.g., 1:100) overnight at 4°C
with gentle agitation.
2. Wash the membrane 3 times for 5 minutes each with TBS-T.
3. Incubate the membrane with an HRP-conjugated anti-human
IgG secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (e.g., 1:2000)
for 1 hour at room temperature.
4. Wash the membrane 3 times for 5 minutes each with TBS-T.
E) Detection
1. Incubate the membrane with chemiluminescent substrate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Detect and document the signals using a gel documentation
system.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
ensure the procedure's accuracy.
• Use a prestained protein ladder to confirm the molecular weights
of the detected proteins.
• Document all observations and deviations during the procedure.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare the bands obtained from the patient's serum with the
positive and negative controls.
• A positive result indicates the presence of autoantibodies against
optic nerve proteins.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the presence or absence of anti-optic nerve
autoantibodies.
• Include any relevant observations that could impact the results,
such as non-specific binding or technical issues.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Non-specific binding may occur, leading to false-positive results.
• Variations in protein transfer efficiency can affect the results.
• The detection limit is dependent on the sensitivity of the
chemiluminescent substrate.
11. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Adhere to standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Handle human serum samples with care, treating them as
potentially infectious.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and safety glasses.
