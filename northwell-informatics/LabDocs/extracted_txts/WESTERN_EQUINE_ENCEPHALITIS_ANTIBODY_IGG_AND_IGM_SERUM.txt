Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Western Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgG and IgM, Serum
1. Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standardized
procedure for the analysis and reporting of Western Equine
Encephalitis (WEE) Antibody, IgG and IgM, in serum samples to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel who perform
Western Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgG, and IgM testing,
ensuring compliance with CLIA regulations and laboratory
quality standards.
3. Responsibilities
• Qualified Laboratory Personnel: Responsible for performing the
assay according to this protocol, maintaining equipment, and
documenting temperature and humidity levels.
• Supervisors: Ensure that all personnel are trained and that
procedures are followed correctly. They address any issues
related to quality control and equipment maintenance.
• Designated Staff: Responsible for logging temperatures of
equipment and monitoring test performance.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection:
◦ Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
◦ Use a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (15-30 minutes for
SST).
◦ Centrifuge promptly (within 1 hour) at 2000-3000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a labeled aliquot tube if not using SST.
• Storage:
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if not tested immediately.
◦ For long-term storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
• Transport:
◦ Ship serum samples on cold packs if shipping to an external
laboratory.
1. Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies
• WEE IgG and IgM ELISA kits or equivalent
• Microplate reader (450 nm)
• Adjustable pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Plate washer (optional)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Absorbent paper
1. Quality Control
• Frequency: Include both positive and negative controls with each
batch of tests.
• Material: Use commercially available WEE IgG and IgM control
sera.
• Storage: Controls should be stored according to the
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Acceptability Criteria: Any deviation from expected control
values should be investigated, and corrective actions must be
documented.
1. Procedure
• Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature.
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Assay Steps:
1. Coating and Blocking Step (if required): Coat a
microplate with the antigen of interest (If not using pre-
coated plates).
2. Wash Step: Wash plates with wash buffer to remove
unbound components.
3. Sample Addition:
▪ Add diluted serum samples, positive control, and
negative control to wells.
▪ Incubate at 37°C for a specified time.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
▪ After the wash step, add the enzyme-conjugated
antibody (e.g., HRP-conjugated anti-IgG or anti-IgM) to
each well.
▪ Incubate at 37°C for another specified time.
5. Final Wash and Substrate Addition:
▪ Wash to remove unbound enzyme-conjugated
antibodies.
▪ Add substrate solution to each well.
6. Color Development:
▪ Incubate in the dark for the time stated in the protocol.
▪ Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
7. Read the Plate:
▪ Read absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes.
1. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
• Calculation:
◦ Generate a standard curve if required.
◦ Calculate sample concentrations based on the standard curve
or optical density (OD) values.
• Interpretation:
◦ Results are interpreted as Positive or Negative based on OD
values and kit cutoff values.
◦ IgG and IgM positivity indicates current or recent infection or
prior exposure to Western Equine Encephalitis virus.
1. Reporting of Results
• Documentation:
◦ Results are recorded in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist.
• Reference Intervals: Defined by the kit or established in the
laboratory:
◦ IgG: Negative, Equivocal, Positive
◦ IgM: Negative, Equivocal, Positive
• Critical Values: Report any critical results to the requesting
physician immediately.
1. Troubleshooting
• Quality Control Failures:
◦ Investigate the cause (e.g., reagent issues, equipment
malfunction).
◦ Repeat the assay with a new set of controls.
• High Background:
◦ Ensure proper washing techniques are used.

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory-specific SOP for ELISA testing.
1. Safety and Precautions
• Follow all biosafety guidelines when handling human serum
specimens.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to institutional and
federal guidelines.
This protocol will ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Western
Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgG and IgM, in serum testing,
contributing to precise diagnosis and clinical management.
