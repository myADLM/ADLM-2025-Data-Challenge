Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Western Equine
Encephalitis Antibody Panel, IgG and IgM, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the detailed procedure for performing the Western Equine
Encephalitis (WEE) Antibody Panel, IgG and IgM, on spinal fluid
specimens using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
technique.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of qualified medical laboratory scientists to
perform, document, and interpret results of the Western Equine
Encephalitis Antibody Panel.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and investigating any deviations or abnormal results.
1. DEFINITION
The Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE) Antibody Panel, IgG and
IgM, detects the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies specific to the
WEE virus in spinal fluid, aiding in the diagnosis of WEE virus
infection.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability
1. Specimen Type:
◦ Spinal fluid (CSF).
2. Minimum Volume:
◦ 1 mL CSF.
3. Specimen Handling:
◦ Specimen should be transported to the laboratory as soon
as possible.
◦ Store at 2-8°C if not tested immediately.
◦ If specimens are to be stored for an extended period, freeze
at -20°C or colder.
B. Reagents, Supplies, and Equipment
1. Reagents:
◦ WEE IgG and IgM ELISA Kits
◦ Wash Buffer
◦ Sample Diluent
◦ Control Sera (Positive and Negative)
◦ Substrate Solution
◦ Stop Solution
2. Supplies:
◦ Microtiter plates
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Microplate reader
◦ Tubes for sample dilutions
◦ Timer
3. Equipment:
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Microplate Washer
◦ Microplate Reader with 450 nm filter
C. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
2. If controls do not perform as expected, repeat the assay.
3. Document all control results in the QC log.
D. ELISA Assay Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before beginning the assay.
◦ Label microtiter plates according to the number of
specimens and controls being tested.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Add 100 µL of each control, specimen, and standard to the
appropriate wells.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plates thoroughly (3-4 times) with Wash Buffer
using a plate washer.
4. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody
to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Repeat the washing step.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of the Substrate Solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of Stop Solution to each well. The color should
change from blue to yellow.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
E. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each control and patient
specimen.
2. Determine the cut-off value.
◦ The cut-off value is typically calculated according to the kit
instructions.
3. Comparison:
◦ Absorbance values higher than the cut-off indicate a positive
result.
◦ Absorbance values lower than or equal to the cut-off
indicate a negative result.
4. Reporting:
◦ Report IgG and IgM results as either positive or negative.
◦ Include any supplementary comments regarding the assay
validity or additional observations.
F. Result Validation and Reporting
1. All results are reviewed and validated by the technologist
before being reported.
2. Critical or unexpected positive results must be verified by
retesting or confirmatory testing methods.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
report them to the requesting physician promptly.
4. Sample Integrity:
◦ Questionable samples (e.g., hemolyzed, contaminated)
must be flagged and the requesting physician notified.
