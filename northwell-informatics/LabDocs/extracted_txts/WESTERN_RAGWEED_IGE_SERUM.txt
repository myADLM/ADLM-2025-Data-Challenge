Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Western Ragweed, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures and
responsibilities involved in the analytical phase of generating results
for Western Ragweed-specific IgE, Serum.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the analytical procedures as defined in this SOP. It is
the responsibility of all staff to ensure that the procedures are
followed and to report any deficiencies or issues immediately to a
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred volume: Minimum 1 mL Accepted
Storage: Serum specimens should be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C
and may be frozen at -20°C or lower if testing is delayed for longer
periods.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or ImmunoCAP®
system for IgE detection
• Microplate Reader
• Calibrators specific to Western Ragweed IgE
• Controls (Negative and Positive Controls)
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel), tips
• Reagent kits specific to Western Ragweed IgE
1. PROCEDURE
The following steps outline the procedure for generating Western
Ragweed-specific IgE results.
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure specimen integrity by confirming the receipt, labelling,
and storage as per the specimen requirements.
2. If serum is frozen, thaw specimens at room temperature and
mix thoroughly before analysis.
B. Assay Process
1. Set up the ELISA or ImmunoCAP® system according to the
manufacturer's instructions, ensuring all equipment and
reagents are calibrated and within expiry dates.
2. Prepare the working standards, controls, and patient samples
following the kit's guidelines.
3. Using a calibrated pipette, carefully dispense standards,
controls, and patient serum samples into appropriate wells.
4. Add the necessary reagents to the wells as specified in the
assay protocol.
5. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time as
defined in the assay protocol.
6. Wash the plate according to the assay instructions.
7. Add the detection reagent and incubate as specified.
8. Read the microplate using a Microplate Reader at the specified
wavelength determined by the assay kit.
C. Data Analysis
1. Calculate the concentration of Western Ragweed-specific IgE
for each sample by constructing a standard curve.
2. Compare the assay results of patient samples against the
standard curve.
3. Ensure controls are within acceptable ranges before approving
any sample data.
4. Record all results accurately within the laboratory information
system (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
• Two levels: Negative and Positive controls
Quality Control Procedure:
1. Run controls with each patient batch.
2. Record control results and ensure they are within
predetermined acceptable ranges.
3. Investigate and troubleshoot any QC failures before releasing
patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
release. Reference Intervals: Western Ragweed-specific IgE levels
will be compared against established reference intervals to determine
normal or elevated levels. Critical Results: Any critical elevations in
Western Ragweed-specific IgE levels should be immediately
communicated to the responsible healthcare provider following
laboratory policy.

limitations. Relevant clinical and laboratory guidelines for Western
Ragweed IgE testing.
This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in procedures, technologies, and regulatory
requirements.
