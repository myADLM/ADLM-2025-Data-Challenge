Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of WEST
NILE CSF INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the interpretation and reporting of West Nile
Virus test results for Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) specimens in the
laboratory, ensuring accurate and reliable results for patient diagnosis
and management.
Responsibility:
Designated staff, including technologists and supervisors, are
responsible for adhering to this SOP, performing required quality
control, and accurately reporting results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• CSF collected aseptically and transported to the laboratory
immediately.
• Specimen should be free of hemolysis, clots, and contaminants.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in incorrect containers or compromised
during transport.
• Specimens with no collection date/time or patient identifiers.
• Specimens with visible contaminants or signs of decomposition.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit specific for West
Nile Virus
• Standard laboratory equipment including pipettes, centrifuges,
and microplate reader
• Reagents and buffers as specified by the ELISA kit manufacturer
• Calibration and quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure the ELISA kit and all reagents are within their expiration
dates and stored according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before beginning the assay.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the ELISA procedure,
which typically includes: a. Adding calibrators, controls, and
samples to designated wells on the microplate. b. Incubation
steps as specified, ensuring accurate timing using a laboratory
timer. c. Washing wells as directed to remove unbound
substances. d. Adding substrate and incubating for
development of color. e. Stopping the reaction and reading the
absorbance using a microplate reader.
2. Record absorbance values and calculate concentrations using
the standard curve provided by the calibrators.
C. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch to
monitor assay performance.
2. Ensure results for controls fall within specified ranges.
3. Document any deviations or failures in quality control and take
corrective actions as necessary.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
A. Positive Result:
• Indicates presence of West Nile Virus-specific antibodies in the
CSF.
• Supportive of recent or current infection, requiring clinical
correlation.
B. Negative Result:
• Indicates absence of detectable West Nile Virus-specific
antibodies.
• Suggests no recent or current infection, potential false negative in
early stages of infection.
C. Indeterminate Result:
• Results that fall within the equivocal range require repeat testing
or further clinical investigation.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review.
3. Verify validity and accuracy of results before finalizing.
4. Report critical findings to the attending physician immediately.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT
A. Regular monitoring and documenting of instrument performance
and assay results. B. Technologists must exercise professional
judgment when evaluating sample integrity and assay performance.
C. In cases of abnormal/discrepant results, reevaluate the CSF
specimen, repeat the assay if necessary, and consult a supervisor for
guidance.

1. RECORD KEEPING
Document all actions, including specimen receipt, assay
performance, quality control results, and reporting, maintaining
compliance with laboratory standards and regulations.
This SOP ensures that West Nile Virus CSF testing is conducted
systematically, adhering to high standards of accuracy for reliable
patient diagnosis and management.
