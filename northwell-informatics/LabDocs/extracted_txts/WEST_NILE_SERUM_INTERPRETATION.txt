Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for West Nile Serum
Interpretation
Purpose: To detail the procedures for the analysis, interpretation,
and reporting of West Nile Virus (WNV) serological test results to
ensure accuracy, reliability, and standardization in the laboratory
setting.
Scope: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of WNV serum testing using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or equivalent serological methods.
Responsibilities:
• Technologists: Conduct the WNV testing, record results, perform
quality control measures, and ensure proper handling of samples.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to this SOP, review test results,
provide technical support, and approve final reports.
• Quality Control Officer: Oversee the implementation of quality
control protocols and validate equipment and reagents used in the
testing process.
Definitions:
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay): A plate-based
assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying
substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, and
hormones.
• IgM and IgG Antibodies: Immunoglobulins that indicate acute
(IgM) or past (IgG) infection with the West Nile Virus.
Procedure:
1. Equipment and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Ensure ELISA reader, incubator, and pipettes are calibrated
as per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Reagents must include West Nile Virus-specific antigen,
conjugated anti-human IgM/IgG, substrate solution, and
stop solution.
◦ Confirm the expiry date and proper storage of reagents
before use.
2. Patient Specimen Handling:
◦ Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube without
anticoagulant.
◦ Specimen should be centrifuged and serum separated
within 2 hours of collection.
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
3. Pre-Analytical Phase:
◦ Ensure all samples and reagents reach room temperature
before starting the assay.
◦ Label all test plate wells appropriately to avoid cross-
contamination and ensure accurate identification of patient
samples, controls, and standards.
4. Running the ELISA Assay:
◦ Add 50 µL of the patient serum, calibrator, and controls
(positive/negative) to assigned wells in duplicate.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
◦ Wash each well 3 times with wash buffer to remove
unbound serum and reagent.
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies to
each well. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash wells 3 times again to remove unbound conjugated
antibodies.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate
for 20 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Read the optical density (O.D.) at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader within 30 minutes after adding stop solution.
5. Interpreting Results:
◦ Calculate the average O.D. for duplicates of calibrators,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Establish a cut-off value based on the negative control O.D.
plus three standard deviations or according to
manufacturer’s recommendations.
◦ Compare patient sample O.D. values against the cut-off
value:
▪ IgM Positive: Indicates recent infection if the value is
greater than the cut-off.
▪ IgG Positive: Suggests past exposure if the value is
greater than the cut-off.
▪ IgM and IgG Negative: Indicates no significant
antibodies present.
▪ IgM Positive and IgG Positive: May indicate both
recent and past infection.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal positive and negative controls with each assay
batch.
◦ Ensure that the precision and accuracy of controls fall within
the acceptable range as per laboratory guidelines or kit
insert specifications.
◦ Document and review all quality control data. Address and
rectify any deviations immediately.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
or designated reporting format.
◦ For positive results, include a comment advising
confirmatory testing via neutralization assays or another
specific WNV confirmatory test as recommended.
◦ Report critical values in accordance with laboratory and
clinical protocols.
8. Documentation and Record Keeping:
◦ Maintain all records of test results, quality control logs,
equipment calibration records, and steps taken during
troubleshooting.
◦ Ensure reports are signed off by a qualified supervisor
before they are released to clinical personnel or included in
patient records.
