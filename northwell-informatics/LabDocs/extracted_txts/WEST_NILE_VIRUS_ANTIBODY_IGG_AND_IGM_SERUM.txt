Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for West Nile Virus Antibody, IgG and IgM,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of West Nile Virus (WNV)
antibodies (IgG and IgM) in serum samples to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and documenting all processes according to this
SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and addressing any deviations or issues.
2. DEFINITION
West Nile Virus (WNV) Antibody Testing is a diagnostic method used
to detect IgG and IgM antibodies in the serum, indicating either
current or previous infection with WNV.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum samples collected in red-top or serum separator tubes
(SST).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
• Frozen (≤ -20°C): Long-term storage
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) reader and ancillary
equipment.
2. WNV IgG and IgM antibody detection kits (ensure not expired).
3. Micropipettes and tips.
4. Vortex mixer.
5. Incubator (37°C).
6. Reagent-grade water.
7. Calibrators and controls as provided in the antibody detection
kit.
8. Disposable gloves and lab coat.
C. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. Vortex mix each sample before analysis to ensure homogeneity.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls as per
manufacturer's instructions provided in the kit insert.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Add required volumes of controls, calibrators, and patient
samples into designated wells of the provided microplate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the time specified in the
kit’s instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate as directed using an automated or
manual washing system to remove unbound substances.
5. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add enzyme conjugate to each well, followed by a second
incubation as specified by the instructions.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the appropriate substrate to each well and incubate for
the time specified to allow for color development.
7. Reaction Termination:
◦ Add a stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
8. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set to the wavelength specified by the kit
instructions.
◦ Calculate the concentration of IgG and IgM antibodies using
the provided calibrators and control data.
E. Quality Control:
1. Internal Quality Controls (IQC):
◦ Run positive and negative controls provided in the kit with
each batch of patient samples.
◦ Ensure that control results fall within acceptable ranges
specified by the manufacturer before accepting patient
results.
2. External Quality Assurance (EQA):
◦ Participate in EQA programs to ensure inter-laboratory
consistency and accuracy.
3. Documentation and Review:
◦ Document control results and patient sample results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results for consistency.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Interpretation of Results:
◦ WNV IgM Positive: Indicates recent infection.
◦ WNV IgG Positive: Indicates past or ongoing infection.
◦ Results are reported as positive, negative, or equivocal
based on cutoff values specified by the kit.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Notify the requesting clinician of any positive results
immediately and document the communication.
G. Method Limitations:
• Cross-reactivity with antibodies to other flaviviruses (e.g.,
Dengue, Zika) may occur.
• Early infection may not be detected due to a lack of
seroconversion.
H. References:
• West Nile Virus Antibody Test Kit Insert (provide insert version
and source, e.g., CDC guidelines, 2023).
4. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious and follow standard
biosafety guidelines.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to laboratory safety
protocols.
