STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
WEST NILE VIRUS ANTIBODY, IGG AND IGM, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analysis and reporting of West
Nile Virus (WNV) Antibody, IgG and IgM, in spinal fluid specimens to
ensure accuracy and consistency in testing.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for conducting the testing, analyzing
the results, documenting processes, and reporting findings consistent
with this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
Specimen Volume: Minimum required volume is 0.5 mL of CSF.
Stability:
• Room Temperature (15-25°C): Up to 4 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Up to 6 months
Note: If delayed beyond these timeframes, specimens should be
rejected for testing.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for WNV IgG
and IgM
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and tips (adjustable and single-use)
• Vortex mixer
• Test tubes and racks
Reagents:
• WNV IgG and IgM ELISA kits
• Wash buffer solution
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Positive and negative controls
• Calibration standards
Storage Conditions:
• Reagents and kits should be stored as per manufacturer's
instructions, typically at 2-8°C.
4. PROTOCOL
4.1 Preparation and Equipment Calibration
1. Check the expiration dates and integrity of all ELISA kits and
reagents.
2. Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before beginning the assay.
3. Ensure that the microplate reader is properly calibrated.
4.2 Assay Procedure
WNV IgM ELISA:
1. Sample Dilution: Dilute CSF samples with the provided
sample diluent (e.g., 1:100 as per kit instructions).
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Load diluted samples, positive control, negative control, and
calibrators into designated wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Each sample and control should be tested in duplicate.
3. Incubation: Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing: Wash the plate with wash buffer (generally 3-5
cycles).
5. Conjugate Addition: Add labeled conjugate (enzyme-linked
antibody) to each well and incubate as specified (typically 30
minutes).
6. Second Wash: Perform washing steps as specified.
7. Substrate Addition: Add substrate solution to each well.
Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes or
until color develops.
8. Stop Reaction: Add stop solution to each well.
9. Reading: Measure the absorbance at the appropriate
wavelength (typically 450 nm) using a microplate reader.
WNV IgG ELISA: Follow the same steps as the WNV IgM ELISA,
substituting the IgG-specific reagents.
5. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS INTERPRETATION
1. Blank Correction: Subtract the optical density (OD) of the
blank wells from the ODs of all other wells.
2. Positive Control Validation: Ensure the positive control OD
falls within the manufacturer's specified range. If it fails, the run
should be considered invalid, and troubleshooting should be
performed.
3. Negative Control Validation: Ensure the negative control OD
falls within the specified range.
4. Calculate Results:
◦ Calculate the mean OD for duplicate wells of each sample,
control, and calibrator.
◦ Use the calibrators to create a standard curve for
determining the relative concentration of antibodies in
sample wells.
5. Interpretation: Compare results against established cut-off
values:
◦ Positive: OD values above the cut-off indicating the
presence of WNV antibodies.
◦ Negative: OD values below the cut-off indicating no
detectable WNV antibodies.
◦ Equivocal: Results that are borderline may require repeat
testing or additional confirmatory tests.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record Results: Document results in the laboratory
information system ensuring all values are accurately entered.
2. Review and Verification: A designated technologist will review
and verify the final results for accuracy prior to release.
3. Generate Report: Results are to be transcribed into the
electronic medical record or conveyed to the requesting
physician/laboratory department.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Controls: Run positive and negative controls with each assay
to ensure the test is functioning properly.
2. Trend Analysis: Perform periodic reviews of quality control
data to identify any trends signaling assay performance issues.
3. Documentation: Maintain comprehensive records of each
assay’s controls and patient results for audit and accreditation
purposes.
