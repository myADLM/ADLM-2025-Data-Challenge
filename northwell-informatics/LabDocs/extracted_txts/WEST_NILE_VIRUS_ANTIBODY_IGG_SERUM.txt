1. PURPOSE
This SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) outlines the analytical
procedures to be followed for the generation of results for West Nile
Virus (WNV) Antibody, IgG, Serum to ensure accurate and reliable
test outcomes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the analysis of WNV IgG antibodies in serum
samples.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to verify that all
procedures are followed correctly and to address any
discrepancies or issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum from a red top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Collect at least 5 mL of blood to obtain sufficient serum volume for
analysis (minimum volume: 1 mL of serum).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens received beyond stability period (serum stored at
2-8°C for more than 7 days, or serum stored at -20°C for more
than 30 days before analysis).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader/EIA Reader or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay
Analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (set at 37°C)
• Wash buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20)
• WNV IgG Antibody Test Kit (ELISA or Chemiluminescence)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples and reagents to reach room temperature
before analysis.
2. Centrifuge the blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Aliquot the serum into a clean, appropriately labeled tube if not
analyzed immediately.
Testing Procedure (ELISA method example):
1. Add the appropriate volume (e.g., 100 µL) of serum sample,
calibrators, and controls to the designated wells of the microtiter
plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 to 60 minutes, as specified in
the kit instructions.
3. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash each well 3 to 5
times with wash buffer.
4. Add the enzyme-conjugate or secondary antibody to each well
and incubate for the specified duration at 37°C.
5. Repeat the washing step as mentioned above.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time in the kit insert.
7. Stop the reaction with the appropriate stop solution and read
the optical density (OD) in an ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
Testing Procedure (Chemiluminescence method example):
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
sample rack of the analyzer.
2. Ensure reagent kits are loaded and the analyzer is prepared
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Select the WNV IgG assay test profile and initiate the run.
4. The analyzer will perform automated pipetting, incubation,
washing, and detection steps.
5. Obtain the results from the analyzer’s output screen or
connected Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each assay run by including positive
and negative controls provided in the kit.
• Review control results to ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• If control results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and do not report patient results until
the issue is resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results as Positive, Negative, or Indeterminate based on
the provided reference values and assay cut-offs.
• Interpretable results should be exported to and verified in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical values or indeterminate results should be reviewed and, if
necessary, confirmed by repeat testing or additional testing.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific WNV IgG Antibody Test Kit insert for any
procedural limitations, interferences, or specific assay
characteristics.
• Note that the presence of rheumatoid factor, certain autoimmune
diseases, or recent vaccination may lead to false-positive or false-
negative results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Below the assay cut-off value
• Positive: Above the assay cut-off value
• Indeterminate: Near the assay cut-off value; requires repeat
testing or follow-up testing
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the WNV IgG Antibody Test Kit
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
antibody testing
• Relevant literature and product inserts
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure that all results, QC data, and troubleshooting actions (if
any) are documented in the laboratory records.
• Maintain a log of reagent lot numbers, expiry dates, and
calibration certificates.
• All records should be reviewed periodically for completeness and
accuracy by the laboratory supervisor.
