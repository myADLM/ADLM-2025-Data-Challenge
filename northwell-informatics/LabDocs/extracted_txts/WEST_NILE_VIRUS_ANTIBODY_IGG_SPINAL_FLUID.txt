Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for WEST NILE VIRUS ANTIBODY, IGG,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and accurate detection of
West Nile Virus (WNV) IgG antibodies in spinal fluid specimens using
the appropriate Immunoassay method. The results obtained will
assist in the diagnosis of WNV infection.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of West Nile Virus IgG Antibody in spinal fluid specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to adhere
strictly to this protocol and ensure accurate and precise results.
Supervisors must ensure that personnel are trained and competent to
perform the analysis.
4. DEFINITIONS
• WNV IgG: Immunoglobulin G specific to West Nile Virus.
• CSF: Cerebrospinal fluid.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Specimen Type: Spinal fluid (CSF).
• Minimum Volume: 1.0 mL.
• Storage Conditions:
◦ Short-term: Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within
48 hours.
◦ Long-term: Store at ≤ -20°C for up to 6 months.
• Transport Conditions: Keep specimens refrigerated (2-8°C) and
transport using ice packs.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Automated Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g.,
Abbott Architect, Diasorin LIAISON)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Timer
• Reagents:
◦ West Nile Virus IgG assay kit specific to the analyzer being
used.
◦ Quality Control (QC) materials: Commercial West Nile Virus
IgG positive and negative controls.
• Other Supplies:
◦ CSF specimen containers
◦ Disposable gloves and lab coats
◦ Biohazard disposal containers
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves and lab coat.
2. Allow all reagents and controls to reach room temperature
before use.
3. Set up the Immunoassay Analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls:
◦ Prepare QC materials as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Load controls into the analyzer.
◦ Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with the specimen analysis. If QC results are not
within range, troubleshoot and resolve any issues before
testing patient specimens.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Centrifuge CSF specimens at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes
to remove any cellular debris.
2. Carefully pipette the clear supernatant into a clean tube,
avoiding the pellet at the bottom.
3. Load the necessary volumes of specimen into appropriate
sample cups as per the assay instructions.
4. Place the sample cups into the automated analyzer sample
carousel/tray.
5. Select the West Nile Virus IgG assay program on the analyzer.
6. Ensure proper identification and labeling of each specimen.
7. Start the analysis cycle according to the analyzer's operational
protocol.
D. Reporting Results
1. Upon completion of the assay, retrieve and review the analytical
results from the analyzer.
2. Evaluate results using the cut-off values established by the
assay manufacturer to determine negative, equivocal, or
positive results.
◦ Negative: Value below the cut-off.
◦ Equivocal: Value around the cut-off, indicating the need for a
follow-up sample.
◦ Positive: Value above the cut-off.
3. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
4. Verify that results are consistent with quality control data before
issuing the final report.
5. Interpretation of results should be performed in conjunction with
clinical findings and other diagnostic procedures.
E. Post-Assay
1. Dispose of any waste materials, including specimen cups and
pipette tips, in designated biohazard containers.
2. Clean and maintain the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Store unused reagents and control materials as specified to
ensure their stability and validity for future use.

9. REVISION HISTORY
• Version 1.0: Initial document creation (October 2023)
Ensure that all steps are followed meticulously to guarantee the
integrity and reliability of the results. Any deviation or anomaly must
be brought to the attention of a supervisor immediately.
