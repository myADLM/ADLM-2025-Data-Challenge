1. PURPOSE
To outline the specific procedures for the analysis and generation of
results for West Nile Virus Antibody, IgM, Serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST), red-top tube, or
another acceptable tube.
• Collect 5 ml of blood.
• After collection, allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at
room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1,500 x g within 2 hours of collection.
• Aliquot the serum into a clearly labeled secondary tube.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA, citrate,
or heparin.
• Insufficient volume (<0.5 ml serum).
• Samples that were not processed and separated within the
specified time frame.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader (spectrophotometer)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or below)
• Washing buffer (PBS-Tween 20 or equivalent)
• West Nile Virus IgM ELISA kit (commercially available, follow
manufacturer's instructions)
• Plate washer (optional)
• Timer
• Calibrated microplate
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify the patient's identity and specimen details.
2. Label samples with a unique identifier.
3. Ensure the serum is clear of cellular components through
appropriate centrifugation.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare washing buffer as per the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Arrange all necessary equipment, reagents, and samples.
2. Assay Procedure (following manufacturer’s instructions):
◦ Securely place the microplate in the designated area of the
workspace.
◦ Add 100 μL of controls (positive, negative, and cut-off),
standards, and patient samples into the appropriate wells.
◦ Cover the microplate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ After incubation, wash plate 5 times with the washing buffer
using either a manual or automated plate washer.
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Again, wash the plate 5 times with washing buffer.
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for all duplicates.
◦ Determine the cut-off value according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Compare the absorbances of the samples to the cut-off
value to determine positive vs. negative results.
◦ Interpret results as follows:
▪ Absorbance > Cutoff = Positive
▪ Absorbance ≤ Cutoff = Negative
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results before releasing them.
◦ Notify critical positive results to the requesting physician or
clinical team immediately.
3. Storage:
◦ Store serum samples, control materials, and reagents as
per the manufacturer’s recommendations for refrigerating or
freezing.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive, negative, and cut-off controls with each batch of
tests.
• Ensure that the control results meet the acceptance criteria set by
the kit manufacturer before interpreting patient results.
• Document and address any deviations or failures in control
results, initiating troubleshooting if necessary.

control.
1. PRECAUTIONS AND SAFETY
• Handle all biological specimens and reagents as potentially
infectious.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
• Dispose of all waste materials, including used pipette tips and
microplates, according to biohazard waste disposal regulations.
This protocol should be reviewed periodically and updated as
necessary to reflect new research, technologies, and regulatory
requirements.
