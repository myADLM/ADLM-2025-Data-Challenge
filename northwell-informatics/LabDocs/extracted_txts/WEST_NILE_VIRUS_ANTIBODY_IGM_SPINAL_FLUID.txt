Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for WEST NILE VIRUS
ANTIBODY, IGM, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reproducible testing and
reporting of West Nile Virus Antibody, IgM, in spinal fluid
specimens.
2. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected into a sterile red stopper tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in any form other than CSF (e.g., blood,
plasma)
• Specimens contaminated or clotted
• Specimens that have not been labeled correctly with patient
identification, collection date, and time
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator
• ELISA kit for West Nile Virus IgM detection
• Negative and Positive Controls specifically for the West Nile Virus
IgM ELISA
• 96-well microtiter plate reader
• Plate washer
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment
1. PROCEDURE a) Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge CSF sample at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
2. Carefully decant supernatant for analysis without
disturbing pellet.
b) ELISA Setup:
1. Set up the assay as per manufacturer’s instructions provided in
the ELISA kit insert.
2. Arrange sample wells, control wells, substrate and stop solution
according to the kit guidelines.
3. Use samples undiluted unless otherwise specified by the
protocol.
4. Apply samples and reagents sequentially considering
incubation and washing steps between each phase.
c) E-plate Preparation:
1. Securely fit microtiter plate on the plate reader.
2. Perform appropriate blank readings and negative controls for
calibration.
3. Measure Optical Density (OD) at the specified wavelength as
per kit.
d) Result Interpretation:
1. Positive IgM result indicated by color development surpassing
the interpretative threshold set by the manufacturer.
2. Negative results should remain below the given threshold or
exhibit no significant color change.
3. Each run must include positive and negative controls to validate
test cluster.
4. QUALITY CONTROL a) Check reagents and ELISA plates for
integrity and expiration dates. b) Quality control materials
(positive and negative controls) must be run simultaneously
with patient samples to validate test results. Record controls
alongside patient data. c) Verify instrument calibration for plate
reader before use. d) Document any discrepancies in control
results, troubleshoot and rerun the test if needed.
5. REPORTING RESULTS a) Report as positive if IgM OD
readings exceed positive control threshold. b) Report as
negative if IgM remains below specified threshold based on
ELISA standards. c) Include comments if results are
indeterminable or if there are potential interferences. d)
Transmit confirmed findings electronically to LIS for record and
subsequent clinical review.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Interpretation thresholds for positive/negative to be based on
recommendations from ELISA kit insert.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to ELISA kit manufacturer insert
for limitations affecting sensitivity, specificity, and overall
performance of the test.
2. REFERENCES Manufacturer’s Product Insert for specific
ELISA kit used in West Nile Virus IgM CSF testing.
RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of technologists to ensure
accurate performance of the procedure and to adhere to all specified
controls and result interpretations. Supervisors must review any
discrepancies and ensure adherence to quality control protocols.
DOCUMENTATION: Maintain detailed log of run dates, sample IDs,
control outcomes, and any corrective actions taken regarding test
performance.
Note: This protocol is subject to revision per latest manufacturer
recommendations or clinical updates in the domain of West Nile Virus
diagnostics.
