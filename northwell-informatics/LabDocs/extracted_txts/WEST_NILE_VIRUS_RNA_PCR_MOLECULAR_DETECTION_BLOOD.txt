Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results:
WEST NILE VIRUS, RNA, PCR, MOLECULAR DETECTION,
BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and reliable molecular
detection of West Nile Virus RNA in blood specimens using PCR.
This procedure ensures reproducibility, precision, and compliance
with regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis and detection of West Nile Virus
RNA in blood specimens within the molecular diagnostics laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated personnel to follow this SOP
and ensure the accurate detection and documentation of West Nile
Virus RNA results. Supervisors must provide oversight and address
any deficiencies or discrepancies.
4. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
◦ Specimen volume: Minimum of 5 mL.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Clotted blood samples.
◦ Hemolyzed specimens.
◦ Samples received in anticoagulants other than EDTA or ACD.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR machine (e.g., ABI 7500 Fast or equivalent)
• Extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents and consumables
• Positive and Negative controls
• Pipettes and barrier tips
• Vortex and centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
Extraction of RNA:
1. Preparation:
◦ Clean and sterilize the workspace.
◦ Warm up the centrifuge.
◦ Ensure proper labeling of tubes.
2. RNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the extraction kit.
◦ Add 200 µL of the blood specimen to a labeled extraction
tube.
◦ Process the sample according to the extraction kit
instructions.
◦ Elute the RNA in 50 µL of RNase-free water or elution buffer.
◦ Store the extracted RNA at -80°C until testing.
PCR Setup:
1. Preparation of Master Mix:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer's recommendations.
◦ Include reagents such as Taq polymerase, primers specific
for West Nile Virus RNA, dNTPs, and reaction buffer.
◦ Prepare master mix for the appropriate number of samples
plus controls (positive, negative, and no-template controls).
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Aliquot 20 µL of master mix into each well of the PCR plate.
◦ Add 5 µL of RNA extract from each sample into respective
wells.
◦ Include positive and negative control wells.
3. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Program the PCR machine with the following cycling
conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes.
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds.
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Number of cycles: 40.
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Set the detection for fluorescence at the appropriate
wavelength.
PCR Analysis:
1. Post-PCR Analysis:
◦ Use appropriate software to analyze the amplification
curves.
◦ Determine the presence of West Nile Virus RNA based on
the cycle threshold (Ct) values.
2. Validation:
◦ Compare the Ct values of the samples with those of the
positive and negative controls.
◦ Ensure that the negative control shows no amplification
curve and the positive control falls within the acceptable Ct
range.
Quality Control:
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the PCR machine.
• Always include positive and negative controls in every PCR run.
• Record all results and control confirmations in the PCR run log.
• Validate every new batch of reagents before use.
Reporting Results:
1. Documentation:
◦ Record the Ct values and interpret results based on
predefined criteria.
◦ If West Nile Virus RNA detected: positive result with Ct
value.
◦ If West Nile Virus RNA not detected: negative result.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Results must be reviewed by a technologist.
◦ Any discrepancies should be reported to the supervisor for
further investigation.
3. Critical Results:
◦ Positive results indicating the presence of West Nile Virus
RNA must be documented and reported according to
laboratory guidelines.
◦ Inform relevant clinical personnel immediately if critical
values are detected.
7. STORAGE
• Store extracted RNA at -80°C.
• Store PCR reagents according to manufacturer specifications until
expiry.
• Store documentation securely and adhere to confidentiality
policies.
