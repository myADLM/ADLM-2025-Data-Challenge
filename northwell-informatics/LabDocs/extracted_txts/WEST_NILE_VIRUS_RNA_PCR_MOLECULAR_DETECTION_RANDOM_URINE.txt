Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
WEST NILE VIRUS, RNA, PCR, MOLECULAR DETECTION IN
RANDOM URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase for the detection of West Nile Virus (WNV) RNA from
random urine using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology.
This procedure ensures consistent and accurate results in the
detection of WNV RNA.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing WNV
RNA testing using PCR on random urine specimens in the molecular
diagnostics section of the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory technologists to perform
WNV RNA PCR testing according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure and addressing
any issues that may arise.

1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
5.1 Specimen Type: Random urine
5.2 Specimen Collection: Collect a minimum of 10 mL of random
urine in a sterile, leak-proof container. Specimens must be labeled
with patient identification, collection date, and time.
5.3 Specimen Storage: Store urine specimens at 2-8°C if testing is
delayed for up to 72 hours. For long-term storage, freeze specimens
at -70°C or lower.
5.4 Specimen Transport: Transport specimens on ice packs to
maintain stability. Specimens must be transported following the
laboratory's transport protocols to prevent contamination and
degradation.
5.5 Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens in containers with
evidence of leakage or contamination - Specimens without proper
labeling - Insufficient volume for testing (less than 10 mL)
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
6.1 Equipment: - Biosafety cabinet Class II - Refrigerated centrifuge -
Vortex mixer - Precision pipettes (2-20 µL, 20-200 µL, and 100-1000
µL) - Real-time PCR instrument - Thermal cycler - Microcentrifuge
tubes - PCR tube strips or plates
6.2 Reagents: - RNA extraction kit - WNV RNA PCR reagents
(including primers, probes, and master mix) - Positive and negative
controls
6.3 Storage of Reagents: - Store the RNA extraction kit and PCR
reagents as per manufacturer’s instructions - All reagents should be
labeled with the received date, opened date, and expiration date
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 RNA Extraction: 1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for RNA
extraction from urine specimens. 2. Perform the procedure in a
designated clean area to avoid contamination. 3. Transfer extracted
RNA to labeled microcentrifuge tubes. 4. Store extracted RNA at
-70°C until PCR setup if not proceeding immediately.
7.2 PCR Setup: 1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes or
plates. 3. Add extracted RNA (5 µL) to each reaction well, including
positive and negative controls. 4. Seal the PCR tube strips or plates.
5. Load the PCR tubes into the real-time PCR instrument.
7.3 PCR Cycling Conditions: 1. Follow the recommended cycling
conditions provided in the PCR kit insert. 2. Generally, the cycling
conditions include: a. Reverse transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes b.
Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes c. Amplification cycles (40
cycles): i. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds ii. Annealing/Extension:
60°C for 1 minute
1. CONTROLS
1. Run a positive control to ensure the PCR reaction works
and the equipment is functioning correctly.
2. Run a negative control to check for contamination.
3. Include an internal control in each reaction to avoid false-
negative results due to PCR inhibitors.
2. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Analyze the results using the real-time PCR instrument
software.
2. Positive result: The presence of WNV RNA is indicated by
the amplification curve crossing the threshold line before
40 cycles.
3. Negative result: No detectable WNV RNA if the
amplification curve does not cross the threshold by 40
cycles.
4. Inconclusive result: If controls fail, the test must be
repeated.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Verify and review results before releasing them.
3. Report positive, negative, and inconclusive results
according to laboratory and regulatory guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated following the
laboratory’s equipment calibration schedule.
2. Perform daily quality control checks with both positive and
negative controls before processing patient samples.
3. Document all quality control measures.
5. LIMITATIONS
◦ False-negative results may occur if the specimen is
improperly collected, transported, or stored.
◦ Inhibitors in urine may affect the efficiency of PCR.
6. SAFETY
◦ Follow biosafety guidelines while handling specimens and
reagents.
◦ Dispose of waste according to laboratory safety protocols.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's RNA extraction kit insert
◦ Manufacturer's PCR kit insert and user manual
◦ Relevant laboratory SOPs for equipment use and waste
disposal
8. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure that all steps, from specimen accession to result reporting,
are documented properly in the appropriate logs and the LIS.
