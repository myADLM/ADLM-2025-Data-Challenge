Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of WEST
NILE VIRUS, RNA, PCR, MOLECULAR DETECTION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a
standardized procedure for the molecular detection of West Nile
Virus (WNV) RNA in serum specimens using PCR technology.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to perform the analytical procedure for
WNV RNA detection as outlined in this SOP. All staff must
ensure that quality control is maintained and results are
accurately recorded and reported.
3. DEFINITION West Nile Virus (WNV) RNA detection via
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a diagnostic test used to
identify the presence of WNV genetic material in serum
specimens.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Equipment and Reagents:
• PCR workstation (biosafety cabinet)
• Pipettes and sterile filter tips
• Vortex mixer and microcentrifuge
• Real-time PCR thermocycler
• RNA extraction kit
• WNV-specific PCR primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Ethanol (70% for decontamination)
• Serum samples (already accessioned and prepared)
• Positive and negative control samples
• PCR reaction mix components (nucleotides, Taq polymerase,
buffer, etc.)
4.2 Safety Precautions:
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and face protection.
• Work in designated PCR workstations to prevent contamination.
• Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment before and after
use.
4.3 RNA Extraction:
• Thaw serum samples on ice.
• Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the RNA extraction kit.
• Elute the RNA in a final volume of 50 µl of nuclease-free water.
• Store the extracted RNA at -80°C until PCR setup if not used
immediately.
4.4 PCR Setup:
• Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions for the specific WNV PCR kit in use. Ensure the
reaction mix includes WNV-specific primers and probes.
• Dispense the reaction mix into PCR tubes or plates.
• Add 5 µl of extracted RNA to each reaction tube or well. Include
positive and negative control samples in each run.
• Seal the PCR tubes or plates to prevent contamination.
4.5 Real-Time PCR:
• Insert the tubes or plate into the real-time PCR thermocycler.
• Program the thermocycler according to the specific cycling
conditions provided by the WNV PCR kit manufacturer (e.g.,
denaturation, annealing, extension phases).
• Start the thermocycler run and monitor the amplification process
through the thermocycler software.
4.6 Interpreting Results:
• Upon completion of the run, analyze the amplification curves:
◦ Positive Control: Must show amplification with the expected Ct
(Cycle threshold) value to validate the run.
◦ Negative Control: Must not show any amplification. Presence
of amplification indicates contamination and invalidates the
run.
◦ Sample Interpretation:
▪ Detected: Ct value within the established positive control
range indicates presence of WNV RNA.
▪ Not Detected: Absence of a Ct signal or > safety threshold
of Ct value indicates no WNV RNA detected.
• Review data and confirm results.
4.7 Quality Control:
• Ensure positive and negative control results are consistent and
within expected ranges.
• Repeat analysis if QC criteria are not met.
• Record and document any troubleshooting steps taken.
4.8 Reporting Results:
• Report results as "Detected" or "Not Detected".
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
clinical reporting.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Verify the integrity of RNA samples before proceeding. Cap
remaining samples and store at -80°C for future re-testing (if
necessary).
1. CRITICAL RESULTS:
• Report critical positive results to the responsible healthcare
provider immediately.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the RNA extraction kit.
• Manufacturer's instructions for WNV PCR reaction mix and
thermocycler settings.
• Relevant literature on WNV molecular diagnostics.
