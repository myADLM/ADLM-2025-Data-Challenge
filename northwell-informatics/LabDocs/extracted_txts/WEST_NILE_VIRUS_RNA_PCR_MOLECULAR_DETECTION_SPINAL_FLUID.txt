Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
WEST NILE VIRUS, RNA, PCR, MOLECULAR DETECTION,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the detection of West Nile Virus (WNV) RNA in spinal fluid using
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This protocol ensures
consistency and accuracy in test results and maintains the integrity of
the testing process.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained personnel in the laboratory to
follow this SOP accurately. The Laboratory Supervisor is responsible
for ensuring that all personnel are adequately trained and that this
SOP is followed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 1-3 mL of spinal fluid collected in a sterile container and
transported to the laboratory under cold conditions (2-8°C) within
24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are not properly labeled.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection without proper storage.
• Specimens that appear to be contaminated or not properly
sealed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstation
• Real-Time PCR Instrument
• RNA Extraction Kit
• WNV-Specific Primers and Probes
• Master Mix for PCR
• Positive and Negative Controls
• Pipettes and Filter Tips (Aerosol-resistant)
• Sterile Microcentrifuge Tubes
• Vortex Mixer
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A) RNA Extraction:
1. Verify the specimen label against the requisition form.
2. Aliquot 1 mL of spinal fluid into a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
3. Follow the RNA Extraction Kit protocol to extract RNA from the
spinal fluid.
4. Elute the extracted RNA in a final volume of 50 µL of elution
buffer.
5. Document the extraction process including lot numbers of
reagents used, extraction date, and initials of the technologist.
B) Preparation of the PCR Reaction:
1. In a sterile PCR workstation, prepare the PCR Master Mix
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Components of the
Master Mix typically include nucleotides, MgCl2, buffer, Taq
polymerase, and primers/probes.
2. Pipette 18 µL of the Master Mix into each well of a PCR plate.
3. Add 2 µL of extracted RNA from each sample into the
respective wells for testing.
4. Include positive control (2 µL of WNV RNA) and negative
control (2 µL of RNase-free water) in the appropriate wells.
5. Seal the PCR plate with a suitable adhesive film.
6. Briefly centrifuge the plate to ensure all reactions are at the
bottom of the wells.
7. Place the PCR plate into the Real-Time PCR Instrument.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. Program the Real-Time PCR Instrument with the following
cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds.
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute.
◦ Repeat for 45 cycles.
2. Document the PCR run setup including the lot numbers of the
primers, probes, and Master Mix, as well as the date and time
of the run.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze the amplification
curves.
2. Threshold cycle (Ct) values below 35 for both reference and the
sample indicate a positive result.
3. Controls must yield expected results (positive control should
amplify and negative control should not amplify).
E) Interpretation of Results:
1. If the Ct value of the sample is less than 35, it indicates the
presence of WNV RNA in the spinal fluid.
2. If the Ct value of the sample is 35 or higher, it indicates that the
WNV RNA is not detected in the spinal fluid.
3. If either control fails, the run is invalid, and the samples must be
retested.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure the use of positive and negative controls in every PCR
run.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the PCR
Instrument as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all quality control measures and corrective actions if
necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record and review the results.
• Prepare a report indicating the presence or absence of WNV
RNA.
• Ensure the results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified
laboratory supervisor/authorized personnel.
• Document the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Ct value < 35.
• Negative: Ct value ≥ 35.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This protocol is highly specific for WNV RNA; however, false
positives, and false negatives may occur due to cross-
contamination, RNA degradation, or improper extraction.
• Negative results do not rule out the presence of the virus if the
viral load is below the detection limit of the assay.

Master Mix.

This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect the changes in technology or lab practices.
