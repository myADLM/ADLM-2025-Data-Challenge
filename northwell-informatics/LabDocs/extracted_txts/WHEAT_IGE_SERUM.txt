Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for WHEAT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and consistent testing of Wheat, Immunoglobulin
E (IgE) levels in serum samples.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of serum samples for Wheat-specific IgE levels.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to protocol and for addressing any issues that arise during
sample processing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: 5 mL venous blood collected into a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted samples. Samples
arriving without proper labeling or greater than 48 hours after
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia)
• Calibrators and controls specific for Wheat IgE
• Disposable pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• SST collection tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing
1. Upon receipt, check the sample for proper labeling and ensure
it meets acceptance criteria.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Carefully aliquot the serum into a pre-labeled secondary tube if
necessary.
4. Store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours if analysis cannot
be performed immediately, or freeze at -20°C for longer
storage.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) alongside
patient specimens in each batch. Ensure results fall within the
established acceptable range before proceeding.
C. Analyzing Specimens
1. Load the patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
the designated positions on the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer for IgE-specific testing using the
appropriate assay protocol.
3. Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer for any errors or issues
throughout the process.
D. Troubleshooting Anomalies
1. If a result falls outside the reference range, reanalyze the
sample to confirm the result.
2. Investigate and document any deviations or anomalies. This
includes instrument errors, invalid calibration, or quality control
failures.
3. Repeat the test or contact the supervisor for further instructions
as necessary.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
5. Compare the Wheat IgE levels with established reference
intervals:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kUA/L
◦ Low: 0.35-0.69 kUA/L
◦ Moderate: 0.7-3.49 kUA/L
◦ High: ≥3.5 kUA/L
6. Document any deviations and ensure all results are consistent
with quality control standards before verification.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure accuracy.
9. Review and verify results before reporting to the physician.
10. For critical values, immediately notify the physician or
designated contact as per laboratory protocol.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
12. Perform internal quality control daily and record results.
13. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
continued accuracy of testing.
14. Maintain documentation of all quality control and proficiency
testing activities for review.
15. RECORD KEEPING
16. Record all patient results, quality control data, and any
deviations or anomalies in the laboratory logbook.
17. Retain records for the appropriate period as per regulatory
requirements and laboratory policy.
