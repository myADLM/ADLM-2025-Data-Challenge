Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
WHEAT IGG Testing
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for conducting and generating results for
WHEAT IGG testing to ensure accurate and reliable laboratory
results.
2. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain red
top tube.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
◦ Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on sample
container or requisition.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA Reader
• ELISA Plate Washer
• Pipettes and tips (multichannel and single-channel)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Plate shaker
• Incubator
• WHEAT IGG ELISA Kit, including:
◦ Pre-coated ELISA plates
◦ Calibrators
◦ Controls (Positive and Negative)
◦ Conjugate reagent
◦ Substrate reagent
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
4. Procedure
Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the collected serum sample at 1500-2000g for 10
minutes at room temperature to separate serum from cells.
2. Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled microcentrifuge
tubes.
Assay Setup:
1. Preparation of reagents:
◦ Ensure reagents are brought to room temperature before
use.
◦ Follow kit instructions to dilute wash buffer and prepare any
other required reagents.
2. Plate setup:
◦ Place the ELISA plate on a plate shaker for 2 minutes
before adding samples to ensure even distribution of
coating.
◦ Add 100 µL of calibrator, control, and patient serum to the
appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with a plate cover or sealing tape and
incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer using an ELISA
plate washer.
◦ Tap the plate gently on a paper towel to remove any
remaining wash buffer.
5. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate reagent to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Washing:
◦ Repeat washing step as described above.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate reagent to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
9. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA Reader within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction.
5. Quality Control
Quality Control Materials:
• Positive Control - known WHEAT IGG positive serum.
• Negative Control - known WHEAT IGG negative serum.
Quality Control Procedure:
1. Run positive and negative controls in parallel with patient
samples.
2. Ensure controls fall within pre-established ranges to validate
the assay run.
Troubleshooting:
1. If controls are out of range, identify potential errors such as
reagent expiration, improper washing, or equipment
malfunction.
2. Correct identified issues and repeat the run with freshly
prepared reagents.
6. Reporting Results
1. Plot the absorbance readings of calibrators to generate a
standard curve.
2. Calculate WHEAT IGG concentrations of patient samples using
the standard curve.
3. Review and verify results for accuracy before reporting.
4. Enter results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System) and
validate them.
7. Reference Intervals
• Refer to the kit insert for the specific reference ranges.
8. Method Limitations
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens may yield
inaccurate results.
• Ensure proper specimen handling and use of validated reagents.
9. Safety and Handling
• Follow laboratory biosafety protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to institutional guidelines.
