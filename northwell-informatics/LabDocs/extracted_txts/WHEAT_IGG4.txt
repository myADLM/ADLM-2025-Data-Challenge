Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Wheat IgG4 Testing
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for generating analytical results
for Wheat IgG4 tests, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing Wheat
IgG4 testing within our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing Wheat IgG4 tests according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and this SOP.
• Documenting all results and maintaining accurate records.
• Reporting any discrepancies or issues to the laboratory
supervisor.
• Ensuring all equipment used in the process is calibrated and
functioning correctly.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for:
• Overseeing the implementation of this SOP.
• Ensuring staff are trained and competent in performing this test.
• Addressing any issues or discrepancies reported by laboratory
personnel.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum.
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24
hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or colder for up to 6
months.
• Unacceptable conditions: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples;
specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes; specimens showing
signs of contamination.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader (with appropriate filters for Wheat IgG4 detection)
• Microplate Washer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (adjustable and fixed volume)
• Microplates and plate sealers
• Distilled water
• Calibrated timers
• Refrigerator 2-8°C for short-term storage
• Freezer -20°C or colder for long-term storage
Reagents:
• Wheat IgG4 ELISA Kit (store and handle in accordance with
manufacturer’s instructions)
◦ Pre-coated microplates
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Conjugate solution
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer concentrate
◦ Sample diluent
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation
a) Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use. b) Prepare wash buffer by diluting the wash buffer
concentrate with distilled water as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
6.2. Assay Procedure
a) Dilution of Samples:
• Dilute serum samples 1:100 with sample diluent (e.g., add 10 µL
of serum to 990 µL of sample diluent).
b) Plate Set-Up:
• Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and diluted samples to the
appropriate wells of the microplate.
• Seal the plate with a plate sealer and incubate at room
temperature for 60 minutes.
c) Washing:
• Wash the plate 3-5 times with the prepared wash buffer using a
microplate washer.
d) Addition of Conjugate:
• Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
• Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
e) Washing:
• Wash the plate 3-5 times with the prepared wash buffer.
f) Substrate Reaction:
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
g) Stopping the Reaction:
• Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
h) Reading the Plate:
• Read the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (as specified
by the kit insert) using an ELISA reader.
6.3. Quality Control
• Run controls with each batch of tests to ensure the assay
performance is within the acceptable range.
• Document the results from controls, ensuring the values fall within
the manufacturer’s specified range before reporting patient
results.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the sample results using the standard curve provided by
the calibrators.
• Report results in units specified by the assay kit.
• Results outside the specified range should prompt re-analysis
and, if repeated results are inconsistent, investigation and
possible notification to the supervisor.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results by an authorized technologist before
releasing.
• Critical or significantly abnormal results should be promptly
communicated to the clinician as per laboratory policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Refer to the Wheat IgG4 ELISA kit manufacturer’s package insert
for reference intervals.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the Wheat IgG4 ELISA kit manufacturer’s package insert
for specific limitations of the method.
