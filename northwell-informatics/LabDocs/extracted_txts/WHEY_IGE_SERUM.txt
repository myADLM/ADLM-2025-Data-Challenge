Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Whey Protein Specific IgE (sIgE) in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of whey protein specific IgE
(sIgE) in serum samples, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of whey protein specific IgE (sIgE) in serum samples using the
ImmunoCAP or similar allergen-specific IgE assay method.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel responsible for carrying out the analysis and
ensuring adherence to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for the
final review and validation of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum sample: 1-2 mL of serum.
Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be kept frozen at -20°C
or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in expired collection tubes.
• Specimens with no identification labels or collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ImmunoCAP 250 or similar automated analyzer.
• Centrifuge capable of 3000 rpm.
• Pipettes and associated tips.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents:
• ImmunoCAP specific IgE reagent kits.
• Calibrators and controls for specific IgE assays.
• Deionized water for washing steps.
• Serum diluent buffer (if sample dilution is necessary).
Supplies:
• Test tubes.
• Microcentrifuge tubes.
• Labeling tape and markers.
• PPE (Laboratory gloves, coat, and eye protection).
6. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Receive and verify the integrity and labeling of the specimen.
2. Centrifuge the serum sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum if needed.
3. Aliquot the required volume of serum into pre-labeled
microcentrifuge tubes.
Analytical Phase:
1. Refer to the ImmunoCAP or assay kit insert for precise steps.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents, controls, and calibrators as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Program the ImmunoCAP analyzer according to the assay
protocol.
◦ Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
instrument.
◦ Ensure all wells are properly labeled and loaded in the
correct positions.
4. Assay Execution:
◦ Follow the instrument’s prompts and specific assay
procedure to run the test.
◦ Ensure all reaction steps such as incubation, washing, and
detection are performed according to the kit insert.
5. Result Generation:
◦ Upon completion, the analyzer will generate the specific IgE
results for each sample.
◦ Review the results for any flagged inconsistencies or assay
errors.
Post-analytical Phase:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that the control results are within the acceptable
range before validating patient results.
◦ Document any QC failures and corrective actions taken.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Compare the patient results to the established reference
ranges and previous patient history (if available).
◦ Flag any critical values and follow up according to the
laboratory’s policy on critical results.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the verified results into the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
◦ Ensure results are communicated to the appropriate
healthcare providers according to protocol.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Document all QC results and review for consistency.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing at least twice a year to
validate assay performance.
8. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
Routine Maintenance:
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the
ImmunoCAP analyzer as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
Calibration:
• Calibrate the analyzer with each new lot of reagents or at a
minimum frequency established by the laboratory protocols.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the assay kit insert and instrument manual for
troubleshooting common issues such as sample hemolysis,
reagent flags, or instrument errors.
• Contact technical support for persistent unresolved issues.
