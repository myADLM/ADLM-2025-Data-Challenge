Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
WHEY IGG
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process for the analytical phase of generating results
for Whey Immunoglobulin G (IGG) using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting the
analysis as outlined in this SOP, including specimen preparation,
running the assay, and interpreting results. It is also the responsibility
of laboratory personnel to ensure that all equipment used is
calibrated and maintained according to standard procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Collection method: Standard venipuncture technique.
• Volume: A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required.
• Specimen handling: Allow the blood to clot at room temperature
for 15-30 minutes, then centrifuge for 10-15 minutes at 1000-2000
x g.
• Storage: Serum specimens should be aliquoted and stored at
2-8°C if the assay will be performed within 48 hours. For longer
storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader
• ELISA microplates coated with anti-WHEY IGG antibodies
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Washing buffer
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
• Stop solution (e.g., 1N H2SO4)
• Standards and quality control sera
• Incubator set to 37°C (if required for incubation steps)
• Disposable gloves and other PPE
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation a. Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room
temperature (15-25°C) before starting the assay. b. Prepare
washing buffer and other required solutions according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Plate Setup a. Arrange standards, controls, and specimens in
duplicate on the ELISA plate according to the plate layout
provided. b. Add 100 µL of standards, quality control sera, and
patient specimens to the appropriate wells.
4. Incubation a. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30
minutes or according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. b.
Wash the plate three times with washing buffer (300 µL per
well). After each wash, invert the plate and blot it on absorbent
paper to remove excess liquid.
5. Detection Antibody Addition a. Add 100 µL of enzyme-linked
detection antibody to each well. b. Incubate the plate at room
temperature for 30 minutes. c. Repeat the wash step.
6. Substrate Addition a. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each
well. b. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for
10-15 minutes, or until a blue color develops.
7. Stop Reaction a. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt
the enzymatic reaction. The color should change from blue to
yellow.
8. Reading the Plate a. Measure the absorbance of each well at
450 nm using an ELISA plate reader within 30 minutes of
adding the stop solution.
9. Calculation a. Generate a standard curve by plotting the
absorbance of standards against their concentrations. b.
Calculate the concentration of WHEY IGG in samples from their
absorbance values using the standard curve.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control sera with each batch of assays to
validate the accuracy and precision of the results.
• Acceptable ranges for quality control samples must be
established and followed.
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, review
the assay procedure, reagents, and equipment performance.
Documentation of corrective actions and re-running the assay
may be necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results for each patient specimen to ensure no flags or
anomalies.
• Enter final WHEY IGG concentrations into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and verify the results before reporting
them out.
• Consult with a supervisor if any result falls into critical or
questionable ranges.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Maintain and calibrate the ELISA plate reader regularly as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform weekly and monthly maintenance checks on incubators
and pipettes.
• Troubleshoot common problems such as high background, no
signal, or inconsistent results with manufacturer guidelines.

This SOP must be reviewed annually and when new equipment or
reagents are introduced into the laboratory procedures. All revisions
must be documented and approved by the laboratory director.
