Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for WHITEFISH IGE
1. PURPOSE: This procedure provides instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for Whitefish
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing. The goal is to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results to aid in diagnosing allergies
related to whitefish.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analysis, documenting results,
and reporting findings in accordance with this SOP. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring staff adherence to these
procedures and providing necessary training.
3. DEFINITION: Whitefish IgE refers to specific Immunoglobulin E
antibodies present in the blood as a response to whitefish
allergens. This test assesses the level of these antibodies to
determine allergic reactions to whitefish.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: 4.1 Specimen type: Serum or
plasma. 4.2 Collection tube: Serum separator tube (SST) or
EDTA tube. 4.3 Volume: 0.5 to 1 mL of serum or plasma. 4.4
Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 30 days
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS: 5.1. Equipment:
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Micropipettes (variable range)
◦ Calibration standards 5.2. Reagents:
◦ Whitefish IgE ELISA kit
◦ Assay buffer
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Quality controls (negative and positive)
6. PROCEDURE: 6.1 Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and samples reach room temperature
prior to analysis.
◦ Prepare reagents and control materials according to the
manufacturer’s instructions included in the Whitefish IgE
ELISA kit.
6.2 Calibration and Quality Control: - Perform calibration using the
standard calibration solutions provided in the ELISA kit. - Run quality
controls at the beginning of each batch of tests. Document the results
to ensure they fall within the established acceptable ranges.
6.3 Sample Processing: - Label the assay plate according to the
layout plan to include samples, controls, and calibration standards. -
Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples into
designated wells. - Add 100 µL of assay buffer to all wells. Incubate
at 37°C for 60 minutes. - Wash the wells 4 times with 300 µL of
prepared wash buffer. - Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each
well. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes. - Wash the wells 4 times with
300 µL of prepared wash buffer. - Add 100 µL of substrate solution to
each well and incubate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature in the
dark. - Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. - Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 30 minutes.
6.4 Interpretation of Results: - Calculate the mean absorbance for
each standard, control, and sample. - Plot the standard curve data
and determine the concentration of Whitefish IgE for each sample
using the standard curve. - Evaluate the quality control samples to
ensure the assay performed correctly.
1. QUALITY CONTROL: 7.1 Quality control materials should be
analyzed with each run. 7.2 Repeat any run where controls fall
outside the acceptable range. 7.3 Ensure that both negative
and positive controls produce expected results.
2. REPORTING RESULTS: 8.1 Results for patients should be
recorded in the laboratory information system (LIS) in
international units per milliliter (IU/mL). 8.2 Reference intervals:
◦ IgE (IU/mL) interpretation:
▪ < 0.35 IU/mL: Non-reactive
▪ 0.35 - 0.70 IU/mL: Low reactivity
▪ 0.71 - 3.50 IU/mL: Moderate reactivity
▪ 3.50 IU/mL: High reactivity 8.3 Critical values:
◦ Any result > 3.50 IU/mL must be reviewed by a senior
technologist and reported immediately to the requesting
physician.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS: 9.1 Hemolysis, lipemia, and other
sample interferences could affect assay results. 9.2 Proper
sample handling and storage are critical for accurate results.
4. REFERENCES: 10.1 Whitefish IgE ELISA kit manufacturer’s
instructions. 10.2 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) guidelines for immunoassay performance.
5. REVISION HISTORY: 11.1 Document and retain past revisions
as per the lab’s document control procedures. 11.2 Update this
SOP as necessary to reflect current practices and regulatory
requirements.
This protocol aims to ensure precision and accuracy in the Whitefish
IgE testing process, from sample preparation to result reporting,
maintaining the high standards expected of a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
