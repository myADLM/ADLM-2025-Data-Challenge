Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for White Ash, IgE, Serum:
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed and
uniform guidelines for the analytical processing, testing, and reporting
of results for White Ash, IgE (Immunoglobulin E) in serum samples.
This protocol ensures the accuracy, reliability, and repeatability of test
results in compliance with CLIA certification standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY The responsibilities detailed in this SOP fall to
trained laboratory technologists and specialists who operate in the
Immunology and Allergen testing sections of the laboratory. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere strictly to the
protocol to maintain the integrity of test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Volume required: Minimum 1 mL serum
• Collection tube: SST (Serum Separator Tube)
• Specimen stability:
◦ Room temperature (20-25 °C): 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8 °C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20 °C or lower): 28 days
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia
250)
• Calibrators and controls specific for IgE and White Ash allergen-
specific IgE
• Pipettes and tips
• SST tubes
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and Freezer (for sample storage)
• Barcode label printer
• Personal Protection Equipment (PPE)
• Quality control (QC) materials (with known IgE concentrations)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Conduct primary specimen verification ensuring proper
labeling (patient ID, collection date/time).
◦ Centrifuge SST tube at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
◦ Aliquot the separated serum into appropriately labeled
plastic tubes if required.
2. Specimen Storage:
◦ Immediately refrigerate or freeze aliquoted serum if analysis
is not performed promptly.
B. Analytical Steps:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Power on the immunoassay analyzer and perform start-up
checks as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify calibration is performed using IgE and White Ash
allergen-specific IgE calibrators.
◦ Load control materials and ensure they are within the
expiration date.
2. Loading and Running Samples:
◦ Load the patient serum samples, calibrators, and control
materials onto the analyzer.
◦ Ensure all samples are properly identified using barcode
labels to avoid mix-ups.
◦ Initiate the run using the appropriate test protocol for total
IgE and White Ash allergen-specific IgE.
3. Test Performance:
◦ Allow the analyzer to process the samples according to
predefined protocols.
◦ Record the date, time, and initials of the technician
performing the test.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Review the QC results immediately after analysis to confirm
they fall within the acceptable range.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot by following the manufacturer’s
guidelines and re-run controls as necessary.
◦ Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
C. Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Result Verification:
◦ Once the analysis is complete, verify the results for each
patient sample.
◦ Cross-check for any flagged values or error messages
generated by the instrument and reprocess if necessary.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Ensure all results are correctly entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Review the results for accuracy and validity before final
approval.
3. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Interpret IgE levels and allergen-specific IgE as per the
reference ranges and clinical guidelines.
◦ Document any critical values and ensure prompt
communication to the requesting clinician as per lab policy.
4. Specimen Disposal:
◦ Store tested specimens as per the retention policy or
discard following biohazard waste protocols.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Total Serum IgE:
◦ Adults: up to 100 kU/L
◦ Children: Vary with age
• Allergen-Specific IgE (White Ash):
◦ 0-0.35 kU/L: Negative
◦ 0.36-0.7 kU/L: Low Level
◦ 0.71-3.5 kU/L: Moderate Level
◦ 3.51-17.5 kU/L: High Level
◦ 17.5 kU/L: Very High Level
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
accuracy.
• Improper sample handling and storage can result in degradation
affecting IgE levels.

10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all related records including QC logs, instrument
maintenance logs, and patient result forms for a minimum of 2
years or as per regulatory requirements.
11. REVIEW SCHEDULE
• This SOP is subject to review and revision annually or as needed
when new guidelines or procedures are instituted.
