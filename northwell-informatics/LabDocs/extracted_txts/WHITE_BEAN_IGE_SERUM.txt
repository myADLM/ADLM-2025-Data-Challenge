Standard Operating Procedure for the Analysis of WHITE BEAN,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and precise measurement of Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) specific to White Bean allergen in serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
responsible for performing the White Bean, IgE, Serum assay.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to:
• Perform the White Bean, IgE, Serum analysis according to
established procedures.
• Ensure all quality control and calibration procedures are followed.
• Document all results and maintenance activities accurately.
• Identify and report any deviations or issues to the supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• WHITE BEAN, IGE, SERUM: A laboratory test that measures the
level of IgE antibodies against the White Bean allergen in a
patient's serum sample.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: SST (Serum Separator Tube) preferred, red-top
tube acceptable.
• Volume: Minimum 1 ml of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 30 days. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
5.2 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Equipment:
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerator and Freezer
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ White Bean IgE ELISA kit
◦ Quality control sera (negative and positive controls)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Microplate
◦ Timer
5.3 Detailed Testing Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(15-30°C) before use.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ Centrifuge collected blood samples at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum.
◦ Carefully transfer serum into a clean, appropriately labeled
tube.
◦ If analysis is not immediate, store serum samples at 2-8°C
for short term or -20°C for long term storage.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided in the White
Bean IgE ELISA kit insert.
◦ Pipette calibrators, controls, and patient samples into
designated wells of the microplate.
◦ Add enzyme conjugate to each well accordingly.
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time at room
temperature.
◦ Wash the plate using the wash buffer to remove unbound
substances.
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time, protected from light.
◦ Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
◦ Read the plate on ELISA reader at the appropriate
wavelength.
4. Calculations and Reporting:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the calibrators and
determine the IgE concentration of patient samples.
◦ Compare patient results with reference values provided in
the kit insert.
◦ Document and review results for accuracy before reporting.
5.4 Quality Control
• Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens in each
assay run.
• Acceptable ranges for positive and negative controls must be
defined and results should fall within these ranges to validate the
assay.
• If quality control results are outside acceptable limits, identify and
rectify issues before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
5.5 Troubleshooting
• If any issues arise with the assay, refer to the troubleshooting
guide in the ELISA kit insert.
• Common issues may include inadequate washing, incorrect
incubation times or temperatures, and improper sample handling.
6. DOCUMENTATION
Record the following information for each assay:
• Date and time of analysis
• Lot numbers of reagents and controls
• Calibration curves and patient results
• Any deviations from standard procedure and corrective actions
taken
• Signature/initials of the technologist performing the test
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for White Bean, IgE levels will be as provided
in the ELISA kit insert or reference laboratory guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the White Bean IgE ELISA kit insert for specific
limitations related to the assay.
9. REFERENCES
• White Bean IgE ELISA kit insert (manufacturer specifications).
• Relevant laboratory guidelines and quality control protocols.
10. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
reliability and consistency of White Bean, IgE, Serum assay results,
contributing to high-quality patient care and management.
