Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: White Faced
Hornet Venom (IgE), Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to detail the
analytical process for generating results for White Faced Hornet
venom-specific IgE testing in serum samples using
immunoassay methodologies. This includes equipment setup,
specimen processing, assay performance, quality control, and
result reporting.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing the analytical procedures described in this SOP and
ensuring accurate, timely, and reliable results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring the protocol is followed and for addressing
any issues that may arise during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen:
Serum Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of blood drawn in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature and
then centrifuge at 1500-2000xg for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, properly labeled tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without collection date/time
or proper identification.
• Serum specimens that have not been properly separated from the
clot.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, specimens should be stored frozen at -20°C
or colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. ANALYTICAL EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Siemens Immulite,
Phadia ImmunoCAP, or equivalent)
• Centrifuge
• Micro- and macro-pipettes
• Timer
Reagents and Supplies:
• White Faced Hornet venom-specific IgE assay kits and controls
• Calibrators provided with the assay kit
• Dilution buffer
• Deionized water, if required
• Sample tubes and collection containers
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment Setup:
1. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is properly calibrated
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform daily maintenance and quality checks as outlined in the
instrument manual.
3. Ensure all assay-specific consumables, reagents, and controls
are available and within their expiration dates.
Assay Performance:
1. Load serum samples onto the analyzer according to instrument
instructions, ensuring proper identification of each sample.
2. Make appropriate dilutions if specified in the assay kit
instructions.
3. Run the assay following the steps outlined in the
manufacturer’s protocol:
◦ Place sample and reagents in designated positions on the
analyzer.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the process through completion.
4. Read and record results from the analyzer ensuring all quality
control parameters are within acceptable limits.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens to confirm assay performance.
2. Confirm results of controls fall within the predetermined
acceptable range provided by the manufacturer.
3. Record QC results along with patient samples in the QC log.
Troubleshooting: In case of assay failure: - Recheck reagent volumes
and preparation. - Verify instrument calibration and maintenance
logs. - Repeat the assay if necessary. - Notify supervisor for further
action and documentation.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Validate results using the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Ensure all results comply with site-specific reporting guidelines.
4. Critical results should be immediately verified and reported to
the clinician according to the laboratory’s critical results policy.
5. Electronically transmit results to the LIS for final review and
verification by a technologist.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for IgE levels specific to White Faced Hornet
venom should align with those provided in the assay kit insert or
established by internal laboratory validation studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the specific assay kit insert for
limitations regarding sensitivity, specificity, and potential
interfering substances.
