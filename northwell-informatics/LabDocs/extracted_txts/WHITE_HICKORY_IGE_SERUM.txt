SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results of White Hickory,
IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed procedural steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for White Hickory, IgE, serum ensuring accuracy,
reliability, and consistency.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
monitoring, and documenting the steps outlined in this procedure.
They are also responsible for identifying and addressing any
deviations that may affect the results.
Supplies and Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Serum Separator Tube (SST)
• Pipettes and tips
• Appropriate laboratory gloves and PPE
• Calibrated microplate reader
• ELISA kit specific for White Hickory, IgE
• Deionized water
• Plate washer (optional)
• Timer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Reagent reservoirs
Reagents:
• White Hickory, IgE ELISA kit components (coated microplate,
standards, controls, wash buffer, sample diluent, enzyme
conjugate, substrate solution, stop solution)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Ensure that serum samples are properly collected, labeled, and stored at 2-8°C until processing. Samples should be brought to room temperature (20-25°C) before analysis.
2. Centrifuge SST at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes if the serum has not been already separated.
3. Carefully pipet out serum avoiding cellular components and debris.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare all reagents, working standards, and controls as per the ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. **Plate Setup:**
- Label wells of the microplate for standards, controls, and samples.
- Place standards and controls in duplicate.
2. **Sample Addition:**
- Pipette a measured volume of standards, controls, and serum samples (usually 100 µL) into designated wells.
3. **Enzyme Conjugate Addition:**
- Add the enzyme conjugate to all wells as per kit instructions.
4. **Incubation:**
- Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for the specified period (usually 1 hour).
5. **Washing:**
- Wash the plate as per kit instructions using the prepared wash buffer. Ensure thorough washing to remove unbound substances.
- Washing might be done manually or with plate washer.
6. **Substrate Reaction:**
- Add the substrate solution to each well.
- Incubate the plate at room temperature and protected from light for the specified time (usually 15-30 minutes).
7. **Stopping Reaction:**
- Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
8. **Reading:**
- Measure the absorbance of each well at the appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm) using a calibrated microplate reader.
D. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Analyze results from standards and controls first to ensure validity.
2. If controls fall outside the acceptable range, rerun the assay or troubleshoot potential problems (e.g., pipetting errors, reagent contamination).
3. Document all deviations and corrective actions taken.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance values of the standards.
2. Calculate the concentrations of White Hickory, IgE, in serum samples using interpolation from the standard curve.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and review and verify before final reporting.
Acceptance Criteria:
• Quality control results must be within acceptable ranges as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• The slope of the standard curve should meet the criteria specified
by the manufacturer.
