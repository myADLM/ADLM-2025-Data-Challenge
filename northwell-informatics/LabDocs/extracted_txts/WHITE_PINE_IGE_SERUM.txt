Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for White Pine IgE, Serum
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and procedures for the analysis and generation
of results for White Pine specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum
samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform, document, and review the White Pine IgE serum analysis,
as described in this SOP. Ensuring accuracy and reliability of test
results is crucial for patient care and decision-making.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250, ImmunoCAP 1000)
• White Pine IgE specific assay kits
• Calibrators and Controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Sample tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab
coat
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Turn on Immunoassay Analyzer and allow it to warm up
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Verify that all reagents and supplies, including White Pine IgE
specific assay kits, calibrators, and controls are not expired and
are stored at recommended conditions.
3. Ensure that the workstation is clean and free from
contaminants.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure serum specimens have been properly collected,
labeled, and stored at 2-8°C, or frozen at -20°C if testing is
delayed beyond 24 hours.
2. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw at room temperature and
mix thoroughly before analysis.
3. Centrifuge samples at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
potential debris or fibrin clots.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare and run calibrators according to the assay kit
instructions.
2. Prepare and run quality control samples (positive and negative
controls) to ensure the accuracy and precision of the assay.
3. Document calibration and quality control results in the QC
logbook prior to running patient samples.
D. Running the Assay
1. Load samples, calibrators, and quality controls into the
appropriate positions on the Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Select the White Pine IgE assay protocol on the Immunoassay
Analyzer.
3. Enter patient and control information as required by the
analyzer.
4. Start the assay run according to manufacturer instructions.
E. Result Analysis and Verification
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the analyzer-generated
results for calibrators and quality controls. Ensure they are
within acceptable ranges.
2. Validate patient results only if quality controls meet
predetermined specifications.
3. For any quality control failures or out-of-range calibrators,
investigate and take corrective action(s) before reporting patient
results.
F. Documentation and Reporting
1. Record the results, including the patient identifier, assay run
date, and results, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Verify and review the results according to laboratory protocol
before releasing to the healthcare provider.
3. If any critical values are observed (value significantly high
indicating potential severe allergic reaction), notify the
responsible healthcare provider immediately following
notification procedures.
G. Cleanup and Maintenance
1. Properly dispose of any used consumables (e.g., pipette tips,
microcentrifuge tubes) in biohazard waste containers.
2. Clean the Immunoassay Analyzer and workspace as per
manufacturer and laboratory protocols.
3. Perform routine maintenance on the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s schedule and guidelines.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Immunoassay Analyzer and White Pine IgE assay kit
instructions for specific limitations. Note that certain sample
conditions such as hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect the assay
results.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the Immunoassay Analyzer User Manual and White Pine IgE
Assay Kit Instructions for detailed procedural steps and further
information.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Maintain a log of quality control results and regularly review to
identify any trends or recurring issues.
• In case of instrument malfunctions or inconsistent results, refer to
the analyzer troubleshooting guide. If unresolved, contact
technical support.
1. REVISION HISTORY
Document the revision number, change details, and effective date for
all updates to the SOP.
