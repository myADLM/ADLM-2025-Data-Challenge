Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
TITLE: Analytical Phase: Generation of Results for
White Potato, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the
measurement and reporting of White Potato-specific Immunoglobulin
E (IgE) levels in serum samples. This SOP ensures the accurate and
reliable determination of IgE antibodies specific to White Potato
allergen to aid in the diagnosis of allergic responses.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing White
Potato, IgE, Serum testing in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• The medical laboratory scientists are responsible for carrying out
the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the compliance with this
SOP and troubleshooting any issues that arise during the testing
process.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to maintain the
integrity and quality of the testing process and to accurately
document results.
4. DEFINITIONS
White Potato, IgE, Serum: An assay to quantitatively measure the
levels of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to the White
Potato allergen in a patient's serum sample.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
HANDLING
5.1 Specimen Type
• Preferred Specimen: Serum obtained from a properly collected
and handled blood specimen.
5.2 Specimen Volume
• Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum.
5.3 Specimen Storage
• Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for short term
storage (up to 7 days) or at -20°C for long term storage. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles to prevent degradation of the IgE
antibodies.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
6.1 Equipment
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia™ ImmunoCAP™ system or
equivalent)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
6.2 Reagents
• White Potato allergen-specific ImmunoCAP™ (or equivalent
assay-specific reagent)
• Quality Control (QC) materials: both positive and negative
controls
• Calibrators and any necessary diluents provided with the assay kit
6.3 Supplies
• Standard laboratory glassware and plasticware
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
1. Review the instrument manual for start-up, calibration, and
assay-specific instructions.
2. Check that all reagents and materials required for the analysis
are available and within expiration date.
3. Perform a daily equipment calibration check according to the
analyzer's manual.
7.2 Quality Control
1. Run the positive and negative QC samples according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Document the QC results and verify they fall within the
established acceptable range.
7.3 Sample Analysis
1. Thaw serum samples stored at -20°C to room temperature.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
3. Pipette the appropriate volume of serum (as specified by the
assay protocol) into the reaction vessel or well.
4. Load the ImmunoCAP™ (or specified assay kit) specific for
White Potato, IgE, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Initiate the assay run on the analyzer and follow the instrument
prompts and protocols.
6. Upon completion, retrieve the results and ensure they are
within the reportable range of the assay.
8. RESULT REPORTING
8.1 Interpreting Results
• Compare the patient sample IgE levels to the calibrator and
control values.
• Refer to the manufacturer's reference intervals for interpretative
guidelines. Generally:
◦ IgE < 0.35 kUA/L: Negative
◦ IgE 0.35 – 0.70 kUA/L: Low level
◦ IgE 0.71 – 3.50 kUA/L: Moderate level
◦ IgE > 3.50 kUA/L: High level
8.2 Documentation
1. Record all results accurately in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Verify the results and ensure all quality control measures were
within acceptable limits.
3. Consult with a supervisor in case of unusual or unexpected
results.
8.3 Report Generation
1. Generate a standardized patient report from the LIS.
2. Ensure that the report includes patient identification, test
performed, result, units, reference intervals, and any relevant
comments or interpretations.
3. Approve and release the report for physician review.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Daily quality control checks should be performed and
documented.
2. Monthly cross-validation with external standards can be used
to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
3. Annual proficiency testing through an accredited external
agency should be performed to maintain laboratory certification
and analyst competency.
10. MAINTENANCE
• Regularly scheduled maintenance of the analyzer should be
carried out as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all maintenance activities in the laboratory equipment
maintenance log.
