Standard Operating Procedure for Analyzing Whole Blood
Samples
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results from whole blood samples. This protocol
ensures that the integrity of the sample is maintained, accurate
results are generated, and all testing is performed in accordance with
CLIA guidelines.
1. Scope
These procedures apply to all whole blood sample analyses
performed in the laboratory.
1. Responsibility
Laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to the procedures
outlined in this document, ensuring the integrity of the sample,
conducting accurate tests, and properly recording and reporting
results.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Heparinized whole blood (preferred: dry lithium heparin to
avoid dilution)
◦ Blood gas syringes
◦ Heparinized vacutainer (dark green top)
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA specimens
◦ Blood gas samples with significant air bubbles (>10%)
◦ Clotted specimens
◦ Specimens with a needle attached
1. Sample Handling and Pre-Analysis
• Upon receipt, verify the specimen’s identification and integrity.
• Ensure the specimen is adequately mixed before analysis by
gentle inversion or rolling if in a capillary tube.
• Remove any air bubbles in blood gas syringes.
1. Analyzers Preparation
• Ensure that the analyzer is properly calibrated and quality controls
are within acceptable limits before processing samples.
• Document any calibration and quality control activities as per the
equipment manufacturer’s instructions.
1. Procedure
• Blood Gas Analysis:
1. Select the appropriate cartridge or module for the sample.
2. Expel any air in the syringe or capillary tube to minimize
contact with air.
3. Mix the sample gently by inversion or using a metal flea for
capillary tubes.
4. Analyze the sample using the designated blood gas
analyzer.
5. Record results or ensure they are automatically transmitted
to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Hematology Analysis:
1. Mix the blood sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
2. Load the sample into the hematology analyzer.
3. Confirm that the analyzer performs appropriate internal
quality controls.
4. Analyze the sample for full blood count, including
parameters like WBC, RBC, Hb, Hct, platelets, etc.
5. Record results or ensure they are automatically transmitted
to the LIS.
• Coagulation Tests:
1. Whole blood can be utilized for point-of-care coagulation
testing using specific cartridges.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for processing and
analyzing the sample.
3. Record results or ensure they are automatically transmitted
to the LIS.
1. Quality Control
• Perform daily QC checks as per the equipment manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Ensure all analytes necessary for patient assessment are within
acceptable ranges.
• Document any QC failures and initiate corrective actions.
1. Reporting Results
• Review all results for accuracy and consistency before final
verification.
• Verify and release results in the LIS.
• Follow up on any critical values according to the laboratory's
critical value policy.
1. Sample Integrity and Troubleshooting
• In cases of questionable sample integrity (e.g., hemolysis),
evaluate the sample visually or centrifuge an aliquot if needed.
• Make a judgment call on whether to proceed with the analysis or
request a new sample.
• Document any issues encountered and actions taken in the log.
1. Documentation and Record Keeping
• Record all temperatures, calibrations, QC results, and instrument
settings in the log.
• Maintain documentation according to the laboratory’s record-
keeping policy for tracking and future references.
1. References
• Equipment manufacturer's operation manual.
• CLIA guidelines for clinical laboratory testing.
• Laboratory’s internal quality assurance manuals.
