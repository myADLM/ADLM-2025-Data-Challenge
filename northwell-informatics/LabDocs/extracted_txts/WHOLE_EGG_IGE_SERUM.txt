Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for WHOLE EGG, IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
WHOLE EGG, IGE, SERUM to ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow
this SOP during the analysis of WHOLE EGG, IGE, SERUM
samples. It is the responsibility of the Laboratory Supervisor to
ensure staff are trained and competent in carrying out these
procedures.
1. DEFINITIONS WHOLE EGG, IGE: Specific IgE antibody test
for whole egg allergen, measured in serum. Serum: The clear
liquid that can be separated from clotted blood which contains
antibodies.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader
• ELISA Washer
• Incubator
• Microplate
• WHOLE EGG, IGE ELISA Kit
• Multichannel Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Microcentrifuge Tubes
• Serum Samples
• Calibrators and Controls (Negative and Positive)
• Wash buffer, Substrate Solution, Stop Solution, and Diluent
provided by the ELISA kit
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Acceptable
Specimens:
◦ Serum collected in serum separator tubes (SST).
◦ Keep specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 72 hours.
◦ If the analysis is delayed beyond 72 hours, freeze the serum
samples at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
specimens. - Specimens collected in tubes other than SST.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Setup 1. Ensure all reagents and specimens are
at room temperature before use. 2. Label microplate wells for
standards, controls, and samples. 3. Prepare wash buffer, diluents,
and other reagents as per the ELISA kit instructions.
B) Sample and Reagent Preparation 1. Dilute serum samples 1:10
with the sample diluent provided in the ELISA kit (e.g., 10 μL serum
into 90 μL diluent). 2. Prepare standards and controls according to
the ELISA kit instructions.
C) Assay Procedure 1. Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted
serum samples to the appropriate wells. 2. Incubate at room
temperature for 60 minutes. 3. Wash the plate 5 times with the wash
buffer. 4. Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugate (secondary antibody) to
each well. 5. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. 6. Wash
the plate 5 times with the wash buffer. 7. Add 100 μL of substrate
solution to each well. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes in
the dark. 8. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
D) Measurement 1. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader. 2. Ensure the ELISA reader is calibrated and pre-set to
the appropriate parameters. 3. Record the absorbance values for
standards, controls, and samples.
1. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values
of the known standards.
2. Determine sample concentrations using the standard
curve.
3. Interpret results as per the clinical reference ranges
provided in the ELISA kit insert.
Reference Intervals: - Negative: <0.35 kU/L - Borderline/Equivocal:
0.35 - 0.70 kU/L - Positive: >0.70 kU/L
1. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls with each run to
validate the assay performance.
2. Verify that the controls fall within the expected ranges. If
controls do not meet acceptance criteria, repeat the
assay.
3. Review calibration curves and validate that the correlation
coefficient (r²) is within acceptable limits (≥0.98).
2. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results for accuracy.
3. Report critical results immediately to the requesting
physician and document the communication.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the WHOLE EGG, IGE ELISA kit insert for any
specific limitations of the assay.
◦ Results from hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly stored
samples may be unreliable.
