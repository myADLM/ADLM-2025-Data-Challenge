STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Whole Exome and Mitochondrial Genome Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results from whole exome and mitochondrial genome
sequencing in a CSIA-certified laboratory. This ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for diagnostic and research
purposes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff, who are adequately trained in
sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and quality control, will
perform all tasks according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory manager to ensure that all
necessary resources, equipment, and reagents are available and
that all instruments are properly maintained and calibrated.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Whole Exome Sequencing (WES): Sequencing of all protein-
coding regions (exons) in the genome.
• Mitochondrial Genome Sequencing: Sequencing of the complete
mitochondrial DNA, which contains the genetic material of
mitochondria.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Genomic DNA Preparation:
1. Verify sample integrity and concentration using a Qubit
fluorometer or NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
2. Perform quality control using agarose gel electrophoresis and/
or a Fragment Analyzer to check for intact, high molecular
weight DNA.
3. Ensure that all samples meet the concentration and purity
requirements as specified in the kit manual for sequencing
library preparation.
B. Library Preparation:
1. Prepare sequencing libraries using a validated commercial kit,
such as the Agilent SureSelectXT for exome sequencing or
NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep for the mitochondrial
genome.
2. Follow the manufacturer's protocol meticulously, including end-
repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification.
3. Assess library quality and quantity using a Fragment Analyzer
or Bioanalyzer and a Qubit fluorometer or qPCR.
C. Sequencing:
1. Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform (e.g.,
Illumina NovaSeq 6000).
2. Follow the platform-specific guidelines for cluster generation,
sequencing run setup, and monitoring.
3. Ensure sequencing run parameters, such as read length and
sequencing depth, meet the requirements for the desired
coverage (typically 80-100X for exome and 300-500X for
mitochondrial genome).
D. Data Analysis:
1. Initial Data Processing:
◦ Utilize the sequencing platform’s software for generating
FASTQ files and performing initial quality checks.
◦ Remove adapters and low-quality reads using tools like
Trimmomatic or Cutadapt.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align the sequences to the reference genome (e.g.,
GRCh38 for nuclear genome and MITOMAP for
mitochondrial genome) using BWA or a similar aligner.
◦ Perform variant calling using GATK or another validated
pipeline, identifying SNPs, indels, and other variants of
interest.
3. Annotation and Interpretation:
◦ Annotate variants using tools such as VEP, ANNOVAR, or
SnpEff for functional prediction and impact assessment.
◦ Integrate additional databases (e.g., ClinVar, gnomAD) to
aid in clinical interpretation.
E. Quality Control and Validation:
1. Ensure that all sequences meet predefined quality metrics,
including average depth of coverage, uniformity, and base
quality scores.
2. Validate identified variants using Sanger sequencing or another
orthogonal method when necessary.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the sequencing
run, data quality, identified variants, and their interpretation.
2. Ensure that the report is reviewed by a certified geneticist or
qualified personnel before final verification.
3. Communicate the results to the ordering clinician or researcher,
following the guidelines for clinical reporting and data privacy.
G. Data Storage and Retention:
1. Store raw and processed data securely, adhering to data
protection regulations.
2. Archive sequencing data and associated analyses for a
minimum of five years or as specified by institutional guidelines.
3. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of all procedures, including sample
preparation, library prep, sequencing runs, data analysis, quality
control measures, and report generation.
• Record any deviations from the protocol, corrective actions taken,
and final outcomes.
