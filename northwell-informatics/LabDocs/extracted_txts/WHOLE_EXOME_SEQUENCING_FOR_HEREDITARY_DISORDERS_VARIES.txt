Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Whole Exome
Sequencing for Hereditary Disorders
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedural steps for the analytical phase
of generating results for Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) intended
for the detection of hereditary disorders. This protocol ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results from sequencing data.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of WES data for hereditary disorders.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Genetic Technologists: Perform data analysis and initial
interpretation.
• Bioinformaticians: Manage data processing pipelines and variant
annotation.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Review and authorize final reports.
• Quality Assurance Staff: Monitor compliance with the SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• WES: Whole Exome Sequencing involves sequencing all coding
regions of the genome to identify variants associated with
hereditary disorders.
• FASTQ: Raw data file format produced by high-throughput
sequencing.
• BAM: Binary sequence alignment map, a binary version of SAM
file, storing aligned sequence data.
• VCF: Variant Call Format, a standardized text file format for
storing gene sequence variations.
• SNVs: Single Nucleotide Variants.
• Indels: Insertions and deletions.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Raw Data Quality Control
Step 1: Data Retrieval and Integrity Check
• Retrieve raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) from the sequencer
or data storage.
• Verify the integrity of the FASTQ files using checksums to ensure
complete and unaltered files.
Step 2: Quality Control Assessment
• Use software tools such as FastQC to evaluate the quality of raw
sequencing data.
• Generate quality control reports and assess the parameters such
as per base sequence quality, GC content, sequence length
distribution, and adapter contamination.
Step 3: Trimming and Filtering
• Trim adaptor sequences and low-quality bases using tools like
Trimmomatic.
• Filter out low-quality reads based on Q-score thresholds (e.g.,
Q30).
B. Sequence Alignment and Conversion
Step 4: Alignment to Reference Genome
• Align high-quality reads to the reference genome (e.g., GRCh38)
using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) with recommended
parameters for paired-end reads.
• Convert and sort aligned data into BAM format using SAMtools.
Step 5: Post-Alignment Processing
• Mark duplicates in the BAM file using Picard to identify and
remove PCR duplicates.
• Perform local realignment around indels using the Genome
Analysis Toolkit (GATK).
• Recalibrate base quality scores using GATK's BaseRecalibrator.
C. Variant Calling and Annotation
Step 6: Variant Calling
• Use GATK's HaplotypeCaller or an equivalent tool to call SNVs
and indels from the BAM file, generating a VCF file.
• Apply VQSR (Variant Quality Score Recalibration) or similar
methods to filter and recalibrate variant calls.
Step 7: Variant Annotation
• Annotate variants using tools such as ANNOVAR or SnpEff.
Annotation includes adding information about gene function,
pathogenicity predictions, population frequency, and clinical
significance.
• Annotate variants using in-house databases and cross-
referencing with ClinVar, dbSNP, and relevant literature.
D. Data Review and Interpretation
Step 8: Data Review and Curated Analysis
• Review the VCF file for potential hereditary disorder-related
variants in relevant genes using integrated genome viewers (e.g.,
IGV).
• Curate a list of potential pathogenic variants. Assess the clinical
significance based on ACMG guidelines and other relevant
criteria.
Step 9: Clinical Correlation
• Correlate identified variants with the patient's phenotype, family
history, and clinical presentation.
• Discuss findings with the medical geneticist/counselor.
E. Reporting and Documentation
Step 10: Report Preparation
• Prepare a comprehensive clinical report summarizing the findings,
including methodology, identified variants of significance,
interpretation, and clinical recommendations.
Step 11: Review and Approval
• Review the report by a laboratory supervisor or a qualified
geneticist.
• Ensure all data, procedures, and results are documented
according to laboratory standards. Attach the required supporting
documents such as quality control reports and raw data forms.
Step 12: Result Release
• Communicate the finalized report to the referring physician/
genetic counselor.
• Store the results securely, following HIPAA and institutional
guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control
• Cross-check variant calls by processing the same sample through
different pipelines/tools.
• Include positive control samples with known variants to validate
the entire workflow.
External Quality Assurance
• Participate in proficiency testing and external quality assurance
programs (e.g., CAP, EMQN).
7. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance computing resources for data analysis.
• Essential software tools: FastQC, BWA, SAMtools, GATK, Picard,
ANNOVAR/SnpEff, IGV.
• Reference genome datasets (e.g., GRCh38).
8. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow all relevant institutional and regulatory guidelines for data
handling and patient information security.
• Ensure proper training and safety protocols are adhered to in the
laboratory.
