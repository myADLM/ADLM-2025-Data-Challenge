Standard Operating Procedure: Whole Exome Sequencing
(WES) Reanalysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a comprehensive protocol for the reanalysis of previously
generated Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data to identify potential
diagnostic variants in the context of updated databases, new
literature, or clinical data.
Responsibility:
• Designated technologists and bioinformaticians are responsible
for implementing this protocol.
• The supervisor is responsible for reviewing and verifying all
reanalysis results to ensure accuracy and compliance with the
latest quality standards.
1. DEFINITION
Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) reanalysis involves a detailed re-
evaluation of previously generated exome data to identify pathogenic
variants that may have been missed or reclassified due to the
availability of new genetic information or improved computational
tools.
1. PROCEDURE
A. PRE-ANALYTICAL PREPARATION
1. Retrieve and Verify Stored Data:
◦ Access stored exome sequencing data. Confirm integrity
and completeness of raw sequence files (FASTQ), aligned
files (BAM/CRAM), and variant call files (VCF).
◦ Ensure all necessary patient consent forms and clinical data
are up to date.
2. Prepare Analysis Environment:
◦ Set up computational environment, ensuring appropriate
software versions and databases are installed (e.g., GATK,
BWA, SAMtools, ANNOVAR, Reference Genome [GRCh38],
ClinVar, dbSNP, gnomAD).
B. DATA REPROCESSING
1. Reference Genome Alignment:
◦ Align raw sequence reads (FASTQ) to the reference
genome (GRCh38) using the BWA-MEM algorithm.
◦ Post-process aligned sequences with SAMtools to sort and
index BAM files.
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Call variants with the GATK HaplotypeCaller, enabling
identification of SNPs, indels, and structural variants.
◦ Generate new VCF files that include detailed variant
annotations.
3. Variant Quality Control:
◦ Apply GATK’s Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR)
or other suitable quality control practices, filtering based on
quality metrics such as depth, quality by depth (QD),
mapping quality (MQ), and strand bias.
◦ Review filtered variants for quality assurance, making
necessary adjustments to filter thresholds as needed.
C. VARIANT ANNOTATION AND PRIORITIZATION
1. Variant Annotation:
◦ Annotate variants using ANNOVAR or VEP with the latest
functional impact information, population frequencies
(gnomAD), disease association databases (ClinVar, OMIM),
and in silico prediction tools (SIFT, PolyPhen).
2. Clinical Correlation:
◦ Cross-reference annotated variants with updated literature
and patient’s clinical history.
◦ Prioritize variants based on pathogenicity, clinical relevance,
zygosity, allele frequency, conservation, and functional
predictions.
D. VARIANT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Interpretation:
◦ Engage a multidisciplinary team including clinical
geneticists, bioinformaticians, and medical laboratory
scientists to evaluate clinically significant variants.
◦ Consider reclassification of variants of uncertain significance
(VUS) based on new guidelines and evidence from updated
databases.
2. Generating Report:
◦ Compile a comprehensive clinical report summarizing the
reanalysis findings. Include details such as variant
description, zygosity, population frequency, in silico
predictions, clinical significance, and supporting literature
references.
◦ Highlight any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that
may have diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic implications.
3. Report Review and Validation:
◦ Supervisor or designated senior scientist reviews the report
for scientific accuracy and clarity.
◦ Verify the report against primary data for accuracy before
releasing the final report to the clinician.
E. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
1. Recording Results:
◦ Document all steps of the reanalysis, including variant
interpretation decisions and literature references, in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Maintain detailed records of any software and database
versions used during the reanalysis.
2. Communication:
◦ Provide the final validated report to the referring clinician.
Ensure timely communication of any critical findings.
◦ Offer consultation or follow-up discussion if necessary.
QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Participate in external quality assessment schemes and internal
audits for continuous quality improvement.
• Regularly review and update the reanalysis procedure to
incorporate new developments in the field of genomics.
