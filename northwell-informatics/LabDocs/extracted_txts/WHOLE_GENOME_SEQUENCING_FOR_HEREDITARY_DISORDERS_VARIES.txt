Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR HEREDITARY DISORDERS
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
whole genome sequencing (WGS) specifically for hereditary
disorders. This includes DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing, data analysis, and result validation.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to perform these procedures. The laboratory supervisor or
designated personnel are responsible for reviewing and validating the
results.
1. DEFINITIONS Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS): A
comprehensive method for analyzing the entire genomic DNA
sequence of an organism at a single time. Hereditary Disorders:
Genetic disorders known to be inherited from one or both
parents.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION Samples:
Preferred: Peripheral blood in EDTA tube. Alternative: Saliva
sample collected using an FDA-cleared collection kit. DNA
Extraction: Extract high-quality genomic DNA using an
established DNA extraction method (e.g., Qiagen DNA Blood
Mini Kit). Quantify the extracted DNA using fluorometric
methods (e.g., Qubit) and ensure high molecular weight intact
DNA using gel electrophoresis.
3. PROCEDURE
4. DNA Library Preparation: Use a commercially available library
preparation kit suitable for WGS (e.g., Illumina DNA Prep): a.
Fragmentation: Fragment the genomic DNA to the desired size
(200-500 bp) using mechanical or enzymatic methods. b. End
Repair and A-Tailing: Prepare fragmented DNA ends for
adapter ligation. c. Adapter Ligation: Ligate unique sequencing
adapters to the ends of the fragmented DNA. d. Purification:
Purify the adapter-ligated DNA using magnetic beads or
equivalent purification methods. e. Amplification: Amplify the
adapter-ligated DNA using PCR, and purify the PCR products.
5. Sequencing: Load the prepared DNA libraries onto a
sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina NextSeq or NovaSeq): a.
Perform paired-end sequencing as per the sequencing
platform’s protocols (e.g., 2x150 bp reads). b. Ensure sufficient
sequence coverage (e.g., 30X) to reliably detect variants
associated with hereditary disorders.
6. Data Analysis: a. Quality Control (QC) of Raw Sequencing
Data: Use QC tools (e.g., FastQC) to assess the quality of the
raw sequencing reads. Trim low-quality bases and adapter
sequences from reads. b. Alignment: Align cleaned reads to the
human reference genome (e.g., GRCh38) using a suitable
aligner (e.g., BWA-MEM). c. Variant Calling: Call single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels)
using variant callers (e.g., GATK, Samtools). d. Variant
Annotation: Annotate variants using annotation tools (e.g.,
ANNOVAR, VEP) to link variants with known hereditary
disorders. e. Filtering: Apply filters to identify potentially
pathogenic variants (e.g., variant allele frequency, functional
impact). f. Analysis: Confirm the biological relevance of variants
through in-silico predictions and review with genomics
guidelines (e.g., ACMG).
7. Result Validation: a. Confirmatory Testing: If required, confirm
pathogenic variants through alternative methods (e.g., Sanger
sequencing). b. Review: Review results by a molecular
geneticist or designated personnel. Include checking for
consistency with clinical information and reanalysis as
necessary.
8. RESULT REPORTING Generate a comprehensive report
including: Identification of the specimen and patient.
Sequencing coverage statistics. Identified variants and
annotated information. Pathogenicity prediction with an
emphasis on clinically relevant hereditary disorders.
Recommendations for genetic counseling or further
confirmatory testing.
9. QUALITY CONTROL Include positive and negative controls in
each batch of DNA library preparation. Perform inter-run and
intra-run quality assessments as per institutional guidelines.
Utilize internal standards and reference materials to ensure
accuracy and precision.

This SOP outlines the comprehensive workflow for obtaining and
validating whole genome sequencing data to identify hereditary
disorders, ensuring high-quality, reproducible results in a clinical
laboratory setting.
