Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Whole Genome
Sequencing (WGS) Reanalysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for reanalyzing Whole Genome
Sequencing (WGS) data to ensure accurate and updated
interpretations of genomic results. Reanalysis may be warranted due
to new scientific findings, improved computational tools, or at the
request of healthcare providers.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff involved in the reanalysis of WGS
data within the laboratory. It covers the computational, quality control,
and interpretive aspects of reanalyzing WGS data.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated bioinformaticians, clinical
geneticists, and laboratory technicians to adhere to this procedure.
The laboratory supervisor must ensure compliance with this SOP and
facilitate any necessary corrective actions.
1. DEFINITIONS
• WGS Reanalysis: The process of reexamining previously
sequenced whole genome data using updated tools, databases,
and knowledge.
• FASTQ files: Raw sequence data files from a sequencing run.
• BAM files: Binary Alignment/Map files, the binary version of
Sequence Alignment/Map files that store aligned sequences.
• VCF files: Variant Call Format files that contain information about
variants found in the genomic data.
• HGMD: Human Gene Mutation Database, a repository of known
human gene mutations causing disease.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Confirm Need for Reanalysis
1. Reanalysis may be initiated based on a clinician's request,
identification of significant updates in relevant databases, or the
release of new bioinformatics tools.
2. Document the reason for reanalysis and the date of the
request.
B. Data Retrieval
1. Access the original FASTQ, BAM, and VCF files stored in the
laboratory’s secure data repository.
2. Ensure the integrity and completeness of the files before
proceeding.
C. Reanalysis Workflow
1. Use the updated reference genome (as per current guidelines,
e.g., GRCh38).
2. Align the raw sequence data (FASTQ files) to the reference
genome using the latest alignment tools (e.g., BWA MEM).
3. Sort and index BAM files using the SAMtools suite.
4. Perform variant calling using an appropriate variant caller (e.g.,
GATK, FreeBayes) to generate updated VCF files.
5. Annotate variants using the latest annotations from databases
such as ClinVar, HGMD, and gnomAD.
D. Quality Control
1. Assess the quality of the reanalysis using established metrics
such as alignment rates, coverage statistics, and variant call
confidence.
2. Document any quality issues and take corrective action if
necessary.
E. Variant Interpretation
1. Review annotated variants for clinical significance using current
guidelines (e.g., ACMG criteria).
2. Compare results with previous analyses to identify any new
findings or changes in interpretation.
3. Confer with clinical geneticists for the final interpretation and
classification of variants.
F. Reporting Results
1. Prepare an updated report detailing the reanalyzed findings,
including any new variants of interest.
2. Highlight changes from the previous analysis and provide
clinical interpretation for new or reclassified variants.
3. Ensure the report is reviewed and approved by a clinical
geneticist before dissemination.
4. Upload the reanalyzed results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and notify the requesting clinician.
G. Data Management
1. Maintain a secure backup of all reanalyzed data and relevant
documentation.
2. Update the laboratory’s WGS data inventory to reflect the
reanalysis.
3. RECORD KEEPING
Document the reanalysis procedures and findings in a dedicated log.
Ensure all records are accurate, complete, and stored securely.
Records must be retained as per laboratory policy and regulatory
requirements.
