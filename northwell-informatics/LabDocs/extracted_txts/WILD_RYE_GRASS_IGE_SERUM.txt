Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Wild Rye Grass, IgE, Serum
Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Wild Rye Grass, IgE, serum testing. It ensures
accurate and reliable results for diagnosing allergic sensitization to
Wild Rye Grass.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analytical process outlined in this SOP. Laboratory
supervisors must ensure that the procedures are followed and any
anomalies are addressed and recorded promptly.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analyzer or equivalent
• Calibrated microplate reader
• Wild Rye Grass allergen-specific IgE assay kit
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Calibrated laboratory timer
• Microcentrifuge tubes and racks
• Serum samples (properly labeled)
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify that the serum samples have been properly collected,
received, and accessioned.
2. Maintain the samples at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within
48 hours, or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
3. Thaw serum samples to room temperature before starting the
assay.
B. Reagent and Equipment Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and equipment to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare the required number of microplate wells for the assay.
3. Reconstitute standards, controls, and reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microplate wells appropriately for samples, standards,
and controls.
2. Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples into designated wells.
3. Add the enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well following the kit
instructions.
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the specified
duration (typically 30-60 minutes).
5. Thoroughly wash the wells using an automated plate washer or
manual washing method as per the kit instructions.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified duration (typically 10-30 minutes).
7. Add the stop solution to terminate the reaction.
8. Measure the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader
set to the appropriate wavelength (commonly 450 nm).
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
ensure the assay's validity.
2. Document all QC results and take corrective actions if the
results fall outside of the acceptable range.
E. Calculations and Reporting:
1. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards.
2. Calculate the IgE concentration for each serum sample from
the standard curve.
3. Perform all necessary validations and verifications of the results
before reporting.
4. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and verification by the technologist.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any sample or control yields an unexpected result, repeat the
assay.
• If the QC samples fall outside of the accepted range, investigate
potential issues with reagents, equipment, or technique, and
repeat the assay.
• If persistent issues occur, bring them to the attention of the
supervisor for further action and resolution.
5. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate PPE, such as lab coats, gloves, and eye
protection.
• Handle all specimens according to biosafety level 2 protocols.
• Dispose of waste materials, including used microplates, reagents,
and consumables, in accordance with local regulations and
laboratory guidelines.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for the Wild Rye Grass
allergen-specific IgE assay kit.
• Laboratory Specific Guidelines and Protocols.
• Related CLSI Standards and Guidelines.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDING
• Record all sample processing, quality control, and results in the
appropriate logbooks or Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Maintain thorough documentation of any deviations, anomalies,
and corrective actions taken.
