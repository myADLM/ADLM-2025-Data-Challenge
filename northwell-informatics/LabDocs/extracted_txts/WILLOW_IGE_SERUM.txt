Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
WILLOW, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for WILLOW, IGE, SERUM tests using
immunoassays.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analytical steps of
the WILLOW, IGE, SERUM tests, ensuring accurate and timely
results. The staff must identify and report any issues encountered
during testing to the supervisor promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is measured in serum to identify allergen-
specific reactions, monitor allergic conditions, and diagnose related
disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Serum. Collect blood using a serum
separator tube (SST) or a red-top tube without anticoagulant.
• Specimen Handling: Allow the blood to clot at room temperature
for 30 minutes and then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 x
g.
• Storage: Serum samples should be tested as soon as possible. If
not tested immediately, store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
prolonged storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer
• IgE specific test kits, WILLOW
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrators and Controls
• Timer
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Safety
◦ Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab
coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
2. Reagent Preparation
◦ Thaw all reagents to room temperature and mix thoroughly
before use.
◦ Prepare calibrators and quality control materials according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Instrument Setup
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to warm up
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Perform daily maintenance and calibrate the instrument
using the provided standards.
B. Analysis
1. Sample Loading
◦ Place sufficient sample cups or tubes in the sample rack.
◦ Load samples, calibrators, and controls into the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Test Execution
◦ Select the IgE test from the instrument's menu.
◦ Assign sample identification numbers.
◦ Start the analysis.
3. Instrument Monitoring
◦ Monitor the instrument during the run to ensure proper
function.
◦ Document any anomalies or error messages.
4. Post-Analysis
◦ Analyze results once the run is completed.
◦ Verify that all control and calibrator values are within the
acceptable range.
◦ If the quality control fails, repeat the analysis and
troubleshoot any discrepancies according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Print and review the results.
C. Result Interpretation
1. Reference Intervals
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's insert for age-specific reference
ranges for IgE.
◦ Compare patient results to reference intervals to determine
if they are within normal range.
2. Reporting
◦ Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure they are reviewed and verified by a technologist.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run external positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
• Review quality control data to confirm that the assay performs
within the defined limits.
• Record all quality control results in the appropriate logbook.
• If control results are out of range, do not report patient results until
the issue is resolved.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the instrument and reagent troubleshooting guides if the
instrument flags any errors or if control results are not within
acceptable ranges.
• Inform the supervisor of any unresolved issues.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all temperature, calibration, control, and test records are
completed and stored according to laboratory policy.
• Document any deviations from the procedure and actions taken in
the logbook.

calibration procedures.
This protocol ensures proper handling and analysis of WILLOW, IGE,
SERUM samples in compliance with laboratory standards, providing
accurate and reliable test results.
