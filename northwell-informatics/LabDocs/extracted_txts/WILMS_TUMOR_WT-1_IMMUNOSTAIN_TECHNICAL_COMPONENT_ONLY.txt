Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for WT-1 Immunostain: Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure accurate and consistent
analytical procedures for the generation of WT-1 immunostain
results. This procedure applies to the technical component only and
involves the preparation, staining, and initial quality assessment of
the tissue samples stained for WT-1.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel, including
histotechnologists and laboratory technicians, to follow this SOP for
WT-1 immunostain. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the
procedures are performed as described and that all quality control
measures are adhered to.
3. DEFINITIONS
WT-1 Immunostain: An immunohistochemical stain used for detecting
WT-1 (Wilms Tumor 1) protein expression in tissue samples. WT-1 is
typically used in the diagnostic evaluation of Wilms tumor and other
neoplasms.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Section Thickness: 3-5 microns
• Unacceptable Specimens: Tissue sections that are excessively
thick or thin, improperly fixed, or inadequately embedded.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Hot water bath
• Glass slides
• WT-1 primary antibody
• Blocking reagent
• Secondary antibody (preferably HRP-conjugated)
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Humidity chamber
• Positive and negative control slides
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 3-5 micron sections using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath and mount onto glass slides.
3. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 30-60 minutes to ensure
adherence.
6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 10 minutes, repeat once.
2. Hydrate slides through a graded alcohol series:
◦ 100% ethanol – 2 changes, 5 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol – 1 change, 5 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol – 1 change, 5 minutes
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
6.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heat in a pressure cooker or
microwave for 15-20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature, then rinse in distilled water followed by PBS
(phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 minutes.
6.4 Immunostaining Procedure
1. Blocking: Apply blocking reagent to slides and incubate for 10
minutes at room temperature.
2. Primary Antibody: Apply WT-1 primary antibody, covering the
tissue sections completely. Incubate in a humidity chamber for
30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
3. Washing: Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
4. Secondary Antibody: Apply HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
5. Washing: Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
6. DAB Development: Apply DAB substrate solution and monitor
the reaction under a microscope. Develop until appropriate
staining intensity is achieved (usually 2-10 minutes).
7. Washing: Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
6.5 Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in distilled water and differentiate in 0.1% acid alcohol for
a few seconds.
3. Rinse in distilled water and blue in 0.2% ammonia water.
4. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100% - 2
changes each, 5 minutes each).
5. Clear in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
6. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure inclusion of positive and negative control slides with each
staining batch.
• Verify staining quality and specificity on control sections before
proceeding to the analysis of test samples.
• Document all staining procedures and any deviations from the
protocol in the laboratory logbook.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Since this SOP pertains to the technical component only:
• Prepare slides and ensure they are intact for review by a qualified
pathologist.
• Ensure proper labeling and documentation of each slide.
• Maintain records of each staining run, including control results, to
enable traceability and assessment of staining quality.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inconsistent tissue processing can affect staining quality.
• Variations in antigen retrieval conditions can lead to under- or
over-staining.
• Proper fixation is critical to preserve antigenicity.
