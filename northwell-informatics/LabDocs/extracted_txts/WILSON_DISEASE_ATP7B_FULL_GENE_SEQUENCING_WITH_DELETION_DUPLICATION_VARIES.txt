STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF WILSON DISEASE, ATP7B FULL GENE SEQUENCING
WITH DELETION/DUPLICATION
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the process of performing ATP7B full
gene sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis for the
diagnosis of Wilson Disease. This genetic test is designed to
identify pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene, which are
implicated in Wilson Disease.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to molecular diagnostic testing of patient
samples for the ATP7B gene encompassing full gene
sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the molecular technologist to ensure all
steps of the procedure are followed and documented
appropriately. The supervisor must review and verify results and
ensure quality control measures are in place and followed.
4. DEFINITIONS
◦ Wilson Disease (WD): A genetic disorder caused by
mutations in the ATP7B gene leading to abnormal copper
metabolism.
◦ ATP7B gene: A gene responsible for regulating copper
transport within the liver.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ DNA extraction kits
◦ PCR thermocycler
◦ Capillary electrophoresis or next-generation sequencing
(NGS) equipment
◦ Analyzation software
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Reagents for PCR amplification and sequencing
◦ Primers specific for ATP7B gene
◦ Clean tube and pipette tips, gloves, lab coats, etc.
6. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
◦ Follow all institutional biosafety and chemical safety
guidelines.
◦ Ensure use of appropriate personal protective equipment
(PPE).
◦ Handle specimens as potentially infectious.
7. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/acceptability: 3-5 mL of whole blood collected in
EDTA (lavender-top) tubes.
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolysed samples, clotted samples, and
samples not labeled properly.
8. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Label tubes with the patient's details and laboratory
accession number.
2. Extract DNA following the protocol outlined in the DNA
extraction kit’s manual.
3. Quantify DNA concentration using spectrophotometry or
fluorometry.
4. Store DNA at -20°C until ready for use.
B. PCR Amplification and Sequencing
1. Design primers specifically targeting ATP7B exons and
flanking intronic regions.
2. Set up PCR reactions using the standard operating
procedure for PCR amplification:
▪ Template DNA (50-100 ng)
▪ Primers (250 nM each)
▪ dNTPs (200 µM each)
▪ Buffer with Mg2+ (as per kit instructions)
▪ Enzyme (according to manufacturer's instructions)
▪ Nuclease-free water to desired volume.
3. Amplify DNA using a thermocycler with the appropriate
cycling conditions.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) or Sanger
Sequencing
1. For NGS:
▪ Prepare sequencing library following the NGS library
preparation protocol.
▪ Quantify and normalize libraries.
▪ Load onto the sequencing platform and run according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. For Sanger sequencing:
▪ Purify PCR products.
▪ Prepare sequencing reactions for each fragment.
▪ Run capillary electrophoresis on sequencer.
D. Data Analysis
1. Analyze raw data using appropriate bioinformatic tools.
2. Identify variants and assess for pathogenicity using
databases such as ClinVar, HGMD, and literature
correlation.
3. Include deletion/duplication analysis using software
designed for copy number variant detection.
E. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review detected variants and classify according to ACMG
(American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics)
guidelines.
2. Prepare a detailed clinical report summarizing findings,
interpretation, and any recommendations.
3. Ensure the report is reviewed and signed off by a certified
molecular genetics specialist.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests.
◦ Perform routine proficiency testing according to CLIA
regulations.
◦ Document any deviations from protocols and corrective
actions taken.
10. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain records of all procedures, results, and quality
control data in the laboratory information management
system (LIMS).
◦ Document all communications and consultations related to
the test results.
