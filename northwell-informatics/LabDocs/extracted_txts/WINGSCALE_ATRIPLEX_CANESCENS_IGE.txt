Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase -
Generation of Results for WINGSCALE (ATRIPLEX CANESCENS)
IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized guidelines for the
analytical phase of generating results for WINGSCALE (ATRIPLEX
CANESCENS) IgE in the laboratory. This ensures accurate and
consistent testing, maximizes efficiency, and maintains high quality
control standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
and reporting of WINGSCALE (ATRIPLEX CANESCENS) IgE results.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis and
documenting the results. They must identify any analytical
discrepancies, address them, and inform the supervisor if necessary.
The supervisor is responsible for overseeing compliance with this
SOP, reviewing results, and ensuring corrective actions are taken
when needed.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
• ELISA plate
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units for reagents
• WINGSCALE (ATRIPLEX CANESCENS) IgE ELISA kit
• Calibrators and control samples
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
To perform WINGSCALE (ATRIPLEX CANESCENS) IgE testing,
patient specimens should be collected as follows:
• Preferred specimens are serum or plasma.
• Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48 hours
of collection. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or below.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens are
unacceptable.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Set up ELISA reader and software as per manufacturer
specifications.
Assay Protocol:
1. Add 100µL of patient serum, plasma sample, or control to each
well of the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Discard the contents of the wells and wash the plate 5 times
with the prepared wash buffer.
4. Add 100µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well. Incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Discard the contents of the wells and wash the plate 5 times
with the prepared wash buffer.
6. Add 100µL of the substrate solution to each well. Incubate at
room temperature for 15 minutes away from direct light.
7. Add 50µL of stop solution to each well.
8. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA reader.
Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicates.
2. Construct a standard curve using the known concentrations of
calibrators provided in the kit.
3. Determine patient IgE concentrations from the standard curve.
Quality Control:
1. Run controls with each assay batch to ensure it is within
acceptable limits.
2. Document all quality control activities in the QC log.
Data Documentation:
1. Record all relevant data: patient identification, date of analysis,
readings, calculations, and results.
2. Ensure results are reviewed by a technologist before being
entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS for review and
verification by the qualified technologist. Ensure patient results are
duly verified for accuracy and consistency before final reporting.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the WINGSCALE (ATRIPLEX CANESCENS) IgE ELISA kit
insert for specific reagent limitations and troubleshooting guidelines.

10. REVIEW SCHEDULE
This SOP must be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change
in the process, reagents, or equipment.
11. REVISION HISTORY
Document all SOP revisions with date, nature of changes, and the
supervisor’s initials.
