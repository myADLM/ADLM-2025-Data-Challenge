Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for WORMWOOD, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels
in response to Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) using an
immunoassay method.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay as described in this procedure and for ensuring all quality
control and calibration steps are performed.
• It is the responsibility of the staff to report any deviations from this
procedure to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Serum IgE: Immunoglobulin E is an antibody that is produced by the
immune system. Measuring specific IgE levels can help to diagnose
allergic responses to specific allergens, such as Wormwood.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Wormwood-specific IgE test kits (including reagents as per the
manufacturer’s protocol)
• Calibrators and controls provided with the test kits
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety glasses
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated according to the
manufacturer's instructions and is ready for use.
• Allow all reagents, including calibrators and controls, to reach
room temperature before use.
• Review and document the expiry dates of all reagents and kits.
4.2 Sample Preparation:
• Serum specimens should be fresh and properly processed. If
stored, serum should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48
hours, or frozen at -20°C if stored for longer periods.
• Label all samples, calibrators, and controls clearly according to
laboratory protocol.
4.3 Running the Assay:
• Load the serum samples, calibrators, and quality controls into the
appropriate sample racks or locations on the analyzer.
• Load the reagent cartridges into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Enter the essential patient information and test orders into the
system according to laboratory protocol.
• Initiate the assay run on the analyzer.
• Monitor the analyzer for any errors or alerts during the process.
4.4 Quality Control:
• Run a minimum of two levels (low and high) of quality control
materials with each batch of samples.
• Evaluate quality control results to ensure they are within
acceptable range before proceeding to patient results analysis.
• Document all quality control results as per laboratory protocol.
4.5 Reporting Results:
• Review the analyzer-generated data for any flags or errors.
• Post results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS), ensuring
that patient identifiers and results match.
• If any results fall outside of reference ranges or show analytical
warnings/error codes, perform necessary repeat testing or
validation steps according to troubleshooting guidelines.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Normal Reference Interval for Serum IgE: 0 - 100 IU/mL (may
vary slightly based on laboratory standards)
• Elevated IgE levels in response to Wormwood allergens indicate
sensitization and potential allergy.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If internal quality control materials fail to meet laboratory-
established criteria, do not report patient results until the issue is
resolved.
• Recalibrate the analyzer periodically according to manufacturer
instructions or when suggested by quality control data.
• Document all actions taken in a quality control logbook.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High lipemic, hemolytic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens in cases of poly-sensitization
may affect specificity.
