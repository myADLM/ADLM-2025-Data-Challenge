Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for X-Linked
Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for performing analytical phase
procedures for the full gene analysis of X-Linked
Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), ensuring accurate and reproducible
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
molecular diagnostics and is used for analyzing patient samples for
the full gene sequence of ABCD1 gene associated with X-ALD.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated staff involved in the analytical phase must adhere to
this SOP to ensure the quality and reliability of the test results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and providing
necessary training for new staff.

7. PROCEDURES
A. Specimen Preparation and DNA Extraction 1. Verify the
specimen type and integrity upon receipt. 2. Extract DNA using a
suitable kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. 3. Quantify and
assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer
(e.g., NanoDrop).
B. PCR Amplification 1. Design primers specific to the ABCD1 gene
covering all exons and relevant intronic regions. 2. Prepare the PCR
reaction mixture as follows: - DNA template: 50 ng - Forward Primer:
0.2 µM - Reverse Primer: 0.2 µM - dNTPs: 0.2 mM each - Taq
Polymerase: as per the manufacturer’s recommendation - Buffer: as
per the manufacturer’s recommendation - Laboratory-grade water to
final volume (50 µL) 3. Run PCR cycles: Initial denaturation at 95°C
for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30
seconds, 72°C for 1 minute, and a final extension at 72°C for 5
minutes.
C. PCR Product Purification 1. Purify PCR products using a PCR
purification kit or bead-based method. 2. Quantify and assess the
quality of the purified PCR product.
D. Sanger Sequencing or NGS 1. For Sanger Sequencing: - Set up
sequencing reactions using the purified PCR products and
appropriate sequencing primers. - Analyze sequencing reactions
using capillary electrophoresis. 2. For NGS: - Prepare sequencing
libraries following the NGS platform-specific protocol. - Perform
sequencing on the selected NGS platform. - Analyze sequence data
using bioinformatics tools to align sequences and identify variants.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation 1. Review sequence data for
quality using appropriate software. 2. Compare the obtained
sequences against reference sequences to identify any variants. 3.
Classify identified variants according to standard guidelines (e.g.,
ACMG guidelines). 4. Document findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of PCR
reactions.
• Use known standard DNA sequences for instrument calibration.
• Run NIST-traceable standards for each sequencing batch.
• Review QC results and maintain documentation in the QC log.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and validate the sequence data.
• Generate comprehensive reports for each patient.
• Ensure all findings are reviewed and signed off by a qualified
laboratory director or equivalent.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction kits and PCR
reagents
• Relevant peer-reviewed publications on X-ALD sequencing
• ACMG guidelines for variant interpretation
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all logs, raw data, and QC records for a minimum of 2
years.
• Ensure all steps are documented accurately in the LIS for
traceability.
12. SAFETY
• Follow all institutional biosafety guidelines.
• Use appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) at all times.
• Handle genetic material and chemicals in accordance with safety
protocols.
This SOP aims to provide a clear, detailed guideline for the analytical
phase in generating results for X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy full
gene analysis, ensuring accurate, reliable, and high-quality
outcomes.
