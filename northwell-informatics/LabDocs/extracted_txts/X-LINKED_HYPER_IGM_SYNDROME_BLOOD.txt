Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for X-Linked Hyper IgM Syndrome, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for X-Linked Hyper IgM Syndrome (XHIGM) testing in blood
specimens. This includes steps for preparing specimens, performing
the assay, and interpreting the results to ensure accurate diagnosis
and management of XHIGM.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of XHIGM testing using blood specimens. It is designed to
ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Technologists and laboratory staff are responsible for following
this SOP accurately and performing the assay as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
competent in the procedure.
• Laboratory management is responsible for providing necessary
resources and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
• X-Linked Hyper IgM Syndrome (XHIGM): A rare
immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA), and
elevated levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer
• Blood Collection Tubes (EDTA or heparinized)
• Lysis Buffer
• Wash Buffer
• Antibodies specific for CD27, CD40 Ligand (CD154), and IgM
• Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer
• Appropriate Isotype Controls
• Sample Preparation Tubes
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred specimen type: Whole blood collected in EDTA or
heparinized tubes.
• Specimen stability: Blood specimens should be processed within
24 hours of collection. If immediate processing is not possible,
specimens may be stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours before
analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1. Specimen Preparation
1. Verify patient identity and specimen information.
2. Gently mix the blood specimen by inverting the collection tube
several times.
3. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into each sample preparation
tube.
7.2. Staining Procedure
1. Add 5 µL of antibody specific for CD27 to the respective tube.
2. Add 5 µL of antibody specific for CD40 Ligand (CD154) to the
respective tube.
3. Add 5 µL of antibody specific for IgM to the respective tube.
4. Add appropriate isotype controls to a separate tube.
5. Incubate the tubes in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes.
7.3. Lysis and Washing
1. Add 2 mL of lysis buffer to each tube to lyse red blood cells.
2. Incubate the tubes in the dark at room temperature for 10
minutes.
3. Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
4. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell
pellet.
5. Add 1 mL of wash buffer to each tube and resuspend the cell
pellet by gentle vortexing.
6. Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
7. Repeat wash step twice.
7.4. Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Resuspend the final cell pellet in 500 µL of flow cytometry
staining buffer.
2. Load the samples onto the flow cytometer.
3. Acquire at least 10,000 events per sample.
4. Analyze data using appropriate flow cytometry software,
focusing on the expression of CD27, CD40 Ligand, and IgM on
B lymphocytes.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
6. Evaluate the expression patterns of CD27, CD40 Ligand, and
IgM.
7. Compare patient results with reference ranges and control
samples.
8. Positive diagnosis of XHIGM typically shows elevated IgM
levels with abnormally low or absent CD27 and CD40 Ligand
on B cells.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Perform daily instrument calibration using standardized beads.
11. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay accuracy.
12. Review and document QC results before releasing patient data.
13. Follow established protocols for troubleshooting any QC
failures.
14. REPORTING RESULTS
15. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
16. Include detailed interpretation based on flow cytometry
analysis.
17. Notify the ordering physician of any critical or unusual findings
promptly.
18. REFERENCES
19. Flow Cytometry Standards and Guidelines.

21. Manufacturer’s Instructions for Flow Cytometry Antibodies and
Reagents.
22. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
23. Maintain records of specimen receipt, handling, and analysis.
24. Document quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
25. Retain flow cytometry data and analysis reports for future
reference and verification.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the reliability and
accuracy of XHIGM testing, contributing to the effective diagnosis
and management of patients with X-Linked Hyper IgM Syndrome.
