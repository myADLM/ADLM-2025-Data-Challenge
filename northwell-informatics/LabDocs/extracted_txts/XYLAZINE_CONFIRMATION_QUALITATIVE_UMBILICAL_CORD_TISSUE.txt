Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for XYLAZINE
CONFIRMATION (QUALITATIVE), UMBILICAL CORD, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the qualitative confirmation of xylazine in umbilical cord tissue
samples. This test is performed to confirm the presence of xylazine
using appropriate analytical methods.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained in toxicology
analysis to perform this procedure and ensure accurate and reliable
results. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the adherence to
this SOP and investigating any issues that arise during the analytical
process.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5-10 cm segment of umbilical cord tissue collected at birth.
• The specimen should be free from any preservatives or fixatives.
• The specimen should be stored and transported in a clean,
appropriately labeled container.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens contaminated with substances that may interfere with
the analysis.
• Specimens not accompanied by complete and accurate
documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Homogenizer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Solvents: methanol, acetonitrile, and water (HPLC grade)
• Calibrators and controls
• Laboratory-grade glassware
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENT PREPARATION
Prepare all solvents and reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and laboratory protocols. Use only HPLC-grade solvents
for the preparation of mobile phases.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Homogenize the umbilical cord tissue sample: a. Using a
homogenizer, thoroughly homogenize approximately 1.0 g of
umbilical cord tissue in a clean container. b. Add an appropriate
volume of water to facilitate homogenization.
2. Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE): a. Condition the SPE
cartridge with methanol followed by water. b. Load the
homogenized tissue sample onto the SPE cartridge. c. Wash
the cartridge with water followed by methanol. d. Elute the
xylazine from the SPE cartridge using a mixture of methanol
and acetonitrile.
3. Evaporate the eluent to dryness under a gentle stream of
nitrogen.
4. Reconstitute the residue in an appropriate volume of mobile
phase or solvent.
B. Instrumentation and Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibrate the HPLC-MS/MS system using xylazine calibrators.
3. Analyze the reconstituted sample along with appropriate
controls and calibrators.
4. Perform a run sequence that includes blank samples,
calibrators, quality controls, and test samples.
5. Record retention times, ion transitions, and peak areas.
C. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Verify the presence of xylazine in the test samples by
comparing the retention time and ion transitions with those of
the calibrators and controls.
2. Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable limits.
3. Qualitatively confirm the presence or absence of xylazine in the
umbilical cord tissue samples based on the MS/MS data.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Report the presence or absence of xylazine in the umbilical cord
tissue samples as a qualitative result. Include any relevant findings or
observations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Include quality control samples in each analytical run to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of the test results.
3. Document all quality control data and investigate any deviations
from acceptable limits.
4. Follow laboratory protocols for corrective actions if quality
control results are outside the established limits.
5. REFERENCES
Refer to the latest literature, laboratory guidelines, and
manufacturer’s instructions for detailed information on the reagents,
equipment, and procedures used in xylazine confirmation.
End of SOP.
This Standard Operating Procedure should be reviewed periodically
and updated as necessary to ensure compliance with current
standards and laboratory practices.
