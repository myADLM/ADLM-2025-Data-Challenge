Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
YELLOW FACED HORNET VENOM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of results for
Yellow Faced Hornet Venom immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody in
serum. This protocol ensures the accuracy and precision of the
analytical phase to provide reliable patient results.
2. POLICY
All laboratory personnel must adhere to established guidelines and
perform the procedures according to this SOP to maintain CLIA
compliance. This includes proper documentation and execution of
corrective actions when necessary.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
procedures outlined in this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for overseeing the adherence to the SOP and ensuring
corrective measures are implemented as needed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Volume Required:
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Ideal volume: 2 mL
Handling and Storage:
• Specimens must be collected in a red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• After collection, allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed for
30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1200-1500 g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum to a labeled, appropriate secondary container.
• Store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours if the test is not performed
immediately. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated and/or ultra-low freezer
• Automated Immunoanalyzer suitable for IgE testing (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP System)
Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific for Yellow Faced Hornet Venom
IgE, included with the immunoassay kit
• ImmunoCAP Yellow Faced Hornet Venom IgE assay kit
• Quality control materials at two different concentration levels
Supplies:
• Serum separating or red-top tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Labeled secondary containers for aliquots
• Temperature logs for refrigerators and freezers
6. PROCEDURE
Calibrator and Control Preparation:
1. Prepare calibrators and controls according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Calibrators and controls should be treated and processed in the
same way as patient samples.
Assay Procedure:
1. Ensure the immunoanalyzer is properly calibrated and perform
maintenance if necessary.
2. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature or refrigerate
until liquid.
3. Mix samples thoroughly before processing.
4. Load the patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
the designated positions in the sample rack.
5. Follow the immunoanalyzer manufacturer's guidelines to
process the Yellow Faced Hornet Venom IgE assay.
6. Ensure that the instrument settings, including incubation times
and temperatures, are accurate as per the kit instructions.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples alongside patient samples in each
assay batch.
• Acceptable ranges for the controls should be established and
documented. Compare control results against these ranges.
• Validate the assay run only if the controls meet the acceptable
criteria.
Result Generation and Verification:
1. The analyzer generates results automatically based on the
calibration curve.
2. Review all patient results, control values, and instrument
validation data.
3. If any results fall outside established control limits, investigate
and re-run the affected samples as necessary before reporting.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Range: Negative: < 0.35 kUA/L Equivocal: 0.35 – 0.70
kUA/L Positive: > 0.70 kUA/L
Discuss results with the supervising clinician or pathologist as
necessary, especially for cases that require further clinical correlation.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed, verified, and approved by the
technologist.
3. Results flagged as critical or significantly high must be
communicated to the ordering physician according to laboratory
protocols.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Quality Control:
• Implement daily, weekly, and monthly QC checks as per
laboratory SOPs.
• Record all temperatures and instrument maintenance activities.
Troubleshooting:
• Instrument errors or outliers: Follow the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide.
• Repeat the assay if QC results are unsatisfactory.
