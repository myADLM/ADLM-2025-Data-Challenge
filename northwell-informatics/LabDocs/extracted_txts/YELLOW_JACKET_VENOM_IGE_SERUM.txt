Standard Operating Procedure for YELLOW JACKET VENOM,
IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of Yellow Jacket Venom, IgE in serum to ensure accurate and
consistent results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures outlined in this document and adhere to all safety and
quality assurance measures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
competent in performing the test and for addressing any issues
that may arise during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect venous blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, properly labeled tube.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum required volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
Storage:
• Specimens must be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not immediately
analyzed.
• If testing will be delayed more than 48 hours, freeze the serum at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Serum specimens that have undergone more than two freeze-
thaw cycles.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than those specified.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer or ELISA Plate Reader
• Yellow Jacket Venom, IgE assay kits (as per manufacturer’s
recommendations)
• Calibrators and controls supplied with the assay kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Laboratory grade deionized water
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run calibrators and quality control samples with each batch of
patient tests.
• Include at least one positive and one negative control.
• Verify that control results fall within the manufacturer’s specified
range before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• Document all quality control findings and any corrective actions
taken.
1. PROCEDURE
Initial Preparation:
1. Preparation of Reagents: Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for the preparation of all reagents, calibrators,
controls, and patient samples. Bring reagents to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Analyzer Setup: Turn on the analyzer and perform any
required maintenance or calibration procedures as outlined by
the manufacturer. Ensure that sufficient reagents and
consumables are available for the entire run.
Sample Analysis:
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Label each sample tube with a unique identifier.
◦ Vortex each serum sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
2. Pipetting:
◦ Transfer the appropriate volume of serum sample,
calibrators, and controls to the designated positions in the
assay plate or analyzer cups as per the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Ensure all pipetting is accurate and avoid air bubbles.
3. Incubation:
◦ Follow the incubation times and conditions precisely as
described in the assay kit insert.
4. Reading Results:
◦ After the final incubation step, measure the absorbance or
fluorescence of each well/sample using the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that the analyzer is set to the correct wavelength
and read mode.
5. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Utilize the software associated with the analyzer or follow the
manual instructions to calculate IgE concentrations.
• Compare patient results to the reference range provided in the
assay kit instructions.
• Results should be expressed in IU/mL (International Units per
milliliter).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results against the quality control data.
• Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Flag any results that fall outside the established reference range
for review.
• Any discrepancies or anomalous results should be re-evaluated
before reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals and cutoff values should be taken from the
assay kit manufacturer's insert or validated per the laboratory’s
established procedures.
• Generally, the absence of sensitization is indicated by IgE levels
below the cutoff specified in the kit instructions.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Certain medications, medical treatments, or other patient-specific
factors can interfere with IgE measurements and cause false
results. Always consult the assay kit limitations section.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or improper handling can also affect the
results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product insert provided with the Yellow Jacket
Venom, IgE assay kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on IgE testing and
interpretation.
1. REVISIONS
• This SOP shall be reviewed annually and revised as needed to
remain current with best practices and technological
advancements in the field.
This protocol ensures the accurate and reliable analysis of Yellow
Jacket Venom, IgE in serum, conforming to the highest standards of
laboratory practice.
