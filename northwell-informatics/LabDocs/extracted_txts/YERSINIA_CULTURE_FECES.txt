YERSINIA CULTURE, FECES - Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
1. PURPOSE:
To isolate, identify and report Yersinia species in fecal
specimens efficiently and accurately.
2. SCOPE:
This protocol applies to the analysis of fecal specimens for the
isolation and identification of Yersinia species in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
follow this procedure accurately. Laboratory staff must ensure
that all steps are completed, results documented, and any
discrepancies reported to a supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN:
a. Preferred/acceptable: - Freshly collected fecal specimen,
ideally within 1 hour of collection. - Specimen preserved in
Cary-Blair transport medium if there is a delay in transportation
(stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C).
b. Unacceptable: - Dry specimens. - Specimens received in
media other than Cary-Blair if not processed within 1 hour of
collection. - Specimens with visible contamination or
inappropriate transport conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
a. Equipment: - Bunsen burner or alternative flame source. -
Incubator (set to 25-30°C). - Colony counter. - Calibrated loop
(1 µL or 10 µL). - Analytical balance, if necessary.
b. Reagents: - Yersinia Selective Agar (CIN Agar). - Tryptic Soy
or equivalent non-selective agar. - Normal Saline or Phosphate
Buffered Saline (PBS).
6. PROCEDURE:
a. Inoculation: - Using a sterile swab or calibrated loop,
inoculate the fecal specimen onto Yersinia Selective Agar (CIN
Agar). - Streak the specimen in a manner to obtain well-isolated
colonies. - Optional: Inoculate an additional non-selective
medium for comparative growth analysis.
b. Incubation: - Incubate plates at 25-30°C for 24-48 hours. -
Ensure plates are placed in an inverted position to prevent
condensation from disrupting colonies.
c. Examination: - Examine plates after 24 hours and again at
48 hours. - Look for characteristic deep red-centered colonies
with a clear edge (bull's eye appearance) on CIN Agar.
d. Isolation and Identification: - Subculture suspect colonies
onto Tryptic Soy Agar or equivalent for further identification. -
Use biochemical tests (e.g., urease test, oxidase test) or
automated systems (e.g., VITEK, MALDI-TOF) for definitive
identification. - Confirm identification with serotyping if
necessary.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
a. Positive and negative controls should be run with each batch
of specimens. - Positive control: Yersinia enterocolitica control
strain. - Negative control: Known non-Yersinia strain. b. Ensure
that control results are documented and verify that control
organisms produce expected reactions before reporting patient
results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
a. Negative Result: - "Yersinia species not isolated". - Ensure all
steps were verified and examined for clarity before finalizing the
report.
b. Positive Result: - "Yersinia species isolated". - Report
identifications to the species level when possible and provide
antibiotic susceptibility profiles if applicable. - Notify infection
prevention and control departments immediately.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Not applicable.
10. LIMITATIONS:
◦ Other organisms may produce similar colony morphology;
proper biochemical or molecular identification is essential.
◦ Faecal specimens are complex; overgrowth of competing
microflora can inhibit Yersinia detection.
11. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
◦ Follow biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) guidelines.
◦ Handle all specimens and cultures as potentially infectious.
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
12. REFERENCE:
◦ Yersinia Selective CIN Agar package insert.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
This completes the SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for Yersinia culture from feces.
