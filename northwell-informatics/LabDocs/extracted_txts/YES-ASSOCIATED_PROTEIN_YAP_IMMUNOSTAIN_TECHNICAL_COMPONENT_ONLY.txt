Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) For YES-ASSOCIATED
PROTEIN (YAP) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
YES-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (YAP) immunostaining in the
laboratory, ensuring consistent and accurate technical results.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
YAP immunostaining according to this procedure.
It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
immunostaining process which may affect the laboratory test results
and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that immunostaining is
performed consistent with this SOP, including any necessary
corrective actions.
1. DEFINITION
YES-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (YAP) is a crucial regulator of cell
growth, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Immunostaining for YAP
allows visualization of its presence and localization within tissue
samples.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling: - Ensure that specimen has been received and
accessioned according to laboratory protocols. - Confirm
identification of the specimen using the specimen accession number.
Reagents and Supplies: - Primary Antibody: Anti-YAP primary
antibody. - Secondary Antibody: Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
conjugated secondary antibody. - Blocking Solution: 5% Bovine
Serum Albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). -
Chromogen: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) solution. - Counterstain:
Hematoxylin. - Mounting Medium. - Microscope slides, cover slips. -
Antigen retrieval buffer. - Wash Buffer: PBS or Tris-buffered saline
(TBS). - Adhesive slide labels.
Equipment: - Microtome. - Automated or manual staining system. -
Microscope. - Incubator at 37°C. - Humidity chamber. - Water bath or
steamer (for antigen retrieval).
Procedure:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens into
3-5 micrometer sections using a microtome.
◦ Place sections onto microscope slides and allow to dry at
room temperature or in an incubator at 37°C.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Heat slides at 60°C for 1 hour.
◦ Immerse slides in the following solutions: a) Xylene (2x5
minutes) b) 100% ethanol (2x5 minutes) c) 95% ethanol (5
minutes) d) 70% ethanol (5 minutes) e) Distilled water (2x3
minutes)
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Submerge slides in preheated antigen retrieval buffer within
a water bath or steamer.
◦ Heat at 95-99°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes in the buffer.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS (2x5 minutes).
4. Blocking:
◦ Incubate sections with blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS)
for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with the primary antibody diluted in PBS or
TBS (according to manufacturer’s instructions).
◦ Cover sections with antibody solution and incubate in a
humidity chamber for 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C.
6. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides with PBS or TBS (3x5 minutes).
7. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with the HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides with PBS or TBS (3x5 minutes).
8. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB solution to the sections and monitor staining
development under a microscope.
◦ Once desired staining intensity is achieved, stop the
reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
9. Counterstaining:
◦ Dip slides in hematoxylin for counterstaining (1-2 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water (until clear).
◦ Perform differentiating in 0.3% acid alcohol (1 second) and
rinse in tap water.
◦ Blue slides in 0.1% lithium carbonate (5 seconds) and rinse
in tap water.
10. Mounting:
◦ Mount stained sections with mounting medium and cover
slips. Allow them to dry.
Quality Control: - Include positive and negative controls in each
immunostaining run. - Record the batch number and expiration date
for antibodies and reagents used. - Verify staining efficiency and
specificity under a microscope prior to releasing results.
Reporting Results: - Technical component results should be
documented as "YAP immunostaining performed." - Any technical
issues should be documented and reported to the supervisor.
References: - Manufacturer's instructions for Anti-YAP primary
antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. - Laboratory
staining protocol inserts. - Journal articles and Standard Literature for
YAP immunostaining guidelines.
Review and Verification: Results are to be reviewed and verified by
the designated technologist(s) before submission to pathologists for
diagnostic interpretation.
