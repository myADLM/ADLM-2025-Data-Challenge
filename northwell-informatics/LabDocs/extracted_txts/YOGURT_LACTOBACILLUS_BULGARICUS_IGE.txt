Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Yogurt (Lactobacillus bulgaricus) IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed, standardized
procedure for the quantitative measurement of Yogurt (Lactobacillus
bulgaricus) IgE in human serum or plasma using an immunoassay
method. This protocol ensures the accuracy, precision, and reliability
of test results as part of routine laboratory operations.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists and other designated personnel are
responsible for performing Yogurt (Lactobacillus bulgaricus) IgE
assays according to this procedure. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that the SOP is followed and that quality control (QC)
measures are in place.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
1. Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Automated ELISA Reader)
2. Centrifuge
3. Micropipettes and tips (10 µL to 1000 µL)
4. Incubator set at 37°C
5. Plate washer (for ELISA)
6. Refrigerator (2-8°C)
7. Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Reagents and Supplies:
1. Yogurt (Lactobacillus bulgaricus) IgE Test Kit
▪ Coated microtiter plates
▪ Enzyme conjugate
▪ Substrate solution
▪ Stop solution
▪ Calibrators and controls
2. Quality Control samples (negative and positive for Yogurt
(Lactobacillus bulgaricus) IgE)
3. Wash buffer
4. Distilled or deionized water
Storage:
• Store the Yogurt (Lactobacillus bulgaricus) IgE Test Kit and QC
samples according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at
2-8°C.
• Store serum/plasma specimens at -20°C or lower if not processed
immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Fresh serum or plasma collected in serum separator
tubes (SST) or EDTA vacutainer tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
Specimens that have not been properly labeled or transported at
appropriate temperatures.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thawing Specimens:
◦ Thaw frozen serum/plasma specimens at room temperature.
Gently mix by inverting the tube several times. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and microtiter plates as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Pipetting Calibrators, Controls and Specimens:
◦ Pipette an appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
serum/plasma specimens into designated wells.
3. Addition of Enzyme Conjugate:
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate into each well as directed by the
test kit instructions.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time as per the
manufacturer's protocol.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using the plate washer with the
recommended number of wash cycles.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark at room temperature for the specified time.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well, ensuring thorough
mixing.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well using an immunoassay
analyzer at the specified wavelength (usually 450 nm).
C. Quality Control:
1. Include QC samples with each batch of tests:
◦ Ensure that QC sample results are within the acceptable
ranges. If they are not, the run must be invalidated, and
corrective action taken.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the concentration of Yogurt (Lactobacillus bulgaricus)
IgE in each sample using the calibration curve.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for interpreting the IgE
levels.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Ensure all results meet quality control standards before reporting.
• Critical results must be notified to the clinician immediately, and
documentation of the communication must be recorded.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Review QC results and validate the assay according to the
laboratory's quality control policy.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures, and document all
corrective actions.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instruction Manual for the Yogurt (Lactobacillus
bulgaricus) IgE Test Kit.
• Relevant laboratory quality control procedures and regulatory
guidelines.
9. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Keep all work areas clean and follow biosafety guidelines.
• Ensure all personnel receive appropriate training on this SOP.
This protocol should remain current and be reviewed periodically,
with amendments made as necessary to comply with updated
guidelines and practices.
