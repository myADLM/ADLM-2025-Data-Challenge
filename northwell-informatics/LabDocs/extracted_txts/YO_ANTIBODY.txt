Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of YO
Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for YO antibody testing in the laboratory, ensuring accuracy,
consistency, and compliance with regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all technologists performing YO antibody testing
in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the YO
antibody test as per the procedure outlined. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that the testing is conducted accurately, and
results are reviewed and verified.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma (collected in a red-top or serum-separator tube
(SST) or lavender-top (EDTA) tube).
• 4-6 mL of blood collected by venipuncture.
• Specimens should be processed and analyzed within 2 hours of
collection. If storage is required, samples should be refrigerated at
2-8°C and tested within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
• Incompletely filled tubes.
• Specimens with a delay in processing beyond acceptable limits.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• YO Antibody Test Kit (as per manufacturer’s instructions).
• Microcentrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips (calibrated).
• Automated immunoassay analyzer.
• Incubator.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and Freezer (-20°C).
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Refrigerated Specimens: Allow specimen to reach room
temperature before processing.
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to separate serum/plasma.
B. Test Setup:
1. Prepare reagents and calibrators as per the YO Antibody Test
Kit insert.
2. Label each sample, calibrator, and control clearly.
3. Prepare sufficient number of wells/strips in the test plate for all
samples, calibrators, and controls.
C. Analytical Steps:
1. Pipetting: Add appropriate volume (as per kit instructions) of
calibrators, controls, and patient samples into the designated
wells/strips.
◦ Use a clean pipette tip for each addition.
2. Incubation: Incubate the plate at the temperature specified by
the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Wash Steps: Follow the wash procedure as outlined in the kit
insert to ensure all unbound components are removed.
4. Detection: Add the detection antibody/enzyme conjugate and
incubate as required.
5. Substrate Addition: Add the substrate reagent and incubate until
color develops.
D. Measurement:
1. Read absorbance or fluorescence using an appropriate plate
reader as specified in the test kit.
2. Record the absorbance readings for each well.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples.
2. Ensure control results fall within the established acceptable
range.
3. If control results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the kit instructions and do not release patient
results until the issue is resolved.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Calculate YO antibody concentration in patient samples using
the standard curve generated from calibrators.
2. Review the calculated results for consistency and accuracy.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify accuracy before releasing results to electronic health
record (EHR).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the YO Antibody Test Kit insert for specific limitations
related to cross-reactivity and sensitivity.
• Be aware of potential false positives/negatives due to interfering
substances.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results or QC failures occur, review the procedural
steps for deviations.
• Consult the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
• Repeat the test if necessary, and document any corrective actions
taken.
