Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Y Chromosome
Microdeletions, Molecular Detection
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
detection of Y chromosome microdeletions using molecular
techniques. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable results,
adhering to quality standards to support diagnostic decisions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing Y
chromosome microdeletions detection to follow this SOP
strictly. The laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance and addressing any issues that may arise during
the process.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the molecular analysis of genomic
DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes to detect
microdeletions in the azoospermia factor (AZF) region of the Y
chromosome.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
◦ Minimum volume: 3 mL.
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Clotted blood samples.
◦ Specimens collected in inappropriate containers.
◦ Specimens with significant hemolysis or without proper
labeling.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
◦ PCR thermal cycler.
◦ Microcentrifuge.
◦ Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
◦ Gel electrophoresis system.
◦ Transilluminator.
Reagents:
◦ Genomic DNA extraction kit.
◦ PCR master mix.
◦ Y chromosome-specific primers.
◦ DNA ladder.
◦ Ethidium bromide or alternative gel stain.
◦ Loading dye.
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from peripheral blood using an
appropriate DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Measure DNA concentration and purity using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer. Ensure the DNA has an A260/A280
ratio of 1.8-2.0.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Set up the PCR reactions using specific primers for the
AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions of the Y chromosome.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows:
▪ Component: Template DNA.
▪ Component: Primer mix (forward and reverse).
▪ Component: PCR master mix (includes Taq
polymerase, dNTPs, and buffer).
▪ Component: Nuclease-free water.
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates, and add
the template DNA.
4. Load the PCR tubes/plate into the thermal cycler and
program the thermal cycler with the appropriate cycling
conditions (denaturation, annealing, and extension steps).
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or an
alternative stain.
2. Load DNA ladder and PCR products into the gel wells.
3. Run the gel at 100V for 1 hour or until adequate
separation is achieved.
4. View and photograph the gel using a transilluminator.
D. Result Interpretation:
1. Compare the bands corresponding to the PCR products
with the DNA ladder to determine the presence or
absence of the amplified regions.
2. Presence of bands in the AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions
indicates no microdeletions in those regions.
3. Absence of bands in any of these regions indicates the
presence of a microdeletion.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
◦ Verify the integrity of the DNA by electrophoresis prior to
PCR.
◦ Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the PCR
thermal cycler and other equipment.
◦ Document all findings, including any issues encountered
during the procedure, in a laboratory log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report the results indicating the presence or absence of
microdeletions in the AZF regions.
◦ Include an interpretative comment for the clinical
significance of the findings.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Positive control: Specific bands at the expected sizes for the
AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions.
◦ Negative control: No bands or bands corresponding to non-
specific amplification.
