Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ZBTB46 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standard protocol for the
technical component of ZBTB46 immunostaining in tissue samples.
This procedure is intended to ensure accuracy, reproducibility, and
reliability of staining results.
2. Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform the ZBTB46
immunostain, document procedures, and notify supervisors if issues
arise. Staff are responsible for adhering to the guidelines and
ensuring quality control throughout the process.
3. Specimen Requirements:
Acceptable Specimens:
• Freshly obtained tissue samples
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly fixed
• Specimens showing significant signs of degradation
• Specimens that lack proper labeling
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microtome
• Water bath (set to 40–45°C)
• Positive control FFPE tissue block
• Negative control FFPE tissue block
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Primary antibody against ZBTB46
• Secondary antibody (usually enzyme-conjugated, e.g., HRP-
conjugated)
• DAB substrate solution
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Hematoxylin (for counterstaining)
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining system
5. Procedure:
5.1 Sectioning:
1. Cut 4–5 micron-thick sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks using a microtome.
2. Place sections onto positively charged microscope slides.
3. Place slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour to ensure proper
adherence of tissue sections.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 3 changes, 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of ethanol concentrations:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 changes, 2 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 change, 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol, 1 change, 2 minutes
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer,
pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker, microwave, or water bath.
2. Heat for 20 minutes at 95-100°C.
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in PBS.
5.4 Immunostaining:
1. Use a hydrophobic barrier pen to encircle sections on the
slides.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4. Apply primary ZBTB46 antibody to each slide and incubate in a
humidified chamber at room temperature for 1 hour.
5. Rinse slides in PBS.
6. Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to
manufacturer’s instructions (usually 30 minutes at room
temperature).
7. Rinse slides in PBS.
8. Apply DAB substrate solution and develop a color reaction
(usually 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.5 Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse in distilled water and place in 0.3% acid alcohol for
differentiation if needed.
3. Rinse in distilled water again, followed by rinsing in PBS.
4. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
100%).
5. Clear in xylene.
6. Mount with mounting medium and coverslip.
6. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient slides to ensure staining consistency and specificity.
2. Record and review any deviations from protocols and results of
quality control slides.
3. If quality control fails, review protocol, reagents, and equipment
function, and repeat staining if necessary.
7. Reporting Results:
1. The technical component of ZBTB46 immunostains involves
producing technically accurate, high-quality stained slides ready
for interpretation by a qualified pathologist.
2. Ensure that the pathologist or designated personnel reviews
and documents the stained slides pathology report.
8. References:
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for primary and secondary antibodies.
• Laboratory’s internal quality control policies.
• Standard texts and journals on immunohistochemistry techniques.
9. Documentation:
1. Record all details of the staining procedure, including
antibodies, lot numbers, and dates of expiry.
2. Maintain and regularly update logs for equipment maintenance.
3. Document any deviations from the standard protocol and
corrective actions taken.
The above protocol is designed to ensure reproducibility and quality
of the ZBTB46 immunostaining in the laboratory, ensuring reliable
results for technical evaluation.
