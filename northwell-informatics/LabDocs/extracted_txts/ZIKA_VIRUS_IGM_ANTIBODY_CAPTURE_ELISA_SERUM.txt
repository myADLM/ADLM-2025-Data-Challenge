Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Zika Virus, IgM Antibody Capture ELISA,
Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
required to perform the analytical phase for the detection of
Zika Virus IgM antibodies in serum using the IgM Antibody
Capture ELISA method. This test is performed to aid in the
diagnosis of acute Zika virus infection.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for performing Zika Virus IgM Antibody Capture
ELISA testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the test and ensuring the accuracy
and reliability of the results. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for the overall quality assurance and compliance
with this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS • Specimen Type: Serum •
Volume: Minimum of 1 mL • Collection: Blood should be
collected in a serum separator tube (SST) and allowed to clot at
room temperature (20-25°C) before centrifugation.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. • Samples collected in other tube types (e.g., EDTA,
heparinized tubes). • Specimens stored at room temperature for
more than 8 hours before centrifugation.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS • Zika Virus IgM Antibody
Capture ELISA Kit (commercially available) • Microplate reader
compatible with the ELISA kit (capable of reading absorbance
at the specified wavelength) • Precision pipettes and tips
(range: 10 µL to 1000 µL) • Multichannel pipette (optional) •
Vortex mixer • Incubator (37°C) • Deionized or distilled water •
Laboratory timer
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES • Zika Virus IgM Antibody Capture
ELISA Kit, including:
◦ Microplate strips pre-coated with anti-human IgM
◦ Zika Virus antigen-conjugated detection antibody
◦ Wash buffer concentrate
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Positive and negative controls
7. PROCEDURE A) Preparation: • Bring all reagents and
specimen to room temperature (20-25°C) prior to use. • Prepare
the wash buffer according to the kit instructions. • Ensure all
equipment is properly calibrated and functioning.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Preparation: • Secure the required number of microplate
strips in the frame. • Add 100 µL of sample diluent to each well.
2. Specimen and Control Addition: • Add 10 µL of each serum
sample, positive control, and negative control to designated
wells. • Gently mix by tapping the plate or using a vortex mixer.
• Cover the plate with adhesive film.
3. Incubation: • Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing: • Wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of diluted wash
buffer per well, using an automated plate washer or manually
with a multichannel pipette. • Tap the plate on absorbent paper
to remove residual wash buffer.
5. Detection Antibody Addition: • Add 100 µL of Zika Virus antigen-
conjugated detection antibody to each well. • Cover the plate
and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
6. Washing: • Wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of diluted wash
buffer per well. • Tap the plate on absorbent paper.
7. Substrate Addition: • Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each
well. • Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes in the dark.
8. Stop Solution: • Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
9. Reading Results: • Read the absorbance of each well at the
specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm) using a microplate reader.
10. QUALITY CONTROL • Include positive and negative controls in
each run. • Ensure that control results fall within the established
range before interpreting patient results. • Repeat the assay if
controls do not perform as expected.
11. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS • Calculate the mean
absorbance of the negative control wells and add the kit-
specific cutoff factor to determine the cutoff value. • A sample is
considered positive for Zika Virus IgM if its absorbance is
greater than the cutoff value. • A sample is considered negative
if its absorbance is equal to or less than the cutoff value.
12. REPORTING RESULTS • Report results according to the
laboratory’s established guidelines. Include interpretations and
any relevant comments. • Document and review all results,
controls, and any necessary calculations.
13. LIMITATIONS • Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for
limitations specific to the reagents used. • Results should be
interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and other
diagnostic tests. • False-positive or false-negative results may
occur due to technical errors, interfering substances, or cross-
reactivity.
14. REFERENCES • Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use of the Zika
Virus IgM Antibody Capture ELISA Kit. • CLIA guidelines and
laboratory protocol for accuracy and precision in serological
testing.
15. DOCUMENTATION • Document each assay run in the
laboratory information management system (LIMS) or
appropriate logbook. • Retain records of controls and results for
quality assurance and regulatory compliance.
