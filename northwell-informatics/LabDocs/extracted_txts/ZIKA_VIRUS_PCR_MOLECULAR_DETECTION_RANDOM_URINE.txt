Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ZIKA VIRUS, PCR,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
molecular detection of Zika Virus through Real-Time PCR testing on
random urine samples. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable
results for Zika Virus detection in urine specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
Zika Virus PCR testing on urine specimens while following the
procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
ensure the integrity of the specimens and report any deficiencies or
deviations in the process promptly to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND VALIDATION
Specimen Type:
• Random urine sample collected in a sterile container.
Specimen Container:
• Sterile urine collection cups or BD Vacutainer Urine tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Store samples at 2-8°C if testing is delayed for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
Specimen Acceptance Criteria:
• Urine samples arriving in the laboratory within 48 hours of
collection.
• Specimens must have proper collection date and time indicated
on the sample container and requisition form.
Specimen Rejection Criteria:
• Samples received more than 48 hours after collection without
proper refrigeration.
• Samples without collection date and time.
• Contaminated samples or visibly turbid specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-Time PCR instrument
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Biosafety cabinet
Reagents:
• Zika Virus PCR assay reagents (includes primers, probes, master
mix)
• RNA extraction kit
Supplies:
• Sterile tubes and containers
• Nitrile gloves
• Lab coat
• Microscope slides (for validation checks)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Store urine samples at 2-8°C until ready for processing.
2. Allow samples to come to room temperature prior to RNA
extraction.
B. RNA Extraction:
1. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for the RNA extraction kit.
2. Transfer 0.5-1 mL of urine sample into a sterile microcentrifuge
tube.
3. Add lysis buffer and mix thoroughly.
4. Centrifuge sample to pellet any debris or cells.
5. Extract RNA from the supernatant by following the RNA
extraction kit protocol.
C. PCR Setup:
1. Prepare master mix according to the Zika Virus assay kit
instructions.
2. Allocate appropriate amounts of master mix, primers, and
probes into sterile PCR tubes.
3. Add extracted RNA to each PCR tube.
4. Include positive, negative, and no-template controls in each
PCR run.
D. PCR Amplification:
1. Load PCR tubes into the Real-Time PCR instrument.
2. Set up the thermal cycling conditions as specified by the assay
kit:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds and
annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 minute
3. Monitor amplification curves and Ct values through the
instrument software.
E. Result Interpretation:
1. Positive Result: Ct values within the defined range indicating
presence of Zika Virus RNA.
2. Negative Result: No amplification or Ct values outside the
defined positive range.
3. Invalid Result: Controls indicate a failure in the PCR process
(e.g., positive control not amplifying).
F. Reporting Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
2. Verify and validate results before releasing to the physician.
G. Quality Control:
1. Run internal controls with each PCR batch.
2. Benchmarks for acceptable control results are defined by the
manufacturer.
3. Document all discrepancies and corrective actions in the
logbook.
H. Corrective Actions:
1. Should there be a failure in any of the controls, investigate and
resolve the issue before proceeding.
2. Repeat testing if necessary and document any deviations.
3. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for RNA extraction kit.
• Zika Virus PCR assay kit product insert.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) guidelines for result
reporting.

1. RECORD KEEPING
Document all steps in the process, including specimen receipt,
testing procedures, and result validation. Maintain records for quality
control, corrective actions, and equipment calibrations.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Follow standard laboratory safety guidelines including PPE
requirements, biosafety cabinet usage, and proper waste disposal.
This SOP ensures the laboratory maintains high standards for
accurate and reliable testing of Zika Virus through PCR on urine
samples. Compliance with these procedures serves to safeguard the
integrity of test results and uphold patient care standards.
