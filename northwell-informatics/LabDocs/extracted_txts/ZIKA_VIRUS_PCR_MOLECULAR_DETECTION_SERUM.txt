Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ZIKA
VIRUS, PCR, MOLECULAR DETECTION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedure for performing the
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the molecular detection of
Zika Virus in serum samples to ensure accurate and reliable test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
PCR assay, documenting the results, and ensuring that quality
control measures are followed.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are adequately
trained and that the procedures are adhered to.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or red-top tube.
• Minimum volume required: 1.0 mL of serum.
• Stability: Samples are stable for up to 5 days at 2-8°C. For longer
storage, serum should be stored at -70°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstations
• Thermal Cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Vortex mixer
• Real-time PCR Detection System
• Zika Virus PCR Master Mix and Primers/Probes (commercially
available or validated in-house reagents)
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control (known Zika Virus RNA)
• Negative control (nuclease-free water)
• Internal control (to monitor extraction and amplification processes)
• RNA extraction kit
1. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw serum samples, positive controls, and internal controls on
ice.
2. Use the RNA extraction kit to extract viral RNA from 200 μL of
serum according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Include
internal control RNA in each extraction to monitor the efficiency.
3. Elute the RNA in a final volume of 50 μL of nuclease-free water.
Store eluted RNA on ice until amplification.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. A typical reaction mix (20 μL) may contain:
◦ 10 μL of 2× PCR Master Mix
◦ 1 μL of Primer/Probe Mix
◦ 5 μL of extracted RNA (including controls)
◦ 4 μL of nuclease-free water
2. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
3. Mix the reaction components thoroughly and briefly centrifuge.
4. Load the reaction mix into the PCR detection system.
C. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
1. Program the thermal cycler as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification (45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
2. After the run, analyze the amplification curves and Ct values
automatically generated by the PCR detection system.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Positive Result: A Ct value within the expected range for the
positive control and/or patient samples indicates the presence
of Zika Virus RNA.
2. Negative Result: Absence of amplification (no Ct value) in the
patient sample while the positive and internal controls amplify
correctly.
3. Invalid Result: If the internal control fails to amplify, the test is
invalid. Repeat the RNA extraction and PCR for that sample.
E. Quality Control:
1. Include the positive control, negative control, and an internal
control in each PCR run.
2. Document all controls and sample results, including any
anomalies.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Record the Ct values and determine the final result based on
predefined thresholds for positivity.
2. Enter results into Laboratory Information System (LIS) with
appropriate interpretation.
3. Positive results should be reported immediately to the
requesting physician and public health authorities as per
guidelines.
G. Reference Intervals:
• Positive control Ct value: Specific range provided by the reagent
manufacturer.
• Negative control Ct value: No Ct or undetermined.
• Internal control Ct value: Specific range indicating successful
extraction and amplification.
H. Method Limitations:
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for any limitations regarding
the individual components of the PCR assay.
