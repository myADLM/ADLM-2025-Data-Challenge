Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measurement of Zinc,
24 Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide precise and consistent
instructions for measuring zinc in a 24-hour urine sample in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. The procedure ensures that analytical results are
accurate, reproducible, and traceable.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the measurement of
zinc in 24-hour urine samples in the laboratory. It covers the handling,
preparation, and analysis of the samples using Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the assay
according to this SOP.
• The Supervisor is responsible for ensuring technologists are
properly trained and that all equipment and reagents are
maintained and calibrated.
• The Quality Control Team is responsible for verifying quality
control measures are followed and for performing necessary
validations.
4. DEFINITIONS
ICP-MS: Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, a highly
sensitive technique for analyzing metal ions, including zinc.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ICP-MS Instrument
• Centrifuge
• Trace-metal-free polypropylene containers
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Deionized Water (Type I)
• Nitric Acid (Trace metal grade)
• Certified Zinc Standards
• Quality Control Materials (Low, Medium, and High zinc controls)
6. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• 24-hour urine collection in a clean, trace-metal-free collection
container. Ensure no contamination with metal-based elements.
• Store refrigerated at 2-8°C during collection and transport to the
laboratory immediately after collection.
Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure sample is well mixed by inversion.
2. If the total volume is >2000 mL, aliquot an appropriate volume
(e.g., 30 mL) into a trace-metal-free container for analysis.
3. Record total volume of the 24-hour urine to enable accurate
calculation of daily zinc excretion.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates.
5. Transfer supernatant into a clean, trace-metal-free container for
analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare a series of zinc standards by diluting certified zinc
standard solutions with deionized water.
2. Include quality control materials at low, medium, and high levels
in each analytical run.
Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Turn on the ICP-MS instrument and allow sufficient warm-up
time as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Perform daily calibration using prepared zinc standards.
3. Verify calibration by running quality control samples before
analyzing patient samples.
4. Document calibration and QC results in the instrument log as
per laboratory policy.
Sample Analysis:
1. Ensure the ICP-MS is calibrated and within operational
parameters.
2. Load the QC samples, standards, and patient samples into the
auto-sampler.
3. Run the analysis as per the instrument’s predefined urine zinc
analysis mode.
4. Record the instrument run IDs and results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate zinc concentrations using the calibration curve
generated from standards.
2. Verify the results with the QC sample results to ensure
accuracy.
3. Normalize zinc concentration to the 24-hour urine volume.
4. Report results in micrograms/day (μg/day) or milligrams/day
(mg/day) as required.
5. Review all results and document in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
6. Investigate and reanalyze any out-of-range controls before
reporting patient results.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Analyze QC materials (low, medium, and high) with each batch
of patient samples.
2. Document QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
limits before validating patient results.
3. Any QC failure must be investigated, and patient results must
not be reported until resolved.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper collection and storage of urine samples to prevent
contamination and degradation.
• ICP-MS sensitivity may be influenced by high levels of interfering
substances.
11. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle nitric acid and any other corrosive chemicals with care.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s operating manual for ICP-MS.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for urine
trace metal analysis.
• Relevant scientific literature and best practices.
13. REVISIONS
• Document any updates or changes to this SOP with appropriate
justification and approval from the laboratory supervisor.
This SOP provides a structured approach to measure zinc levels in
24-hour urine samples, ensuring accuracy, precision, and reliability of
results in a clinical laboratory setting. It covers the necessary steps
from sample preparation to final reporting, including safety and
quality control measures.
