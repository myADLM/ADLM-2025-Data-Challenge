Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generating
Results for Zinc/Creatinine Ratio, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE: To provide clear instructions for the accurate and
consistent analysis of Zinc/Creatinine Ratio in random urine
samples. This SOP outlines the steps to generate, validate, and
report results while ensuring quality control is maintained
throughout the procedure.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all staff responsible for the
analysis of Zinc/Creatinine Ratio in random urine samples
within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Trained and authorized laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis.
• All staff members must adhere to this SOP to maintain
consistency and reliability of results.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying compliance with this
protocol and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen: Freshly voided random urine sample.
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL.
• Container: A clean, sterile urine container without preservatives.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples with visible contamination,
inappropriate labeling, improperly stored, or those arriving more
than 2 hours after collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) for zinc analysis.
• Urine Creatinine Assay Kit (Jaffe method recommended).
• Calibrators and controls for zinc and creatinine assays.
• Standard laboratory glassware and plasticware.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare zinc standards and calibrators according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Prepare creatinine standards and calibrators according to the
assay kit protocol.
• Ensure all reagents and standards are within their expiration
dates and stored appropriately.
B) Equipment Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate ICP-MS/AAS for zinc analysis and verify calibration
using standards.
• Calibrate equipment for creatinine analysis using the Jaffe method
kit instructions and verify calibration.
• Run appropriate quality control samples (low, medium, and high)
for both zinc and creatinine analysis before processing patient
samples.
C) Sample Preparation:
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly before aliquoting.
• Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
• Separate the supernatant for analysis.
D) Zinc Analysis: i. Using ICP-MS/AAS:
• Pipette 1 mL of the supernatant into a clean test tube.
• Dilute the urine sample as necessary depending on the zinc
concentration range.
• Analyze the sample according to the ICP-MS/AAS manufacturer
instructions.
• Record the zinc concentration in µg/L.
E) Creatinine Analysis using Jaffe Method: i. Following the Creatinine
Assay Kit instructions:
• Add reagents to the urine supernatant as per the kit manual.
• Incubate the reaction mixture at room temperature or as per the
kit instructions.
• Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
spectrophotometer.
F) Calculation and Reporting:
• Calculate the Zinc/Creatinine Ratio using the formula: Zinc/
Creatinine Ratio (µg/g) = (Zinc concentration (µg/L) / Creatinine
concentration (mg/dL)) × 100.
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
G) Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
• Ensure quality control samples fall within the acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
• If quality control samples do not meet criteria, recalibrate the
equipment, check reagents, and re-run the controls.
• Record any issues encountered during the process and notify the
supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Verify all results before reporting.
• Transmit results to the LIS for clinical review and entry into the
patient's electronic health record.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for documenting and
communicating any critical values.
1. REFERENCE RANGES:
• Zinc: 100-1200 µg/L (These ranges may vary based on patient
age, gender, and other factors. Refer to laboratory reference
material for specific ranges).
• Creatinine: Normalized within the reported creatinine reference
interval.
• Zinc/Creatinine Ratio: Reference range should be established
based on the laboratory's population studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Strictly ensure no contamination of samples or reagents, as zinc
is present in trace amounts.
• Ensure proper centrifugation and sample preparation to avoid
inaccurate results.
• Follow all procedural steps accurately and consistently to avoid
erroneous results.
