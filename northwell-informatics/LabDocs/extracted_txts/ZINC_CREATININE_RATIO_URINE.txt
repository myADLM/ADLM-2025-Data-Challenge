Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Zinc/Creatinine Ratio,
Urine Analysis
1. Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a comprehensive
procedure for the analysis of zinc/creatinine ratio in urine
specimens. This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel
responsible for performing zinc and creatinine analysis and
includes the steps involved in generating accurate and reliable
results.
2. Principle
The zinc/creatinine ratio in urine is an important diagnostic
indicator. Zinc is measured using a method that generally
involves atomic absorption spectrophotometry or inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Creatinine is
commonly measured using a colorimetric method, such as the
Jaffe reaction. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
concentration of zinc (µg/L) by the concentration of creatinine
(mg/dL) to provide the zinc/creatinine ratio.
3. Responsibilities
◦ It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the zinc and creatinine assays, calculate the zinc/
creatinine ratio, and verify the results.
◦ Responsibility also includes maintenance of equipment,
monitoring quality control, and ensuring the documentation
of all analytical processes and corrective actions as
required.
4. Specimen Requirements and Stability
◦ Specimen Type: Random or 24-hour urine collection.
◦ Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of urine is required.
◦ Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 7 days of collection. If long-term storage is
necessary, specimens can be frozen at -20°C or lower.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens arriving at the
laboratory without proper labeling, outside of the stated
stability period, or visibly contaminated.
5. Equipment and Reagents
◦ Equipment: Atomic absorption spectrophotometer or ICP-
MS, colorimeter, centrifuge, calibrated pipettes, and relevant
glassware.
◦ Reagents: Zinc standard solutions, creatinine reagent for
the Jaffe reaction, appropriate quality control (QC) material
for zinc and creatinine, and distilled water.
6. Procedure
A. Preliminary Steps:
◦ Verify the specimen integrity and correctly label it.
◦ Mix the specimen thoroughly before processing.
B. Zinc Measurement:
◦ Calibrate the spectrophotometer or ICP-MS using zinc
standard solutions.
◦ Conduct a blank reading using distilled water.
◦ Pipette an aliquot of the urine specimen into a test tube.
◦ Carry out the zinc measurement according to the
instrument’s instructions, documenting all necessary values.
◦ Record the zinc concentration in µg/L.
C. Creatinine Measurement:
◦ Perform a calibration of the colorimeter using creatinine
standards.
◦ Pipette an aliquot of the urine specimen into a separate test
tube for creatinine analysis.
◦ Add the creatinine reagent and mix well.
◦ Incubate according to the reagent manufacturer’s
instruction, then measure the absorbance.
◦ Calculate the creatinine concentration using the calibration
curve and document the creatinine concentration in mg/dL.
D. Ratio Calculation:
◦ Calculate the zinc/creatinine ratio using the formula: [
\text{Zinc/Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{\text{Zinc concentration
(µg/L)}}{\text{Creatinine concentration (mg/dL)}} ]
7. Quality Control
◦ Perform QC checks using QC material with known
concentrations of zinc and creatinine with each batch of
specimens analyzed.
◦ Evaluate QC results against acceptable limits; repeat
analysis if QC results fall outside acceptable limits.
◦ Maintain detailed records of QC results and any corrective
actions taken.
8. Reporting Results
◦ Review and verify all results for zinc and creatinine prior to
reporting.
◦ Include the zinc concentration, creatinine concentration, and
zinc/creatinine ratio in the final report.
◦ Send results to the requesting physician or department
according to standard reporting procedures.
9. Reference Intervals
◦ Establish reference intervals based on methodology and
population being tested. Typically, reference intervals should
be validated periodically to ensure their accuracy and
relevance.
10. Method Limitations
◦ Interferences: Certain substances in urine may interfere with
zinc or creatinine measurements. Refer to instrument and
reagent manufacturer inserts for details on specific
interferences.
◦ Limitations related to matrix: High levels of substances such
as phosphates, proteins, or other metal ions can affect
accuracy.
◦ Thoroughly understand the sensitivity and specificity of the
methods employed.
11. References
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the atomic absorption
spectrophotometer or ICP-MS.

◦ Relevant scientific literature and guidelines on zinc and
creatinine measurement.
