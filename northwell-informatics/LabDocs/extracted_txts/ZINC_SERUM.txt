Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Zinc,
Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate
and precise determination of zinc concentration in serum specimens
using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS).
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to follow this
procedure to ensure the accurate determination of serum zinc
levels.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
comply with this protocol.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a trace element free,
royal blue-top tube (no additive).
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Handling:
◦ Centrifuge and separate serum from cells within 1 hour of
collection.
◦ Store at room temperature if analyzed within 4 hours;
otherwise, refrigerate at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples (greater than slight hemolysis may cause
falsely elevated zinc levels).
◦ Specimens collected in non-trace element free containers.
◦ Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 4 hours.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) with zinc-specific
hollow cathode lamp
• Zinc standard solutions (traceable to NIST for calibration)
• Seronorm trace element serum (for quality control)
• Deionized water
• Trace element ultra-pure HNO3 (if digestion is necessary)
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Calibration Standards
1. Prepare zinc stock standard solution typically at a concentration
of 1000 mg/L.
2. Dilute the stock solution to prepare working standards covering
the assay range (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 µg/mL).
3. Store calibration standards at 2-8°C, bringing them to room
temperature before analysis.
B) Equipment Setup
1. Install the zinc-specific hollow cathode lamp.
2. Set the wavelength for zinc to 213.9 nm.
3. Adjust the lamp current and slit width as per manufacturer's
recommendation.
4. Perform necessary alignments and baseline corrections as per
AAS manual.
C) Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. If necessary, dilute specimens with deionized water to bring
their zinc concentration within the assay range.
3. In well-labeled polypropylene tubes, mix 1 mL of serum with 9
mL of deionized water.
4. Mix gently and proceed with analysis.
D) Analytical Procedure
1. Aspirate blank (deionized water) to condition the system.
2. Aspirate calibration standards sequentially, starting from the
lowest to the highest concentration.
3. Create a calibration curve using the absorbance readings
obtained.
4. Aspirate the samples, recording their absorbance values.
5. Clean the aspiration system with deionized water between each
sample to avoid carryover.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run low and high concentration QC samples (Seronorm) with
each batch of patient samples.
• The acceptable range for QC samples must be within ±2 standard
deviations of the established mean.
• Recalibrate if QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, and
reanalyze affected samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Utilize the calibration curve for quantitation, converting
absorbance readings to zinc concentration.
• Record results in µg/mL.
• Validate and electronically enter results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adult Zinc Reference Range: 0.66 – 1.10 µg/mL
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can significantly elevate zinc concentrations due to the
high red blood cell zinc content.
• Lipemia and icterus can interfere with the accuracy of the
measurement.
• Proper tube and instrument contaminations need to be managed
for precise and accurate measurements.
