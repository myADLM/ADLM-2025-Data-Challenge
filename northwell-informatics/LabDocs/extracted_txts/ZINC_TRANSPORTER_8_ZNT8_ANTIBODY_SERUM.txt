SOP: ZINC TRANSPORTER 8 (ZNT8) ANTIBODY, SERUM ASSAY
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the measurement of Zinc Transporter 8
(ZNT8) antibodies in serum samples.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the measurement and analysis of ZNT8
antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in
the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory Technologists trained on the ELISA method for ZNT8
antibodies are responsible for performing this procedure and
ensuring accurate documentation and reporting of results.
Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the process and ensuring
compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Volume: 1 mL
• Specimens must be free from hemolysis and lipemia.
• Specimens should be stored at -20°C or colder if not tested
immediately and should be stable for up to 3 months under these
conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA microplate reader
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Plate washer or wash bottles
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• ZNT8 Antibody ELISA kit including:
◦ Coated microplate
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Incubation buffer
◦ Wash solution
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Reagent Preparation
• Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure all reagents are equilibrated to room temperature before
use.
6.2 Sample Preparation
• Allow serum samples to thaw completely and mix thoroughly by
gentle inversion or vortexing.
• Centrifuge at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes if there are any
visible particles.
6.3 Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and serum samples to the
designated wells on the ELISA plate in duplicate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the plate 4 times
with 300 µL of wash solution per well. Ensure complete removal
of liquid in each washing step.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Repeat the wash step as described in step 3.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the optical density at 450 nm using the ELISA microplate
reader within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction.
6.4 Quality Control
• Run appropriate controls with each batch of specimens.
• Verify that the control values fall within the expected range before
reporting patient results.
• Document any deviations and the corrective actions taken.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the optical density (OD)
values of the calibrators against their respective concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of ZNT8 antibodies in the serum
samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
• Report results as U/mL according to predefined reference
intervals.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < 15 U/mL
• Indeterminate: 15-25 U/mL
• Positive: > 25 U/mL
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and review results for quality control compliance.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Notify the clinician of any critical or indeterminate results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Lipemic, hemolyzed, or contaminated samples may affect assay
accuracy.
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may produce false results.
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for additional limitations and
troubleshooting.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
• Document the testing date, time, and initials of the testing
technologist.
• Maintain logs of daily equipment calibration and maintenance
activities.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ZNT8 Antibody ELISA kit.
