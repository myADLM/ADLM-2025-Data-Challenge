Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ziprasidone (Geodon, Zeldox) Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of Ziprasidone
(Geodon, Zeldox), ensuring accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results. This protocol covers instructions for handling, processing,
and analyzing specimens to determine the concentration of
Ziprasidone in patient samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP
meticulously. It is the responsibility of all staff to report any deviations
or issues encountered during the process to their supervisor
immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum or plasma
Collection:
• Collect blood samples via venipuncture into a plain (red-top) tube
or a tube containing lithium heparin.
Volume Requirements:
• Minimum required volume: 2 mL of serum or plasma.
Handling and Stability:
• Allow serum samples to clot completely before centrifugation.
• Separate serum or plasma from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store separated serum or plasma at 2-8°C if analysis will be
performed within 24 hours. For longer storage, samples may be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with insufficient volume
• Samples collected in EDTA, sodium citrate, or sodium fluoride
tubes
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes
Reagents:
• Ziprasidone standards
• Internal standards (if using LC-MS/MS)
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
• Control materials (positive and negative controls)
Supplies:
• Centrifuge tubes
• HPLC/LC-MS/MS vials
• Pipette tips
• Syringes and filters for sample preparation
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10-15 minutes
to obtain serum or plasma.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum or plasma into a clean
vial, avoiding contact with the cell layer.
HPLC/LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Inject the prepared samples, standards, and controls into the
HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
3. Set the HPLC/LC-MS/MS parameters as follows (example
settings; adjust according to instrument specifications and
method validation):
◦ Column: C18 reversed-phase column
◦ Mobile Phase: Gradient elution with acetonitrile and water
containing 0.1% formic acid
◦ Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Detection: UV at 254 nm for HPLC or MS/MS detection for
LC-MS/MS
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Verify calibration curve linearity and quality control sample
results before analyzing patient specimens.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
process and notify the supervisor for corrective actions.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Ranges:
• Therapeutic concentration range for Ziprasidone: 50-200 ng/mL
(adjust according to clinical sources and method validation data)
Reporting:
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
review and verification by the technologist.
• Note any irregularities or deviations in the report and include
appropriate comments.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Instrument Maintenance:
• Perform routine maintenance on the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities and any repairs conducted.
Troubleshooting:
• For any issues with the analytical process or instrument
performance, refer to the instrument’s troubleshooting guide.
• Contact technical support if the issue cannot be resolved through
standard troubleshooting steps.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC/LC-MS/MS
system and Ziprasidone standards for detailed procedures and safety
information. Clinical references may include therapeutic drug
monitoring literature and pharmacopeia guidelines.
Through careful adherence to this SOP, laboratory staff can ensure
the timely and accurate generation of ZIPRASIDONE testing results,
thus supporting patient care and therapeutic drug monitoring.
