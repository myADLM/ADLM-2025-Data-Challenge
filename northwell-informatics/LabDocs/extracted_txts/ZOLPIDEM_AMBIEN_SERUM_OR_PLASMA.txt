Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Zolpidem (Ambien)
Analysis in Serum or Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines procedures to accurately and reliably measure
Zolpidem (Ambien) levels in serum or plasma. Appropriate handling,
preparation, analysis, and result verification steps are included to
ensure high-quality results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel must perform and document all
Zolpidem tests according to this SOP.
• All staff must identify and report any deficiencies in the analytical
process that may affect test results to a supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN
A. Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in an EDTA or
lithium heparin tube.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of serum or plasma.
• Handling: Store and transport specimens at 2-8°C. If the assay
cannot be performed within 24 hours, specimens should be frozen
at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with severe hemolysis.
◦ Specimens received in tubes other than those specified.
◦ Specimens not appropriately labeled or without collection date/
time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
A. Equipment:
• LC-MS/MS system or HPLC with UV detection.
• Centrifuge for serum/plasma separation.
• Appropriate pipettes and micropipettes.
B. Reagents and Standards:
• Zolpidem calibration standards.
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated Zolpidem).
• Quality control samples (low, medium, and high concentration).
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, and formic acid).
• Serum/plasma sample preparation reagents (e.g., protein
precipitation reagent).
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge serum or plasma samples at 3000
rpm for 10 minutes to remove particulates before analysis.
2. Sample Aliquot: Transfer 0.5 mL of the supernatant to a clean,
labeled centrifuge tube.
3. Internal Standard Addition: Add 50 µL of internal standard to
each sample, calibration standard, and QC sample.
4. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Add 1 mL of protein precipitation reagent (e.g., acetonitrile)
to the aliquots.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge the tubes at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to an LC-MS/MS or HPLC
auto-sampler vial.
B. Instrument Setup:
1. LC-MS/MS or HPLC System Preparation:
◦ Ensure the equipment is calibrated and performing properly.
◦ Fill the solvent reservoirs with the mobile phase.
◦ Program the system with the appropriate method
parameters for Zolpidem analysis.
C. Analytical Run:
1. Load Samples:
◦ Load prepared sample vials, calibration standards, and QC
samples onto the auto-sampler.
◦ Ensure proper sample sequence and volume.
2. Run Analysis:
◦ Start the analytical run according to the method parameters.
◦ Monitor the systems to ensure proper function and resolve
any issues promptly.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that QC samples fall within the established
acceptance criteria.
◦ If QC samples are out of range, troubleshoot and re-analyze
the batch.
2. Calculation:
◦ Employ the calibration curve to quantify Zolpidem
concentrations in serum or plasma samples.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Zolpidem using peak areas of
the sample, internal standard, and calibration standards.
3. Review of Results:
◦ Review all results for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Flag any results that do not meet the acceptable criteria and
take corrective actions.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter all tested results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing the report.
• Report results in ng/mL, with specific comments or footnotes for
any flagged or critical values.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND LIMITATIONS
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of analytical
instruments.
• Always include internal and external QC samples to ensure
validity.
• Be aware of potential interferences and cross-reactivity as
outlined in the assay validation documents.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for LC-MS/MS or HPLC systems.
• Zolpidem reference standards and reagent package inserts.
• Relevant scientific literature and guidelines for therapeutic drug
monitoring.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated as necessary, or at least
annually, to ensure ongoing accuracy and compliance with regulatory
standards.
