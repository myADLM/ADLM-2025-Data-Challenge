Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Generating Results for Zolpidem in Umbilical Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for analytical testing of Zolpidem, a
sedative-hypnotic drug, in umbilical cord tissue. Accurate
determination requires proper sample preparation, handling, analysis,
and result generation. This procedure ensures that zolpidem
presence is accurately identified and quantified in compliance with
laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the preparation,
analysis, and documentation of zolpidem results from umbilical cord
tissue samples. Supervisors must ensure staff compliance with this
procedure and review results for accuracy and completeness.
2. DEFINITION
Zolpidem: A sedative-hypnotic drug prescribed for the treatment of
insomnia. Its detection in umbilical cord tissue can indicate in utero
exposure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Umbilical cord tissue (approximately 6 inches).
• Obtain tissue as soon as possible after delivery and store at
2-8°C.
• Transport to the laboratory immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Decomposed, moldy, or improperly stored specimens.
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient ID, date/time of
collection).
Stability:
• Store at 2-8°C until analysis.
• If analysis is delayed beyond 7 days, freeze at -20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(HPLC-MS) system.
• Homogenizer or equivalent tissue processor.
• Analytical balance.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Volumetric flasks.
• Zolpidem standard solutions.
• HPLC-grade water, methanol, acetonitrile.
• Sample extraction solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water mixture).
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• PTFE syringe filters (0.22 µm pore size).
• Laboratory glassware (test tubes, beakers, etc.)
• Assorted laboratory consumables (gloves, labels, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Obtain the umbilical cord tissue: Ensure proper documentation.
Rinse tissue with cold saline to remove external contaminants if
necessary.
2. Weights and homogenization:
◦ Weigh 2 grams of tissue using an analytical balance and
record the weight.
◦ Transfer tissue into a homogenizer.
◦ Add 2 mL of HPLC-grade water and homogenize thoroughly
to ensure uniformity.
3. Extraction of Zolpidem:
◦ Transfer homogenate to a clean test tube.
◦ Add 5 mL acetonitrile to the tube, cap, and vortex for 1
minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer supernatant to a clean test tube.
◦ If needed, repeat extraction on the pellet for maximum
recovery and combine supernatants.
B. Sample Clean-Up and Filtration:
1. Using a PTFE syringe filter, filter the extract into an HPLC vial.
2. For particularly dirty extracts, an additional solid-phase
extraction step may be added using appropriate cartridges.
C. Calibration and Controls:
1. Prepare a calibration curve with zolpidem standard solutions
ranging from 0.5 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL.
2. Include blank umbilical cord tissue homogenates as negative
controls.
3. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations (e.g., 1 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL).
D. HPLC-MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC-MS system according to the manufacturer’s
specifications.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Mobile Phase: A (Water with 0.1% formic acid), B
(Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid).
◦ Gradient flow: Start with 90% A, and 10% B, for 1 minute,
then linear gradient to 10% A, and 90% B over 10 minutes.
◦ Flow rate: 0.3 mL/min.
◦ Injection volume: 10 µL.
◦ Column temperature: 40°C.
3. Run calibration, blanks, QCs, and patient samples.
4. Perform data acquisition and process chromatograms,
identifying peaks corresponding to zolpidem.
6. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Calculate the concentration of zolpidem in the umbilical cord
tissue homogenates using the calibration curve.
• Enter results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Flag and immediately notify the requesting clinician of any critical
or significantly elevated levels as per laboratory policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the HPLC-MS
system per manufacturer's guidelines.
• Run QC samples with each batch to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the method.
• Document any deviations, equipment malfunctions, and corrective
actions taken according to the quality management system.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Handle solvents and reagents with care, following OSHA
guidelines.
• Dispose of waste per the laboratory’s hazardous waste disposal
program.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
• Zolpidem detection may be affected by improper sample storage
and handling.
• High levels of matrix components could interfere with mass
spectrometric detection.
