Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Zonisamide, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and efficient analysis of
zonisamide levels in serum samples using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to follow this SOP
for serum zonisamide analysis. The results should be generated and
validated as per the outlined protocols to ensure reliability and
accuracy.
1. DEFINITIONS
Zonisamide: A sulfonamide anticonvulsant medication used to treat
epilepsy. Serum: The liquid part of blood after coagulation, devoid of
blood cells and clotting factors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red or yellow-top tube.
• Minimum volume: 2 mL serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Serum that has been hemolyzed.
• Specimens not stored properly before analysis.
• Specimens collected in incorrect tubes (e.g., EDTA tubes).
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• HPLC system equipped with UV detector
• HPLC Column: C18, 5 µm, 4.6 × 150 mm
• Zonisamide standard (calibration curve)
• Acetonitrile, Methanol, Water (HPLC grade)
• Mobile phase: Mixed solvent containing acetonitrile and water
(70:30 ratio)
• Internal standard (proposed: Sulfamethoxazole)
Supplies:
• Micro-pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Glass/plastic vials
• Sample auto-injector vials and caps
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Calibration Standards:
• Prepare zonisamide stock solution (1 mg/mL).
• Create serial dilutions to generate standards ranging from 1 µg/
mL to 100 µg/mL.
• Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge serum specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain
clear serum.
• Transfer 0.5 mL serum into a labeled vial.
• Add 0.5 mL of internal standard solution.
• Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
• Add 1 mL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
• Vortex again for 1 minute and centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10
minutes.
• Transfer supernatant to an HPLC auto-injector vial.
HPLC Analysis:
• Set up the HPLC system and prepare the mobile phase
(acetonitrile:water, 70:30).
• Prime the system and run a blank.
• Inject calibration standards to create a standard curve.
• Inject a 20 µL sample from each vial or according to optimized
parameters.
• Set the detector wave length at 240 nm for zonisamide detection.
• Run the samples through the column using the following
conditions:
◦ Flow rate: 1 mL/min
◦ Column temperature: 25°C
◦ Run time: 10 minutes
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Samples:
• Run QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations at the
beginning and end of each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure each QC sample falls within the acceptable range values.
If not, investigate and perform necessary troubleshooting steps
before proceeding.
Instrument and Calibration Checks:
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of HPLC equipment.
• Ensure end-to-end system checks including mobile phase
preparation and detector calibration.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review:
• Inspect chromatograms visually for any discrepancies.
• Calculate zonisamide concentration in patient samples using the
calibration curve.
Verification:
• Review results for internal consistency by comparing with
historical data.
• Any results showing significant deviation should be revalidated or
reinvestigated.
Documentation:
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
verify before releasing.
• Report critical results immediately to the ordering physician as per
laboratory policies.

1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling chemicals and
biological samples. Dispose of all waste materials according to
hazardous waste disposal regulations.
End of SOP
These procedures should be reviewed periodically and updated as
necessary to accommodate advancements and changes in
technology, procedures, and regulations.
