Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Zucchini (Cucurbita spp) IgE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps necessary for the analytical
phase of generating results for Zucchini (Cucurbita spp) IgE
testing. This test is performed to detect IgE antibodies specific
to zucchini allergens in patient serum or plasma, aiding in the
diagnosis of allergic reactions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory staff performing the analytical phase of Zucchini
(Cucurbita spp) IgE testing must be trained on this SOP and
adhere to the outlined procedure. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory management to ensure the availability of required
materials and equipment, as well as to oversee adherence to
this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum separated from a venipuncture
sample, collected in a red-top or serum-separator tube (SST).
• Acceptable Specimen: Plasma collected in a heparin or EDTA
tube.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Specimens received in sodium fluoride or citrate tubes
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fully automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250,
ImmunoCAP)
• Zucchini (Cucurbita spp) IgE reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls (Low, Medium, High)
• Quality control materials
• Timer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Review the calibration and maintenance log of the
immunoassay analyzer to ensure it is within the acceptable
operational range before use.
2. Verify that all reagents are within expiry dates and brought to
room temperature if stored refrigerated.
B) Specimen Handling:
1. Allow serum or plasma specimens to come to room
temperature.
2. Vortex if needed to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot specimen if necessary, ensuring proper labeling.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer using the
calibrators provided with the reagent kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each testing
day and with each new assay kit.
3. Verify that quality control results fall within the expected ranges
before proceeding with patient specimens.
D) Assay Procedure:
1. Load the Zucchini (Cucurbita spp) IgE reagent kits, controls,
calibrators, and patient specimens onto the immunoassay
analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer for Zucchini (Cucurbita spp) IgE testing,
inputting patient and sample information as required.
3. Initiate the run following the manufacturer's instructions for the
specific immunoassay system in use.
4. Monitor the analyzer throughout the testing process to ensure it
operates without errors.
E) Interpretation and Verification of Results:
1. Upon completion of the assay run, retrieve and review the
results from the analyzer.
2. Compare the results of patient samples to the calibration curve
and reference ranges provided in the reagent kit insert.
3. If any results fall outside of the acceptable range or expected
control value, investigate and resolve the cause before
releasing results.
4. Document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure that critical values are communicated to the relevant
healthcare provider in accordance with the laboratory’s critical
value policy.
3. Include interpretative comments if required for clearer
understanding by the healthcare provider.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Follow internal quality control protocols and document all quality
control procedures.
• Perform proficiency testing for Zucchini (Cucurbita spp) IgE as
required by regulatory bodies.
• Maintain records of all Quality Control (QC) and proficiency
testing for at least two years.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In case of repeated calibration or control failures, consult the
instrument and reagent manufacturers' technical support.
• Document any analytical phase issues and the steps taken to
resolve them.
