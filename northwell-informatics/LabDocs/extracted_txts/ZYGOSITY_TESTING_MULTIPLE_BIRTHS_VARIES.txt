STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
ZYGOSITY TESTING (MULTIPLE BIRTHS) - ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for performing
zygosity testing (multiple births) in a clinical laboratory. This
procedure ensures accurate and reliable results for determining the
zygosity of multiple births using molecular methodology.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of zygosity testing specimens. The samples may be buccal
swabs or blood specimens from multiple births.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
zygosity testing according to this SOP and to document all
procedures, results, and any deviations from the protocol. Any issues
or inconsistencies discovered during the analysis must be reported to
the laboratory supervisor immediately.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Zygosity: The degree of similarity of the alleles for a trait in an
organism.
• Multiple Births: The birth of more than one offspring from one
pregnancy.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Buccal swabs or blood samples
• Specimens should be received and accessioned properly before
analysis
• Specimens should be stored at -20°C if there is a delay in
proceeding with the analysis
6. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents
• Short Tandem Repeat (STR) specific primers
• Thermocycler
• Electrophoresis equipment (e.g., capillary electrophoresis)
• DNA size standard
• Positive and negative controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Confirm specimens are correctly labeled and accessioned.
2. Thaw frozen specimens if necessary.
3. Follow the DNA extraction kit's protocol to isolate genomic DNA
from buccal swabs or blood samples.
4. Assess DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer. Record results.
B. Amplification by PCR
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add DNA template to each PCR reaction tube.
3. Include positive control DNA and negative control (water) in the
PCR setup.
4. Program the thermocycler with the following steps:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 30 cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 56°C for 30 seconds (temperature may vary
depending on primers used)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
5. Validate amplification by running an aliquot of the PCR product
on an agarose gel (if necessary).
C. Fragment Analysis
1. Prepare the PCR products for electrophoresis.
2. Run the products on a capillary electrophoresis system
following the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Use an appropriate DNA size standard for accurate fragment
sizing.
4. Analyze the electropherogram data using the system's
software.
D. Data Analysis
1. Compare the STR profiles of multiple birth specimens.
2. Determine if the profiles match (monozygotic twins) or differ
(dizygotic twins).
3. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
complete the worksheet, ensuring all fields are filled out
accurately.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each extraction,
amplification, and analysis batch.
• Document any deviations from the standard procedure and
corrective actions taken.
• Review all control results before validating and reporting patient
results.
• Conduct periodic proficiency testing according to regulatory
guidelines.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and approve the results in the LIS.
• Report results according to the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
Provide interpretation of results and comments if necessary.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s protocol for the DNA extraction kit, PCR reagents,
electrophoresis system, and STR analysis software.
• Relevant scientific literature and guidelines on zygosity testing
methods and interpretation.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of specimen handling, DNA extraction, PCR
setup, electropherogram data, and final results.
• Ensure all documentation is complete and stored according to
laboratory standards for record-keeping and regulatory
compliance.
12. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow the laboratory’s safety protocols for handling biological
specimens and chemicals.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
• Dispose of all waste according to the laboratory’s biohazardous
waste disposal procedures.
13. REVIEW AND REVISION OF SOP
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure
current practices and compliance with regulatory requirements.
• Revisions will be documented, and staff will be trained on new
procedures promptly.
