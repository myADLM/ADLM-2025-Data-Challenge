# IV Device/System Characteristics:

# A Device Description:

AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing is an In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assay (IVDMIA) test service performed in a single laboratory. It assesses the gene expression profile of RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene expression levels are converted to an AlloMap Test Score, which is reported to the physician.

The following sample collection supplies are provided by CareDx to ordering laboratories/physicians:

• 8 mL BD Vacutainer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CPT™ Cell Preparation Tubes with Sodium Citrate (CPT) (only tubes supplied by CareDx should be used) AlloMap sample processing reagent kit (10 centrifuge tubes containing $5 \mathrm { m L }$ phosphate buffered saline, 10 tubes containing $1 . 8 \mathrm { m L }$ of LyseDx™ lysing reagent, 10 sterile disposable transfer pipettes, 1 package insert with instructions for use, 1 quick reference card)   
• CareDx Frozen Shipper Pack

# Principle of Operation:

Blood specimen collection at the referring facility is initiated by a physician order. Whole blood is drawn from the patient into blood collection tubes supplied by CareDx. PBMCs are separated from whole blood via centrifugation, washed, pelleted, and lysed using reagents supplied by CareDx. The lysate is stored frozen and shipped to the CareDx laboratory using kits provided by CareDx. Upon arrival at the CareDx laboratory, samples are inspected and accessioned into the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database that tracks all workflow steps.

RNA from the PBMC lysate is purified and quantified with a spectrophotometer. Upon meeting RNA quantity and purity acceptance criteria, liquid handling instruments are used to dispense samples and reagents into 96-well reaction plates. RNA is converted to cDNA via a reverse transcriptase protocol on a thermal cycler. The cDNA is then diluted and dispensed using liquid handling instruments into 384-well AlloMap plates containing qRT-PCR reagents. qRT-PCR of 20 genes (11 informative and 9 used for normalization and quality control) is carried out using qRT-PCR instruments. Multiple automated quality control (QC) checks are performed on every sample.

For all samples that pass QC, CareDx Analyzer software converts the expression levels determined for the 20 genes into an AlloMap Test Score (an integer ranging from 0 to 40) using a proprietary algorithm. Final reports are signed off by the clinical laboratory scientists in the CareDx laboratory and are sent to the ordering physician. The physician interprets the results along with other standard clinical assessments of cardiac allograft status to determine probability of ACR.

AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing is only performed at the CLIA-certified and CAPaccredited clinical laboratory at CareDx in Brisbane, CA.

2. Linearity:

Linearity is not applicable. AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing provides physicians with a score between 0 and 40.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

The analytical specificity for AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing was established in DEN080007/k073482.

4. Assay Reportable Range:

AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing provides physicians with a score between 0 and 40.

Quality control materials and procedures remain unchanged from DEN080007/k073482.

Sample stability study protocols and data were reviewed and found acceptable. Patient RNA samples are stored for up to 6 months at $\leq - 6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and patient cDNA samples are stored for up to 6 months at $\leq - 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . RNA controls are stored for up to 16 months at $\leq - 6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and cDNA controls are stored for up to 45 months at $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

6. Detection Limit:

A study was conducted to confirm that a minimum RNA yield of $4 0 0 \mathrm { n g }$ is required to run the assay. A pool of patient RNA samples with an AlloMap score of 34.6 was tested in RNA inputs ranging from 150 to $5 0 0 \mathrm { n g }$ to generate cDNA. Each cDNA was tested three times in the same plate section across three plates from the same lot using one LC480 instrument. The results confirmed the minimum RNA yield of $4 0 0 \mathrm { n g }$ .

As established in DEN080007/k073482, the blood collection procedure yields sufficient RNA to run the AlloMap test on $9 8 \%$ of patient samples, the acceptable $\mathrm { A } _ { 2 6 0 } / \mathrm { A } _ { 2 8 0 }$ ratio range for testing is 1.5 to 3.5, and each gene assay must provide a $\mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { T } }$ at or below 38 to generate a test score.

7. Assay Cut-Off: Not applicable.

8. Accuracy (Instrument): See the method comparison with predicate device study in section VII.B.1.

9. Carry-Over: Not applicable.

# B Comparison Studies:

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:

A method comparison study was conducted using 163 heart transplant patient RNA samples spanning the range of AlloMap scores. cDNA was generated from each RNA sample and each cDNA was tested on two candidate devices (with Roche LightCycler 480II (LC480) instruments) and one predicate device (with Applied Biosystems Incorporated 7900HT (7900HT) instruments).

Passing-Bablok regression analysis was conducted with the AlloMap scores from each pair of predicate and candidate devices used in the method comparison study. The results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Comparison</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope estimate(95% confidenceinterval)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept estimate(95% confidenceinterval)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$R 2r}$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Candidatedevice 1 vs.predicate device</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1 (0.99, 1.01)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0 (-0.53, 0.53)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9603</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Candidatedevice 2 vs.predicate device</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1 (0.99, 1.01)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0 (-034, 0.34)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9512</td></tr></table>

An allowable total difference (ATD) analysis was conducted with the method comparison data and within-laboratory imprecision estimates for the predicate device according to FDA’s guidance document “Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices” (issued on April 25, 2013). The analysis showed that over $9 8 \%$ of the samples over the entire AlloMap score range fell within the ATD zones with the lower limit of the $9 5 \%$ one-sided confidence interval being above $94 \%$ for both candidate devices tested. Therefore, it was concluded that the candidate device performance is comparable to the predicate device performance since the majority of the candidate device measurements fall within the imprecision of the predicate device.

Analyses were provided that demonstrated that the mean NPV and PPV differences between the candidate and predicate devices were within $1 \%$ for NPV and within $2 \%$ for PPV for both the 2-6 month and $> 6$ month post-transplant periods.
