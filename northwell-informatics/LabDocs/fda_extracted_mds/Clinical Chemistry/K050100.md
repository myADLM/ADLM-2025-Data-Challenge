# II. Description of the new device

Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a human hemoglobin A (HbA0) with glucose irreversibly bound to the N-terminal valine of the beta-chain. %HbA1c is the percentage of glycolsylated hemoglobin molecules as a percentage of the total hemoglobin concentration.

%HbAlc is quantified on medical devices by turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TINIA), ion-exchange HPLC, boronate affinity HPLC or gel electrophoresis.

The Bayer DCA ${ 2 0 0 0 + }$ [K940971] determines HbA1c concentration by immunoassay and total hemoglobin concentration by colorimetry. Using the values obtained for each of these two analytes, the percentage of the total hemoglobin that is glycated is calculated and reported as $\mathrm { H b A 1 c \% }$ .

RNA1c Hemoglobin A1c Control for Bayer DCA2000 and DCA $\bf { 2 0 0 0 + }$ Analyzers is a two-level, aqueous liquid control solution consisting of a synthetic peptide identical to the Hb Alc epitope in a non-biological aqueous solution with dye to provide the appropriate total hemoglobin value. The concentration of dye and peptide are optimized for use on the Bayer DCA 2000 and DCA ${ 2 0 0 0 + }$ Analyzers to provide measurement values for HbAlc equivalent to the predicate device, Bayer DCA 2000 Hemoglobin A1c Normal and Abnormal Control Kit.

# RNA1c Hemoglobin A1c Control for Bayer DCA2000 and DCA2000+

Analyzers provides a convenient method of performing periodic QC checks for laboratories selecting to measure liquid QC material as a part of their quality assurance program. The product is packaged in a plastic bottle with dropper tip for application of the solution to the test cartridge.

# RNA1c Hemoglobin A1c Control for Bayer DCA2000 and DCA2000+

Analyzers is a non-hazardous aqueous solution containing no biological materials and requires no reconstitution prior to use.

Intended use of the device RNA1c Hemoglobin A1c Control for Bayer DCA2000 and $\mathbf { D C A 2 0 0 0 + }$ Analyzers is intended to be used to monitor and evaluate the analytical performance of the Bayer DCA 2000 and DCA $2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers.

(6) Technological characteristics of the device.

RNA1c Hemoglobin AIc Control for Bayer DCA2000 and DCA ${ 2 0 0 0 + }$

Analyzers is a two-level, aqueous liquid control solution consisting of a synthetic peptide identical to the HbAlc epitope in a non-biological aqueous solution with dye to provide the appropriate total hemoglobin value. The concentration of dye and peptide are optimized for use on the Bayer DCA 2000 and DCA ${ 2 0 0 0 + }$ Analyzer to provide measurement values for HbA1c equivalent to the predicate device, Bayer DCA 2000 Hemoglobin A1c Normal and Abnormal Control Kit.

(b) (1) Summary of non-clinical tests submitted with the premarket notification for the device.

Tests were conducted to verify specific performance requirements:

a) Closed bottle stability b) Stability after opening c) Correlation to predicate device d) Test precision and range

(b) (2) Summary of clinical tests submitted with the premarket notification for the device.

Re: k050100 Trade/Device Name: RNA1c Hemoglobin Alc Control for Bayer DCA2000 and DCA2 $0 0 0 +$ Analyzers Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660 Regulation Name: Quality control material (assay and unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I Product Code: JJX Dated: January 17, 2005 Received: January 18, 2005

Dear Ms. Storro:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that havc been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all thc Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requircments as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 –

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
