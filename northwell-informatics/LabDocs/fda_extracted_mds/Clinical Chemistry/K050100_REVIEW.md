# 510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION DECISION SUMMARY ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE

A. 510(k) Number: k050100 B. Purpose for Submission:

The company is introducing of a new product – a control – for an existing $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ party device.

# C. Measurand:

This product under submission serves as a control for a device that simultaneously measures the concentration of hemoglobin via adsorption and the glycosylation state via an immunoassay.

The proposed control uses a glycosylated peptide fragment to mimic the binding target of the immunoassay. The concentration of hemoglobin is mimicked by a red dye.

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

RNA Medical Brand ${ \mathrm { R N A } } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ Control is an assayed quality control material used for monitoring the performance of Bayer DCA 2000 and DCA $2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers that measure $\mathrm { H b A } _ { \mathrm { 1 c } }$ .

2. Indication(s) for use:

RNA1c Control for Bayer DCA2000 and $\mathbf { D C A 2 0 0 0 } +$ Analyzers is intended to be used to monitor and evaluate the analytical performance of the Bayer DCA 2000 and DCA $2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers that measure HbA1c. The use of quality control materials is indicated as an objective assessment of the precision of methods and techniques in use and is an integral part of good laboratory practice. The two levels of controls allow performance monitoring within the clinically important range.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Not applicable

4. Special instrument requirements:

This control is only intended for use with the Bayer DCA 2000 and DCA $2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers.

# I. Device Description:

RNA1c Control for Bayer DCA2000 and $\mathrm { D C A } 2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers is an assayed, two level, aqueous liquid control solution consisting of a synthetic peptide identical to the HbA1c epitope in a non-biological aqueous solution with dye to provide the appropriate total hemoglobin value. The concentration of dye and peptide are optimized for use on the Bayer DCA 2000 and DCA $2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers to provide measurement values for HbA1c equivalent to the predicate device, Bayer DCA 2000 Hemoglobin A1c Normal and Abnormal Control Kit. RNA1c Control for Bayer DCA2000 and $\mathrm { D C A } 2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers is a non-hazardous aqueous solution containing no hemoglobin or other materials of biological origin.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Bayer DCA $2 0 0 0 +$ HbA1c Control

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k021484

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced in this submission.

# L. Test Principle:

The product under submission is used to verify the performance of Bayer Analyzers. The control is treated as a typical sample. Processing is done per instrument instructions.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

No Traceability was provided.

The predicate and pre-market devices serve as controls for specific Bayer clinical equipment. The stability of the components is one of the primary criteria for acceptance.

Stability is measured by:

• Open vial aging which mimics handling by the users of the product. These studies involve verifying concentration of the analyte mimics as seen by the Bayer device when the product is stored capped but unsealed at $2 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

• Accelerated stability testing which involves storing tested samples at elevated temperatures $( 2 5 \ \ \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ in an effort to predict their long-term performance.

The reported stability is within the error limits stated with the product. The measured stability is consistent with the shelf life claimed on the product insert.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The performance of this control was verified by comparing it to the existing control on the required Bayer instrument.

The assigned ranges for these controls are based upon replicate assays of samples of the product on multiple instruments and lots of measurement cassettes in accordance with directions accompanying the Bayer analyzers.

Values assigned by this method were evaluated against replicate assays of representative samples of the product by participating laboratories using the DCA 2000 and DCA $2 0 0 0 +$ models to confirm $59 5 \%$ of values reported within assay limits for both the product and the predicate device. All values were assigned with instruments and instrument manufacturer’s reagents available at the time of the comparison.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

Expected values are presented in the labeling for a representative lot for HgbA1c assay on the Bayer DCA 2000 and $2 0 0 0 +$ Analyzers as follows:
