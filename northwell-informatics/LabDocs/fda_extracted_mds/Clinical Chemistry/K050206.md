CEDIA@ Tacrolimus Assay   
Enzyme Immunoassay, Tacrolimus MLM   
21 CFRS862.1678.   
Class 2 (special controls)

# Predicate Device(s):

The data and results described herein demonstrate that the CEDIA® Tacrolimus Assay is substantially equivalent to $\boldsymbol { \lvert { \mathsf { M } } \times \mathbf { \em { \^ { \otimes } } } }$ Tacrolimus II (MElA) for the quantitative determination of tacrolimus (FK506) concentration in human whole blood as an aid in the management of kidney and liver transplant patients receiving therapy with tacrolimus.

# Device Description:

The $C E D \mathsf { I A } ^ { \otimes }$ Tacrolimus Assay uses recombinant DNA technology (US Patent No. 4708929) to produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme $\beta$ -galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments i.e., enzyme acceptor (EA) and enzyme donor (ED). These fragments spontaneously reassociate to form fully active enzyme that, in the assay format, cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.

In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive fragment (ED) of $\beta$ -galactosidase for antibody binding site. If analyte is present in the sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragments free to form active enzyme. If analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the reassociation of inactive $\beta$ -galactosidase fragments, and ro active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of analyte present in the sample.

# Intended Use:

The $C E D / A ^ { \mathfrak { O } }$ Tacrolimus Assay is an in vitro diagnostic medical device intended for the quantitative determination of tacrolimus in human whole blood using automated clinical chemistry analyzers as an aid in the management of kidney and liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus therapy.

$C E D | A ^ { \otimes }$ Tacrolimus Calibrators are intended for calibration of the CEDlA® Tacrolimus Assay in whole blood.

# Comparison to Predicate Device(s):

The CEDlA® Tacrolimus Assay is substantially equivalent to ${ \mathfrak { M } } { \mathfrak { x } } ^ { \otimes }$ Tacrolimus II (MEIA) in its intended use and in for the quantitative determination of tacrolimus (FK-506) concentration as an aid in the management of kidney and liver transplant patients receiving therapy with tacrolimus.

# Summary:

The information provided in this pre-market notification demonstrates that the CEDIA® Tacrolimus Assay is substantially equivalent to the ${ \mathsf { M } } \mathbf { x } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Tacrolimus Il assay. The ${ \cal M } x ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ Tacrolimus Il assay is commonly used for determination of tacrolimus concentration in whole blood samples obtained from patients receiving tacrolimus for post-operative management following hepatic transplant. Data and results provided in this premarket notification were collected and prepared, respectively, in accordance with the established guideline, "Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus Assays; Guidance for Industry and FDA", dated September 16, 2002. , These data and results amply demonstrate that the CEDlA@ Tacrolimus Assay is substantially equivalent to the ${ \| { \mathsf { M } } \times } ^ { \textregistered }$ Tacrolimus Il assay for the quantitative determination of tacrolimus (FK506) in human whole blood using automated clinical chemistry analyzers as an aid in the management of kidney and liver transplant patients receiving therapy with tacrolimus.

Dear Ms. Charter:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determincd the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commercc prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), i may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Tille 21, Codc of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcemcnts concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination thal your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administercd by other Federal agencics.
