# 2.2. Safety and Effectiveness Information

Predicate Device:   
Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to BAYER Corp. - Glucometer Elite Blood Glucose Meter ( K964630 ).   
Device Description: Based on an electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action, 3tes Glucose Monitoring System only needs a small amount of blood. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into

the action chamber and your blood glucose result is precisely and displayed in 5 seconds, and 100 blood glucose result memory.

# Intended Use:

The 3test glucose test strip is intended to measure the glucose in whole blood with the 3tes Glucose Monitoring System. It is suitable for a person with diabetes to monitor their blood glucose at home by themselves. The 3tes Glucose Monitoring System can also be used at clinical sites by nurses or professional people to test patient's glucose level in whole blood.

# Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

Pre-clinical and clinical data are employed upon submission of this 510(K) premarket notification according to the Guidance Document for In Vitro Diagnostic Test System; Guidance for Industry and FDA document provided by CDRH/ FDA.

# Substantial Equivalence (SE)

A claim of substantial equivalence is made to the predicate device BAYER Corp. - Glucometer Elite Blood Glucose Meter (K964630). Both of them have the same working principle and technologies. The differences are control solution, dimensions of the unit and strip, the time of auto shut off, memory results, and test time. There are no safety and effectiveness aspects arising from the subject device. They are substantially equivalent.

Dear Dr. Jen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use staled in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class IlI (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations afecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
