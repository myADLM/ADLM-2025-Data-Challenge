4. Panel: Immunology (82)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Elecsys CA 19-9 Immunoassay is an immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of CA 19-9 tumor associated antigen in human serum and plasma. The assay is indicated for the serial measurement of CA 19-9 to aid in the management of patients diagnosed with cancers of the exocrine pancreas. The test is useful as an aid in the monitoring of disease status in those patients having confirmed pancreatic cancer who have levels of CA 19-9 at some point in their disease process exceeding the median concentration determined for the apparently healthy cohort. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the

Roche Elecsys 1010/2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 (Elecsys module) immunoassay analyzers.

The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalSet is used for calibrating the quantitative Elecsys CA 19-9 assay on the Elecsys immunoassay systems.

2. Indication(s) for use:

As an aid in the management of patients diagnosed with cancers of the exocrine pancreas and in monitoring of disease status in those patients having confirmed pancreatic cancer who have levels of CA 19-9 at some point in their disease process exceeding the median concentration determined for the apparently healthy cohort.

3. Special condition for use statement(s):

Patients must be Lewis blood group antigen positive. Patients known to be genotypically negative for Lewis blood group antigen are unable to produce the CA 19-9 antigen even in the presence of malignant tissue. Phenotyping for the presence of the Lewis blood group antigen may be insufficient to detect true Lewis antigen negative individuals. Even patients who are genotype positive for the Lewis antigen may produce varying levels of CA 19- 9 as the result of gene dosage effect. The device is for prescription use only.

4. Special instrument Requirements:

Use with Roche Elecsys 1010/2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 (Elecsys module) immunoassay analyzers. These systems were 510(k) cleared under k961481.

# I. Device Description:

The Elecsys CA 19-9 Immunoassay kit consists of 1 bottle each of M. streptavidincoated microparticles, biotinylated monoclonal anti-CA 19-9 antibody (Ab) in phosphate buffer (R1) and ruthenium complex labeled monoclonal anti-CA 19-9 Ab in phosphate buffer (R2). Reagents are assembled into a ready-for-use unit. All reagents contain preservative.

The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalSet consists of two levels of human CA 19-9 (approximately $2 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ and $2 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ) in lyophilized human serum with preservative.

# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys CA 19-9 Assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay. A sample is incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal CA 19-9 antibody and a ruthenium complex labeled monoclonal CA 19-9 antibody. If CA 19-9 is present in the sample, it will bind to both antibodies to form a sandwich complex. After addition of the streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex will bind to the microparticles as the result of interaction of biotin and streptavidine. The reaction mixture is aspirated into a measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are removed with system buffer. Application of a voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined using a calibration curve generated by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

i. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated on Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer by testing 6 replicates each of two controls (CA 19-9 concentrations of 19.2 and $6 0 . 6 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ) and 3 patient samples (CA 19-9 concentrations of 11.1, 46.6 and $1 8 5 . 4 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ) per day for 10 days. The following table summarized the results of the with-in run and total precision.

Additional data were provided for five human serum samples with CA 19- 9 concentrations of 36.81, 159.79, 307.47, 644.61 and $9 1 9 . 7 8 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . These samples were tested in duplicate on four Elecsys 2010 instruments with two series per instrument. The total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ across all instruments ranged from $1 . 6 \%$ to $4 . 4 \%$ . Lot-to-lot comparison was performed on 5 lots with 5 control samples with the following CA 19-9 concentrations: 12.6, 16.7, 20.8, 71.7 and $1 9 6 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . The $\% \mathrm { C V }$ ranged from $1 . 7 \%$ to $3 . 5 \%$ .

ii. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated by assaying 3 serum samples containing varying concentrations of CA 19-9 (1138.6, 866.7 and $1 4 0 0 . 4 \mathrm { U / m L }$ ). Each sample was serially diluted with sample diluent to 14 dilutions, from undiluted to samples containing $0 . 6 \%$ serum. The observed results were compared to the expected results and the percent recovery was calculated. The percent recoveries ranged from $8 5 . 4 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 5 \%$ .

The assay measuring range is from $0 . 6 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ iii. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

There is no known reference standard for CA 19-9. The Elecsys CA 19-9 assay was standardized against the Enzymun CA 19-9 manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim Immunodiagnostics. The master calibrators and secondary calibrators are prepared using human CA 19-9 spiked into human serum matrix. Value assignment is based on the Enzymun CA 19-

9. The CalSets are assayed and compared to these standard preparations and values are assigned. This assignment process utilizes four E170, four Elecsys 2010 and four Elecsys 1010 analyzers. Two series of analyses are performed on each instrument. Two-fold determinations are made for each series.

PreciControl Tumor Marker is the control material for the Elecsys CA 19- 9. PreciControl Tumor Marker was originally cleared under k972235. A special 510(k) will be submitted for the PreciControl Tumor Marker to obtain clearance for the additional analyte. CA 19-9 analyte is a constituent of the already cleared PreciControl Tumor Marker but remains silent in the product labeling as no Elecsys CA 19-9 immunoassay is yet available in the US.

iv. Detection limit (functional sensitivity):

The lower detection limit (LDL) was determined on the Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer by calculating the concentration of CA 19-9 that would give a response equal to the mean of the CA 19-9 Master Low calibrator plus two standard deviations (SD). Three runs of 21 replicates of the Low calibrator were performed. The results were expressed in counts and then converted to $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ using the slope and intercept of the standard curve. The mean counts $+ \ 2 \mathrm { S D }$ were 1486, 1553 and 1530 which were equivalent to $0 . 1 3 \mathrm { ~ U } / \mathrm { m L }$ , $0 . 2 8 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ and $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ . The mean LDL claim is $< 0 . 6 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ .

v. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous substances - Interference was determined by using natural and spiked samples and assayed on the Elecsys 2010. Interfering substances tested include hemoglobin, biotin, intralipid, bilirubin and rheumatoid factor. No significant interference was observed for bilirubin $< 6 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin $< 2 . 2 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , intralipid ${ < } 1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , biotin ${ < } 1 0 0$ $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and rheumatoid factor $\leq 1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

Pharmaceutical compounds – Interference was determined by spiking the following pharmaceutical compounds into natural patient samples and assayed on Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer: acetylcystein (150 $\mathrm { { m g / L ) } }$ , ampicillin $( 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ), ascorbic acid $( 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , ca-dobesilate $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , cyclosporine $( 5 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ ), cefoxitin $( 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , levodopa (20 $\mathrm { { m g / L ) } }$ , methyldopa $( 2 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , metronidazole $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , phenylbutazone $( 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , acetysalicylic acid $( 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , rifampicin $( 6 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , intralipid $( 1 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L ) }$ , acetaminophen $( 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , ibuprofen (500 $\mathrm { m g / L ) }$ , theophyllin $( 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , doxorubicin $( 7 5 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ . cyclophosphamid $( 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { { m g / L ) } }$ , cisplatin $( 2 2 5 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , 5-flourouracil $( 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , methothrexat $( 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , tamoxifen $( 5 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , mitomycin $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , carboplatin ( $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 m g / L ) }$ , etoposid $( 4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ , flutamid $( 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ and taxol $( 5 . 5 \mathrm { m g / L } )$ . No interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) - To assess interference due to HAMA, a sample with known amount of CA 19-9 $( 9 3 . 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L } )$ ) was spiked into serial dilutions of a sample with known HAMA concentration $( 4 5 \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ and known intrinsic concentration of CA 19-9 of $1 1 . 9 5 \mathrm { U / m L }$ At all dilutions, recovery of CA 19-9 was in the range of 100 to $102 \%$ . The same samples were likewise tested with reagents without the HAMA inhibiting proteins and falsely elevated results corresponding to 921.7 $\mathrm { U / m L }$ of CA 19-9 was obtained. Another HAMA positive sample (207 $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ ) tested also gave falsely elevated CA 19-9 concentrations of 747.8 $\mathrm { U } / \mathrm { m L }$ as compared to $1 8 . 5 \mathrm { { U } / \mathrm { { m L } } }$ of the same sample with HAMA inhibiting reagents.

Cross-reactivity - Other tumor antigens (TM) was assessed for potential cross-reactivity by testing CA 19-9 positive serum samples that were spiked with known concentrations of TM. The samples were assayed on the Elecsys 2010 and results were summarized below.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Serial Monitoring Analysis Three hundred ninety-one serum samples from 95 patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer were prospectively collected and banked at two US clinical sites. Samples from six patients were excluded from the statistical analysis. Four patients ((#003, #007, #014 and #026) were excluded because all samples had zero CA 19-9 results on the predicate and test device. These subjects were considered Lewis blood group non-secretors. Two patients $\# 0 0 4$ and $\# 0 4 8$ ) were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Patient $\# 0 0 4$ had primary duodenal cancer with pancreatic involvement and Patient $\# 0 4 8$ was diagnosed with prostate cancer in addition to the primary pancreatic cancer during the study. Of the remaining 89 patients, 74 were Caucasians, 2 African Americans, 9 Hispanics, 1 Asian and 3 others.

At the time of diagnosis, 87 of the 89 patients had stage information: $1 4 . 9 \%$ were Stage I, $2 6 . 4 \%$ Stage II, $2 4 . 1 \%$ Stage III and $3 4 . 5 \%$ stage IV. Metastases were detected in $2 3 . 1 \%$ of Stage I patients, $4 7 . 8 \%$ Stage II, $5 7 . 1 \%$ Stage III and $80 \%$ Stage IV. The average $( \pm \operatorname { S D } )$ length of time in the study was 250 $( \pm 3 3 8 . 8 )$ days ranging from 14 days to 2013 days.

Changes in CA 19-9 concentrations and changes in disease state were analyzed on a per-visit basis. A significant change in CA 19-9 was defined as greater than $1 5 \%$ for both new and predicate devices. The following tables show the association between CA 19-9 concentrations and disease status for the 274 evaluable observation pairs. Concordance results for test and predicate devices are given in tables below. The data in the tables represent “panel” data. Since each subject brings a unique set of visit pairs, the Genmod Procedure of SAS was used to obtain estimates of concordance.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The normal reference range was established by testing serum samples from 403 apparently healthy subjects (200 females and 203 males) collected during routine physician visits from 11 centers. The cohort consisted of 366 Caucasians, 18 African Americans, 16 Hispanics, 2 Asians and 1 Native American. The mean and median age of the cohort was 56.2y (ranged from 40y to 88y) and 54.7y respectively. The female subjects had a mean age of 56y (40y to 88y) and median age of 54.3y whereas the mean age of the male subjects was 56.5y (40y to 88y) and median age 55y. The mean ages between the genders were not statistically different. Overall mean specimen age was 2.23y (ranged from 1.5 to 3.58y) with a median value of 1.91y. Of the 403 specimens, 96 were 3 to 3.58y old. The table below shows the CA 19-9 results analyzed by gender.

In addition to the normal cohort, 456 serum samples from patients with benign conditions (192 females and 264 males) and 456 from patients (232 females and 262 males) with malignant diseases were tested. The benign disease samples were collected from 22 centers and selection was based on presenting symptoms, previous test results or diagnosis. The benign cohort consisted of 399 Caucasians, 48 African Americans, 8 Hispanics and 1 Asians. The overall mean age and median age were 62y (ranged from 40y to 92y) and 63y respectively. The female subjects had a mean age of 61.4y (40y to 88y) and median age of 62y and the mean age of the male subjects was 62.4y (40y to 92y) and median age 63y. Overall mean specimen age was 3.09y (ranged from 1.58 to 5.75y) with a median value of 3.17y. Of the 456 specimens, 383 were older than 3y

The specimens from malignant subjects were from 3 collection sites. The malignant cohort consisted of 383 Caucasians, 33 African Americans, 54 Hispanics, 23 Asians and 1 other. The overall mean age and median age were 60y (ranged from 24y to 86y) and 61y respectively. The female subjects had a mean age of 60 y (24y to 86y) and median age of 61y and the mean age of the male subjects was 61y (25y to 86y) and median age 60y. Overall mean specimen age for the malignant group was 5.81y (ranged from 0.08 to 9.58y) with a median value of 6.5y. The Elecsys CA 19-9 results concentrations for the cohorts are summarized below.
