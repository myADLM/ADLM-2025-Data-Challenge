Substantial Equivalence of Device

This test is substantially equivalent to: Product Name: Direct Bilirubin; Roche, 510(k) K910593 Total Bilirubin: Roche, 510(k) K910591

The Direct Bilirubin LiquiColor test kit is comprised of two reagents, Reagent 1 (R1) and Reagent 2 {o calibrate the test kit, a calibrator is used that has values determined by a similar method.

The Total Bilirubin LiquiColor® test kit is comprised of two reagents, Reagent 1 (R1) and Reagent 2 To calibrate the test kit, a calibrator is used that has values determined by a similar method.

# Intended Use of Device

The Stanbio Direct Bilirubin LiquiColor® and Total Bilinubin LiquiColor test systems are devices intended to measure the leveis of bilirubin (direct and total) in serum and plasma. Measurements of the levels of bilirubin, an organic compound formed during the normal and abnormal destruction of red blood cells, is used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver, hemolytic, hematological, and

# Comparison of Devices

Both methods employ absorbance change as a means for quantitative determination of direct and total bilirubin concentration in serum and plasma. The Stanbio method employs DCA (2,4-Dichloraniline), whereas, the Roche is a diazo-colorimetry method. The change in absorbance correlates with concentration of direct and total bilirubin.

# Performance Data

Substantial equivalency was demonstrated by method comparison by performing correlation studies, linearity, precision studies (intra and inter), interference studies, and sensitivity.
