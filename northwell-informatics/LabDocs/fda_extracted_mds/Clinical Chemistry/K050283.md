Substantial Equivalence of Device

This test is substantially equivalent to:

Product Name:

Creatinine Reagent 510(k) K941837 Roche Diagnostic

Description of Device The Creatinine LiquiColor $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ test kit is comprised of two reagents, Reagent 1 (R1) and Reagent 2. To calibrate the test kit, a calibrator is used that has values determined by a similar method.

Intended Use of Device   
The Stanbio Creatinine LiquiColor $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ test system is a device intended to measure creatinine levels in serum or urine. Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes.

# Comparison of Devices

The Stanbio methods employ absorbance change as a means for quantitative determination of creatinine concentration in serum or urine. The Stanbio method employs an enzymatic test method described below, whereas, the Roche method uses a kinetic modification of the Jaffe reaction.

Red complex

The rate of formation of the red colored complex is measured at ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { n m }$ and is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.

# Performance Data

Substantial equivalency was demonstrated by method comparison to the Roche Diagnostics Creatinine reagent.

# Correlation

Correlation: Serum specimens $( \mathtt { n } = 3 0 )$ were assayed by this method and by another commercial method. Statistical analysis revealed a c orrelation c oefficient (r) of 0.9991, with a regression equation of $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 4 8 1 5 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 5 8 3 1$ .

Correlation: Urine specimens $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 3 7 )$ were assayed by this method and by another commercial method. Statistical analysis revealed a c orrelation c oefficient (r) o f 0.9854, with a regression equation of $\mathbf { y } = \mathbf { 1 } . 0 5 4 5 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 3 6 0 7$ .

Re: k050283 Trade/Device Name: Creatinine LiquiColor® Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1225 Regulation Name: Creatinine test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: JFY Dated: May 2, 2005 Received: May 5, 2005

Dear Mr. Johnson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2-

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
