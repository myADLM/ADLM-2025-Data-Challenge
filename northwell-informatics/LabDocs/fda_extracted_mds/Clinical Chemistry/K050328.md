# Date of Summary Preparation

Revision -March 17, 2005   
Device Identification   
Product Trade Name: Pregnancy-SkreenTM   
Common Name: hCG Liquid Control Urine – Negative hCG Liquid Control Urine - Positive   
Classification: Class I   
Product Code: JJX Single   
Regulation Code: 21 CFR 862.1660

# Description of device

These products are manufactured in a liquid matrix solution prepared with negative human urine, chemicals, and preservatives. The matrix is not known to interfere with any immunoassay procedures including those used in handheld devices. The positive control is spiked in a target range of $2 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U }$ of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin per mL of urine.

# Intended Use

The Pregnancy-SkreenTM controls are intended to validate the performance of qualitative hCG urine procedure: and immunochromatographic devices.

# Devices to which Substantial equivalence is claimed

We conducted a comparison study of the performance of Biochemical Diagnostics' Pregnancy-Skreen'm positive and negative controls with the Biorad Liquichek (k965171, k031231) and qUAntity urine controls. (k042446). The Biorad products are multi-constituent whereas Biochemical Diagnostics' control is a single constituent product designed to monitor the qualitative performance of urinalysis test procedures screening for elevated levels of hCG as an early indicator of pregnancy. The above-mentioned controls were tested on three Hiuman Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) test devices. Included were the Unotech Accutest (k971886), the Quidel Card QS (k972748), and the Quidel Quickvue (k020799). Device LOD's ranged from 20-25 mIU/mL.

# Acceptance Criteria

The negative and positive Pregnancy-SkreenTM controls were tested from date of manufacture to date of expiration on several devices listed above. They were run side by side with the Biorad Liquichek and qUAntity urine controls that contained hCG as one of the multiple constituents. All controls performed as expected with positive controls reading positive and negative controls reading negative.

New lots of material are run against released lots as well as against other existing controls in the market. Aliquots of the master batch are taken and stored at room temperature (18-25° C) and refrigerated at 2-8°C. testing is performed on day one and day 31. Room temperature testing serves as an accelerated test for stability of the new batch and enables QC/QA to check for cloudiness that would occur if the batch is contaminated or not properly preserved. Upon acceptance of the master batch the control is dispensed into vials, sampled according to GMP at the beginning, midle and end of run and tested on hand held devices as previously described. Key customers are periodicaly surveyed regarding performance of this product.

# Note:

We have been forced to discontinue the quantitative testing of hCG because, to the best of our knowledge, it is no longer available from commercial reference laboratories. All quantitative testing is currently done on serum. Urine testing is limited to hand held devices. We feel confident that, considering the screening nature of the pregnancy testing and the wide range of results that constitute a positive result, combined with our testing history and acceptance criteria, we are able to produce a product that is well suited to this market without quantitative confirmation.

# Stability

The urine matrix used in Pregnancy-SkreenT (see description of device) has been used for over eleven years in our DetectabuseTm Liquid Control Urines (k925586). During this period it has proven to impart long-term stability (greater than three years) to all drugs added as wel as to naturally occurring compounds. In order to validate the stability of hCG in this matrix, stability testing was performed over a two year period with a single lot # of each Pregnancy-SkreenTm control. Several other lots of this product were produced and tested from time to time during this period with identical qualitative results (positive or negative) as the long-term test lot. Aliquots of the long term lot of Pregnancy-SkreenTM controls were stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ and at room temperature (18-25° C) and tested as shown in the accompanying chart. Allsupporting data is on file at Biochemical Diagnostics, Inc.

Unopened Shelf Life– Unopened controls, packaged in 5 mL bottles and sampled bi-weekly, were stable for at least 31 days (limit of study) when stored at room temperature ( $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \ : \mathrm { C } )$ and for two years when stored refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$

Opened bottle stability – Opened controls were stable for at least 31 days when stored at room temperature (18-25° C) or refrigerated at 2-8° C (study limited to 31 days). Negatives remained negative and positives remained qualitatively positive. Opened controls packaged in 100 mL bottles and sampled by pouring instead of pipetting were stable for two years when stored at 2-8° C.

# Preservatives

Pregnancy-SkreenTm controls (positive and negative) contain Sodium Azide in a concentration of less than 0.1%, which is below the level required for preparation of MSDS and listing on the bottle or packaging label.
