No traceability indicated.

Chorionic Gonadotropin human is a purchased product which has a known concentration. To produce the positive control a calculation is performed by Biochemical to determine the amount of product needed to spike negative urine to obtain a target range between 200 and $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U }$ and tested by radioimmunoassay. Subsequent testing is performed qualitatively.

New lots of material are run against released lots as well as against other existing controls in the market. Aliquots are stored at room and refrigerator temperature. Testing is performed on day one and day 31. Room temperature samples are used to check for cloudiness that would occur if the batch is contamination or not properly preserved. Upon acceptance of the master batch the control is dispensed into vials and sampled according to GMP.

Stability:

Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The stability is listed below:

Open vial stability is 31 days at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$

Closed vial stability is two years at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ }$ or 31 days at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$
