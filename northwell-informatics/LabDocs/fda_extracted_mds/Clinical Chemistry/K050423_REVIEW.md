4. Panel:

# 75, Clinical Chemistry

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indication for below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

# Pleural Fluid

The Omni (Modular, C, and S) can be used for the measurement of pH in pleural fluid, as long as care is taken to ensure that the specimen to be analyzed is clear of fibrin clots or other debris which may block the sample transport system.

The pH measurement of pleural fluid can be a clinically useful tool in the management of patients with paraneumonic effusions.

Critical Values:

$\mathsf { p H } { \mathsf { > } } 7 . 3$ is measured in uncomplicated paraneumonic effusions. All pleural effusions with a pH of $< 7 . 3$ are referred as complicated paraneumonic effusions; they are exudative in nature.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

Pleural fluid pH on the Roche Omni (Modular, C, and S) is to be used only in the pH range of 7.0 – 7.5

4. Special instrument requirements: For professional use only.

# I. Device Description:

The Omni (Modular, C, and S) pH electrode uses the Sorensen 1909 principle which is based on the measurement of hydrogen ion $( \mathsf { H } ^ { + } )$ concentration. The electrodes consist of a special $\mathsf { H } ^ { + }$ glass membrane and an accompanying Ag/AgCL reference electrode. The pH electrode is a component of an array of Ion Selective electrodes used to measure specific ions in the blood.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): AVL model 995-Hb pH/blood gas analyzer and the CIBA-Corning Model 288 blood gas analyzer.

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k895317, k872888

No guidcance or standard document referenced

L. Test Principle: Ion Selective Electrode (ISE)

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision/Reproducibility was established in the initial submission of the OMNI Modular Analyzer (k990092), the OMNI C Analyzer (k013373) and the Omni S Analyzer (k032311) on whole blood.

Further studies of the Precision/Reproducibility of pleural fluid pH were researched in literature on the predicate device. These findings are referenced in section P. - Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity/assay reportable range was established in the initial submission of the OMNI Modular Analyzer (k990092), the OMNI C Analyzer (k013373) and the Omni S Analyzer (k032311) on whole blood.

Further studies of the Linearity/assay reportable range of pleural fluid pH were researched in literature on the predicate device. These findings are referenced in section P. - Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability, Stability, and Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods) were established in the initial submission of the OMNI Modular Analyzer (k990092), the OMNI C Analyzer (k013373) and the Omni S Analyzer (k032311) on whole blood.

Further studies of the Traceability, Stability, and Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods) of pleural fluid pH were researched in literature on the predicate device. These findings are referenced in section P. - Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information.

# d. Detection limit:

Detection limit was established in the initial submission of the OMNI Modular Analyzer (k990092), the OMNI C Analyzer (k013373) and the Omni S Analyzer (k032311) on whole blood.

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Roche Diagnostics used regression analysis to determine the appropriate range for pleural fluid. The defined specification was a difference of no more than 0.7 pH units. 35 samples were used in the regression analysis. The correlation coefficient between the OMNI and

Roche 995 results was 0.998. The r-square for the linear model was 0.995.

$\Nu { = } 3 5$ $\mathsf { Y } { = } 0 . 8 9 6 \mathsf { x } + 0 . 8$ Correlation 0.998

Values below 7.0 can be expected to show differences greater than 0.7   
variation establishing the functional range of pleural pH as 7.0 – 7.5
