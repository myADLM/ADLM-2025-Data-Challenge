# Device Name:

FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# Common Name:

Blood Glucose Meter and Reagent Test Strips

# Classification:

Glucose Test System Class II per 21 CFR 862.1345

# Predicate Devices:

FreeStyle Blood Glucose Monitoring System, K992684, K000582, K012014,K031260 Precision PCx 2.2.1 Blood Glucose System, K022941

# Description:

The FreeStyle Blood Glucose Monitoring System comprises an electrochemical biosensor glucose reagent test strip, a handheld meter, a quality control solution, a complete Owner's Booklet and a Quick Reference Guide. A lancing device, lancets and a logbook for recording test results are also included with the system.

When the user inserts a test strip, the meter turns on. The user acquires a blood sample (with the test strip in the meter) by picking up the meter and touching the edge of the test strip at the blood target area, filling the chamber on the strip by capillary action. The meter sounds a tone (beeps) to let the user know that the sample chamber is full and the reaction has begun. When the test is complete, the meter displays the glucose reading on its liquid crystal display (LCD).

# Intended Use:

The FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary, venous, arterial and neonatal whole blood samples. The FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the home and in professional settings to monitor blood glucose levels.

# Principle of Operation:

The user obtains a blood sample using a conventional lancing technique on the finger, forearm, upper arm, hand, thigh, calf, or palm. The user inserts a test strip into the meter, which turns the meter on. When the strip is touched to the blood drop, the sample chamber on the strip fills by capillary action in approximately 2 seconds. The blood sample volume required is approximately 0.3 microliters (300 nanoliters), which can be obtained from the finger, forearm, upper arm, hand, thigh, calf, or palm. Test results are displayed in about 15 seconds. The time required to display test results varies depending on the blood glucose concentration (approximately 15 to 45 seconds).

The glucose in the blood sample reacts with the glucose dehydrogenase enzyme to yield gluconolactone, and produces a small electrical current. This current is measured by the FreeStyle meter and displayed as a glucose level.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

The FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, FreeStyleTm Blood Glucose Monitoring System, K992684, K000582, K012014, K03 1260 and the same intended use as the Precision PCx 2.2.1 Blood Glucose System, K022941.

# Performance Studies:

The performances of the FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was studied in the laboratory and in clinical settings by healthcare professionals. The studies demonstrated that healthcare professionals could obtain blood glucose results that are substantially equivalent to a comparative method.

# Conclusion:

Results of laboratory and clinical testing demonstrates that the performance of the FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System when used according to the intended use stated above is acceptable and comparable to the performance to a comparative method. Clinical test results support a determination of substantial equivalence.

Re:k050500 Trade/Device Name: FreeStyle 600 Blood Glucose Monitoring System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: NBW, LFR, JJX Dated: May 24, 2005 Received: May 25, 2005

Dear Ms. Edwards:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of June 27, 2005.

We have reviewed your Section 5 10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2-

This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please   
contact the Office of In Vitro Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0652 Also, please note   
the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part   
807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from   
the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free   
number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
