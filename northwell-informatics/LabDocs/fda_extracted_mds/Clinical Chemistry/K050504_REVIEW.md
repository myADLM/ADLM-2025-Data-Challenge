# I. Device Description:

The VALIDATE® Urine Chemistry Calibration Verification Test Sets are comprised of three separate kits designated as UC1, UC2, and OSMO. Each kit of UC1, UC2 consists of two bottles each of six levels including zero. The OSMO set consists of two bottles each of five levels. All sets are in a human or serum matrix compatible with chemistry systems.

Human source material from which this product has been derived has been tested at the donor level for the Human Immunodeficient Virus (HIV1, HIV2) antibody, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and found to be non-reactive. FDA approved methods have been used to conduct these tests.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None stated

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods)

The test sets, Cat # 701 / 702 / 703, are prepared in a human urine matrix to which analytes of a chemical or biological (human or animal) nature are added along with preservatives, stabilizers, and other excipients. The concentration of the added chemicals or biologicals are subsequently measured on various clinical chemistry analyzer systems using methods designed for measurement of these analytes in human urine. Levels 1 and 5 are prepared so that Level 1 meets the lower limit of the instrument manufacturer's claimed linearity and Level 5 the upper limit. Levels 1 and 5 are assayed in triplicate on the applicable instrument system. When the recovered values meet the acceptance tolerance, admixtures of Levels 1 and 5 are made to create Levels 2, 3 and 4. Levels 2, 3 and 4 are then tested, again in triplicate, to validate that recovery meets the required tolerance. After this testing event, all levels are labeled and filled after which final in process testing (FIPT) is performed, again in triplicate, for all analytes in each level. Each testing event requires each level be assayed in triplicate on the system for which the product is designed.

d. Detection limit Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable
