# 4.0 Description of Device

These products are prepared from human serum with added constituents of human and animal origin, preservatives and stabilizers. These controls are provided in liquid form.

# Statement of Intended Use

Liquichek: Cardiac Markers Plus Control, Cardiac Markers Plus Control LT and Cardiac Markers Plus Control LT Low are intended for use as a quality control serum to monitor the precision of laboratory testing procedures listed in the package insert. These products do not contain sodium azide as a preservative. They contain a broad-spectrum anti-microbial cocktail as preservatives where the concentration of any one ingredient is less than 0.1%. At this low level, these ingredients are not expected to cause a health hazard to the user. And thus, domestic and international regulations do not require this type of information on the vial or box label.

# 7.0 Comparison of the new device with the Predicate Device

Liquichek Cardiac Markers Plus Controls claims substantial equivalence to the Liquichek m Cardiac Markers Contro! LT currently in commercial distribution. The new Liquichek Cardiac Markers Plus Controls contain B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), Creatine Kinase, Total and CReactive Protein (CRP). The current product does not contain these analytes.

Dear Ms. Platt:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclasified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
