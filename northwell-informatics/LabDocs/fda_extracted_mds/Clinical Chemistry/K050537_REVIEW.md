# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced in the submission.

L. Test Principle: NA

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The mean values were derived from replicate analysis. The tests listed in the labeling were performed by the reagent manufacturer and/or independent laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents.

Accelerated stability studies were performed to support shelf life of the product. Real time studies are on-going for the life of the product. The acceptance criterion is defined as T final being $\pm 1 0 \%$ T zero. The results are as follows:

Shelf life stability: 3 years at -20 to $- 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Open vial stability: 20 days at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Not Applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10 including warning statements for biological source material and treat as potential infectious.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
