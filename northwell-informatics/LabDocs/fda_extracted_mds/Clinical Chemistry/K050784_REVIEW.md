N/A

4. Special instrument requirements: Nichols Advantage $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Specialty System (k961142)

# I. Device Description:

Nichols Institute Diagnostics utilizes chemiluminescence acridinium esters as the label in its specialty chemiluminescence system. Acridinium esters emit light upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide and an alkaline solution. Trigger 1 solution contains hydrogen peroxide in dilute acid and the Trigger 2 solution contains dilute sodium hydroxide. The system automatically injects Trigger 1 and 2 solutions into the well of the cuvette, which oxidize the acridinium ester. The oxidized product is in an excited state. The subsequent return to ground state results in emission of light, which is quantified in two (2) seconds and is expressed in relative light units (RLU) by the integrated system luminometer.

The human source material used in the preparation of this product has been found negative for the presence of the antibody to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-I and HIV-II), HCV and HBV by FDA approved methods.

# L. Test Principle:

The aldosterone assay is based upon competitive binding between aldosterone in the sample and acridinium ester labeled aldosterone (labeled aldosterone) for a specific mouse monoclonal antibody to human aldosterone. First, sample is incubated with biotinylated anti-aldosterone monoclonal antibody for 10 minutes at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Next, labeled aldosterone is added to the reaction mixture. In the second incubation, aldosterone from the sample competes with labeled aldosterone for binding to the specific monoclonal antibody. In the third and final 10 minute incubation, streptavidin-coated magnetic particles and assay buffer are added into the reaction mixture. Because of the high affinity between biotin to streptavaidin, biotinylated monoclonal antibody rapidly binds to the streptavidi-coated magnetic particles. The captured complex bound to the magnetic particles is then washed by the system to remove unbound components and labeled aldosterone. The cuvette wells containing the washed magnetic particles are moved into the system luminometer, which automatically adds trigger 1 and 2, initiating the chemiluminescence reaction. The light is expressed as relative light units (RLU). The amount of RLU is proportional to the amount of labeled aldosterone bound to the magnetic particles. The RLU signal when read-off the stored calibration curve is inversely proportional to the aldosterone concentration in the sample.

Recovery:

Three sets of high and a low/normal sample were mixed in 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 ratios and assayed. The recoveries were determined from the undiluted results. The results demonstrate good recovery $( 9 3 - 1 1 0 \% )$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Controls and calibrators were reviewed and previously cleared k032188 and not reviewed with this submission. However the adjusted master curve stable has gone from 5 days to fourteen days. This was confirmed by testing calibrators, controls and pools over a 30 day period. Acceptance criteria is defined as statistically insignificant slope, average change in dose from Day 0 $< 1 0 \%$ and change in the lower or upper $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the slope $< 1 5 \%$ . The controls and pools were within acceptable limits, supporting the claimed stability of 14 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection, LOD) was determined by reading the -2SD response from $\mathrm { n } { = } 2 0$ replicate measurements of the zero standard from the stored master curve from several runs and instruments. The analytical sensitivity for this assay was estimated to be $\leq 1 . 2 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

The functional sensitivity (Limits of Quantification (LOQ)) was determined by detecting the lowest concentration at which an acceptable CV $20 \%$ can be obtained. The functional sensitivity for this assay was estimated to be $3 \mathrm { n g / d L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

The anti-sera for the assay are very specific for aldosterone and demonstrates extremely low cross-reactivity to other steroidal compounds in patient samples. Cross-reactivity in the chart below was calculated on a weight-perweight basis at approximately $50 \%$ binding intercept or less.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The Nichols Advantage Aldosterone assay was compared to a commercially available aldosterone RIA method. 118 24-hour urine samples were assayed by both methods. The range of values observed with the commercial RIA method was $0 . 8 { - } 8 0 . 2 \ \mu \mathrm { g } / 2 4$ hours; and the range of values observed with the Nichols Advantage Aldosterone method was $0 . 4 { - } 6 6 . 7 \mu \mathrm { g } / 2 4$ hours. Passing Bablok regression analysis yielded an equation of $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 2 3 \mathrm { x } { - } 1 . 1 9$ (cid:) $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals of the slope and intercept were 1.2-1.28 and -1.43 to - 0.81, respectively). Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the paired data was $\mathbf { r } =$ 0.96 $9 5 \%$ confidence interval was 0.94-0.97).

Twenty-four urine samples were collected from 80 (41 females and 39 males) apparently healthy normal adults 18 to 78 years of age. None of the females were pregnant, taking birth control pills or on estrogen treatment and none were on any medications. After square root transformation of the data, the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval for normal 24-hour urine aldosterone results was as follows: 0.7(0.4 to 1.2) to 23.0 (18.3 to 28.6) $\mu \mathrm { g } / 2 4$ hours.
