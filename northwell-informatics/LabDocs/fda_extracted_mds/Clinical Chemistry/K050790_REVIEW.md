1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Intra Assay precision was assessed at three levels. Twenty replicates of the same sample within one analytical run were evaluated at three levels. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) in percent were calculated. An intra assay CV of $1 5 \%$ was determined to be acceptable.

Inter assay precision was determined by analyzing duplicates of three different samples in each of ten different runs over ten different occasions. An inter assay CV of $< 1 0 \%$ was determined to be acceptable.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity/calibration curve fit data were generated for a pool that spanned the linear range of the test. Serial dilution sets were prepared using $7 \%$ BSA and made up fresh and assayed with each of three calibrated runs. The results at each level of analyte were averaged and the linear fit was assessed. The linearity claim is based on a percent deviation of $\leq 5 \%$ at the two highest analyte concentrations. The LDH test was found to be linear from 59.7 to 914 IU/L. Linear fit parameters were $y = 1 . 0 0 9 x - 2 4 . 5 8 ~ \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 6 .$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Calibration on the magnetic calibration card was determined by an internal stability study. The initial shelf-life determinations were conducted by accelerated aging studies and backed up with real time aging studies. The shelf life of the magnetic calibration card was conducted after exposure to real shipping conditions and labeled storage conditions. The duration of the testing is $2 5 \%$ beyond the labeled expiration date for an $80 \%$ claim.

d. Detection limit:

The minimum detectable LDH activity with an acceptable level of precision was determined as $1 0 0 \mathsf { I U } / \mathsf { L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Correlation studies were performed comparing the LDH test results generated on the SPOTCHEM EZ SP-4430 analyzer against the results generated from legally marketed tests. The 41 serum samples spanned from 101 to $5 5 3 \mid \Downarrow / \mathsf { L }$ . The regression equation was $y = 0 . 9 5 5 \times$ $+ 2 . 9 4 6$ and $r { = } 0 . 9 9 6 4$ .

b. Matrix comparison:

Correlation studies were performed comparing the LDH test results generated on the SPOTCHEM EZ SP-4430 for the specimen types of serum and whole blood. Eighteen matched samples of serum and whole blood were analyzed. The regression equation for the 18 serum and whole blood samples was $y = 0 . 9 8 3 x + 0 . 0 1 6$ and $r ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 7 7 0$ .
