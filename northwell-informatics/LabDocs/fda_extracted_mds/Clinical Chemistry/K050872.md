# 2) Device name

Proprietary name: Accu-Chek Integra System   
Classification name: Glucose dehydrogenase, glucose test system   
(21 C.F.R.S862.1345)(75LFR)

# 3) Predicate device

We claim substantial equivalence to the current legally marketed AccuChek Compact System (K#031755).

4) Device Description

Instrument Operating Principle -- photometry Reagent Test Principle -- glucose dehydrogenase

# 5) Intended use

The Accu-Chek integra system is designed to quantitatively measure the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood by persons with diabetes or by health care professionals for monitoring glucose in the home or in health care facilities. The device is indicated for professional use and over-the-counter sale.

Professionals may use the test strips to test capilary and venous biood samples; lay use is limited to capillary whole blood testing. Capillary blood samples can be acquired from fingertips, forearm, upper arm, thigh, calf and palm.

# 6) Similarities

The Roche Diagnostics Accu-Chek Integra System is substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed Accu-Chek Compact (predicate) System. The proposed modification is relatively modest in scope. The following is a list of some of the claims and features unaffected by the proposed modification.

# 7) Data demonstrating substantial equivalence

Performance testing on the modified Accu-Chek Integra System demonstrated that the device meets the performance requirements for its intended use. A multi-center performance study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the modified device. The clinical data demonstrates that the performance of the Accu-Chek Integra correlates well with the laboratory plasma glucose reference test method. All predetermined acceptance criteria.were satisfied. The data also demonstrates that the Accu-Chek Integra is substantialy equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Demirtzoglou:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240)276-0484.
