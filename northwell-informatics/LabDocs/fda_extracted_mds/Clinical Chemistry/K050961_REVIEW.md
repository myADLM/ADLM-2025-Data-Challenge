4. Special instrument Requirements: Axis-Shield NycoCard HbA1c test system.

# I. Device Description:

RNA1c Control is for the NycoCard HbA!c reader. The bi-level (abnormal and normal) glycated bovine hemoglobin liquid control contains no human biological material and does not require reconstitution. The control is supplied in two $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ vials and contains beads, buffers, viscosity adjusters and stabilizers.

The bovine blood sourced from US disease-free cattle and this product can be provided with certificate of health from the USDA Veterinary Services.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: N/A   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A   
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method): Assigned ranges for the controls are based on replicate assays of representative samples of the product on multiple instruments and lots. Value assigned by this method were evaluated against replicate assays of representative samples (10 tests for each control type) of the product by participating laboratories using the Axis-Shield NycoCard HbA1c reader. The acceptance criterion is a reading of greater that $9 5 \%$ of values reported within assay limits for both the product and the predicate device. Stability Closed vial stability was conducted and evaluated at $^ { - 2 0 }$ and $5 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } }$ . Evaluation to determine the change from the value at time zero to show less that $10 \%$ change in HbA1c recovery over 12 months when stored at -20 or $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The result for normal was $6 \%$ and for abnormal was $- 5 \%$ . Open vial stability was evaluated by testing percent change of HbA1c in vials stored at $2 { - } 8 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ daily for 30 days. The percent change in HbA1c over 30 days was $- 1 . 4 \%$ and $+ 1 . 8 \%$ for normal and abnormal lots respectively.   
d. Detection limit: N/A   
e. Analytical specificity: N/A   
f. Assay cut-off: N/A

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device: N/A b. Matrix comparison: N/A

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical sensitivity: N/A b. Clinical specificity: N/A c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable): N/A
