# 4. Device Description:

The Nano-Check TM AMI 3 IN 1 Test is a one-step lateral flow immunochromatography assay for the qualitative determination of three cardiac markers simultaneously in serum and heparin plasma.

The test is a single-use, visually read, cassette device in a plastic housing. Membrane strip inside the plastic housing contains immobilized molecules at three test lines and one control line; CK-MB antibody, Myoglobin antibody, streptavidine and goat anti-mouse antibody. Dye pad at the end of the membrane strip contains biotinylated cTnl antibody and gold colloidal particles coupled with CK-MM, cTnl and Myoglobin antibodies. Cutoff level of each marker is $0 . 5 \ : \mathsf { n g } / \mathsf { m } \vert$ 5 ng/ml and $8 0 \ n { \sf g } / { \sf m } |$ for cTnl, CK-MB and Myoglobin respectively.

Device is sealed in pouch with desiccant and provided with instructions for use and disposable sample dropper.

# Test Principle:

The Nano-Check TM AMI 3 IN 1 Test is an immunochromatography assay for the qualitative determination of three biochemical markers (cTnl, CK-MB and Myoglobin) simultaneously in serum and heparin plasma. The membrane strip contains three test lines and one control line; immobilized monoclonal mouse antibody against CK-MB, monoclonal mouse antibody against Myoglobin, streptavidin for biotinylated cTnl antibody, and goat anti-mouse antibody for control line. A dye pad is placed at the end of the membrane containing biotinylated cTnl antibody and gold collidal particles coupled with CK-MM, cTnI and Myoglobin antibodies. When a sample is applied into the sample well, the cardiac makers present in the sample bind to the specific antibodies coupled with gold particles. cTnl in a sample binds to both cTnl specific dye coupled antibody and biotinylated antibody. The immune complexes move along the nitroceluiose membrane through the test lines and bind to their corresponding capture antibodies immobilized on the test line. Unbound immune complexes pass through the test line and are captured by goat anti mouse antibody in the control line.

If the concentration of any of these three markers in the sample is above the cutoff level, red bands appear at the corresponding test lines and the control line. If the concentration of the markers in the sample is lower than the cutoff level, only the colored control line can be seen in the test window.

The control line is an internal control to ensure that an adequate volume of sample has been added. This colored control band rmust always appear at the control line position (Con) for valid test results. A test result is not valid if the colored control line does not appear in the test window.

# 5. Intended Use:

The Nano-Check TmAMI 3 IN 1 Test is a rapid immunoassay for the qualitative determination of Cardiac Troponin I (cTnl), Creatine Kinase MB (CK-MB), and Myoglobin in human serum and plasma specimens at cutoff concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml, 5.0 ng/ml, and 80 ng/ml, respectively, as an aid in the diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

The Nano-Check Tm AMI 3 IN 1 Test is a qualitative assay, which can not monitor the rise and fall of cTnl, CK-MB, and Myoglobin in single testing. Single testing is not recommended for AMI monitoring. Test results should be interpreted by the physician in conjunction with other laboratory test results and patient clinical findings.
