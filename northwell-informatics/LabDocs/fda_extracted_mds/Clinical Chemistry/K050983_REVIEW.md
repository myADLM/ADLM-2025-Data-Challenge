K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): NCCLS EP-14A Evaluation of Matrix Effects

L. Test Principle: N/A

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: N/A   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

The IRMA TRUpoint™ Creatinine Control kit is composed of nonbiological creatine anhydrous, sucrose and dye.

The range and value assignment was based on ANSI ASQ Z1.4 standard and is dependant on lot size. For a lot size of 600, thirteen were tested to determine the range mean. The derived mean and range is fixed according to CAP/HCFA criteria of $+ / - 0 . 0 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $+ / - 1 5 \%$ , whichever is greater. The assigned values are chosen to span the expected medically relevant decision point (approximately $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and to incorporate the upper region of the reportable range (approximately $7 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ).

Closed Container Stability

Closed container stability testing was conducted on 4 lots of each control level. Each lot was stored at different temperatures 4, 10, 22 and $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and analyzed at its 4 week shelf-life. The sponsor reports significant shifts at un-refrigerated temperatures in the mean results. The sponsor recommends refrigeration storage of $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open Container Stability

Open container stability testing was conducted on 3 lots of each control level. Two lots were evaluated through 2 hours and one lot through 3 days. No significant changes in mean or variability were observed and support the sponsors’ claim of 1 hour open container stability.

d. Detection limit: N/A

e. Analytical specificity: N/A

f. Assay cut-off: N/A

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device: N/A b. Matrix comparison: N/A

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical sensitivity: N/A b. Clinical specificity: N/A c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable): N/A

4. Clinical cut-off: N/A

5. Expected values/Reference range: N/A

# N. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
