# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for Use

2. Indication(s) for use:

“The Opiate Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system to detect opiates in human saliva with a cutoff of $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ when testing oral fluid specimen collected with Salivette collector (manufactured by Sarstedt) and diluted with $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of buffer.

The calibrators and controls of the analyte Morphine are prepared with oral fluid buffer so that it can be used to verify and validate the assay. The assay is intended for use in the qualitative determination of methadone drugs. The assay is designed for professional use with a number of automated clinical analyzers.

The Opiate Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.”

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription, professional use only in clinical chemistry laboratories; the assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.

4. Special instrument requirements: Roche Hitachi 717 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer

# I. Device Description:

The device consists of two liquid reagents; an antibody/substrate reagent and an enzyme/drug conjugate. The antibody/substrate reagent contains mouse monoclonal anti-morphine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), NAD, stabilizers, and preservative. The enzyme/drug conjugate contains morphine-labeled glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in buffer with preservatives. Calibrators (3 levels) and controls (2 levels) are based on oral fluid buffer with preservatives and contain varying levels of morphine.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): LZI Opiate EIA OraSure Opiates Intercept Micro-Plate EIA Dade Behring Emit II Plus Opiate Assay

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k020368 k981341 k011289

3. Comparison with predicate:

The device and the predicate devices share a similar intended use. The device uses similar reagents and test principle as the LZI urine assay, and the device is intended for the same matrix as the OraSure assay. The cutoff differs between the assays.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced by the sponsor.

# L. Test Principle:

Enzyme-labeled drug and drug present in the sample compete for limited monoclonal mouse anti-morphine antibody binding sites. Binding of the enzyme-labeled drug inhibits its reaction with the substrate, thereby influencing the rate of absorbance change measured by the instrument. The rate of absorbance change is proportional to the concentration of drug in the sample. Concentrations of controls and unknowns are calculated from the standard curve. Results are read at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The negative, cutoff, and high calibrators and two levels of controls were assayed with the Hitachi 717 analyzer in replicates of 6, twice a day for 10 days. The within-run $\%$ CV ranged from 0.54 to $0 . 7 0 \%$ and the total precision $\% \mathrm { C V }$ ranged from 0.73 to $0 . 8 7 \%$ .

A recovery study showed that the assay correctly identified six spiked samples at approximately $50 \%$ above the cutoff as positive and six spiked samples at approximately $50 \%$ below the cutoff as negative.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability:

A commercially available standard solution is made into a secondary (lower concentration) stock solution. The secondary stock solution is then spiked into the calibrators and controls to the desired concentration. The concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS.

# Stability Studies:

Real time and accelerated studies meet the manufacture’s acceptance criteria and support a claim of 18 months when the product is stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$

Stability of morphine in the Salivette collection device was determined by taking a pool of negative oral fluid samples spiked at three different concentrations and split into three hundred and thirty-three samples. On day one, 10 samples were run to determine the baseline for comparison to subsequent runs. Of the remaining one hundred samples for each concentration half were stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ and the other half were stored frozen at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The study was conducted over 22 days; samples were run on days 1, 2, 5, 8, 14 and 22. The results support the manufacturer’s claim that the sample is stable for 22 days when stored at refrigerator $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ or frozen at -20 $^ \mathrm { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

See the Precision/Reproducibility section above for performance around the stated cutoff concentration.

e. Analytical specificity:

Various morphine-related and -unrelated compounds were tested for crossreactivity with the assay. Test compounds were spiked into drug-free negative oral fluid calibrator matrix and evaluated against the cutoff calibrator. The following table lists the lowest concentration that gave a response equivalent to that of the cutoff calibrator. Cross-reactivity was calculated by dividing the concentration at which the compound yielded a positive result by the designated cut-off concentration.

Potential interference caused by other substances or drugs was evaluated by adding various concentrations of each drug to oral fluid calibrator matrix and testing with the Opiate Oral Fluid Assay: all compounds below gave a response less than the cutoff calibrator at the concentration specified.
