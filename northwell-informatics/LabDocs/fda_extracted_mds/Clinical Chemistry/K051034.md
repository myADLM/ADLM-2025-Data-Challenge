3)Predicate device

We claim substantial equivalence to the currently market CLINITEK 50 Urine Analyzer, manufactured by Bayer Corp. (K960546).

4) Device Description

The URYXXON 200 Urine Analyzer is a reflectance photometer for invitro semi-quantitative reading of Medi-Test Combi 11 urine test strips for the following analytes: blood, urobilinogen,bilirubin,protein,nitrite, ketones,ascorbic acid, glucose,pH, specific gravity and leucocytes.

5) Intended use

In-vitro,semi-quantitative deterimination of urine analytes in clinical laboratories and point-of-use settings.

Dear Mr.March:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28,1976,the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,therefore, market the device,subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling,and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21,Code ofFederal Regulations (CFR),Parts 800 to 895.Inaddition,FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with allthe Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus,permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Ofice of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also,please note the regulation entitled,"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

# Indications for Use

Indications For Use:

The URYXXON@ 200 is a portable reflectance photometer that instrumentally measures the reflectance off a reacted Medi-Test Combi 11 Reagent Strip for Urinalysis. The product is intended for use as an in vitro diagnostic aid using urine specimens for screening for diabetes，metabolic abnormalities, liver diseases，biliary and hepatic obstructions and diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract.

The test provided on Macherey-Nagel Reagent Strips for the determination of specific gravity, leucocytes, glucose, protein,blood,nitrite，pH, ketones,bilirubin,ascorbic acid and urobilinogen and urine color are considered routine urinalysis
