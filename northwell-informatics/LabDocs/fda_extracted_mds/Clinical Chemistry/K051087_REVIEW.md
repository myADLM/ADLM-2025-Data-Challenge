# L. Test Principle:

BUN: Urease specifically hydrolyzes urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia is used by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) to reductively aminate $\alpha { \cdot }$ - ketoglutarate( $\alpha$ -KG), with simultaneous oxidation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The change in absorbance at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ due to the disappearance of NADH is directly proportional to the urea nitrogen concentration in the sample and is measured using a bichromatic (340, 383 nm) rate technique.

$\mathbf { N a } ^ { + } \mathbf { K } ^ { + } \mathbf { C L } ^ { - }$ methods use indirect V-LYTE™ Integrated Multisensor Technology (IMT). There are four electrodes used to measure electrolytes on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ V-LYTE™ system. Three of these electrodes are ion selective for sodium, potassium and chloride. A reference electrode is also incorporated in the multisensor. Diluted sample (1:10 with VLYTE™ Diluent) is positioned in the sensor and $\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ , $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ or Cl- ions establish equilibrium with the electrode surface. A potential is generated proportional to the logarithm of the analyte activity in the sample. The electrical potential generated on a sample is compared to the electrical potential generated on a standard solution, and the concentration of the desired ions is calculated by use of the Nernst equation.

IgG: Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

Pheno: The phenobarbital method is based on a particle enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) technique. The phenobarbital method is a homogenous particle enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) technique which uses a latex particle-phenobarbital reagent (PR) and phenobarbital-specific monoclonal antibody (Ab). Phenobarbital present in the sample competes with the particles for the antibody, thereby decreasing the rate of aggregation. Hence, the rate of aggregation is inversely proportional to the concentration of phenobarbital in the sample. The rate of aggregation is measured using bichromatic turbidimetric readings at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The concentration is determined by means of a mathematical function.

CKMB: The MMB method is a homogenous sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCI™) technology. LOCI™ reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a bead - mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme - biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the mass creatine kinase MB isoenzyme concentration in the sample.

B) Verification – Master Lot recovered values vs. Master Lot assigned values using Atomic absorption analyzer. Commercial Lot - Reagent grade NaCL & KCl weighed into aqueous solutions with buffer & preservative. Two levels (Std. A & Std. B). Verify that the concentration of each level is within acceptable ranges using a Flame Photometer and Cl titrator calibrated with Master Lot solutions. 9 replicates each level Confirm measured concentrations are within specification.

Shelf life same as above, but additional 30 Day Onboard Stability testing where standards are installed on day zero. The V-LYTE™ system is calibrated & 5 Replicates of 3 QC products are assayed. Onboard standards are used for QC testing on Day 31 vs. freshly installed standards. Allowable drift is $< 1 \%$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Except for electrolytes, detection limit is based on the analytical sensitivity represents the lowest concentration of analyte that can be distinguished from zero. This sensitivity is defined as the mean value ( $\mathrm { \Pi } _ { \mathrm { n } } = 2 0$ replicates) plus two standard deviations of a zero level sample. Analytical sensitivity data is included for applicable methods.

$\mathrm { B U N } = 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $\mathrm { I g G } = 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ , Pheno $= 2 . 0$ $\mathrm { g / m L }$ , $\mathrm { C K M B } = 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ Electrolyte detection limit is based on linearity studies.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed using guidance supplied by CLSI/NCCLS, Document EP7-A, "Interference testing in Clinical Chemistry.” Potential Interfering Substances section of product insert sheets for method specific interfering substances summary information.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable
