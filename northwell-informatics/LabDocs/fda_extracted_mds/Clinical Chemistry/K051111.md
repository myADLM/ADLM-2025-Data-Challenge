# 5. Device description

The Sentinel UiBC Liquid described in this 510(k) submission is composed of reagents and standard,packaged and distributed in the same kit.The device is intended to be sold as an in vitro test for professional use.

Serum is added to an alkaline buffer/reductant solution containing a known concentration of iron to saturate the available binding sites on transferin.The iron that remains free after transferrin saturation is reduced to a ferrous state and then complexed by Ferene-S to form a stable complex,of which the color intensity is measured at 580-6o0nm. UiBC is therefore determined by subtracting the quantity of unbound iron from the total added quantity.

# 6. Intended Use

The Sentinel UIBC Liquid (Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity) assay is intended to measure the unsaturated iron-binding capacity in serum. Iron-binding capacity measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of anemia. CFR 862.1415

# 7. Comparison with Predicate Devices

Table 7.1 lists the predicate device for the Sentinel product included in this submission，and provides information on the regulatory status of the predicate device,including the 510(k) number.

# 8. Performance Data

Performance evaluations included sensitivity, intra- and inter-assay precision,linearity and method comparison. In the method comparison study evaluating 60 serum samples, the correlation $( r , y = m x + q )$ ） of the Sentinel UIBC Liquid on the Abbott AEROSET to the predicate device Roche UlBC was 0.9144, $y = 1 . 0 2 4 x + 1 4 . 6 4$

# 9. Conclusion

The performance and safety data presented in this premarket notification support a finding of substantial equivalence between the Sentinel UIBC Liquid and the predicate devices specified in this submission.

Dear Mr. Spada:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28,1976,the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration,listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling,and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
