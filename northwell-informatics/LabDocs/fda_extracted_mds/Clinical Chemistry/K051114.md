# 5. Device description

The Sentinel Ammonia Ultra Diagnostic Assay described in this 510(k) submission is composed by reagent, calibrator and controls,packaged and distributed in different kits.The device is intended to be sold as an in-vitro test for professional use.

The Ammonia UItra is an enzymatic in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of ammonia in human plasma. Ammonia,in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH),combines with $\alpha$ -ketoglutarate and NADH to yield glutamate and $N A \mathsf { D } ^ { + }$ . The decrease in absorbance due to the NADH oxidation,at $3 4 0 \ m m ,$ is proportional to the ammonia concentration in the examined plasma. The reagent contains lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in excess,to rapidly reduce endogenous pyruvate so that it does not interfere with the assay system. The actual concentration of ammonia is determined multiplying the rate of absorbace per the calibration factor obtained during the calibration with the ammonia standard of $5 0 0 ~ \mu \ g / \alpha L$ included in the kit.

To ensure a correct determination during quantification of ammonia samples,a quality control procedure is required. The Ammonia Controls are liquid controls at 3 levels. prepared in bovine albumin matrix,and are used to verify the performance of the Ammonia UItra assay. The value and range assigned to each level is specific for each lot and has been determined in rigorously standardized condition by the calculation of the median obtained in multiple determinations using reagents and standard relative to the Ammonia Ultra.

# 6. Intended Use

The Ammonia UItra is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of Ammonia (NH3)in human plasma on automated system.

Ammonia measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of severe liver disorders such as cirrhosis,hepatitis and Reye's syndrome" CFR 862.1065

The Ammonia Controls are intended as a means of monitoring Sentinel Ammonia Ultra assay method.

The Sentinel's Ammonia reagent and controls and the predicate devices are both used for the determination of ammonia. In addition, they use the same:

Sample type:plasma   
Technology:enzymatic   
Detection method:NADH oxidation   
Calibration:against aqueous standard

However, Ammonia UItra willbe used with the Abbott ARCHITECT $^ { \circ } c 8 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ analyzer, whereas the Trace Ammonia labeling indicates that the product can be used with any automated clinical chemistry analyzer.

# 8. Performance Data

Performance evaluations included sensitivity, intra- and inter-assay imprecision, and method comparison.

# 9.Conclusion

The performance and safety data presented in this premarket notification support a finding of substantial equivalence between the Sentinel Ammonia Ultra Diagnostic Assay and the predicate devices specified in this submission.

Dear Mr. Spada:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28,1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),Parts 800 to 895.In addition, FDA mav publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with allthe Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 80l and 809);and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2-

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classfication for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
