# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Sentinel Iron Liquid is a direct colorimetric in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of Iron without deproteinization in human serum and plasma (heparin salts, only).

Iron (non-heme) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as iron deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis (a disease associated with widespread deposit in the tissues of two iron-containing pigments, hemosiderin and hemofuscin, and characterized by pigmentation of the skin), and chronic renal disease.

# 2. Indication(s) for use:

The Sentinel Iron Liquid is a direct colorimetric in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of Iron without deproteinization in human serum and plasma (heparin salts, only).

Iron (non-heme) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as iron deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis (a disease associated with widespread deposit in the tissues of two iron-containing pigments, hemosiderin and hemofuscin, and characterized by pigmentation of the skin), and chronic renal disease.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements:

Abbott AEROSET and Abbott ARCHITECT c8000

# I. Device Description:

Transferrin is the carrier protein in blood, normally $20 \%$ to $50 \%$ saturated in its two iron-binding sites. This assay determines the amount of iron carried in by transferrin in a serum or plasma sample.

Components of the kit and initial concentration of reactive components:

The reagent pack consists of three solutions. The first is a concentrated acetate buffer, $1 . 4 ~ \mathrm { M }$ , and a $\mathsf { p H }$ of 4.8 containing $4 . 5 ~ \mathrm { M }$ of guanidine hydrochloride and 65 mM thiourea. The second solution contains Ferene-S at concentrations in excess of

$2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ and $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { M }$ ascorbic acid. The iron standard is $1 7 . 9 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ in $\mathrm { F e } ^ { + 3 }$ in an HCl solution, $\mathrm { p H } = 3$ .

# L. Test Principle:

The product under submission is used by laboratory professionals to measure the iron in serum and plasma. Serum or plasma is added to an acidic denaturing buffer that triggers the release of iron from carrier proteins. The released iron is reduced and complexed with an iron-specific chromophore.

# 1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Imprecision was assessed by measuring twenty replicates at two different concentrations, $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { u g / d L }$ and $1 7 3 { \mathrm { ~ u g / d L } }$ , for a total of forty measurements. Inter-assay imprecision was determined by sampling both concentration levels twice a day for 10 days. The Aeroset and Architect tests both demonstrated an intra-assay imprecision of less than $1 . 2 \%$ . Inter-assay imprecision was less than $4 \%$ for the Aeroset test system and less than $2 \%$ for the Architect test system.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The company conducted linearity studies using nineteen different concentrations spanning the entire range of the assay, $5 - 1 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . Each concentration was measured five times over a time course of fourteen days. For both platforms, the observed values of the assay correlated with the expected values with a correlation coefficient for regressions exceeding 0.999. Deviations from theoretical values were randomly distributed and below $4 \%$ CV.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The calibration standard packaged with the assay is traceable to gravimetric preparations made by the company. The company verifies the standard value against a NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standard, SRM 3126a.

Reagent stability was established by real-time performance studies. “Reagent on board” stability was established through real-time measurement on control samples. Stability claims were substantiated by following three separate samples at each of three separate concentrations beyond the claimed shelf or calibration lifetime of the product. Actual measured stability exceeded the stability claimed in the product insert by at least $20 \%$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The company established the lower detection limit of the assay by determining three times the standard deviation of 20 replicate measurements of their zero value. The lower limit of the assay was $5 \mathrm { u M } / \mathrm { d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Not applicable f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The company tested 58 clinical samples in duplicate spanning the clinically relevant concentration range of $4 0 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 6 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ and showed that their device was substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device. The correlation coefficient of the fit on the AEROSET was greater than 0.999 with a slope of 0.9584 and intercept of 2.8900. The correlation coefficient of the fit on the ARCHITECT was greater than 0.998 with a slope of 1.002 and intercept of - 0.401.
