# Device Name

Proprietary name: Elecsys? CA 19-9 CalCheckTM

Common name: CA 19-9 CalCheck

Classification name: Single (specified) analyte controls (assayed and unassayed)

# Predicate device

The Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CA 19-9 CalCheckTM is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ C-Peptide CalCheckTM (K040157).

Device Description

The Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CA 19-9 CalCheckTM is a lyophilized product consisting of CA 19-9 in a buffered human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analytes are spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

# Intended use

Re: k051185 Trade/Device Name: Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck Regulation Number: 21 CFR 866.1660 Regulation Name: Quality control material (assayed and unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I Product Code: JJX Dated:May 6,2005 Received: May 9,2005

Dear Ms Harper:

We have reviewed your Section S10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28,1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments,or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food,Drug,and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device,subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,labeling,and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code ofFederal Regulations,Title21,Parts 800 to 898. Inaddition,FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements,including,but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This leter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to legally marketed predicate device results in a classfication for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
