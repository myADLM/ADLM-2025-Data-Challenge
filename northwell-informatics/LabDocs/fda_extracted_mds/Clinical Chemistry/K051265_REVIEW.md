# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A, CLSI EP7-P and CLSI EP9-A

# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA IMS BNP assay is a fully automated two-site sandwich immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology, which uses two monoclonal antibodies. The first antibody, in Reagent 1 (R1) is a FITC-labeled monoclonal mouse antihuman BNP F(ab’)2 fragment specific to the ring structure of BNP. The second antibody, in Reagent 2 (R2), is an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human antibody specific to the C-terminal portion of BNP. The sandwich complex formed by the analyte and the antibody conjugates are captured by the magnetic particles so that the BNP concentration in the sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity. A direct relationship exists between the amount of BNP present in the patient sample and the amount of relative luminescence counts detected by the system.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Three levels of control were assayed 4 times in 20 runs on 2 systems $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 6 0$ for each sample), over a period of 20 days. The results are presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concentrationpg/mL (pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within-run SDpg/mL (pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within-run% CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total SD pg/mL(pmol/L)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total % CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>71 (20.5)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.83 (0.82)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.89 (0.84)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>716 (206.9)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.47 (3.31)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.65</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13.77 (3.97)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2660 (768.74)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>38.62 (11.16)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>48.47 (14.01)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.8</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity was assessed by mixing plasma samples with high BNP concentration in various proportions with patient samples containing low levels of BNP. When compared to the expected value, the measured (recovered) values of BNP averaged $9 8 . 5 \%$ with a range of 84 to $109 \%$ . The reportable range is ${ < } 4$ to $6 0 0 0 { \mathrm { p g / m L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ADVIA IMS BNP assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using synthetic human BNP (amino acid 77-108). Assigned calibrator doses and ranges for quality control material are traceable to this standardization.

# d. Detection limit:

The Minimum Detectable Concentration (MDC) was determined based on the mean and two times within-run standard deviations of the reaction rate for level one calibrator. The MDC was calculated to be approximately $4 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

The functional sensitivity is defined as the lowest BNP concentration determined at a CV of $20 \%$ . The functional sensitivity was determined to be $1 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

Less than a $10 \%$ change in results was seen in results for specimens with up to $7 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin, $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ triglycerides, $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ cholesterol, $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urea, $2 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ creatinine, $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin, $7 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ albumin and $4 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L \mathrm { I g C } }$ .

A total of 39 commonly used pharmaceutical drugs were added to human plasma-based samples at two times the maximum therapeutic dosage and evaluated for potential interference. The results demonstrated $\leq 1 0 \%$ interference from each drug.

The drug Neseritide is a synthetic form of BNP-32 which is thought to be virtually identical to the endogenous active hormone BNP. The Bayer BNP assays measure Neseritide as BNP. The following statement in the labeling addresses the use of the test with patients receiving Neseritide:

It has been reported that patients with acute decompensated heart failure who are candidates for nesiritide (recombinant BNP) infusion should have a baseline BNP measurement taken prior to initiation of therapy. Measurements taken during infusion are reflective of the dose of nesiritide. Because of the short half-life of BNP (20 minutes), measurements taken 2 hours after the cessation of treatment again reflect the level of endogenous BNP. It has also been reported that following infusion, endogenous BNP levels return to baseline by 1-2 hours and continue to drop at 6 hours to about $80 \%$ of preinfusion levels, suggesting a resetting of the neuro-hormonal axis and improvement in ventricular wall tension as a result of treatment. The ADVIA Centaur and ACS:180 BNP assays are not approved for nesiritide monitoring.

f. Assay cut-off: See clinical cutoff below

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the ADVIA IMS System to the ADVIA Centaur System using plasma samples. The correlation is as follows: BNP $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 0 \mathrm { x } + 4 . 3 7$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 2$ , $\mathtt { n } = 3 6 0$ , range $4 { \cdot } 4 5 3 1 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$

b. Matrix comparison:

This test has been evaluated with plasma using EDTA as the anticoagulant. Serum, sodium citrate, lithium heparin and sodium fluoride sample tubes have been tested and are not recommended.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Clinical studies were performed using the ADVIA Centaur BNP in k031038 and will be included in the labeling for the ADVIA IMS BNP. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the ADVIA Centaur BNP assay using a decision threshold of $1 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for various age groups within each gender is presented in the following tables:

b. Clinical specificity:

see clinical sensitivity above

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

# 4. Clinical cut-off:

The decision threshold for diagnosing heart failure was determined based on the BNP level at the 95th percentile of the Reference Group. The most appropriate decision threshold for diagnosing heart failure apparent from these distributions is $1 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . This BNP value translates into a general specificity of the test of greater than $9 7 \%$ .

The decision threshold for predicting survival and future heart failure in patients with acute coronary syndromes is $8 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

Prognostic Utility in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes:

Two independent retrospective studies have demonstrated the prognostic utility of BNP. In the first study, BNP was assayed on 438 patients with myocardial infarction (MI) from the ENTIRE-TIMI 23 multi-national trial. The baseline BNP level was significantly higher in patients who died within 30 days $\mathrm { \Delta } [ { \mathfrak { n } } ^ { = 1 5 }$ , 89 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ ; 25th-75th, $4 0 { \cdot } 1 9 2 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ) compared to survivors $\mathtt { n } = 4 2 3$ , $1 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ; 25th-75th, $8 . 8 { - } 3 2 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , $\mathrm { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ). BNP levels greater than $8 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ were associated with a substantially higher risk of death through 30 days of follow-up ( $1 7 . 4 \%$ vs. $1 . 8 \%$ , $\mathrm { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1 $ ). The odds ratio for death within 30 days for patients with BNP levels greater than $8 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ was 11.5. The odds ratio for death within 30 days for patients with BNP levels greater than $8 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , adjusted for age, history of hypertension, and prior angina, was 8.3 with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of 2.7 to 25.8. Patients with elevated BNP levels also had an increased risk of composite end points for death and heart failure combined $( 2 3 . 9 \%$ vs. $5 . 1 \%$ , $\mathrm { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ). The odds ratio for death or heart failure within 30 days for patients with BNP levels greater than $8 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ was 5.8. The odds ratio for death or heart failure within 30 days for patients with BNP levels greater than $8 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , adjusted for age, history of heart failure, history of hypertension, and prior angina, was 3.6 with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of 1.5 to 8.8. Elevated levels of BNP at initial presentation are associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with MI.

Another study was performed on 2525 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Patients with a BNP level of more than $8 0 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ were significantly more likely to die, have a new recurrent infarction, or have new or progressive heart failure than those with a level of $8 0 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ or less. After adjustment for other independent predictors of the long-term risk of death, a BNP level of more than $8 0 \mathrm { p g / m l }$ remained significantly associated with an increased 10-month mortality rate $\mathrm { { P } = 0 . 0 4 ) }$ ).

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected results for the ADVIA Centaur BNP assay were previously established in $\mathrm { k } 0 3 1 0 3 8$ and will be included in the labeling for the ADVIA IMS BNP. The circulating BNP concentration was determined from 1521 individuals without heart failure (785 women and 736 men). This population included

apparently healthy individuals and individuals with hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The descriptive statistics for BNP concentrations in the population without heart failure are shown in the following tables. These values are representative of the results obtained from clinical studies. Clinical studies indicate that BNP levels increase with age in the general population with the highest values seen in individuals greater than 75 years of age. In this subgroup of patients, age needs to be taken into consideration for accurate interpretation of test results.

# Patients with Heart Failure

To establish the expected results for the ADVIA Centaur BNP assay in individuals with heart failure, plasma samples were obtained from 722 patients diagnosed with heart failure (264 women and $4 5 8 \mathrm { ~ m e n } ,$ ). The descriptive statistics for BNP concentrations in patients with heart failure are presented in the following tables. These values are representative of the results obtained from clinical studies. In addition, laboratories should be aware of their respective institution’s current practice for the evaluation of heart failure.
