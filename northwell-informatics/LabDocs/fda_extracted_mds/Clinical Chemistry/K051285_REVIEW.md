The GLUCOLAB™ Diabetes Monitoring System is used for the quantitative measurement of glucose level in whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management in the home and in clinical settings, including physician’s office laboratories and point of care sites. The GLUCOLAB™ System provides plasma-equivalent results. The GLUCOLAB™ System is not intended to be used with neonatal blood samples. The GLUCOLAB™ System is for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). Testing sites include the traditional fingertip testing along with alternate site testing on the forearm, upper arm, palm, calf and thigh.

GlucoLab™ control is used with GlucoLab™ Brand System to check that the meter and test strips are working together as a system and that you are performing the test correctly. It is very important that you do control solution tests routinely to make sure you are getting accurate results. Control Solutions are sold separately.

3. Special condition for use statement(s):

Provides plasma equivalent results.

For over-the-counter or professional use

Not for use in neonates

Patients should not test on the forearm, upper arm, palm, calf or thigh when they think their blood glucose is rapidly falling, such as within two hours of exercise or a rapid-acting insulin injection or insulin pump bolus. Testing with a fingertip sample may identify a hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) level sooner than a test with a forearm or palm sample.

Patients should not test on the forearm, upper arm, palm, calf or thigh when it has been less than two hours after a meal, a rapid-acting insulin injection or insulin pump bolus, physical exercise, or they think their glucose level is changing rapidly.

Patients should not test on the forearm, upper arm, palm, calf or thigh when they are concerned about the possibility of hypoglycemia.

# L. Test Principle:

The Test Principle used by this device is electrochemical biosensor technology using Glucose Oxidase. The strip uses the enzyme Glucose Oxidase to produce an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by the GlucoLab™ meter and displayed as a blood glucose result.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor indicated precision studies were assessed by taking 4mL of blood that was treated with EDTA drawn in a vacuum tube. Glucose was added to the $4 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood to generate 5 different levels of glucose concentrations for the test. Each of the samples was measured 5 times for precision.

# Day-to-Day precision also known as Between Day Precision

The sponsor prepared three control solutions of Low, Normal and High. Each of the controls was measured twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon for a month.

Table 1 (below) shows a summary of the Within-Run Precision and the Day-to-Day Precision Tests.

This study showed variability from strip to strip in blood tests of 3.8 $\%$ or less and from day to day in control tests of $3 . 9 \%$ or less.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Test Procedure (Dilution Schemes)

The claimed detection range for the GlucoLab Blood Glucose Monitoring System is $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ m g / d L }$ . The linearity study presented in this submission that utilizes NCCLS EP6-A with the recommended dilution schemes did not challenge the lower (10-40 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ or upper $( 5 5 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ claimed detection range. So the sponsor performed two additional studies of 30 different paired samples that compared the GlucoLab at the $\scriptstyle 1 0 - 4 0 \log / \mathrm { d L }$ range and the $5 5 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ range to the YSI analyzer (reference). In the first study the glucose range tested was $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 3 9 \ m g / d L }$ with the following correlation:

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { \mathbf y } = 0 . 9 7 7 9 \mathbf x + 0 . 4 2 9 6 } \\ { { \mathbf R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 6 9 } \\ { { \mathbf n } = 3 0 } \end{array}
$$

In the second study the glucose range tested was $5 5 0 { - } 5 9 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ with the following correlation:

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { \mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 7 9 1 \mathbf { x } + 1 5 . 1 6 } } \\ { { \mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 7 4 } } \\ { { \mathbf { n } = 3 0 } } \end{array}
$$

The NCCLS EP6-P2 recommends dilution schemes to estimate the linearity of the Quantitative Analytical Method.

According to the NCCLS EP6-P2 protocol, a blood sample of $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ was taken, treated with the EDTA in a vacuum tube, and let set for a day. Two glucose concentrations of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ (high and low concentrations) were prepared. As a measuring tool, nine glucose concentrations were prepared using the following dilution schemes (see Table 2).

Table 2: Levels of Dilution Schemes

<table><tr><td colspan="2"> S=9 Samples</td></tr><tr><td>Level 1(Low, L)</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>0.875L + 0.125H</td></tr><tr><td>Level 3</td><td>0.750L + 0.250H</td></tr><tr><td>Level 4</td><td>0.625L + 0.375H</td></tr><tr><td>Level 5</td><td>0.500L + 0.500H</td></tr><tr><td>Level 6</td><td>0.375L + 0.625H</td></tr><tr><td>Level 7</td><td>0.250L + 0.750H</td></tr><tr><td>Level 8</td><td>0.125L + 0.875H</td></tr><tr><td>Level 9(High, H) 1</td><td>H</td></tr></table>

The meter used in this test can display below $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and over $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for checking linear range.

Each of the glucose levels was measured 5 times to test for precision. In order to evaluate the straight line for the Sensory Strip that was used, the following formula was used:

All dilution schemes start with a high and low concentration samples in which the concentrations meet or exceed the range of interest. For the test, the highest and lowest glucose concentration used was $6 6 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\mathrm { 8 m g / d L }$ . If a strip sensor has an ideal linearity $( \mathrm { r } 2 { = } 1 )$ ) from Lowest to highest concentration, the ideal concentration of level 2 mixed with 0.875L and 0.125H volume ratio is a $9 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ [ $( 0 . 8 7 5 ^ { * } 3 7 . 4 +$ $0 . 1 2 5 ^ { * } 5 3 0 . 2 ) / ( 0 . 8 7 5 + 0 . 1 2 5 ) ]$ .

Table 3, below, shows a summary of the nine dilutions that were measured five times for precision.

It has been determined that the polynomial evaluation of linearity assumes that the data set is not linear. This approach assumes that the data points fall perfectly on a line or curve in the absence of random error. The method consists of two parts. The first part examines whether a nonlinear polynomial fits the data better than a linear one. The second part assesses whether the difference between the best-fitting nonlinear and linear polynomial is less than the amount of allowable bias for the method, which should be predefined.

The nonlinear $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ fits the data better than a linear one, but the difference is lower than 4.3   
$\mathrm { m g / d L }$ from $8 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $6 6 1 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The R2 of $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ order regression is a 0.9988

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

Traceability referenced to NBS, NIST Standards

Users are directed to use the control solutions before the expiration date printed on the bottle. The controls are stable for three months after opened.

d. Detection limit:

Reportable range $= 1 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ 1.7 to $3 3 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ See linearity study above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was conducted to determine the effect of select endogenous and exogenous substances.

# Hematocrit Study

In this study, approximately $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of blood was taken from 64 random diabetic individuals. The blood samples were treated with the EDTA vacuum tube and the glucose concentration was adjusted to approximately $5 0 - 5 8 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ by adding an adequate amount of the phosphate buffer $2 0 \mathrm { m M }$ with $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 4 )$ that contains a different level of glucose. In order to adjust the Hematocrit value $( 3 0 \sim 5 5 \% )$ ), a proper volume of the centrifuged plasma (serum) was removed.

The Hematocrit level and glucose concentration in the blood was assessed by using the Nova Stat Profile M and the YSI2300 STAT (respectively).

Figure 2: Blood glucose conc. Vs Hematocrit $\%$

The $\%$ bias of the assay value of the GlucoLab™ system is relative to the YSI and does not have a negative or positive correlation to hematocrit level in this experiment. $9 8 \%$ of the data is within $+ / - 2 0 \%$ bias and $8 6 \%$ lies within $+ / - 1 0 \%$ in the overall range of glucose and hematocrit.

The potential interference of various exogenous and endogenous substances was tested by spiking the levels listed below in Table 5 into non-spiked control samples. The results were compared and the $\%$ error was calculated for the highest level tested.

The sponsor states that high test concentrations were referenced to NCCLS Document EP7-P.

The sponsor states that:

Acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and other reducing substances (when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic concentrations) do not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high concentrations in blood may cause inaccurately high results.   
• Cholesterol up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or triglycerides up to $2 8 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ do not significantly affect the results. Glucose values, however, in specimens beyond these levels should be interpreted with caution.   
• Blood samples that contain a high concentration of dissolved oxygen may lower the test result.   
• Tolazamide or Gentistic acid treatment may increase the test result. Antiglycolytic agents and anticoagulants in blood samples may affect the test results.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The method comparison to the predicate device was assessed with One hundred sixty subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes during a normally scheduled clinic visits. In the study protocol, both the lay user and a trained technician obtained fingerstick

glucose readings on the GlucoLab™ and ONETOUCH ULTRA, as well as alternate site glucose testing on the forearm, palm, upper arm, thigh and calf using both the GlucoLab™, and ONETOUCH ULTRA meters. No effort was made to determine whether patients were in the steady state or had rapidly changing blood glucose concentrations.

The readings were taken as close in time as possible. Within 5 minutes, a venous whole blood sample was drawn and centrifuged for making serum. The serum sample was tested by Hitachi 747. The sponsor indicated that during the comparison studies, alternate sites were vigorously rubbed by the lay user and trained technician before testing, and in some cases a warming pad was used.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical sensitivity: Not Applicable b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a and b are not applicable):

The accuracy of the GlucoLab™ System was assessed by comparing blood glucose results obtained by patients with those obtained using the Hitachi 747, a laboratory instrument. Glucose levels were measured on 410 fresh capillary blood specimens by 104 diabetic patients and three healthcare professionals at three different clinical centers.

The correlation between Hitachi 747 and GlucoLab™ were confirmed in the blood samples with correlation coefficients of $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 8 4 0$ (healthcare professionals) and $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 8 3 0$ (lay users) (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively). Results indicate that the use of the GlucoLab™ generate results similar to the Hitachi 747.
