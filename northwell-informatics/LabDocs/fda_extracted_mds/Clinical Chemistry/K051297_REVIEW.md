# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI Document EP5-A, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices

# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys N-MID Osteocalcin Assay is a two step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was determined using Elecsys reagents on the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer, pooled human sera, and controls in a modified CLSI replication experiment. Six replicates of each control or sample (pooled human sera) were tested per day for 10 days. Within-run and total precision were calculated according to EP5-A.

The mean values for the three sera were $1 5 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $1 3 . 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and 68.3 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The mean values for the three controls were $2 1 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , 105.7 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $2 0 5 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The within-run precision yielded CVs ranging from $1 . 2 \%$ to $4 . 0 \%$ . The total precision yielded CVs ranging from $1 . 7 \%$ to $6 . 5 \%$ .

Precision was also determined using the Elecsys E170 analyzer. The mean values for the sera were $6 . 9 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , $2 4 . 8 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , and $7 6 . 4 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The mean values for the controls were $2 2 . 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $9 4 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $1 9 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The within-run precision $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 1 )$ ) yielded CVs ranging from $0 . 5 \%$ to $1 . 1 \%$ . The total precision yielded CVs ranging from $1 . 1 \%$ to $1 . 6 \%$ .

Precision data on Elecsys 1010 are maintained on file at Roche.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ N-MID Osteocalcin Assay was evaluated on the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer by diluting three patient samples with varying amounts of the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Universal Diluent.

The expected values were generated using the concentrations measured in the diluent and the undiluted sample and then applying the dilution factors. The percent recovery was determined by dividing the measured concentration with the expected concentration. Three serum samples $( 3 4 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , $1 3 5 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ , and $2 1 1 . 7 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) yielded recoveries ranging from $9 1 . 3 \%$ to $1 0 2 . 1 \%$ .

Two additional dilution studies were performed to support linearity between 212 and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ , the upper limit of the measuring range. The $2 6 5 . 6 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and $2 7 7 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ samples yielded recoveries ranging from $9 1 . 8 \%$ to $1 0 5 . 3 \%$ .

To assess hook effect, a sample was spiked with osteocalcin to a concentration of $4 2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ diluted using Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Universal Diluent, and tested. No high-dose hook effect was observed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Elecsys Osteocalcin assay has been standardized against in-house reference standards: osteocalcin in analyte-free human serum matrix.

The CalSet and CalCheck were prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown by FDA-approved methods to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV.

Values are assigned using four Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 Immunoassay Analyzers, four Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2010 Immunoassay Analyzers, and four Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 1010 Immunoassay Analyzers. Two independent series of analyses are performed on each instrument. Two-fold determinations are made for each sample. The target value is then calculated as the median of the determined values.

Accelerated stability data ( $3 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ for 3 weeks) and reconstituted stability data were provided to support insert claims for Osteocalcin CalSet. The acceptance criterion for each study was based on signal recovery of $9 5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 5 \%$ of the reference value.

Accelerated stability data ( $3 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ for 3 weeks) and reconstituted stability data were also provided to support insert claims for Osteocalcin CalCheck. The acceptance criterion for each study was recovery of $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of the reference value.

d. Detection limit:

The lower detection limit of the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ N-MID Osteocalcin Assay (0.500 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ was determined on the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer by calculating the concentration of osteocalcin that would give a response equal to the mean of the Osteocalcin Master Low calibrator plus two standard deviations. Three runs of twenty-one replicates each of the low calibrator were performed. The calculated mean LDL for the three runs was 0.21 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To evaluate potential assay interference from endogenous substances, three samples spiked with different amounts of an interferent (one interferent per sample) were evaluated. Also, each of three samples with high rheumatoid factor concentrations were diluted with one human sample and evaluated.

No interference (based on acceptable recoveries) was observed for the following substances: biotin up to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ (osteocalcin $7 3 . 8 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ), lipids up to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (osteocalcin $2 7 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ), bilirubin up to $6 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (osteocalcin $3 9 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ), and rheumatoid factor up to $2 2 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ (osteocalcin $2 0 . 0 { - } 2 5 2 . 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ).

Various pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into a sample with osteocalcin concentration of approximately $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and tested by the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ N-MID Osteocalcin on the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer. Each of the compounds were found to be non-interfering.

The specificity of the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ N-MID Osteocalcin Assay was determined on the Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer using samples spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds. No cross-reactivity was observed with $\beta$ - Cross Laps at $1 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and bone alkaline phosphatase at $1 4 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ . Parathyroid hormone at $3 9 1 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ exhibited $5 . 4 \%$ cross-reactivity.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison of Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ N-MID Osteocalcin with a commercially available N-MID Osteocalcin test using 48 clinical samples (from 39 postmenopausal women and 9 men) gave the following correlations $( \mathrm { n g / m L } )$ : $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 3 0 7 \mathrm { x } + 2 . 0$ , $\Gamma = 0 . 9 6 6$ , $\mathrm { m d } ( 6 8 ) = 0 . 8 1 6$ . Sample concentrations ranged between approximately 2.58 and $4 9 . 7 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

b. Matrix comparison:

Twenty-five samples each drawn into serum, $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 }$ -EDTA, and Li-Heparin plasma vacutainer tubes were compared to determine potential effects. Passing/Bablok and Least Squares were calculated, and the method comparison was found to be acceptable. Both the EDTA and heparin samples, when compared to serum, yielded slopes between 0.9-1.1.

3. Clinical studies:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ N-MID Osteocalcin (run on the Elecsys 2010) and a commercially available N-MID Osteocalcin were used to measure retrospective samples from 57 postmenopausal subjects participating in a clinical study involving two Calcitonin treatments over six months. Samples were taken from patients at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24, yielding a total of 228 samples measured.

Sample concentrations ranged between approximately 9.19 and $9 3 . 3 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ on the subject device. Passing/Bablok linear regression results were as follows: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 1 2 0 \mathrm { x } + 4 . 4$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 2 2$ , $\bmod { ( 6 8 ) } = 1 . 3 3 7$ .
