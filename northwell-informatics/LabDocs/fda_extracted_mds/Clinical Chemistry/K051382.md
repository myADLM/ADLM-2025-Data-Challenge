# Device Name

Proprietary name:Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ proBNP Immunoassay

Common name: proBNP test

Classification name: Test, Natriuretic Peptide

# Description

A device for the measurement of human proBNP in serum or plasma.

# Intended use

Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of N-terminal proBrain Natriuretic Peptide in human serum and plasma.

# Indications for Use

Elecsys proBNP is used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals suspected of having congestive heart failure. The test is further indicated for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome or congestive heart failure. The test may also serve as an aid in the assessment of increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at risk for heart failure who have stable coronary artery disease.

# Substantial equivalence

The device and test method contained within this premarket notification and described in the labeling is substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in the United States.We claim equivalence to the Roche Elecsys proBNP (K032646).

Dear Dr. Ambrose:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28,1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,labeling,and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),Parts 800 to 895. In addition,FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with allthe Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 80l and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
