# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ proBNP Immunoassay is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). The test uses the sandwich principle. In the first incubation, antibody from the sample, biotinylated polyclonal NT-proBNP-specific antibody and polyclonal NT-proBNP-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex form a sandwich complex. In the second incubation, after addition of streptavidin labeled microparticles, the complex produced is bound to the solid phase via biotinstreptavidin interaction. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve. This curve is instrument-specifically generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
