ldentification of Device:   
Device Name: CK-MB Test   
Proprietary/Trade Name: i-STAT? CK-MB Test   
Common Name: CK-MB, Creatine Kinase MB Isoenzymes   
Device Classification: Il   
Regulation Number: 21 CFRs 862.1215   
Panel: Biosensor, Immunoassay, Cpk Or lsoenzymes   
Product Code:MYT

ldentification of the Predicate Device:

Device Name: CK-MB test, Triage Cardiac Panel for use on the Triage Meter.

# Intended Use of the Device:

The i-STAT CK-MB test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of creatine kinase MB in whole blood or plasma samples. CK-MB measurements can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (Ml).

The cartridge is to be used with the i-STAT 1 Analyzer bearing the (lmmuno) symbol,but not with the i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyzer or the Philips Medical Systems (formerly Agilent Technologies) Blood Analysis Module (BAM).As part of the i-STAT System,the CK-MB test is to be used by trained health care professionals in accordance with a facility's policies and procedures.

# Description of the Device:

The i-STAT CK-MB test is contained in a single-use test cartridge. In use,the user scans a bar code and then places approximately 16 uL of whole blood or plasma in the cartridge.After the cartridge isclosed,it is inserted into the thermallycontrolled i-STAT1Analyzer,andallanalytical steps are performed automatically.Patient and use information may be entered into the analyzer via a keypad during the automated analysis cycle.

As the analyzer performs several quality checks and controls the temperature of the sensors via resistive heating to the underside of the sensor chips, the substrate/wash fluid is released into a conduit within the cartridge and a metered volume of the sample over the sensor chips. The enzyme-linked antibody conjugate dissolves into the sample and the sample incubates for a controlled time. The sample is then pushed into a waste chamber and the substrate/wash solution is brought over the sensors.The alkaline phosphatase captured on the CK-MB sensor cleaves the substrate present in the substrate/wash fluid, giving rise to an amperometric signal which is measured.

# Summary of Non-Clinical Performance in Support of Substantial Equivalence:

Studies established that the i-STAT CK-MB test is insensitive to hematocrit levels from 0 to $7 0 \% \mathsf { P C V }$   
The CK-MB assay is not significantly influenced by the presence of CK-BB at $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or . CK-MM at $1 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$   
Studies established that the interference efects from common medications, particularly those commonly prescribed to patients with cardiovascular conditions,were similar to the efects for those drugs on CK-MB of the Triage Cardiac Panel.   
Studies established that the lower limit of detection (LLD) for the i-STAT method is a comparable $0 . 6 \ : \mathsf { n g / m L }$ versus $1 . 0 n g / m L$ for the CK-MB of the Triage Cardiac Panel. The imprecision of the i-STAT CK-MB test using plasma controls was established using inhouse and user studies. The Level 1 control $\% 0 v$ was $1 1 . 9 \%$ at $5 . 9 n g / m L$ ,the Level 2 control $\% 0 \%$ was $10 . 4 \%$ at $2 5 . 8 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and the Level 3 control $\% 0 v$ was $1 0 . 0 \%$ at 90.1 ng/mL.This includes within-lot,lot-to-lot,vial-to-vial,analyzer-to-analyzerandoperator-tooperator components of the imprecision.

Summary of Clinical Test Performance is Support of Substantial Equivalence Claims: Studies conducted at clinical sites compared the results of the i-STAT CK-MB test to those of the CK-MB test on the Triage Cardiac Panel for samples from patients who presented to the hospital with chest pain. Heparinized whole blood and plasma samples were analyzed on the i-STAT System while plasma samples were analyzed on the Abbot AxSYM. The methods were compared using Deming regression analysis.The results are summarized in the table below:

# Conclusions:

Based on clinical and non-clinical data the i-STAT CK-MB test is insensitive to hematocrit level from $0 - 7 0 \% \mathsf { P C V }$ is not significantly influenced by the presence of other CK isoforms,shows similar interference efects to common drugs as the CK-MB test on the Triage Cardiac Panel, and has a lower limit of detection (LLD) of $0 . 6 \ : \mathrm { n g / m L }$ than the CK-MB test on the Triage Cardiac Panel.Studies using plasma controls indicateadequate imprecision for low, mid-range,and high results. Clinical data indicates acceptable corelation to the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Zelin:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28,1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21,Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),Parts 800 to 895.In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
