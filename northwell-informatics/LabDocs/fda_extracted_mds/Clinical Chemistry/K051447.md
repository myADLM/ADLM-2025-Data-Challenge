# Test Description:

The Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of pancreatic amylase in serum or plasma. The Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is a two-reagent format that is carried out in two successive steps. In the first incubation step, the activity of the human salivary alpha-amylase is inhibited using two different monoclonal antibodies with no effect on the pancreatic alpha-amylase. In the second reaction step,the pancreatic alpha-amylase catalyses the hydrolysis of the EPS substrate (Ethylidene Protected Substrate) $\mathfrak { p }$ -nitrophenyl-maltoheptaoside 4,6- ethylidene-blocked (Ethylidene-G7PNP) forming 2 ethylidene- $\mathrm { \bf G } 4 + 2 \mathrm { \bf G } 3 \mathrm { \bf p } \mathrm { \bf N P } +$ ethylidene- $\mathrm { G 3 + G 4 P N P }$ The $\alpha$ -glycosidase hydrolyses allfragments of G2PNP, G3PNP,and G4PNP into $\mathbf { p }$ -nitro phenol (PNP) and glucose (G). The increase of

absorbance, due to PNP formation, is proportional to the activity of pancreatic alphaamylase in the examined sample.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is substantially equivalent to the Roche Pancreatic Amylase assay (K895880) on the Roche analyzer. These assays yield similar Performance Characteristics.

# Similarities:

Both assays are in vitro clinical chemistry methods.   
Both assays can be used for the quantitative determination of pancreatic amylase.   
·Both assays yield similar clinical results.

# Differences:

There is a difference between the assay ranges.

# Intended Use:

The Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is used for the quantitation of pancreatic amylase in serum or plasma.

# Performance Characteristics:

Comparative performance studies were conducted using the AEROSET and ARCHITECT? $c 8 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ analyzers.

Method comparison studies of the Pancreatic Amylase on the AEROSET analyzer yielded acceptable correlation with the Roche Pancreatic Amylase assay on the Hitachi 911 Analyzer. The correlation coefficient $= 0 . 9 9 9 4$ ,slope $= 0 . 9 6 5$ ,and Y-intercept $= 3 . 8 4 3$ . Samples ranged from 5 to $2 4 2 8 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$

Method comparison studies of the Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase on the ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer yielded acceptable correlation with the Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase on the AEROSET analyzer. The correlation coefficient = 0.9998, slope = 1.011,and Y-intercept $= - 0 . 7 9 6$ . Samples ranged from 4 to $2 2 9 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$

Precision studies were conducted using the Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase. Within-run, between-run, and between-day studies were performed on the AEROSET analyzer using three levels of control material. The total %CV for Level 1 is 3.99%,Level 2 is 1.64%,and Level 3 is 1.11%. Within-run, between-run, and between-day studies were performed on the ARCHITECT c800O analyzer using two levels of control material. The total %CV for Level 1 is 1.50% and Level 2 is 0.60%.

The Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is linear up to 22O0 U/L. The limit of detection (sensitivity) of the Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is $1 \ \mathrm { U / L }$ ，

These data demonstrate that the performance of the Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is substantially equivalent to the performance of the Roche Pancreatic Amylase assay on the Hitachi 911 analyzer.

# Conclusion:

The Sentinel Pancreatic Amylase is substantially equivalent to the Roche Pancreatic Amylase assay on the Roche analyzer as demonstrated by results obtained in the studies.

Dear: Mr. Spada

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28,1976,the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling,and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),Parts 800 to 895. In addition,FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your dcvice complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
