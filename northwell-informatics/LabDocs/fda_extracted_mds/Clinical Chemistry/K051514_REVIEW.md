# I. Device Description:

The Advance Micro-Draw Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a hand-held blood glucose meter, test strips, and control materials. Each lot of test strips has a code chip containing lot-specific calibration information that the machine reads automatically. The meter is turned on by strip insertion; the user then supplies fingertip blood or control solution to the strip and the meter starts the assay, which completes in 15 seconds. The meter’s software converts the results read off the test strip into a plasma glucose concentration and displays the value on the meter’s LCD screen.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

This submission covers modifications to the glucose meter. The original meter and the control materials were previously cleared under k020232 as the Hypoguard Advance. A strip modification was cleared under k031388. An alternate site claim was added under k041881 but alternate site testing is not claimed in this submission.

1. Predicate device name(s): Hypoguard Advance Micro-Draw

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k020232, k031388, k041881

3. Comparison with predicate:

Certain features of the glucose meter have been modified from the predicate:

the test strip port is now on the top of the meter a strip-ejection mechanism has been added an adjustable backlight feature has been added alarm features have been added

The indications for use, the calculation algorithm, the test strips, and the control solutions are unchanged.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Precision studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A.

# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on the release of electrical potential after a two-step reaction where glucose and ferricyanide, in the presence of glucose oxidase, are converted into gluconolactone and ferrocyanide. Ferrocyanide, when electrical current is applied, becomes ferricyanide and releases electrons; the increase in current measured by the meter is proportional to the glucose concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision was tested in the manufacturer’s facility based on CLSI EP5-A. Whole blood samples from non-diabetic volunteers were spiked to yield 6 glucose concentrations ranging from $3 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The lowest level of blood was allowed to glycolyze; all other samples were tested within four hours of collection. Results were compared to YSI values. One strip lot was tested. Within-run precision was tested on twenty replicates of each glucose level; between-day precision was tested by six independent runs of within-day precision. The sponsor set acceptance criteria as total $C V \%$ not to exceed 9.5 $\%$ . Testing results are summarized in the table below:

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The data from the precision study was used to determine linearity by plotting the average YSI value against the average meter value for each glucose level for each of the six days of testing. The regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the Assure Pro and the YSI method: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 2 \mathrm { x } + 2 3 . 5 .$ , $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 8$ .

The sponsor conducted another linearity study using seven levels of glucosespiked blood covering the same range as the previous testing; two different test strip lots were tested on three Assure Pro meters $\mathrm { \acute { n } } = 1 2$ per level). The regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the Assure Pro and the YSI method: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 6 \mathrm { x } + 6 . 6 .$ , $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): These parameters were established in the original submission (k020232).

d. Detection limit:

The low and high detection limits for the Assure Pro system have been set at 20 and $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose. Twenty blood samples $< 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (by YSI) and 20 samples between $8 0 0 { - } 9 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ generated the expected “LO” and “HI” result respectively.

e. Analytical specificity: These parameters were established in the original submission (k020232).

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: See Clinical Studies section below.

Not applicable. The meter’s software adjusts the whole-blood glucose reading to a plasma-equivalent reading.

3. Clinical studies:

One hundred diabetics participated in a study to establish the clinical characteristics of the Assure Pro System. Testing included men and women, both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, who span a wide range of education, and spanned an age range from 18 to 81. Each participant was given the product labeling, asked to read it, and then perform the test without the help of the clinical study staff. The clinical staff collected capillary blood for YSI testing and obtained results on two Assure Pro meters and the predicate meter. Ten additional people with blood glucose levels below $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested at the sponsor’s facility; some of these were not diabetics.

# a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The relationship between the glucose value obtained from YSI testing and the average of the finger-stick values is described below:

One method of comparing the significance of variability between finger-stick values and YSI values is to determine how close the values are to each other. Bias describes the difference as a percent of the finger-stick value. The more tests that have a low percent bias suggests that the two tests give similar readings:

However, differences between the two measurement systems may or may not affect clinical decisions; the Clarke Error Grid method was used to determine if differences between the methods might affect clinical outcome.

$\mathrm { \mathrm { ^ { * } Y S I v a l u e } } = 6 3 \mathrm { \ m g / d L }$ , Assure Pro value $= 7 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The cut-off for the Dzone at $6 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ is a meter value of $7 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or higher.

$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off:

Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is $7 0 - 1 0 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . One to two hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than 140 mg/dL. A medical professional should determine the range that is appropriate for diabetes patients.
