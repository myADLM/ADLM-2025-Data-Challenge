K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): None referenced

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Each control level is tested on a total of twelve Elecsys immunoassay analyzers. Two series of measurements are performed on each instrument with samples tested in duplicate. The method has been standardized against an inhouse reference standard: osteocalcin in analyte-free human serum matrix. The target values for Osteocalcin are set at approximately 20, 100 and 205 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . Lyophilized control material is stable up to the stated expiration date.

Reconstituted control material is stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 days. Stability data at 5 days supports the package insert claim of 5 days. Percent recoveries at 5 days meet the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $9 0 - 1 1 0 \%$ of concentration based on unstressed material.

Reconstituted control material is stable frozen at $\mathrm { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ for 1 month. Stability data at one month supports the package insert claim of stability frozen at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ C for 1 month. Percent recoveries at 1 month meet the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $9 0 - 1 1 0 \%$ of concentration based on unstressed material.

Reconstituted control material is stable for up to 8 hours at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Stability data supports the package insert claim that the control is stable for up to 8 hours at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Percent recoveries meet the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ .
