# StatusFirst™M CHF NT-proBNP and DXpress™M Reader system 510(k) Premarket Submission K051596

# Device Description

The StatusFirstTM CHF NT-proBNP test device utilizes biotin coupled anti-NTproBNP antibody/streptavidin solid-phase chromatographic immunoassay technology to quantitatively determine the concentration of NT-proBNP in human EDTA plasma. After a sample has been dispensed into the sample well, the StatusFirstTM CHF NTproBNP test device is placed in the DXpressTM Reader. The DXpress™M Reader displays the NT-proBNP concentration 15 minutes after sample addition. The DXpressTM Reader is programmed to automatically convert the intensity of the test band (as indicated by the "pBNP" line on the test device) into a concentration of NTproBNP by using lot specific calibration factors supplied with each box of 20 StatusFirstTM CHF NT-proBNP test devices. The NT-proBNP concentration in the sample correlates with the intensity of the test band.

# Comparison to Predicate

A method comparison was performed using a total of 355 CHF subjects and 333 nonCHF subjects. The non-CHF subjects include 282 apparently healthy subjects and 51 subjects with diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

NT-proBNP levels from the above patient samples were measured with both the StatusFirst CHF NT-proBNP test in conjunction with the DXpress™ Reader, and the Roche Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ proBNP immunoassay on the Roche Elecsys $\mathfrak { Q }$ 2010 immunoassay analyzer. Results within the measuring range of the StatusFirst™M CHF NT-proBNP test $( 2 0 { - } 5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression.

# Comments and conclusion on Substantial Equivalence

The StatusFirstTM CHF NT-proBNP and the Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ proBNP assays are both intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of NT-proBNP.

Both tests are indicated or use as an aid in thediagnosis of Congestive Heart Failure.

Goodcorrelation has been demonstrated between the StatusFirst™ CHF NT-proBNP and the Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ proBNP assays.

StatusFirst™M CHF NT-proBNP and the Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ proBNP devices are substantially equivalent based upon their intended use and performance characteristics.

Dear Ms. Schramm:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2-

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
