# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

FDA Guidance “Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators”, February 22, 1999

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable. This submission is for clearance of a calibrator.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The apoA1/apoB values of the calibrator are traceable to the WHO-IFCC international reference materials (SP1-01/SP3-07).

The values for the Direct HDL Cholesterol were derived from human serum correlation studies versus the Designated Comparison Method of the National Cholesterol Education Program.

Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. Stability is performed on 3 lots of material. After real time stability studies, the product was assigned 24 months stability. After reconstitution, the calibrator is stable for 3 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
