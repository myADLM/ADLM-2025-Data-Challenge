# Device Description(s):

# CKMB

# Method

The Stratus® CS Acute CareTM CKMB method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon sold phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal CKMB antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the CKMB TestPak. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized anti-CKMB antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a distinct antigenic site on the B subunit of the CKMB molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound CKMB, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus® CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of CKMB in the sample. The reaction rate is measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# Calibrator

# cTnI (TROP on original submission)

# Method

The Stratus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS Acute CareTM Troponin I method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the cTnI TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the cardiac troponin I molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a second distinct antigenic site on the cardiac troponin I molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound cardiac troponin I, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of cardiac troponin I in the sample. The reaction rate can then be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# Calibrator

# MYO

# Method

The Stratus® CS Acute CareTM MYO method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon sona phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal myoglobin antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the MYO TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the myoglobin molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antimyoglobin antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a distinct antigenic site on the myoglobin molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzymelabeled antibody reacts with the bound myoglobin, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus® CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of myoglobin in the sample. The reaction rate can then be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

Dear Ms. Jurga:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
