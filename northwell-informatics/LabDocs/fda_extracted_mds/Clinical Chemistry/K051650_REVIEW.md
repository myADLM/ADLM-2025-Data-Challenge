# L. Test Principle:

# CKMB

The Stratus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS Acute Care™ CKMB method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. Dendrimer linked monoclonal CKMB antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the CKMB TestPak. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized anti-CKMB antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a distinct antigenic site on the B subunit of the CKMB molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During the second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound CKMB, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of CKMB in the sample. The reaction rate is measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# Troponin I (cTnI)

The Stratus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS Acute Care™ Troponin I method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. Dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the cTnI TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the cardiac troponin I molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a second distinct antigenic site on the cardiac troponin I molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During the second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound cardiac troponin I, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone.
