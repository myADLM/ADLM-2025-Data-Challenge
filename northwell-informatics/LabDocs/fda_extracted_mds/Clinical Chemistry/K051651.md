# Device Name:

Propriety Name: G4TM Common Name: Blood Glucose Test System Classification Name: Class II, 862.1345 Glucose Blood Tester

# Predicate Device:

We claim substantial equivalence to the LifeScan, Inc., OneTouch $^ { \textregistered }$ Ultra $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ .

# Device Description:

The $\mathrm { G 4 ^ { r m } }$ Monitor is an in vitro diagnostic device designed for measuring the concentration of glucose in capillary whole blood, which is used with the $\mathbf { G 4 7 M }$ Test Strips.

The test principle is:

This device is an in vitro diagnostic product intended for the measurement of glucose concentration in human blood. The principle of the test relies upon a specific type of glucose in the blood sample, the dehydrogenase glucose that reacts to electrodes in the test strip. The test strip employs an electrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical reaction.This reaction is measured by the Meter and displayed as your blood glucose result.

# Intended Use:

The $\mathbf { G 4 7 M }$ Diabetes Monitoring System is used for the quantitative measurement of glucose level in capillary whole blood as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management in the home and in clinical settings. $\mathrm { G } 4 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ System is for

testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). Testing sites include the traditional fingertip testing along with alternate site testing on the forearm giving it an attractive, nearly painless alternative to the more painful fingertip site. The $\mathrm { G } 4 ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ Control Solutions are a red liquid which is to be used to check that both the $\mathrm { G } 4 ^ { \mathrm { { T M } } }$ meter and $\mathrm { G } 4 ^ { \mathrm { { T M } } }$ test strips are working together properly. It contains a known range of glucose as specified on the vial.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

The US Diagnostics, Inc. $\mathbf { G } 4 ^ { \mathbf { T M } }$ Module is substantially equivalent to the other products in commercial distribution intended for similar use. The most notable, it is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed item, the OneTouch $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Ultra $^ { \textregistered }$ by LifeScan, Inc.

# Conclusion:

The G4TM Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the following predicate devices: K024194 LifeScan, Inc.

Dear Mr. Letko

We have reviewed your Section 51o(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the cnactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices. good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (sec above) into cither class I1 (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
