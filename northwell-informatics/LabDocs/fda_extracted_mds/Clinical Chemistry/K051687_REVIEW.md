# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced in the submission.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Roche Diagnostics maintains a set of master calibrators for each assay that have values assigned that are traceable to the various method “gold standards.” Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PreciControl products are assayed and compared to these reference preparations and target values and ranges are assigned.

Values are assigned using a total of 12 analyzers except for hCG; hCG values were assigned using 8 analyzers. Two independent series of analyses are performed on each instrument for each analyte. Each sample is tested in duplicate. The target value is calculated as the median of the determined values.

Four studies were performed on reconstituted material to verify the stability claims.

Elecsys PreciControl Universal material and reference material are evaluated in triplicate. The Elecsys PreciControl Universal material is stressed. The reference material is an unstressed set of Elecsys PreciControl Universal. One bottle of Elecsys PreciControl Universal material was used per each stability testing. Each result is reported as the average of three samples. The acceptance criterion is recovery of $9 0 \% { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of the concentration based on unstressed material. The results are presented below.
