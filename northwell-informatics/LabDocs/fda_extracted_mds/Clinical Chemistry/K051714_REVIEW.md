# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None Referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

In the presence of Tion-NAD, the enzyme 3-α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3- $\mathfrak { a }$ -HSD) converts bile acids to 3-keto steroids and Thio-NADH. The reaction is reversible and 3- $\mathfrak { a }$ -HSD can convert 3-keto steroids and Thio-NADH to bile acids and Thio-NAD. In the presence of excess NADH, the enzyme cycling occurs efficiently and the rate of formation of Thio-NADH is determined by measuring specific change of absorbance at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ .

The assay mechanism is shown below:

# d. Detection limit:

To demonstrate the limit of quantification of the total bile acid measurement by the Diazyme TBA Enzymatic Assay, test sample with bile acids of $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ was diluted with Solution A to obtain the sample concentrations of 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, and $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { M }$ . The limit of quantification is defined as the lowest concentration having a $C V < 1 5 \%$ . The samples were analyzed by the Diazyme TBA Enzymatic Assay by eight replicates.

Sample type: human serum dilution with $5 0 \mathrm { m M }$ MES buffer   
Target concentrations/range: 1-6   
Number of measurements per concentration: 8   
Solution A: $5 0 \mathrm { m M }$ MES buffer, $\mathrm { p H } 6 . 0$   
Sensitivity method: lowest analyte concentration where $\% \mathrm { C V }$ is acceptable   
Acceptance criteria: lowest analyte concentration where $C V < 1 5 \%$

Average data from all eight samples are shown below:

<table><tr><td>Theoretical BA μmol/L</td><td>Observed BA μmol/L</td><td>SD μmol/L</td><td>% CV</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5.97</td><td>0.14</td><td>2.27</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4.01</td><td>0.22</td><td>5.55</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2.98</td><td>0.16</td><td>5.33</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1.97</td><td>0.15</td><td>7.47</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.99</td><td>0.13</td><td>13.37</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>0.53</td><td>0.08</td><td>15.8</td></tr></table>

The results demonstrate that the limit of quantification for the Diazyme TBA Enzymatic Assay is $1 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To study the effect of potential interferences in the Diazyme TBA Enzymatic assay, agents like bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglyceride, and ascorbic acid were spiked into normal human serum to be used as samples. In this study, 3 replicates of each agent were evaluated.

$\%$ interference is calculated using the following equation:

Spiked sample – non-spiked sample X $100 \%$ interference Non-spiked sample

Acceptance criteria: calculated $\%$ interference must be less than $5 \%$

Interference Agents:

1. To study the effect of bilirubin on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample with bile acid level of $2 2 \mu \mathrm { M }$ , was spiked with bilirubin to achieve bilirubin serum level of $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This concentration is in addition to the bilirubin concentration found in the normal serum sample.

2. To study the effect of hemoglobin on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample with bile acid level of $2 2 \mu \mathrm { M }$ , was spiked with hemoglobin to achieve a hemoglobin serum level of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This concentration is in addition to the hemoglobin concentration found in the normal serum sample.

3. To study the effect of ascorbic acid on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample with bile acid level of $2 2 \mu \mathrm { M }$ , were spiked with ascorbic acid to achieve serum level of $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This concentration is in addition to the ascorbic acid concentration found in the normal serum sample.

4. To study the effect of lipid on the bile acid measurement, a serum sample with bile acid level of $2 2 \mu \mathrm { M }$ , was spiked with lipid to achieve lipid serum level of 750 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This concentration is in addition to the lipid concentration found in the normal serum sample.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The accuracy study comparing the Diazyme Total Bile Assay with the Predicate Trinity’ s Bile Acid method presented a slope of 1.15, correlation coefficient 0.99, and y intercept of 0.89. I felt the $1 5 \%$ bias compared to the predicate device was an issue because the Diazyme method did not show good correlation with the predicate device in the normal expected range of $0 { \cdot } 1 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$ .

There were 8 samples (sample # 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, 16, 19, and 23 in the correlation data list) whose TBA values were significantly different from the values determined by the predicate method. The sponsor indicated that they were aware of this discrepancy and additional studies were performed. The sponsor came to the conclusion that the discrepancies noted were not caused by the inaccuracy of the Diazyme TBA method but was because of the poor anti-interference capacity and low sensitivity of the NBT/formazan based predicate method.

The sponsor presented the following 5 points to demonstrate that the new enzymatic cycling based total bile acids assay gives more accurate results for lipemic and hemolytic samples than does the predicate method.

1. Difference in assay mechanisms: enzyme cycling versus non-cycling and rate assay versus end point assay.

It is well known that there are two major drawbacks of the enzymatic, colorimetric bile acids assay method (the predicate method) using nitro blue tetrazolium as color indicator coupled with NAD. One is low sensitivity and the other is significant interferences from hemolytic and lipemic serum samples. The assay mechanism of the predicate method is depicted as below:

To overcome these drawbacks of the NBT/formazan based enzymatic bile acids assay, a more sensitive and high capacity of anti-interference method has been developed. This new method (the Diazyme method) utilizes an enzyme cycling based mechanism that allows each bile acid molecule in the patient serum to produce multiple molecules of Thio-NADH for detection. Through repeatedly oxidation and reduction reaction cycles, the indicator Thio-NADH is significantly amplified. This rate based assay significantly reduced lipemic and hemolytic interferences in comparison with the end point based predicate assay. The assay mechanism is shown below:

![](images/92bd982a56ec9ad1ada05994de1004b7a8f91df09d12bfd70333a3bd49f088c2.jpg)

# 2. Drawbacks of the predicate method described in the literatures

The two major drawbacks, low sensitivity and significant interferences by lipemic and hemolytic samples are well documented in the literatures. For example, in Ueda et al’s 1994 patent (U.S. 5,286,627), it is described that the enzymatic colorimetric total bile acids assay (the predicate method) is liable to be influenced by bilirubin, and is low sensitivity (see the attachment #1).

In another literature published in 1991 in the Journal of bioluminescence and chemiluminescence, Lekhakula et al described a discrepancy of total bile acids levels determined by two different methods. Lekhakula found that the BNT method (predicate method) gave 4 times higher TBA values for those hypertriglyceridemic and hypercholesterolemic sera (see the attachment #2). This observation was similar to what Diazyme has observed.

# 3. Direct interference comparison between the enzyme cycling method and the predicate method

Diagnostic Chemicals Limited (DCL), a Canada based major clinical diagnostic reagent company who currently distribute Diazyme’s total bile acids reagent in U.S.

has made a head to head comparison of interferences by hemoglobin and triglycerides on TBA assays. As shown in the attachment #3, the predicate method is significantly affected by hemoglobin and triglycerides. The former causes under estimation of TBA value whereas the later causes over estimation of TBA values. In contrast, the enzyme cycling method is not significantly affected by both hemoglobin and triglycerides

# 4. The cause of the discrepancy was confirmed experimentally

We measured the triglycerides and hemoglobin contents of the 8 problematic serum samples, and found that all the samples showed higher TBA values in the predicate method were lipemic samples and all the samples showed lower TBA values in the predicate method were the hemolytic samples as shown in the table below. These observations are consistent with the literature descriptions and DCL’s experimental findings.
