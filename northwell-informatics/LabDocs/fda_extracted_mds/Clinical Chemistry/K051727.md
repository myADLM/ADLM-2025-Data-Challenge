Device Name: Common Name: Device Description:

AimStick $( \overrightarrow { A }$ Urine Reagent Strips Urinalysis Reagent Strips

Plastic strips with rcagent pads which provide a color change when exposed to urine.

Medical Specialty: Intended Use:

Clinical Chemistry

The AimStick $\boldsymbol { \mathfrak { R } }$ Urine Reagent Strips are intended for detection of glucose, bilirubin, kctone, specific gravity, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrite and leukocytes in urine.

Product Description:

The AimStick $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Urine Reagent Strips are plastic strips to which Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite and Leukocyte reagent pads are affixed. The reagcnt pads react with the urine and provide a visible color reaction. The product is packaged with a drying agent in a plastic bottle. Each strip is stable and rcady to use upon removal from the bottle. The entire reagent strip is disposable. The directions must be followed exactly. Results are obtained by direct comparison of the test strip with the color blocks printed on the bottle label. Laboratory instrumentation is not required.

# Tests Principles:

Glucose:

This test is based upon thc enzymatic glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOD/POD) method. Glucose oxidase catalyzes the formation of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidasc, catalyzcs the rcaction of hydrogen peroxidase with a potassium iodide chromogen to oxidize the chromogen to colors ranging from green to blue.

# Bilirubin

This tcst is bascd upon the coupling of bilirubin with diazotized dichloroanilinc in a strongly acid mcdium. The colors produced on the reagent pad ranges through various shades of beige or tan.

Ketone:

This tcst is based upon the reaction between acctoacetate and sodium nitroprusside in an alkalinc mcdium. A positive result is indicated by a color change on the reagent pad from bcige to violet.

Specific Gravity:

This test is based upon the release of protons in the presence of cations. The reaction produces hydrogenous ionogen, which reacts with $\mathfrak { p H }$ indicator. Colors produced range from deep blue-green through yellow-green.

Blood:

This test is bascd upon hemoglobin reacting as peroxidase. Intact erythrocytes hemolyze on the tcst pad and the hemoglobin released produces a green dot. Scattered green dots on the yellow test pad are indicative of intact erythrocytes. A uniform grcen color is indicative of rcleased hemoglobin, myoglobin, or hcmolyzed erythrocytes. The colors produced range from orange through green.

pH:

The test is bascd upon the well known method of pH indicators methyl red and bromthymol bluc. The colors range from orange through yellow and green to blue.

# Protein:

This is based upon the protein-error-of-indicator principle Anion in the specific $\mathfrak { p H }$ indicator attracted by cation on protein molecules makes the indicator further ionized, which changes its color. A positive reaction is indicated by a color change from yellow to light green and to darker greens.

Urobilinogen: This test is based on the Ehrlich reaction in which p-diethylamino benzaldehyde in conjunction with a color cnhancer reacts with urobilinogen in a Strongly acid medium. A positive reaction is indicated by a pink-reddish color.

# Nitrite:

This test is based upon the conversion of Nitrate to Nitrite. The Nitrite in the urine and aromatic amino sulphanilamide are diazotized to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound reacting with tetrahydro benzo(h) quinolin 3-phenol causes the color changc. A positive reaction is indicated by a light pink to pink color.

Leukocytes: This test is based upon the reaction of esterases, present in granulocyuc leukocytes, which catalyzc the hydrolysis of an indoxylcarbonic acid ester to indoxyl. A positive reaction is indicated by a light purple to dark purple color.

Substantial Equivalence: The AimStick® Urine Reagent Strips are substantially equivalent to the Bayer MultiStix $( \ddot { \bf { R } } )$ 10SG reagent strips.
