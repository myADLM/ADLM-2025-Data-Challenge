# DEC 7 2005 SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS FOR DRG SALIVARY CORTISOL ELISA

# Manufacturer:

DRG International, Inc. 1167 U.S. Highway 22 Mountainside, NJ 07092

# Contact Information:

Lehnus & Associates Gary Lehnus 150 Cherry Lane Rd. East Stroudsburg, PA 18301 Tel: (570) 620-0198

# Device Name / Classification:

The device trade name is the DRG SLV Cortisol ELISA having FDA assigned name: Cortisol test system, 21 CFR, 862.1205, categorized as Class Il medical devices for the Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Panel, as Product Code NHG.

# Test Principle

The DRG Salivary Cortisol ELISA KIT is based on the competition principle and the microplate separation. An unknown amount of Cortisol present in the sample and a fixed amount of Cortisol conjugated with horseradish peroxidase compete for the binding sites of mouse polyclonal Cortisol-antiserum coated onto the wells. After one hour incubation the microplate is washed to stop the competition reaction. After addition of the TMB substrate solution the concentration of Cortisol is inversely proportional to the optical density measured.

# Device Intended Use:

An enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic measurement of active free cortisol (hydrocortisone and hydroxycorticosterone) in saliva. Measurements of cortisol are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the adrenal gland.

# Device Performance Normal Range Study

In order to determine the normal range of SLV cortisol, 109 saliva samples from adult male and female apparently healthy subjects, ages 20 to 80 years, were collected in the morning and analyzed using the DRG SLV Cortisol ELISA kit. The following range was calculated from this study.

Adults: 0.12 - 1.47 µg/dL or 1.2 - 14.7 ng/mL (AM collection)

# Method comparison

Studies were performed to compare the DRG SLV Cortisol test to commercially available tests. One study evaluated saliva samples from 114 subjects ages 40 to 70 years. The samples were run in duplicate on the DRG test and another commercially available LIA method to determine the concentration of Cortisol in the samples. A correlation of 0.872 was obtained versus this method.

A second study was performed using saliva samples from seventy-two (72) saliva samples collected from 40 - 70 year old men and women and run in duplicate on DRG and another commercially available ElA test. A correlation of 0.936 was observed compared to another ElA method.

Another study was performed comparing 28 saliva samples to a reference LC-MS method. A correlation of r = 0.89056 with a formula of y = 1.0144x + 1.7762 was obtained to this method.

To further demonstrate substantial equivalence of the DRG SLV test, additional expanded comparison studies were requested. One expanded study evaluated saliva samples from 40 subjects ages 25  65 years. The samples were run in duplicate on the DRG test and another commercially available LIA method to determine the concentration of Cortisol in the samples. An overall correlation of 0.9795 and a regression formula of $\mathsf { y }$ EPY $\mathbf { \Omega } = 0 . 9 5 8 8 x \cdot 0 . 0 3 3 8$ was obtained versus this method.

A second expanded study was performed using 40 saliva samples collected from men and women ages 25  65 years and run in duplicate on DRG and another commercially available ElA test. A correlation of 0.9920 with a regression formula of $\ y = 1 . 0 7 2 2 x +$ 0.1482 was observed compared to another ElA method.

The DRG Cortisol ELISA test demonstrated equivalent performance to commercially available ELISA and LIA methods for detection of Cortisol in saliva.

# Sensitivity

The lowest detectable level of Cortisol that can be distinguished from the Zero Standard is 0.537 ng/mL or $0 . 0 5 3 7 \mu { \sf g } / { \sf d } { \sf I }$ at the $95 \%$ confidence limit.

# Specificity

The following materials have been evaluated for cross reactivity. The percentage indicates cross reactivity at $50 \%$ displacement compared to Cortisol.

# Recovery

Recovery of the DRG ELISA was determined by adding increasing amounts of the analyte to three different saliva samples containing different amounts of endogenous analyte. Each sample (non-spiked and spiked) was assayed and analyte concentrations of the samples were calculated from the standard curve. The percentage recoveries were determined by comparing expected and measured values of the samples

# Linearity

Three samples (saliva) containing different amounts of analyte were serially diluted to 1:64 with zero standard and assayed with the DRG ELISA. The percentage recovery was calculated by comparing the expected and measured values for SLV cortisol. An assay linearity of 0.537 - 77 ng/mL has been identified as the usable range. Samples above this range must be diluted and re-run.
