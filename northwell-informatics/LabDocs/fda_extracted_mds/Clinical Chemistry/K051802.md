# Description of the Device:

The FreeStyle Connect monitor utilizes coulometric biosensor technology found in the FreeStyle Connect test strip to quantitatively measure glucose concentration in whole blood samples or in FreeStyle Control Solutions. The FreeStyle Connect BGMS measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose biosensor is capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood by virtue of the glucose specificity of the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) present on the glucose test strip.

# Intended Use of the Device:

The FreeStyle Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for invitro diagnostic use for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary, venous, arterial and neonatal whole blood samples. The FreeStyle Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System is for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The FreeStyle Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the home and in professional settings to monitor blood glucose levels.

# Performance Studies:

The performance of the FreeStyle Connect BGMS was studied in the laboratory. The results obtained during these studies demonstrated that the FreeStyle Connect BGMS is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

# Conclusion:

Results of laboratory testing demonstrated that the performance of the FreeStyle Connect BGMS is acceptable and comparable to the performance of the predicate devices for blood glucose testing when used according to its intended use.

Re: k051802 Trade/Device Name: FreeStyle Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: NBW Dated: July 29, 2005 Received: August 1, 2005

Dear Ms. Kline:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
