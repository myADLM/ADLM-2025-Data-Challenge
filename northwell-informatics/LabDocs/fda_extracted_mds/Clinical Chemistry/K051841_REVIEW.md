# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

The WH Accu Test™ One-Step Urine/Serum Combo Pregnancy test employs a combination of dye conjugated monoclonal antibody and polyclonal solid phase antibody to selectively identify hCG in serum and urine. The sample $( { \sim } 1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } )$ is added to the specimen well of the test device using the specimen dropper provided. As the sample flows through the absorbent portion of the device, the antibody-dye conjugate binds to the hCG if it is present in the sample, forming an antibody-antigen complex. The complex binds to the anti-hCG antibody in the reaction zone, producing a pink-rose colored band in the test area when the concentration of hCG is equal to or greater than $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . Absence of a colored line indicates a negative result. A colored line should also appear in the control area of the device, to indicate the test was performed correctly.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility was confirmed by testing the device with three different levels of spiked hCG in both male serum and urine: 0 (unspiked), 25 and 100 mIU/mL. For each test sample 12 replicates $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 2 )$ were performed. The 0 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ serum and urine both gave negative results, while the 25 and 100 mIU/mL test sample in serum and urine all gave positive results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The assay was standardized using the hCG WHO $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ International Standard 75/537.

Stability studies are on-going and are performed for each lot of product. A stability protocol was provided. The data generated to date support a shelf-life of 24 months when the product is stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

Five male urine and five serum samples were each spiked with five concentrations of hCG (0, 10, 25, 50 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ ) and tested. All the 0 and $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ test samples were negative while all of the 25, 50, and 100 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ test samples were positive. A $2 5 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ cutoff is claimed for serum and urine.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Luteinizing hormone $\mathrm { 5 0 0 m I U / m L }$ ), follicle stimulating hormone (1000 $\mathrm { m U } / \mathrm { m l } )$ and thyroid stimulating hormone $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 \ : \mu I U / m L }$ ) were added to hCG negative and hCG positive $( 2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG added) male serum and urine. The potential cross-reactants spiked into hCG negative serum and urine all gave negative results in the assay. The potential cross-reactants spiked into the sera and urines containing $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG all gave positive results.

Common prescription and over the counter drugs, as well as hemoglobin, protein, bilirubin and triglycerides were also tested in the assay at specified concentrations, in both hCG negative and positive samples. The potential interferents were tested in both urine and serum, except for protein (urine only) and triglycerides (serum only). No interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

The Prozone or “hook” effect was studied by testing samples containing high concentrations of hCG using the assay. Urine and serum specimens from normal, non-pregnant donors were spiked with up to $1 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ of hCG and tested. All test samples up to $1 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ gave a positive result, indicating the absence of a hook effect at this level or below.

f. Assay cut-off: See (d) Detection Limit above

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Matched urine and serum specimens from 102 individuals were tested using both the WH Accu Test and ACON Laboratories One Step Pregnancy test. The samples were obtained with informed consent from patients seeking confirmation of pregnancy. Of these specimens, 57 were positive and 45 negative with both the WH Accu Test and the predicate device.

b. Matrix comparison:

When comparing the 102 matched serum and urine specimens, there was $100 \%$ agreement using the WH Accu Test.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: The expected values are based on literature. The labeling states the following:

Negative results are expected in healthy, non-pregnant women and healthy men. Healthy pregnant women have hCG present in their urine and serum specimens. The amount of hCG will vary greatly with gestational age and between individuals.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports substantial equivalence decision.
