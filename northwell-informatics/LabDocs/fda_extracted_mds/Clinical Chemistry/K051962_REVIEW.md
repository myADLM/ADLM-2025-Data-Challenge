# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The total precision as well as the precision for each component of variation (between-day, between-run, and within-run) was estimated by assaying two control levels (Level 1 and Level 2 at normal and abnormal analyte concentrations). These controls were tested in duplicate, twice per day (separated by a minimum of two hours), for 20 days, using two instruments: one AEROSET, one c8000. This study was conducted in accordance with NCCLS Document EP5-A.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Eleven samples at various concentrations were run in four replicates. At least one level was included which exceeded the desired range. The acceptable difference between the observed result and expected value was based on clinical significance for reagent accuracy. This study was based on NCCLS Document EP6-A.

Data generated during linearity studies indicate an acceptable assay recovery from 5 to $1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 Systems, with percent recoveries within $10 \%$ of the predicted values with $9 5 \%$ confidence.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Abbott Laboratories ARCHITECT c8000 and AEROSET analyzer has shown traceability using the Abbott calibrator (previously cleared) and the ULTRA HDL assay and has been certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network.

# d. Detection limit:

Data generated during linearity studies indicate an acceptable assay recovery from 5 to $1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 Systems. The limit of quantitation (functional sensitivity) of the Ultra HDL was verified to be $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A test sample prepared to a concentration of $\leq 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was analyzed in replicates of ten, on three instruments, two runs per instrument and resulted in $\leq 2 0 \%$ CV (pooled within instrument). The study was done consistent with the guidelines in NCCLS Protocol EP17-A.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interferents which may falsely elevate or reduce results were tested. Human serum samples were spiked with various levels of interferents. Three replicates of each interferent level and three replicates of each reference sample were run at the medical decision levels. Medical Decision Level 1 target is $3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Medical Decision Level 2 target is $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

At Medical Decision Level 1 and 2 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin.

At Medical Decision Level 1 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $1 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Intralipid. At Medical Decision Level 2 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Intralipid.

At Medical Decision Level 1 and 2 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $3 . 8 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ascorbic acid.

At Medical Decision Level 1 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $3 2 . 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ conjugated bilirubin. At Medical Decision Level 2 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $6 3 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ conjugated bilirubin.

At Medical Decision Level 1 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $3 2 . 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ unconjugated bilirubin. At Medical Decision Level 2 the percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $6 7 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ unconjugated bilirubin.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Data generated demonstrate an acceptable degree of correlation between the Ultra HDAL assay on the AEROSET System and Architect c8000 System, and the Predicate assay on the Hitachi 717 Analyzer.

The degree of correlation was determined per the work instruction protocol for the Ultra HDL assay. 111 samples (minimum of one replicate per run) were tested using the AEROSET vs Hitachi 717, 110 samples were tested using the ARCHITECT $\mathbf { c 8 0 0 0 }$ vs Hitachi 717 and 110 samples were tested using the AEROSET vs ARCHITECT c8000. A linear regression analysis was performed comparing the results for each method. A single replicate was used for the linear regression analysis. This study was conducted in accordance with NCCLS Document EP9-A2. The linear regression analyses were reported as follows: AEROSET vs Hitachi 717 - 111 serum samples ranging from 12.20 to $1 8 7 . 9 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ showed a correlation coefficient of 0.999, a slope of 0.97 and a Y intercept of $0 . 4 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

ARCHITECT c8000 vs Hitachi 717 – 110 serum samples ranging from 12.20 $- 1 8 0 . 2 1 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ showed a correlation coefficient of 0.999, a slope of 0.97, and a Y intercept of $0 . 9 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

AEROSET vs ARCHITECT c8000 – 110 serum samples ranging from 12.30 to $1 7 8 . 6 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ showed a correlation coefficient of 0.999, a slope of 1.00 and a Y intercept of $0 . 6 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

Twenty two subjects were tested using each of the collection tubes to be evaluated. Data were analyzed for statistical differences between different tube types. Based upon the equivalency between the AEROSET and c8000, testing was performed on the AEROSET. Less than or equal to $\leq 5 \%$ difference with $9 5 \%$ confidence for the serum was observed for lithium heparin, sodium heparin, EDTA, PST (plasma separator tube), and SST (serum separator tube) tubes for the Ultra HDL assay.
