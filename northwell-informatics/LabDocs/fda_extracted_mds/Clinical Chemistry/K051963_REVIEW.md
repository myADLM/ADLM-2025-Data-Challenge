# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for over-the-Counter (OTC) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) 510(k)s”

# L. Test Principle:

The BE CERTAIN™ Home Pregnancy Test is a one-step test based on immunochromatographic technology.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The BE CERTAIN™ Home Pregnancy Test is calibrated against the WHO $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ International Standard for hCG.

d. Detection limit:

The sensitivity of the BE CERTAIN™ Home Pregnancy Test is $2 5 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ . Urine from 30 normal, non-pregnant females or males were spiked with different concentrations of hCG (five replicates at each level) and analyzed on the BE CERTAIN™ Home Pregnancy Test. At $1 8 . 7 5 \mathrm { \ m I U / m L }$ , three out of five samples were positive; and all were positive at $2 5 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ and above.

e. Analytical specificity:

To determine the specificity (i.e. cross-reactivity with high physiological concentrations of LH, FSH, and TSH), urine samples from a total of 45 normal, non-pregnant females or males were spiked with various concentrations of LH, FSH, and TSH and analyzed on the BE CERTAIN™ Home Pregnancy Test. The samples contained 0, 10, or $5 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG.

All 0 and $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG samples spiked with LH up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , FSH up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , and TSH up to $1 { , } 2 5 0 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ read negative. All 50 mIU/mL hCG samples spiked with LH up to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , FSH up to 500 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ , and TSH up to $1 { , } 2 5 0 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ read positive.

To determine interference by prescription/OTC drugs, chemical analytes, and biological analytes, urine samples from 36 normal, non-pregnant females or males were spiked with the potentially interfering substances and analyzed on the BE CERTAIN™ Home Pregnancy Test. The samples contained 0 or 50 mIU/mL hCG. Additionally, to assess potential interference from $\mathrm { p H }$ , a 0 and a 50 mIU/mL hCG sample were titrated with an acid or base to yield pH values of 3 to 10 and analyzed on the subject device.

No interference was observed in the 0 or $5 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L 1 }$ hCG samples spiked with interfering substances. All tests were negative with the $0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG sample and positive with the 50 mIU/mL hCG sample. Similarly, $0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG samples and $5 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG samples in the pH range of 3-10 yielded negative and positive results, respectively.

f. Assay cut-off: See “Detection limit” above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Two comparison studies were performed to determine the correlation of the BE CERTAIN™ Home Pregnancy Test (new test), when used by lay persons, with that of a commercially available test.

The first study assessed performance when using the dip method. In this study, coded, spiked samples were analyzed by 100 non-pregnant females (ages 16 to 48 years) using the new test and a professional using the new test and the predicate test. The results demonstrated a high degree of correlation ( $100 \%$ agreement) between the lay persons and professional user, using the new test. When the lay persons’ results were compared to the professional’s, when using the predicate device, $9 9 \%$ agreement was observed.

The second study assessed performance when using a urine drop method. In this study, 50 non-pregnant females from the first study analyzed coded, spiked samples using the new test, and their results were compared to the professional’s when using the dip method with the predicate test. The results showed $100 \%$ agreement between the subject and predicate devices.

At the completion of the study, the subjects completed a questionnaire. All subjects considered the test easy to perform and the labeling instructions clear and easy to follow. The results demonstrate that women of various ages, racial backgrounds, and educational backgrounds should be able to properly use this test.
