# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

A master calibrator is developed that has values assigned that are traceable to the method “gold standard”. Iron Standard is a gravimetrically prepared product with a target value of $5 0 0 ~ \mu \ g / \mathrm { d L }$ . This product is assayed and compared to a NIST standard prepared from SRM 937, Iron Metal (Clinical).

Values are confirmed on Hitachi analyzers using the Iron or UIBC reagent kit. The reagent is calibrated using the $5 0 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ NIST standard. Replicates of the Deleted: 25 r new batch of Iron Standard are run, followed by replicates of the NIST Deleted: 5 standard and replicates of a previously released lot of Iron Standard. The new Deleted: 10 product, the NIST Standard, and the previously released lot of Iron Standard met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria.

Two studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for the new Iron Standard.

<table><tr><td>Stability</td><td>Unopened</td><td>Opened</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Standard</td><td>Store at 15 25°C until expiration date</td><td>1525°C: until expiration date</td></tr></table>

Study 1: Real Time Stability. The Iron product is stored at $1 5 { - } 2 5 \mathrm { C } ^ { \circ }$ for 6   
months, 9 months and 12 months. The Iron reagent is calibrated using the 500   
$\mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ NIST standard. Using a Hitachi 917, testing is performed at 6, 9 and 12   
months on replicates of the new batch of Iron Standard, followed by replicates Deleted: 25   
of the NIST standard and replicates of a previously released lot of Iron Deleted: 5   
Standard. The new product, the NIST Standard, and the previously released Deleted: 10   
lot of Iron Standard met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria.

Study 2: Accelerated Stability: At the $1 1 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ month of a 12 month shelf life, the Iron product is incubated for 5 days at $4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and equilibrated to the labeled storage temperature, $1 5 { - } 2 5 \mathrm { C } ^ { \circ }$ . The Iron reagent is calibrated using $5 0 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ NIST standard. Using a Hitachi 917, replicates of the new batch of Iron Deleted: 25 Standard are run, followed by replicates of the NIST standard and replicates Deleted: 5 of a previously released lot of Iron Standard. The new product, the NIST Deleted: 10 Standard, and the previously released lot of Iron Standard met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria.

The results of the real time and accelerated stability studies support the claim of a 12 month expiration date.
