Not available Substantial Equivalence:   
The ABX PENTRA 400 is a new device developed by HoribaABX. It has been demonstrated that the ABX PENTRA 400 can be considered substantially equivalent to the predicate device Roche Cobas Mira Plus (K920402).

The optional ISE module has been similarly demonstrated as being substantially equivalent to K963627; the Roche Ion Selective Electrode. Whilst the ABX PENTRA Glucose HK CP, and ABX PENTRA Glucose PAP CP have been demonstrated substantially equivalent to K801297; the Cobas Reagent for Glucose Rapid (K801297). ABX PENTRA Multical, ABX PENTRA N Control and ABX PENTRA P Control have been respectively demonstrated as being substantially equivalent to K033501, Roche Calibrator for Automated Systems and K041 1227, Roche Precinorm U and Roche Precipath U.

# Description:

The ABX PENTRA 400 is a benchtop clinical chemistry analyzer using two measuring principals absorbance and ion selective electrodes.

The instrument may be summarized as follows :

Multi-parametric (up to 52 simultaneous tests + 3 ISE tests)   
Patient per patient   
On routine or Stat   
150 to 300 tests / hour (in single or bi-reaction mode) (analytical cycle of 12seconds) random access working on primary tubes or sample cups   
ABX PENTRA reagent cassettes are compact and ready-to-use.   
on board bar-code readers are used to identify newly loaded reagent cassettes and samples for patient identification

The ABX PENTRA 400 offers both Closed and Open channels for a multitude of parameters (clinical chemistry, DAT, TDM, plasma protein, hemostasis, optional ISE module).

# Intended Use :

The ABX PENTRA 400 is a discrete photometric benchtop chemistry analyzer for clinical use.

The device is intended to duplicate manual analytical procedures by performing various steps such as pipetting, mixing, heating and measuring color intensity.

The device is intended for use in conjunction with certain materials to measure, control and calibrate a variety of analytes.

The option of an ISE (Ion Selective Electrode) module is intended for the quantitative determination of Sodium, Chloride, Potassium by potentiometry using ion selective electrode.

# Conclusions for non clinical and clinical tests :

The non clinical studies tests conclude that the safety and effectiveness of the devices are not compromised.

The ABX PENTRA 400 (Option ISE)meets the :

IEC 61010-1 : safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory   
use - Part 1: General requirements   
EN 61326 : standard for Electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use - EMC   
requirements   
UL 3101 -1 / CSA - C22.2 No. 1010-1 : Safety Requirements for Electrical Equipement for   
measurement, control, and laboratory use, Part 1 : General Requirements

Clinical testing met all acceptance criteria, and data demonstrates that the devices are substantially equivalent to their predicate devices.

Re: k052007 Trade/Device Name: ABX PENTRA 400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzers ABX PENTRA 400 Calibrators and Controls Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: CFR, JGS, CEM, CGZ, JIX, JY, JJE Dated: November 16, 2005 Received: November 21, 2005

Dear Mr. Lawton:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
