# K. Test Principle:

The automated Dimension® CSAE method uses an immunoassay technique in which free and CSA-bound antibody-enzyme species are separated using magnetic particles. The assay is performed using a method specific Flex® reagent cartridge. The calibrators and controls for this assay are sold separately.

# L. Performance Characteristics:

1. Reproducibility

Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices (EP5- A, Feb.1999). Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, once a day, for 20 days. The within-run (repeatability) and total (within-lab) standard deviations were calculated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) method.

# 2. Method Comparison

A total of 140 specimens were tested with the Dimension® CSAE assay, with the Abbott $\mathrm { T D x } ^ { \circledast } / \mathrm { T D x } ~ \mathrm { F L x } ^ { \circledast }$ Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood Assay and by LC/MS technology. Linear regression was used to calculate a slope, intercept and correlation coefficient. The model equation for regression statistics is: Result of Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system (Slope x comparative method result) $^ +$ Intercept.

3. Linearity

Standard solutions were prepared by sequential mixing to create a set of eight equally spaced sample pools starting with a high and low pool of known analyte concentration. Theoretical concentrations were computed for all intermediate pools based on the initial concentrations of the high and low pools. The analysis of cyclosporine on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ RxL by the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CSAE method shows a deviation from the estimated line of less than $1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ $[ 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { n m o l / L } ]$ with $9 5 \%$ confidence at the analytical concentration of $7 9 4 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ [662.1 nmol/L]. The lower limit of the linearity claim is $3 5 0 . 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ [291.7 nmol/L].

# 4Interference Testing

Interference testing was performed according to the CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP-7A. A summary of the substances that do not interfere with the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Cyclosporine methods when present in whole blood at the concentrations indicated. Inaccuracies (biases) due to these substances are less than $10 \%$ at a CSA level equivalent to 800 $\mathrm { n g / m L } \left[ 6 6 5 . 6 \mathrm { n m o l / L } \right]$ can be found in the package insert.

# 5. Analytical Specificity

Six major metabolites were evaluated for cross-reactivity in the presence of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ [416 nmol/L] cyclosporine. The percent cross-reactivity was calculated as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">% cross reactivity</td><td colspan="2">measured CSA - control CSA (500 ng/mL) [41.6 nmol/L] X</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">100 metabolite added</td></tr><tr><td>Cyclosporine</td><td></td><td>Cross-Reactivity</td></tr><tr><td>Metabolite</td><td>Metabolite Level Tested ng/mL [nmol/L]</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>AM1 (M17)</td><td>1000 [821]</td><td>4.7</td></tr><tr><td>AM1c (M18)</td><td>1000 [821]</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>AM1c9 (M26)</td><td>1000 [810]</td><td>3.9</td></tr><tr><td>AM4N (M21)</td><td>1000 [842]</td><td>3.1</td></tr><tr><td>AM9 (M1)</td><td>1000 [821]</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>AM19 (M8)</td><td>1000 [810]</td><td>3.0</td></tr></table>

# 6. Recovery

Known amounts of CSA were added to human whole blood samples with concentrations of 610.0, 1232.2, and $1 8 6 1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ [507.5, 1025.2, 1861.8 nmol/L]. CSA concentrations on these samples were then measured and the calculated percent recovery ranged from $9 4 . 3 \%$ to $1 0 3 . 1 \%$ with a mean recovery of $1 0 1 . 0 \%$ .

Value obtained - Baseline Percent Recovery $\asymp$ - ---- x 100 Amount Added

7. Functional Sensitivity   
The functional sensitivity of the CSAE method was demonstrated to be less than 350ng/mL. The functional sensitivity is defined as the lowest concentration at which the intra-assay coefficient of variation is not greater than $20 \%$ .
