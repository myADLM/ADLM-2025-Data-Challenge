15- Substantial Equivalency is claimed against the following device: Blood Pressure Monitor, Model SE-311, manufactured by Sein Electronics Co., Ltd. 510k #K042138 Clever Chek TD-3213, 510k# K042795 One Touch Ultra Blood Glucose monitoring system, 510k #K002134

# 16- Description of the Device:

BGP-100 Sein Blood Glucose & Pressure Monitor system BGP-100 combines the function of a blood glucose monitoring system and a blood pressure meter in one unit. Supplies with the meter are test strips, lancets, lancing device, storage case and control solution. The blood glucose monitoring system is turned on by strip insertion; Once the user confirms that the numerical code on the display, and strip bottle all match, a test strip is inserted into the meter and glucose testing can proceed. The user then supplies finger-tip blood or control solution to the strip and the meter starts the measurement, which is completed in 5 seconds. Sein Electronics Co.,Ltd has provided instructions and illustrations explaining, that the blood drop will be pulled into the strip sample entry by capillary action until meter beeps and the result will be show on liquid crystal display ("LCD") after 5 seconds. Results are automatically stored in the meter's memory for tracking purposes. The capacity of memory is 150 blood glucose values and average value of past 14 days or 30days. Control Solution is sold separately from the kit. BGP-100 adopts the wrist type cuff for blood pressure meter part. The cuff and control unit are combined into a single wrist-mounted assembly. The user interface panel has power switch, mode switch, memory switch, for blood pressure meter part and LCD for displaying the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, date and time. This device has the memory function that permits memory and display of the 60 most recent measurement results. User should wrap the pressure cuff around the wrist with the palm facing up and pushes the Power" button.The cuff will be full with appropriate air pressure automatically. Pressurization is automatically governed. If the initial inflation pressure (180mmHg) is inadequate for measurement, i.e. lower that the patient's systolic pressure, the pump will automatically repressurize to a preset level (30 mmHg) above the initial level. Symbols in the LCD indicate pressurization status at all times. The air of cuff is automatically deflated during blood pressure measurement. No special training beyond basic ability to follow instruction is required. Since the products are designed for home use, detailed instructions on avoidance of practices that adversely affect the accuracy of measurements are included in the instruction manual.

# 17- Intended use of the device: (refer to FDA form attached)

The BGP-100 blood glucose and blood pressure measurement system consists of a meter with wrist cuff and test strips. The system is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood taken from the fingertip. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes mellitus, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for use on neonates. Also the system measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate from adult's wrist in the home care environment. The device employs a wrist cuff and the oscillometric method of measurement.

Dear Mr. Mansour,

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
