# I. Device Description:

This device combines the functions of a blood glucose meter and a blood pressure measurement system in one unit. Supplied with the meter are the test strips, lancets, lancing device, control solutions and storage case. To measure blood glucose, the user inserts a test strip. A numerical code appears on the screen and the user compares this number to the number located on the test strip bottle to ensure the two numbers match. Once the user confirms that the code number in the meter matches the strip bottle, glucose testing can proceed. The sponsor has provided instructions and illustrations explaining that the blood drop will be pulled into the strip sample entry by capillary action and that the confirmation window must be completely filled with blood to obtain an accurate result. Results are stored in the meters memory for tracking purposes. The blood pressure monitor system was previously cleared (k042138). The controls can be purchased separately.

To measure blood pressure, the user is instructed to wrap the cuff around the left wrist with the palm facing up approximately $\%$ to $\%$ inch below the ball of the thumb. The user is instructed not to move or talk during the measurement. The sponsor has also provided instructions and illustrations explaining that the user must be sitting and the blood pressure cuff must be at the same level as the user’s heart to obtain an accurate reading. Results are stored in the meters memory for tracking purposes.

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose: the glucose oxidase in the strip reacts with the glucose in the sample to produce an electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose concentration in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or mmol/L.

Blood pressure: the pressure sensor in the cuff detects small changes in pressure and converts them to electrical signals. The meter analyzes the singles and converts them to standard measurements of pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor evaluated the intra precision of the device by running 5 whole blood specimens of different concentration $( 3 0 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ within one run using 10 meters. The acceptance criterion is $\mathrm { S D } < 7 . 7 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for glucose values ${ < } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and CV $< 7 . 5 \%$ for glucose values $\geq 1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The results are presented in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Grand Mean(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>42.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>98.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>141.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>207.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>336.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pooled SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12.2</td></tr></table>

The Inter Precision was evaluated by running 5 control solutions of different concentrations ( $3 0 { - } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ once a day for 10 days using 9 meters. Acceptance criteria is a $C V { < } 1 0 \%$ . The results are presented in the table below:

Accuracy was based on the ISO International Standard 15197. Acceptable accuracy for results shall be: $9 5 \%$ of the individual results shall fall within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at glucose concentration ${ < } 7 5$ and within $20 \%$ at glucose concentration $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Three hundred and four (304) capillary blood samples were collected and run on the BGP -100 glucose meter and then run on the reference method (YSI 2300). The sample range was from 26 to $5 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Results are shown in the tables below:

A linear regression was also performed and has the following results, $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 4 7 \mathrm { x } +$ 4.4358, $\mathbf { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 4$ , $\mathrm { n } { = } 2 5 0$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the glucose measurements was demonstrated by comparing prepared blood samples on the Sein Blood Glucose meter and a glucose reference method (YSI). The nine samples ranged in concentration from a low of approximately 19 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ to a high of approximately $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The test results of all values, except for the $7 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , satisfy the ISO International Standard 15197. Acceptable accuracy for results shall be: $9 5 \%$ of the individual results shall fall within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at glucose concentration ${ < } 7 5$ and within $20 \%$ at glucose concentration $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The linear regression equation obtained with samples ranging from 18 to $1 0 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was $\mathrm { Y } =$ $0 . 9 8 9 4 X - 1 3 . 3$ , $\operatorname { R } ^ { 2 } { } = 0 . 9 9 8 9$ and the linear regression equation obtained with samples ranging from 19 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was $\mathrm { Y } = 1 . 0 \mathrm { X } - 2 1 . 3 5$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { \dot { 2 } } = 0 . 9 9 9$ .

The reportable range for glucose measurements is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Two levels of control material are provided for use with the test system and are traceable to NIST and NBS standards. Values are assigned to the controls by comparing to a glucose reference method. Stability is assessed by performing realtime studies for the shelf life and in use stability. Stability is evaluated with the criterion that all values fall with the established range during the time period tested. Shelf life is 18 months and in use stability is 90 days when stored between $8 - 3 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

d. Detection limit:

$2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L - S e } $ linearity study above.

e. Analytical specificity:

Specificity of the glucose meter was assessed by spiking various endogenous and exogenous compounds into prepared whole blood samples. The sponsor first prepared a low whole blood control at approximately $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and a high whole blood control at approximately $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose and confirmed these concentrations prior to the addition of the interferents. The sponsor then added the interfering substance and ran each control solution on the BGP-100 system. If the change in glucose measurement from the control solution was less the $1 5 \%$ this was considered no interference. Results of the testing were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interferent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Highest Concentration WhereNo Interference Seen (mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acetaminophen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbic Acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>30</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dopamine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>L-dopa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Methyldopa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tolbutamide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triglycerides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3000</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Uric Acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>80</td></tr></table>

The meter was tested at different altitudes to assess the effect of low oxygen levels on the meter performance. No effect on performance was found when three different levels of blood were tested up to 10,000 ft., higher elevations were not tested. The sponsor presented data that supported using the test system between $1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $4 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

Hematocrit Effect:

The effect of sample hematocrit variation on the BGP-100 test system was tested experimentally by preparing samples of known hematocrit and spiking aliquots of these samples with four different levels of glucose. These samples were run on the BGP-100 and YSI; there was less than a $\pm 1 5 \%$ bias across the claimed range of $20 \mathrm { { \sim } } 6 0 \%$ Hematocrit.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: See clinical studies section below.

b. Matrix comparison:

Not applicable. The glucose meter is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only.

3. Clinical studies:

Two separate clinical studies of the BGP-100 System performance were performed.   
The results of these studies are presented in the Clinical Sensitivity section below.

The consumer study was performed at two POC sites with a total of 110 lay-users. The lay-users ranged in age, education and were about equally divided between males and females. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood using the instructions in the User’s guide. A trained professional then performed another fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter. Blood was collected and measured on an YSI analyzer.

Another study was performed by Health care professionals at three POC sites. Fifty patient volunteers participated at each site. A fingerstick was performed for testing on the BGP-100 and blood was collected for testing on the YSI analyzer.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

Each bottle of test strips as a code number which is used to calibrate the meter. The user confirms that the code number on the test strip bottle matches the code number in the instrument. If they are different then the user changes the number by depressing the code key on the meter until the correct number is displayed. No further calibrations are required of the user.

# 6. Quality Control:

The sponsor is providing a high and low glucose control solution with this device. To mark the test result as a control the user is instructed to press and hold the C button for three seconds. Check will appear on the display. This prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If control results fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a list of troubleshooting steps and the customer care line.
