The ADVIA IMS Glucose method reagent pack is sufficient for 1250 tests. The reagent pack consists of R1, R2, and DIL 2. R1 is $2 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ solution containing adenosine triphosphate and surfactant. R2 contains hexokinase (yeast), glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase ( $L$ . mesenteroides), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, supplied lyophilized. DIL 2 is $2 1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of surfactant.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI document EP5- A - Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices   
CLSI document EP9-A – Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples

# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA IMS Glucose method is a colorimetric endpoint chemistry. The method is based on the combination of hexokinase (HK) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) for the specific measurement of glucose. HK catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose using adenosine- $. 5 '$ -triphosphate (ATP). G6PD catalyzes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-mediated oxidation of glucose-6- phosphate (G-6-P) to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone (6-PG) with the concomitant production of NADH. The amount of NADH produced is in direct proportion to the

concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Imprecision was evaluated at specific analyte levels using control materials in a protocol similar to that recommended in CLSI document EP5-A. The controls were tested over 11 days and included 17 runs. The results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>WithinRunSD         %CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>TotalSD         %CV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Control 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>64</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>35.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.74</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.82</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Control 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>65</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>60.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.28</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.35</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.2</td></tr></table>

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The assay range is 1 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (0.1 to $3 3 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ). Five samples from individual donors were pooled and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with pure glucose to achieve a final concentration of approximately $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The two aliquots were then codiluted to produce three additional, equally spaced levels. The five samples were then tested in duplicate on the ADVIA IMS. A least squares fit was generated for the first three points. The percent difference between the theoretical line and the actual recovery for the five samples was then determined. The results showed $- 3 . 6 \%$ to $1 . 2 \%$ deviation from the predicted value for all five samples (observed values: 65- $5 3 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ADVIA IMS Glucose method is traceable to the CDC Reference Method using reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology via patient sample correlation.

Assigned values for calibrators and ranges of Assayed Chemistry Controls are traceable to this standardization.

# d. Detection limit:

The minimum detectable concentration (sensitivity) is $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ $\mathrm { { ( 1 \ m g / d L ) } }$ . This is based on 2 times the within-run standard deviation from at least 20 replicates of a sample containing no glucose.

e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical specificity was established in predicate submissions. Also, the sponsor noted that interfering substances are not expected in cerebrospinal fluid samples.

f. Assay cut-off: See “Detection limit” above.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Correlation was evaluated with human CSF samples in a protocol similar to that recommended in CLSI document EP9-A. A total of 64 samples, with glucose concentrations ranging from 31 to $1 3 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (1.7 to $7 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } $ , were tested on both platforms. The regression equation was as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 2 + 2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { { m g } / d L , ~ r = 0 . 9 9 7 , ~ ( y = 0 . 9 2 x + 0 . 1 3 ~ \mathrm { { m m o l } / L , ~ r = 0 . 9 9 7 ) } }
$$

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: The expected values/reference range for CSF was determined in the literature: 60 to $8 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (3.3 to $4 . 4 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ). The expected values/reference range for serum or plasma is 60 to $1 2 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (3.3 to $6 . 7 \mathrm { m m o l } / \mathrm { L } \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). The expected values/reference range for urine is $< 0 . 5 \ \mathrm { g } _ { \scriptscriptstyle { \it / } }$ day $( < 2 . 7 8 \mathrm { m m o l / d a y } )$ .
