# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not Applicable

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: ISE Compensator is traceable to the reference material NISTSRM909b. The reference method is flame photometry for the sodium and potassium analytes and coulometry for the chloride analyte. The value assignment process takes place using multiple external laboratories and using different Hitachi analyzers with ion selective electrodes. The final value assigned to each analyte is lot specific and is found on the Value Sheet that is provided with the product.

Stability: The shelf-life and open-vial stability of ISE Compensator when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ have been demonstrated using real time stability data and predetermined acceptance criteria.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not Applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports substantial equivalence decision.
