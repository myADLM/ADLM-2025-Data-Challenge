# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced in the submission.

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The value assignment of the Controls for the two levels were done by a Fitness-For-Use (FFU) study over a period of 4 days. The FFU data was collected with two lots of the Reagents, Calibrators and Controls on two ADVIA $^ { \textregistered } 1 6 5 0$ systems for a total of 128 replicates.

The mean System Specific Values (SSVs) of the two Controls, Level 1 and 2, were then validated by value assignment using a nested testing protocol on the ADVIA $^ { \textregistered } 1 6 5 0$ . The nested tested derived mean SSVs compared well with FFU derived mean SSVs and were within $4 . 8 \%$ .

The FFU study was also done on the ADVIA $^ { \textregistered } 2 4 0 0$ and 1200 systems to compare the 1650 derived mean SSVs with the SSVs derived on the ADVIA ® 1200 and the ADVIA ® 2400.

Shelf life stability: 24 months.

Open vial stability: 28 days at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not Applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
