# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA $\mathrm { I M S } ^ { \mathrm { \textregistered } }$ Troponin I Ultra (TnI-Ultra) assay is a heterogenous sandwich immunoassay using magnetic separation. Reagent 1 (R1) contains a fluoresceinated monoclonal antibody to troponin I and Reagent 2 (R2) contains a polyclonal antibody to troponin I conjugated to the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The sandwich complex formed by the analyte and the antibody conjugates is captured by the magnetic particles so that the troponin I concentration in the sample can be measured in terms of enzyme activity. The enzyme substrate used for this assay is a dioxetane phosphate derivative, which is dephosphorylated by ALP resulting in photon emission. Luminescence is measured by a photomultiplier tube. The dose response curve is proportional to the analyte concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Imprecision was evaluated in a protocol similar to CLSI EP5-A. Studies were performed over a 10-day period on two instruments with serum pools and Bayer Cardiac Control materials. The protocol consisted of five replicates of each control or pool and one run per day per system.

To determine the functional sensitivity of the assay, a series of low serum pools was prepared by sequential dilutions of a low sample with a negative serum pool and run on two instruments over a ten day period. Recoveries for the low serum pools from the two instruments were combined and the total CV was calculated. The level for the $10 \%$ total CV was estimated to be 0.03 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The upper $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of normal distribution was found to be 0.04 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ for serum ${ \bf \langle n = } 3 3 7 _ { . }$ ).

The assay meets the guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology that the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of a reference group is used as the cutoff for increased troponin levels and that the assay should have the imprecision (total CV) at the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile cutoff of $10 \%$ or less.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To determine the high dose hook effect, high levels of troponin I antigen were spiked into negative serum pool. The reaction rates of the spiked samples were obtained from the ADVIA IMS. There was no drop in rates for TnI concentrations up to $1 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Serum samples with high troponin I concentrations were mixed in various proportions with serum samples containing low levels of troponin I with expected concentrations ranging from 0.01 to $3 6 . 2 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . When compared to the expected value, the measured (observed) values of troponin I averaged $103 \%$ with a range of 98.9 to $1 0 8 . 8 \%$ . Linearity was also evaluated by spiking troponin I in the calibrator serum base. These pools were then mixed in various proportions to prepare five levels with expected concentrations ranging from 0.2 to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and tested on two ADVIA IMS systems. When compared to the expected value, the measured (observed) values averaged $1 0 0 . 5 \%$ with a range of 96 to $106 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ADVIA $\mathrm { I M S } ^ { \mathrm { \textregistered } }$ TnI-Ultra method is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using purified material. Assigned values of the calibrators are traceable to this standardization. The calibrator value is assigned through a two step process. The Master Lot value is assigned via serum sample correlation between the ADVIA IMS TnI and the ACS:180 TnI assays. The assigned calibrator values are based on in-house and external clinical trial correlation data. The future lots are value assigned through a nested testing protocol.

Calibrators, after storage at the recommended storage condition are tested through the recommended shelf life. Data from calibrators stored at stress temperatures are utilized to ensure lot to lot consistency and provide information for product stability during shipping. The ADVIA $\mathrm { I M S } ^ { \mathbb { R } }$ TnIUltra Calibrator is stable at $\leq 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until the expiration date on the vial. Thawed calibrators should be stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for up to 7 days. Aliquots can be stored frozen for up to 30 days.

# d. Detection limit:

The minimum detectable concentration (MDC) was determined by running 20 replicates of a serum pool from normal donors. The mean rate and standard

deviation from the normal serum pool were calculated. The concentrations corresponding to mean rate $+ 2$ times S.D. was determined to be $0 . 0 1 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Potential cross reactants to troponin I were spiked into serum pools and tested for cross-reactivity. Cardiac troponin T, troponin C and skeletal troponin I all showed negligible cross-reactivity. Serum pools spiked with hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , triglyceride up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , bilirubin up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and albumin up to $6 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ showed less than $5 \%$ interference.

f. Assay cut-off: See clinical cutoff

# b. Matrix comparison:

Lithium heparin and serum sample pairs were assayed with the ADVIA $\mathrm { I M S } ^ { \mathbb { B } }$ TnI-Ultra assay. The linear regression equation is: y (Heparinized plasma) $=$ $0 . 8 9 0 8 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } ( \mathrm { s e r u m } ) + 0 . 2 3 2 7$ ; $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 3$ , ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 4 5$ , with values ranging from 0.03 to $1 9 . 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The dose recoveries for the plasma samples were about $1 1 \%$ lower than the corresponding serum samples. The labeling contains the instructions that plasma samples showed an $1 1 \%$ reduction in dose compared to serum samples and to not use heparinized plasma and serum samples from the same patient interchangeable with this test.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity:

The clinical sensitivity based on the ACS:180 assay (k980528), to which this assay is equivalent, was determined to be $9 4 . 6 \%$ .

b. Clinical specificity:

The clinical specificity based on the ACS:180 assay(k980528), to which this assay is equivalent, was determined to be $9 8 . 8 \%$ . See k

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

# 4. Clinical cut-off:

The upper 99th percentile of normal distribution was determined using 337 serum samples from donors with no known cardiovascular diseases. The samples were assayed with the TnI-Ultra method and the troponin values were numerically ranked. The 99th percentile was found to be $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The AMI Troponin I cut-off value is based on the data for the ACS:180 troponin I assay (k980528) to which the ADVIA IMS TnI-Ultra method is equivalent. Evaluation of a population of patients from multiple clinical sites was performed. The patient population which included both females and males consisted of 112 individuals who ruled-in for AMI and 166 patients who ruled-out for AMI. Patient results were analyzed using Cumulative Distribution Analysis (CDA). The diagnostic cutoff for AMI patients was determined to be $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The upper 99th percentile of normal distribution was determined using 337 serum samples from donors with no known cardiovascular diseases. The samples were assayed with the TnI-Ultra method and the troponin values were numerically ranked. The 99th percentile was found to be $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .
