# I. Device Description:

Cliniqa Liquid QC Bilirubin Controls Levels 1, 2, & 3 are prepared from human serum and purified chemicals. Preservatives and stabilizers are added to maintain product integrity. Cliniqa LiniCAL Bilirubin Calibration Verifiers Levels A - E for Olympus AU Systems are human-serum based, containing constituents of human origin and are used in the clinical laboratory to verify calibration and/or assess linearity of the Olympus AU Systems. Five assayed levels of Bilirubin are provided to allow monitoring of the reportable range.

Each serum donor unit used to manufacture this product was tested for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), HIV-1 antigen, antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and ntibody to HIV-1/2 and found non-reactive using FDA accepted test methods.

Cliniqa Liquid QC Bilirubin Controls Levels 1, 2, & 3 are 0.30, 7.76, and $2 2 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for total bilirubin respectively and 0.10, 3.20, and $8 . 0 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for direct bilirubin respectively.

The Cliniqa LiniCAL Bilirubin Calibration Verifiers Levels A - E for Olympus AU Systems have a series of analyte concentrations ranging from $0 . 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to 32 mg/dL for total bilirubin and $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 0 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for direct bilirubin.

# Stability

Stability characteristics of the Cliniqa Liquid QC Bilirubin Controls Levels 1, 2, & 3 and the of Cliniqa LiniCAL Bilirubin Calibration Verifiers Levels A - E for Olympus AU Systems were determined using the Arrhenius model of accelerated elevated temperature studies to predict estimated storage stability at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial stability was determined in a real time on board stability study at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } C } }$ on an Olympus AU 400 chemistry analyzer.
