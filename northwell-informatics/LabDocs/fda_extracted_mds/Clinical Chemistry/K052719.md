# Legally marketed devices which we are claiming equivalence:

Bayer Corporation MULTISTIX 10 SG Reagent Strips

# Device Description:

URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips provide qualitative and semi-quantitative for pH, specific gravity, blood, prote nite lukocye gucoe, bbin, anduoen uriUT 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips are firm plastic, dry reagent strips.The reagent areas are dipped into theurine sample and read visually according to a color chart or are read instrumentally with a Bayer® Family of Clinitek Urine Analyzers.The results are available within 120 seconds.To obtain optimal results, it is necessary to use fresh, well-mixed and uncentrifuged urine.

# Intended Use:

ARJ Medical URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips are for single use in professional near patient (pointocare) facilities and centralized laboratory locations by medical technologists both read visually and on the Bayer Family of Clinitek Analyzers. .

# Assessment of Performance:

The performance of URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips was studied in a clinical laboratory setting. The trips were read visually and instrumentally using the Family of Bayer Clinitek Urine Analyzers.The results were compared to results obtained from Bayer MULTISTIX 10 SG reagent strips. The studies demonstrated that professional users in centralized and point-of-care (POC) hospital, clinical and doctor's office setting can obtain valid urinalysis test results.

# Conclusion:

URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips provide 10 reagent tests of urinalysis that are similar in composition and performance to reagent tests currently provided by devices on the U.S. market. URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips are suitable for use in point-of-care (POC) settings. ARJ Medical studies showed that URITEST 10 Urinalysis Reagent Strips provide test results consistent with laboratory methods and performance comparable to that of Bayer MULTISTIX 10 SG Reagent Strips in POC, hospital, and clinical settings.
