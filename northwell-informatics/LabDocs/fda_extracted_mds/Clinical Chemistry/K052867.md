Common Names: Total iron binding capacity assay

Classification Names: Iron-binding capacity test system (862.1415): Class: I

Calibrator (862.1150): Calibrator Ki 29: Class II.

Quality Control material (assayed and unassayed) (862.1660): Class I (general controls). Since these devices (VITROS Performance Verifiers I & II) are assayed controls, they meet the reserved criteria under Section 510(l) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

# 4 Predicate Devices

The VITROS Chemistry Products dTIBC assay is substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring Total Iron Binding Capacity (IBCT) Flex® assay on the Dimension® clinical chemistry systems.

The VITROS Chemistry Products Performance Verifiers I and II are substantially equivalent to the VITROS Chemistry Products Performance Verifiers I and II.

# 5. Device description

The VITROS Chemistry Products dTIBC Reagent is used in conjunction with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 29 on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the quantitative measurement of TIBC in human serum.

The VITROS Chemistry Products dTIBC Reagent is a dual chambered package containing ready-to-use liquid reagents. Reagent 1, an acidic buffer containing ferric ions bound to chromazurol B (iron-binding dye) is added to the sample. The acidic pH releases iron from transferrin and the released iron binds to the excess chromazurol B. Reagent 2, a neutral buffer is added, shifting the pH, which results in increased affinity'of transferrin for iron. Serum transferrin rapidly extracts iron from the dye- iron complex. The decrease in absorbance of the colored dye-iron complex is directly proportional to the total iron-binding capacity of the sample and is measured spectrophotometrically at 660 nm. Once a calibration has been performed, the TIBC concentration in each unknown sample can be determined using the stored calibration curve and the measured absorbance obtained in the assayof the sample.

The VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 29 is a two level standard used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the quantitative measurement of total iron binding capacity (TIBC). VITROS Calibrator Kit 29 level 1 is an aqueous solution containing processed bovine serum albumin, and preservative. VITROS Calibrator Kit 29 level 2 is a lyophilate containing processed human serum, proteins, enzymes, organic compounds, electrolytes, immunoglobulins, inorganic compounds, hormones, and metals. The VITROS Chemistry Products FS Reconstitution Diluent is processed water used to reconstitute the VITROS Calibrator Kit 29 level 2.

The VITROS Chemistry Products Performance Verifiers I and II are lyophilized materials prepared from processed human serum to which enzymes, electrolytes, stabilizers, preservatives, and other organic analytes have been added. The lypohilate is reconstituted using diluent manufactured from processed water to which inorganic salts have been added. These are assayed quality control materials are used to monitor the performance of the VITROS dTIBC assay on the VITROS 5,1 FS System.

5. Device description (continued)

The VITROS dTIBC assay utilizes VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 2 (BSA/Saline), a common reagent that is used by multiple assays on the VITROS 5,1 FS System. This is a dual chambered package containing two ready-to-use liquid diluents. Diluent 1 (Saline) is prepared from processed water to which inorganic salt has been added. Diluent 2 (BSA) is prepared from processed water to which bovine serum albumin, inorganic salts and preservatives have been added.

The VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System is a clinical chemistry instrument that provides automated use of the VITROS Chemistry Products MicroTip® and MicroSlides® range of products. The VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System was cleared for market by a separate 510(k) premarket notification (K031924).

Device intended uses

7. Comparison to predicate devices

The VITROS Chemistry Products dTIBC Reagent and VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 29 are substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring Total Iron Binding Capacity (IBCT) Flex® reagent cartridge (K994115) on the Dimension® clinical chemistry systems. (K994115) and Dade Behring IBCT Calibrator (K994114) (predicate devices) which were cleared by the FDA for IVD use.

The relationship between the VITROS dTIBC assay and the predicate device, determined by least squares linear regression, is:

$$
\mathrm { V I T R O S \ d T I B C } = 0 . 9 4 \mathrm { X } + 1 2 . 9 9 ( \mu g / d \mathrm { L } ) ,
$$

with a correlation coefficient of 0.981, where X is the Dade Behring Total Iron Binding Capacity (IBCT) Flex assay on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system.

The VITROS Chemistry Products Performance Verifiers I & II are substantially equivalent to the VITROS Chemistry Products Performance Verifiers I & II (predicate device) which was cleared by the FDA (K042006) for IVD use.

In addition to correlation studies, bench testing was performed to determine assay precision, linearity, specificity, expected values, limit of detection, dilution and specimen matrix of the VITROS dTIBC assay.

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the similarities and differences between the new devices and the predicates.
