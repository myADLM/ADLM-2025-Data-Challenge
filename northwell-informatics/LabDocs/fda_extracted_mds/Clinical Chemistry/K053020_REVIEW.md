# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP7A- Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry

# L. Test Principle:

The ADVIA Centaur TnI-Ultra assay is a three-site sandwich immunoassay that utilizes direct chemiluminometric technology. The Binary Lite reagent includes a polyclonal goat anti-troponin I antibody labeled with acridinium ester and two biotinylated monoclonal anti-troponin I antibodies. The solid phase reagent is magnetic latex particles conjugated with streptavidin. The antibodies in the Binary Lite reagent bind to troponin I in the sample. The biotin contained in the immune complex then binds to the streptavidin-labeled magnetic particles. A direct relationship exists between the amount of troponin I present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLU) detected by the system.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Imprecision studies were conducted over a 20 day period on two instruments with commercially available control materials and patient pools. The following samples were run in duplicate in one run per day per system.

To determine the functional sensitivity of the assay, a series of low serum pools was prepared by sequential dilution of a low sample with a negative serum pool and run on two instruments over a 20 day period. Recoveries for the low serum pools and controls from the two instruments were combined and the total $\%$ C.V. was calculated. The level for the $10 \%$ and $20 \%$ total CV was estimated to be $0 . 0 4 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $0 . 0 2 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ respectively. The upper $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of normal distribution was found to be $0 . 0 4 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ for serum $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 6 4 8 )$ .

The assay meets the guidelines from the European Society of Cardiologist and American College of Cardiology that the assay demonstrate an imprecision (total $\%$ CV) of $10 \%$ or less at the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of a normal reference population.

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

To determine the high dose effect related with the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TnIUltra Assay, high levels of troponin I antigen was spiked into negative serum pools. The reaction rates of the spiked samples were obtained from the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TnI-Ultra Assay. There was no drop in rates for TnI concentrations up to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ .

Serum samples with high troponin I concentrations were diluted with negative serum and obtained expected concentrations ranging from $0 . 7 2 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to $4 4 . 3 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . When compared to the expected value, the measured (observed) values of troponin I averaged $103 \%$ with a range of 91.6 to $1 1 3 \%$ . In addition, linearity was also studied in a high dose dilution recovery study. A high patient pool was created by diluting a patient sample $( > 5 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) with a negative patient sample. The observed concentrations ranged from 8.59 to 49.76 and the recoveries ranged from $9 6 \%$ to $100 \%$ . The linearity (from 8.59 to $4 9 . 7 6 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ ) equation for observed (y) and Theoretical $\mathbf { \rho } ( \mathbf { x } )$ was $\scriptstyle \mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 9 \mathbf { x }$ - 0.42 with a $\mathtt { R } ^ { 2 }$ of 0.999.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ADVIA Centaur TnI-Ultra method is standardized to an internal standard manufactured using purified materials. Assigned values of the calibrators are traceable to this standard. The calibrator value is assigned through a two step process. The lyophilized calibrators are value assigned as zero to approximately $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . All future lots of calibrators will be value assigned against the master lot via nested testing procedures. The test lot and the master lot, together with previous lots, are value assigned through nested testing in the same run using ten replicates for each control level. The ADVIA Centaur system uses 2-point calibration of a master curve that is distributed with the reagent as a printed master curve card. The system uses the RLU’s of the calibrators to adjust the master curve and this adjusted master curve is used for all calculations of patient sample and control doses. The sponsor suggests that calibration should occur with every new reagent lot and/or every 28 days within a lot.

Calibrators, after storage at the recommended storage condition are tested through the recommended shelf life. Shelf life was determined by analyzing calibrators throughout the time frame. The calibrators are assessed with dose determinations from the gold master curve as well as in its ability to calibrate an assay and recover appropriate control doses. The calibrators are stable for 10 months or until the expiration listed on the calibrator.

# d. Detection limit:

The minimum detectable concentration (analytical sensitivity) was determined by running twenty replicated of a negative serum pool. The mean RLU’s and SD from the negative serum pool were calculated. The concentration

corresponding to rate $+ \ 2 \mathrm { x S D }$ was determined to be $0 . 0 0 8 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The analytical determination was calculated on a base pool by assaying in five replicates on the three instruments over four days using two lots.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Potential cross reactants to troponin I were spiked into negative serum pool and tested for cross reactivity. Cardiac troponin T, troponin C, skeletal troponin I, actin, CK-MB and myoglobin all showed negligible cross reactivity.

Serum pools spiked with hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , triglyceride up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , bilirubin up to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and albumin up to $6 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ showed less than $10 \%$ interference.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Correlation of the ACS:180 cTnI assay versus the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TnI Ultra assay was evaluated with serum samples. Two sets of ranges were analyzed and calculated in order to capture medically relevant doses: 0.1 to approximately $3 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and 0.1 to approximately $4 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The results were analyzed with the Passing-Bablok regression in addition to the leastsquares regression method. The results for both ranged are summarized below.

b. Matrix comparison:

Lithium heparin and serum sample pairs were assayed with the ADVIA Centaur $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ TnI-Ultra Assay. The linear regression equations are below:

y(Heparinized plasma) $=$ 0.91x(serum) $+ 0 . 6 7$ ; $\mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 6 4$ and $\mathtt { n } { = } 5 3$ $\mathrm { Y ( E D T A \ p l a s m a ) } { = } 0 . 8 1 \mathrm { x ( s e r u m ) } + 0 . 1 5 \ ; \mathrm { r = } 0 . 9 6 4 \ \mathrm { a }$ nd $\mathrm { n } { = } 3 1$ .

Evaluation of heparinized and EDTA plasma samples resulted in a mean $1 \%$ and $4 \%$ decrease in observed values, respectively, compared to serum. The labeling contains the instructions that plasma and serum samples from the same patient should not be used interchangeably with this test.

$b$ . Clinical specificity: The clinical specificity based on the ACS:180 assay, to which this assay is equivalent, was determined to be $9 7 . 0 \%$ .   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off:

Using the definition of MI as described by the World Health Organization (WHO), evaluation of a population consisting of patients from multiple clinical sites was previously performed using the ACS:180 cTnI assay. The patient population which included both males and females consisted of 112 individuals who ruled-in for AMI and 166 individuals who ruled-out for AMI. Results from clinical data were analyzed based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots using the guidelines presented in CLSI document GP10-A. A $0 . 9 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ diagnostic cutoff was determined.

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

The upper $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of normal distribution was determined using 648 healthy individuals ranging from 17 to 91 years of age. The samples were assayed with the TnI-Ultra method and the troponin values were numerically ranked. The $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile was found to be $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
