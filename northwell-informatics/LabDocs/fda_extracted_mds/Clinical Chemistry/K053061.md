2. Device Name / Classification

Emit® 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay / Class II

# 3. Identification of the Predicate Device

Abbott TDx®/TDxFLx $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood Assay, P890025

# 4. Device Description

The Emit® 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay employs a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique used for the analysis of cyclosporine in whole blood. The assay contains mouse monoclonal antibodies with a high specificity for cyclosporine.

The Emit® 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay is based on competition for cyclosporine antibody binding sites. Cyclosporine in the sample competes with cyclosporine in Enzyme Reagent B that is labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Active (unbound) enzyme converts the oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Antibody Reagent A to NADH, resulting in a kinetic absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, allowing the cyclosporine concentration in the sample to be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroides) enzyme employed in the assay.

# 5. Device Intended Use

The Emi $- \textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay is for in vitro quantitative analysis of cyclosporine (CsA) in human whole blood as an aid in the management of cyclosporine therapy in kidney, heart and liver transplant patients.

# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information

The Emit $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to the Abbott $\mathrm { T D } \mathbf { x } \textcircled { \mathbf { B } } / \mathrm { T D } \mathbf { x } \mathbf { F } \mathbf { L } \mathbf { x } \textcircled { \mathbf { B } }$ Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood Assay. Both devices are immunoassays intended for use in the quantitative measurement of cyclosporine in human whole blood. The Emit $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay has an assay range of $4 0 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ or $3 5 0 { - } 2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The Abbott TDx®/TDxFLx $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood Assay has an assay range of $2 5 { \cdot } 1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ E

# Comparison Information

Method comparison studies were conducted at two external sites comparing the extended range Emit $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 2000 Cyclosporine Specific Assay against two predicates:

the Abbott $\mathrm { T D } \mathbf { x } \textcircled { \mathrm { R } } / \mathrm { T D } \mathbf { x } \mathrm { F } \mathbf { L } \mathbf { x } \textcircled { \mathrm { R } }$ Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood Assay, and liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS)

Banked retrospective samples from 3 transplant patient groups (heart, liver and kidney) were used in the studies. The data from both sites were pooled and analyzed by linear regression.

Dear Yuk-Ting:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
