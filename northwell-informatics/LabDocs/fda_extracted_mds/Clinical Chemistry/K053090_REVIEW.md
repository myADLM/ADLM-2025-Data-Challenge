# L. Test Principle:

The Dri-STAT $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Enzymatic Bilirubin Reagent employs an enzymatic method, in which bilirubin oxidase catalyses the oxidation of bilirubin and produces a loss in the characteristic yellow absorption band. In the assay medium provided, total bilirubin is determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at $4 7 9 \mathrm { n m }$ and $5 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The total absorption change is proportional to the concentration of bilirubin in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Imprecision was assessed by three control samples and one serum pool. Four randomized runs were performed five times over twenty days. Each run contained two replicates. Acceptance criteria is a SD of $< 0 . 1 5$ for the within run and a SD ${ < } 0 . 2 2 5$ for the total imprecision. The results are presented in the table below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity of the bilirubin measurement was demonstrated by taking a pooled serum sample and splitting into two samples. One sample is spiked with purified bilirubin to a concentration of $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The two samples were inter-diluted to make a total of seven levels spanning the range of the assay 0- $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Each sample was tested in triplicate and the average recovery was calculated and plotted against the targeted recoveries. Linear regression of comparison data yielded the following relationship:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 2 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 0 7 , \mathbf { r } = 1
$$

The reportable range for bilirubin measurements is $0 . 2 { - } 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The calibrators were previously cleared under k791141. The traceability process is based on prEN ISO 17511.

The configuration and formulation of the bilirubin reagent is the same as the predicate, therefore the shelf life stability of the assay was determined in the predicate submission k843174 and not repeated for this submission.

On-board stability was determined by calibrating the instrument and running controls solutions. The controls were periodically run over 18 days and the values were compared to the original values. Acceptance criterion is $\pm 1 . 3$ times the within run Imprecision SD $\mathrm { ( 0 . 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } ) }$ or $C V \%$ $( 3 \% )$ . On-board stability demonstrated acceptable stability of 14-days.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity of the assay was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of saline (zero) and a patient sample diluted (with saline) to achieve a concentration less than the claimed sensitivity. Assay sensitivity is distinguishable with $9 5 \%$ confidence $\pm 2$ SD. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is $0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The functional sensitivity is defined as the lowest bilirubin concentration determined at a CV of less than $20 \%$ . The functional sensitivity was determined to be $0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere with the method. A substance was considered to show no significant interference if the test sample was within $0 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $6 \%$ of the control specimen recovery. A summary of the data for know interferents appears for the common interferents in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Clinical correlation studies were performed comparing the Dri-STAT Enzymatic Bilirubin reagent results on the Synchron LX and CX systems against the results from the Cobas Fara using serum samples. The correlations are as follows:

$$
\mathrm { L X P l a t f o r m - y } = 1 . 0 3 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 1 6 , \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 7 , \mathrm { n } = 7 0
$$

$$
C X ~ { \mathrm { P l a t f o r m } } - \mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 0 4 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 0 4 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 7 , \mathbf { n } = 7 0 
$$

b. Matrix comparison:

A serum and plasma comparison study was conducted to substantiate the use of EDTA anticoagulant for bilirubin testing. Paired samples were analyzed by the assay on the Synchron Systems. The correlation was as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 5 2 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 0 3 8 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 , \mathbf { n } { = } 5 8
$$

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The following reference range was obtained from the literature and verified by drawing blood from 20 apparently non-smoking healthy adults. All samples were run in duplicate. The acceptance criteria required at least $90 \%$ of the samples to have bilirubin values within the cited reference interval. The reference range was determined to be $0 . 3 - 1 . 2 \mathrm { m g . d L }$ .
