# K. Test Principle:

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CCRP Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product intended to be used to calibrate the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CardioPhase $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Cat. No. RF434) method for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system with the heterogeneous immunoassay module. The hsCRP method is a one step enzyme immunoassay based on the "sandwich" principle.

# L. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability

Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at 4°C with product stored at -70°C to ensure that analytical system drift is dissociated with calibrator drift. Linear regression across the shelf life interval for each test sample versus test day will have non-significant slopes (p> 0.05) or observed drift within +/-5% for non-zero samples and +/-0.05 mg/L at 0 mg/L CRP over a 12 month interval The shelf life of the product will be 6 months after the successful completion of 7 months of real time stability on three lots of product.

# 2. Traceability:

The assigned values of the CCRP calibrator are standardized to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) International Reference Preparation for Plasma Proteins, the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The basis of this international standardization is the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference preparation for 14 human serum proteins (Lot No. 91/0619=CRM470=RPPHS 91/0619) (lot V).

# 3. Value Assignment

Three Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry analyzers are calibrated with the approved CCRP Masterpool. The acceptable recovery of an approved CCRP Calibrator lot must be obtained. Test calibrator levels are then tested on three separate analyzers with different CCRP flex lots. The grand mean of all 5 replicate test means of all 9 curves is the value assignment for each Calibrator Level.

Dear Ms. Tasker:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
