# I. Device Description:

The high sensitivity C-reactive protein calibrator is a liquid bovine serum albuminbased product. Levels 2 -5 contain a human C-reactive protein.10 vials in each box. There are 5 levels and each vial contains $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ each.

Human source material was tested and found negative for HIV 1 and 2, HBV and HCV using FDA approved methods.

# L. Test Principle:

The general calibration procedure is described in the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system manual. All sampling , reagent delivery, mixing, separation, processing and printing of results are automatically performed by the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system with the heterogeneous immunoassay module. The following information should be considered when calibrating the CCRP method:

Assay Range: $0 . 1 - 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$

Calibrator Target Levels: $0 , 1 , 6 , 1 0 , 1 7 \mathrm { m g / L }$ (These levels may vary based on lot to lot assignment.)

Calibration Scheme, Replicates: 4 $@$ level 1, 3 $@$ level 2 and 3, 2 $@$ level 4 and 3 $@$ level 5 (This scheme is performed automatically by the instrument)

Calibration Frequency: Each new reagent cartridge lot. Every 30 days for any lot.

Preparation: Allow liquid calibrator to equilibrate to room temperature $( 2 2 \mathrm { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and swirl to mix before use.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The assigned values are standardized to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) International Reference Preparation for Plasma Proteins, the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The basis of this international standardization is the IFCC/BCR/CAP reference preparation for 14 human serum proteins (Lot No. 91/0619 $\Vdash$ CRM470 $\vDash$ RPPHS 91/0619) (lot V)

Calibrator Stability Testing Protocol : Study Duration: 13 months

Reference: Identical lot of product stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$   
• Testing Replicates: Five (5) replicates per level   
Testing Frequency: Product is stored at $2 - 8 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and throughout testing cycle and tested at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, 63, 91, 189, 273, 301, 364, 392. The control material is stored at $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ and tested at the same frequency.   
• Freeze/Thaw Testing: Product is frozen and thawed three (3) times then stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Testing occurs on days 28, 91, 189, 273, 364, 392. Stressed Stability: Product is stored at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2 days, then $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 1 day at the beginning of the study. The product at the elevated temperatures is then redistributed at $2 - 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ after the third day. The vials are then tested at days 28, 91, 189, 273, 364, 392.   
• Acceptance Criteria: Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ with product stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to ensure that analytical system drift is dissociated with calibrator drift. Linear regression across the shelf life interval for each test sample versus test day will have non-significant slopes $( \mathsf { p } { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ or observed drift within $\pm 5 \%$ for non-zero samples and $\pm 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$ at $0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ CRP over a 12 month interval.
