# L. Test Principle:

The Wako Total Bilirubin V uses an enzymatic method for bilirubin detection. Total bilirubin reacts with vanadate under acidic conditions, and is oxidized to biliverdin. The resulting absorbance change is colorimetrically measured at $4 5 1 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ .

1. Analytical performance:

All studies were conducted on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer unless stated otherwise.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-run precision was conducted with Wako Total Bilirubin V with 22 and/or 23 replicates of five sample concentrations.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

A dilution linearity study was conducted and the sponsor claims a reportable range of 0.1 to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . When total bilirubin concentration exceeds 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , a 1:1 sample dilution with saline is required and the result is multiplied by 2. Seventy two plasma and serum pairs that ranged from 0.46 to $3 8 . 9 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were analyzed and the linear regression equation was reported as $\mathbf { y } { = } 0 . 9 8 1 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 4 4$ and $\mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 9$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Wako Total Bilirubin is stable when stored at 2 to $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until its expiration date.

# d. Detection limit:

The minimum level of detection is $0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and was calculated by running a known zero sample (water) for 21 replicates. The mean plus 2 SD was used to calculate the minimum level of detection of $0 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

No interference was observed by ascorbic acid up to $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and intrafat up to $2 \%$ . Anticoagulants were also studied and no interference was detected with EDTA, citrate, oxalate, sodium flouride and

heparin.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The Wako Total Bilirubin $\mathrm { V }$ was compared to the Wako Total Bilirubin V that was previously cleared in 1997. A comparison of bilirubin measurements by the current device (y) and the predicate device (x) was performed using 89 serum samples. The equation of $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 0 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 0 0 5$ with an $\mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 9$ was obtained with using the ADVIA 1650 instrument.

# b. Matrix comparison:

A comparison of 36 matched serum and plasma samples (31 patient samples and 5 spiked samples run in duplicate) that ranged from 0.46 to $3 8 . 9 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was performed. Of the 36 matched serum and plasma samples, 5 were spiked with a concentrated form of human bilirubin calibrator to evaluate the comparison at the high end of the linear range. The 31 patient samples were drawn fresh daily and run in duplicates for 7 days. The comparison was preformed on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer and gave the following equation: $\mathbf { y } { = } 0 . 9 8 1 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 4 3$ and $_ { \mathrm { r = 0 . 9 9 } }$ .

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor states that the expected value of total bilirubin in serum and plasma is 0.2 to $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as recommended in Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry by Carl A. Burtis and Edward R. Ashwood.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
