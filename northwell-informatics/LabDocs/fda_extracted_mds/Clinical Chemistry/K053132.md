# 510(K) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

Serum and plasma measurement is widely used as a screening test for liver functions. The methods most widely used for determination of serum bilirubin are the diazo coupling method 13 and the bilirubin oxidase enzymatic methodHowever, these methods have disadvantages such as interference by coexistent serum substances unsatisfactory stability of reagents after preparation. Wako Direct Bilirubin V is based on a chemical oxidation method, utilizing vanadate as an oxidating agent, shows good correlation with conventional methods, practically no interference by coexistent serum. and plasma substances, and is convenient ready-to-use liquid type reagent®.

When a sample is mixed with the reagent containing the detergent and the vanadate, at around pH3, direct bilirubin in the sample is oxidized to biliverdin. This causes the absorbance of yellow, specific to bilirubin, to decrease. Therefore, the direct bilirubin concentration in the sample can be obtained by measuring the adsorbances before and after the vanadate oxidation.

The safety and effectiveness of the Wako Direct Bilirubin V assay is demonstrated by its substantial equivalency to our previous Direct Bilirubin assay (510(K) # 970986). The previously marketed device (510k# 970986) was marketed for serum samples and this submission adds the use of plasma as a sample. There are no changes to performance claims already established in 510(k) # 970986.

Re: k053132 Trade/Device Name: Wako Direct Bilirubin V Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1110 Regulation Name: Bilirubin (total or direct) test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: LFM Dated: November 7, 2005 Received: November 9, 2005

Dear Ms. Creasy:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If yourdevice is classifd (see above) into either class II (Special Contros) or class II (MA) it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
