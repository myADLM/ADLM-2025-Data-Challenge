# Substantially Equivalent Devices: Product: True $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ 20 One-Step Pregnancy Test Manufactured by: Stanbio Laboratory

# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

The MySetTM Pregnancy Test is to be used for detecting human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. The presence of hCG usually appears about the seventh day after fertilization. The MySetTM Pregnancy Test will detect hCG in urine at a concentration level of $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m l }$ .

# INTENDED USE:

The MySetTM Pregnancy Test is a test for the qualitative determination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine for the early detection of pregnancy. For OverThe-Counter Use.

# SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY:

The One-Step Pregnancy Test employs a unique combination of monoclonal-dye conjugate and mouse monoclonal-solid phase antibodies to selectively identify human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. As the urine sample flows through the absorbent portion of the device, the antibody-dye conjugate binds to the hCG forming an antibody-antigen complex. This complex binds to the anti-hCG antibody in the positive reaction zone and produces a red color band if hCG concentration is equal to or greater than $2 5 \mathrm { m U U / m l }$ .In the absence of hCG, there is no line in the reaction zone. Unbound conjugate binds to the reagents in the control zone, producing a red color band, demonstrating that the test is functioning correctly.

# PERFORMANCE DATA:

A method comparison was done to compare the performance of the MySetTM Pregnancy Test to a FDA cleared product. These data clearly demonstrate the performance of the MySetTM Pregnancy Test by Ani Biotech Oy is substantially equivalent to a commercially available FDA cleared pregnancy test: Stanbio True® 20 One-Step Pregnancy Test (K980531)

Agreement: E $100 \%$

# STATEMENT OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY:

The MySet™M Pregnancy Test when compared with another commonly used pregnancy test (Stanbio True 20-K980531) demonstrated $100 \%$ performance.

These data clearly demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the MySetTM Pregnancy Test and further confirm that the accuracy of this product when compared to a substantially equivalent device currently being sold.

Testing by untrained women of childbearing years confirmed that the test can be effectively performed by untrained individuals.
