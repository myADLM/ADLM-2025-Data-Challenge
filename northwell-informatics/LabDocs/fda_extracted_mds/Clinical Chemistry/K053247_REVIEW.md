# I. Device Description:

The VALIDATE® Cardiac Marker Calibration (CM1) Verification Test Set contains CK-MB and myoglobin in a human serum matrix. It is comprised of one bottle each of six (6) levels including zero. The sponsor states that for both analytes the contents of Level 0 and Level 1 are identical and should recover the same value. Each bottle contains $3 \mathrm { m L }$ and is shipped frozen.

The CM1 Test Set was tested and found negative for HIV-1/2, HCV, HBV, and HBsAg by FDA approved methods.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP-6A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline

Guidance for Industry: Points to Consider Guidance Document on Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The raw materials (purified human CK-MB and myoglobin) are processed into a stock solution, analyzed, and spiked into the human serum base matrix. The product also includes stabilizers and preservatives. The sponsor states that for value assignment, levels 0, 1, and 5 are assayed in triplicate in three analytical runs while levels 2, 3, and 4 are assayed in triplicate in two analytical runs. Two levels of control material are run with each determination and must fall within the cited acceptance range for the run to be accepted.

Stability is assessed by measuring recoveries in both real-time and accelerated studies.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not Applicable

N. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
