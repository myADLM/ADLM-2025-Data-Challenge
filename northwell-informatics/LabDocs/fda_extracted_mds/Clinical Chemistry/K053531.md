# Device Description:

The FT4 method is a homogenous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCITM) technology. The LOCITM

# 000004

reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring, weaker binding analog of T4, and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a fraction of the biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free T4 concentration. In a second step, T3 chemibeads are added and form bead/ biotinylated antibody immunocomplexes with the non-saturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. When illuminated by light at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , sensibeads convert dissolved oxygen in the reaction solution into the singlet oxygen form $( ^ { 1 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } )$ . In the bead pairs, the singlet oxygen diffuses ("channels") into chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is an inverse function of the concentration of free T4 in the sample.

The Dimension Vista™M LOCI I Calibrator is a three level, liquid, multi-analyte product. This product's matrix is bovine serum albumin and it contains buffer, stabilizer and preservatives. Level A is a zero level, while levels B and C contain human thyroxine, triodothyronine and thyroid stimulating hormone. Values are assigned to the calibrator from a masterpool that is traceable through a patient correlation study to an existing comparative method for FT3 and FT4. The TSH value is referenced to the WHO standard, 2nd IRP 80/588, and confirmed with the 3rd IS 81/565.

# Intended Use:

The Dimension Vista™M Free Thyroxine Flex® reagent cartridge (FT4) is an in-vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Free thyroxine in human serum and plasma.

The Dimension VistarM LOCl I Calibrator is an in-vitro diagnostic product intended for the calibration of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Free Triodothyronine (FT3), and Free Thyroxine (FT4).

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

Both the Dimension VistaTM Free Thyroxine Flex® reagent cartridge and the predicate Advia Centaur FrT4 assay employ prepackaged reagents for use on automated clinical chemistry test systems. A comparison of the important similarities and differences of these methods is provided in the following table:

Device Namc: Dimension VistaTM Free Thyroxine Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (FT4)

Indications For Use:

The Dimension VistaTM Free Thyroxine Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (FT4) is a device intended to measure Free (not protein bound) thyroxine (thyroid hormone) in serum and plasma. Levels of free thyroxine in plasma are thought to reflect the amount of thyroxine hormone available to the cells and may therefore determine the clinical metabolic status of thyroxine. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease.
