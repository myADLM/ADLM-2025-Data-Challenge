# Device Name

Trade Name: Common Name: Classification: DPC Catalog Number:

IMMULITE®/IMMULITE® 1000 Turbo Intact PTH Intact Parathyroid Hormone Assay Class II device, CEW 21 CFR 862.1545 LSKPTZ (50 tests)

# Description of Device

IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH is a solid-phase, chemiluminescent immunometric assay employing a goat polyclonal anti-PTH (44-84) antibody as the capture antibody and a goat polyclonal anti-PTH (1-34) antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as the detection antibody.

# Indications for Use

"For in vitro diagnostic use with the IMMULITE and IMMULITE 1000 Analyzers — for the quantitative measurement of intact parathyroid hormone (parathyrin, PTH) in EDTA plasma or serum. It is intended as an aid in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia and can be used intraoperatively."

# Manufacturing Site

IMMULITE®/MMULITE® 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay is manufactured by Diagnostic Products Corporation at the following locations:

Diagnostic Products Corporation Reagent Manufacturing Division 5700 West $9 6 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Street Los Angeles, CA 90045-5597 FDA Establishment #: 2017183

Diagnostic Products Corporation Corporate Offices 5210 Pacific Concourse Drive Los Angeles, CA 90045-6900 FDA Establishment #: 3005250747

# Performance Equivalence

Substantial equivalence assessment for intra-operative use of the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay is based upon comparison to clinical data. The IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay kit has not changed from its original FDA clearance on July 6, 1999 (K992105).

The IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay results were compared to clinical data when patient samples were tested in the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo assay and results reported during parathyroid surgery. This comparison to clinical data was performed by two groups of researchers, Kao PC, et al. at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester Minnesota and Johnson LR, et al. at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri. Results were reported in peer reviewed journals.

# Summary of Clinical Investigations

Clinical investigations using the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH (parathyroid hormone) assay during parathyroid surgery were conducted by two groups of researchers, one at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (Kao PC, et al.) and the second at University of Washington Medical School/Barnes Jewish Hospital, St. Louis Missouri (Johnson LR, et al.).

The researchers at the Mayo Clinic collected blood specimens from 47 parathryroid gland surgery patients during surgery. The schedule for specimen collection was at baseline (prior to removal of abnormal tissue) and 5, 10, and 20 minutes after beginning parathyroid resection. The generally accepted guideline that a $50 \%$ or greater decrease from the baseline PTH value suggests complete tumor removal was used. Among 47 parathyroidectomy patients tested with the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay, 45 $( 9 6 \% )$ had their plasma intact PTH (iPTH) levels decrease to $< 2 5 \%$ of baseline. A second criterion important for the surgeon is a return to normal iPTH values after parathyroid tissue is removed. This occurred in $87 \%$ of patients in this study and all of them were clinically cured. Collection of blood samples was stopped at 10 minutes in 2 patients and at 15 minutes in 2 patients making this test suitable for the intended intraoperative monitoring purpose.

The researchers at Washington University/Barnes Jewish Hospital examined the performance of the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo iPTH assay intraoperatively in a study group of 49 patients and compared clinical outcomes to a "control" group of 55 patients that underwent parathyroidectomies without intraoperative PTH determinations. This study also employed the generally accepted guideline that a $\geq 5 0 \%$ decrease in the iPTH value from baseline suggests complete tumor removal. Samples were drawn in the operating room before incision and during the period 10-12 minutes after excision of suspected diseased parathyroid gland tissue. Of the 49 patients in the study group, 46 had $a > 5 0 \%$ decrease in iPTH values within the first three post-resection samples. When the control and study groups with similar sex, age, and diagnoses were compared, 44/49 $( 9 0 \% )$ of the patients in the study group and 49/55 $( 8 9 \% )$ of the control patients achieved normocalcemia postoperatively. Thus, the surgery guided by intraoperative IMMULITE/IMMULITE Turbo Intact PTH measurements had identical physiologic outcomes. Frozen section use in the study group was statistically significantly less $( \mathfrak { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ than in the control group.

# Conclusions from Clinical Studies

When used intraoperatively (samples tested and results reported) for parathyroid surgery, the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay provides surgeons with rapid, accurate results corresponding to clinical signs and outcomes. The assay met the generally accepted criterion of $a > 5 0 \%$ decrease from baseline (before incision) with complete tumor removal.

IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay's performance including measuring range, precision, analytical sensitivity, and correspondence to clinical status, makes this test suitable for the intended intraoperative monitoring purpose.
