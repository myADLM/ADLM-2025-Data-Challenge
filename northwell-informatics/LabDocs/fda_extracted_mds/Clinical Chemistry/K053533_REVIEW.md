# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

# L. Test Principle:

IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo Intact PTH is a solid phase chemiluminescent immunometric assay utilizing a goat polyclonal anti-PTH (44-84) antibody as the capture antibody and a goat polyclonal anti-PTH (1-34) antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as the detection antibody.

IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 Turbo mode processes samples at an accelerated rate, with time to first result being 15 minutes and subsequent samples are generated every 45 seconds.

Clinical studies were performed at the Mayo Clinic1 , Rochester, MN (Kao, PC et al.) and Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes Jewish Hospital2 , St. Louis, MO (Johnson, LR, et. al) to evaluate the Immulite/Immulite 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay results on patients undergoing parathyroidectomy. These assay results were compared to clinical data and reported in the following peer reviewed journals:

1. Kao PC, van Heerden JA, Farley DR, et al. Intraoperative monitoring of parathyroid hormone with a rapid automated assay that is commercially available. Annal of Clin & Lab Science 2002; 32(3):244-251.

2. Johnson LR, Doherty G, Lairmore T, et al. Evaluation of the performance and clinical impact of a rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay in conjunction with preoperative imaging and concise parathyroidectomy. Clin Chem 2001; 47(5):919-925.

# Study #1:

The Mayo Clinic Study was conducted between July 1999 and October 2001 using the currently marketed Immulite/Immulite 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay.

EDTA blood specimens were collected from forty seven patients undergoing parathyroidectomy at the following time intervals: baseline (prior to removing the parathyroid gland) and 5, 10, and 20 minutes after parathyroid resection. Turbo Intact PTH results on ninety-four specimens were immediately analyzed. These results were compared to the in-house rapid assay and generated the following correlation: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 4 7 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 1 8 6$ ; $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 6 8$ .

45 of 47patients $( 9 6 \% )$ had their plasma PTH levels decrease to $< 2 5 \ \%$ of the baseline levels. In 41 of 47 patients $( 8 7 \% )$ , the PTH value decreased to <5pmol/L (provisional reference range) within 20 minutes after tumor excision.

The assay met the generally accepted criterion of $1 > 5 0 \%$ decrease from baseline (before incision) with complete tumor removal.

# Study #2:

The Washington University Barnes Jewish Hospital Study evaluated the IMMULITE and IMMULITE 1000 Turbo iPTH assay intraoperatively in 49 patients and compared clinical outcomes to a “control” group of 55 patients that underwent parathyroidectomies without intraoperative PTH determinations. This study also employed the generally accepted guideline that a $2 5 0 \%$ decrease in the iPTH value from baseline suggests complete tumor removal. Samples were drawn in the operating room before incision and during the period 10-12 minutes after excision of suspected diseased parathyroid gland tissue. Of the 49 patients in the study group, 46 had $a > 5 0 \%$ decrease in iPTH values within the first three post-resection samples. When the control and study groups with similar sex, age, and diagnoses were compared, 44/49 $( 9 0 \% )$ of the patients in the study group and 49/55 $( 8 9 \% )$ of the control patients achieved normocalcemia postoperatively. The surgery guided by intraoperative IMMULITE/IMMULITE Turbo Intact PTH measurements had identical physiologic outcomes. Frozen section use in the experimental group was statistically significantly less $\left( \mathrm { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1 \right)$ than in the control group.

The assay met the generally accepted criterion of $a > 5 0 \%$ decrease from baseline (before incision) with complete tumor removal.
