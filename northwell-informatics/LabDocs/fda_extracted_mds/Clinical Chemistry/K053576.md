# Method

The MYO method is a homogenous sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCITM) technology. LOCITM reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-myoglobin monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-myoglobin monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a beadmyoglobin-biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 { \mathrm { n m } }$ and is a direct function of the myoglobin concentration in the sample.

# Calibrator

The Dade Behring MYO Calibrator is a three level (A, B, C), frozen liquid product containing purified human heart myoglobin in a $6 \%$ bovine albumin matrix with stabilizers and preservatives. The kit contains 3 vials of each level $\mathrm { A } { = } 2 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ , $\mathbf { B } { = } \mathrm { ~ l ~ } . 0 \mathrm { ~ m } \mathbf { L }$ , $\mathrm { C } \mathrm { = } 1 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$

# Intended Use:

# Method

For the quantitative measurement of myoglobin in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista™M System as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

# Calibrator

For the calibration of the myoglobin (MYO) method on the Dimension Vista™M System.

# Analytical Results

# Method Comparison

A split sample method comparison demonstrated good agreement between the Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM MYO method and the predicate Dade Behring Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ MYO immunoassay with serum and heparinized plasma patient samples.

<table><tr><td>Comparative</td><td></td><td>Intercept</td><td>Correlation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Method</td><td>Slope</td><td>(ng/mL)</td><td>Coefficient</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>Dimension® MYO</td><td>1.003</td><td>6.98</td><td>0.998</td><td>160</td></tr></table>

The model equation for linear regression statistics is: [results for Dimension $\mathrm { V i s t a } ^ { \mathrm { \tiny { T M } } } \mathrm { M Y O } ] = \mathrm { s l o p e } \mathrm { \bf ~ x }$ EPY [comparative method results] $^ +$ intercept. The range of MYO values in the correlation study was: 12 to $9 3 2 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# Serum/Plasma Comparison

Serum and heparin plasma matched pairs were examined on the Dimension Vista™ system. Serum samples $( n = 3 7 )$ ranging from 28 to $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ when compared to lithium heparin samples gave a slope of 1.05, correlation coefficient of 1.0, and an intercept of ${ \bf \cdot 5 . } 1 2 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ using linear least squares regression statistics.

A separate study was conducted to evaluate the comparison of 115 lithium and sodium heparin samples ranging from $1 6 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ to approximately $8 2 3 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . A linear least squares regression analysis comparing the lithium to sodium heparin samples gave a slope of 1.00, a correlation coefficient of 1.0, and an intercept of $\mathbf { \partial } _ { \mathbf { \tilde { \Sigma } } } 0 . 5 4 \ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the NCCLS (CLSI) Approved Guideline for User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices EP5-A2. For each test level, a single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day. The within-run and total standard deviations were calculated by the analysis of variance method.

# Calibrator

The Dimension Vista™ MYO calibrator is similar to other calibrator products associated with their assays, such as the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MYO calibrator.

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

Both the Dimension Vista™M MYO reagent cartridge and the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ MYO immunoassays are intended for the quantitative determination of myoglobin. Comparative data for serum and human plasma samples demonstrate good analytical and clinical agreement between the methods.

# Conclusion:

The Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM MYO and the predicate Dade Behring Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ MYO immunoassays (K984191/K984193) are substantially equivalent based on their intended use and performance characteristics as described above. The calibrator products are also equivalent in their design and intended use with their respective assay systems.
