# FDA Guidance Documents:

None applicable

Predicate Device(s):

Dade Behring CTNI immunoassay and Calibrator (K010313/K010314)

# Device Description(s):

# Method

The CTNI method is a one-step sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCITM) technology. LOCITM reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibodyfragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a particle/cardiac troponin I/biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads then are added and bind to the biotin to form beadaggregated immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at $6 8 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads, which diffuses into the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at $6 1 2 { \mathrm { ~ n m } }$ and is a direct function of the cardiac troponin I concentration in the sample.

# Calibrator

The Dade Behring CTNI Calibrator is a three level frozen liquid product (levels A, B, C) containing human troponin complex in a human serum matrix with stabilizers and preservative. The kit contains 3 vials of each level $\mathbf { A } { = } 2 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ , $\mathtt { B } = 1 . 0 \ \mathrm { m L }$ , $\mathrm { C } { = } 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$

The Dimension Vista™M CTNI SDIL Sample Diluent is a single level liquid product containing a human serum matrix with stabilizers and preservative. The kit contains 6 vials with $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ in each vial.

# Intended Use:

# Method

The CTNI method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of cardiac troponin I in human serum on the Dimension Vista™ System. Measurements of cardiac troponin I are used to aid in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMl) and in the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes with respect to their relative risk of mortality.

# Calibrator:

The CTNI CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of cardiac Troponin-I (CTNI) on the Dimension Vista™ system.

# Diluent:

For use on the Dimension VistaTM System to dilute samples with elevated CTNI results.

The reproducibility testing was conducted in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for User Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices EP5-A2. For each test level, a single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day. The within-run and total standard deviations were calculated by the analysis of variance method.

Calibrator   
The Dimension Vista™M CTNI Calibrator is similar to other calibrator products associated with their assays, such as the Dimension® CTNI Calibrator. Sample Diluent   
The Dimension Vista™M CTNI SDIL Sample Diluent is similar to other diluent products associated with their assays.

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

Both the Dimension VistaTM CTNI reagent cartridge and the Dimension® CTNI immunoassays are intended for the quantitative determination of troponin I. Comparative data for human serum samples demonstrate good analytical and clinical agreement between the methods.

# Conclusion:

The Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM CTNI and the predicate Dade Behring Dimension $^ { \otimes }$ CTNI immunoassays (K010313/K0103 14) are substantially equivalent based on their intended use and performance characteristics as described above. The calibrator products are also equivalent in their design and intended use with their respective assay systems.
