# L. Test Principle:

The Dimension Vista CTNI method is a one-step sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCI) technology. The LOCI reagents consists of two latex bead reagents and a reagent containing a biotinylated anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-cardiac troponin I monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. The sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a particle/cardiac troponin I/biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead-aggregated immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex by light at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads, which diffuses into the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the cardiac troponin concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was performed over a period of 20 days following a protocol similar to CLSI EP5-A2 and included commercial controls as well as normal human sera spiked with TnI at 3 different levels (0.12, 0.55, and 31.4 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . Repeatability ranged from $1 . 5 { - } 5 . 8 \%$ CV and within lab imprecision ranged from $2 . 9 \substack { - 6 . 6 \% }$ CV.

Limit of Quantitation (Functional Sensitivity) was evaluated by determining the total imprecision of natural TnI samples. Two replicates of each sample were tested once per day for 20 days. The limit of quantitation was determined to be $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ and corresponds to a coefficient of variation (CV) of $10 \%$ .

$b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: The reportable range of the assay is 0.015 to $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

Linearity was evaluated by comparing the observed versus expected values obtained with the Dimension Vista CTNI method. A high concentration natural troponin I sample was mixed with a normal serum in different proportions across the range of the assay. The observed results recovered in the range of $9 5 . 9 9 . 9 \%$ of the expected TnI values.

High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing normal human sera spiked with troponin I at high concentrations up to $1 2 8 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . No hook effect was observed with samples up to this level.

Accurate dilution of samples using Dimension Vista SDIL CTNI sample diluent was demonstrated by diluting multiple elevated samples (17-40 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ , at a 1:5 ratio. The sponsor determined the results to be acceptable if recovery was within $10 \%$ of the expected value and all diluted samples met this criterion.

The Dimension Vista system will report an error code to the user when the signal generated by high level TnI samples exceeds $4 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability and Value Assignment:

Dimension Vista CTNI calibrators are traceable to Primary Reference Calibrators that are prepared from native human sera and assigned values using the Dade Behring Stratus $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ CS system. Manufacturers Working Calibrators (Master Pools) are prepared from a normal human serum pool spiked with human troponin complex. Their value is measured from the Primary Reference Calibrators tested on the Dimension Vista system, using several instruments and reagent lots. The Master Pool value is assigned from the mean of all test results.

The commercially available Dimension Vista CTNI calibrators consist of troponin complex spiked into troponin I negative serum pool at three levels of TnI. The values of these calibrators are measured from the Master Pool calibrators tested on the Dimension Vista CTNI system, using several instruments and reagent lots. The calibrator value is assigned for each of the three levels from the mean of all test results.

Stability: The shelf life of the product is stated to be 12 months when stored frozen between $- 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The calibrators are stable for 7 days, once thawed if stored unopened at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or opened and re-capped immediately. The thawed calibrator is also stable for 7 days when stored on-board the Dimension Vista system, once the stopper of the vial is punctured.

Stability studies were performed to support these claims. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was that value at each testing point should recover within $5 \%$ of the assigned bottle value.

Stability studies for the CTNI Sample Diluent were performed to support the claim of 12 months for the unopened product when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and the claim of 30 days for the opened product.

# d. Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity was defined as the concentration corresponding to two standard deviations above the mean of a sample containing no troponin I $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 0 )$ ). Twenty replicates of the Dimension Vista CTNI calibrator Level A (0 $\mathrm { { n g / m L } ) }$ were evaluated in the CTNI assay and resulted in an analytical sensitivity $\sim 0 . 0 1 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

The Limit of Quantitation is $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ (see Precision section above).

e. Analytical specificity:

Evaluation of analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was done by spiking each cross-reactant to target concentration into a troponin I negative serum as well as a serum spiked with human troponin complex to approximately 1.0 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . A control for each cross-reactant was prepared by spiking the samples with the same volume of the solvent used for reconstituting the cross-reactant. The cross-reactant test samples and the control samples were measured on the Dimension Vista and the cross-reactivity was calculated.

The effect of potentially interfering substances, including endogenous substances, commonly ingested substances and cardiac drugs were tested by spiking a sample containing approximately $1 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ TnI with the appropriate concentration of the test substance and comparing the TnI recovery of the sample to that of a control sample. The control sample was prepared by spiking the TnI sample with an equal volume of the solvent used to dissolve the test substance. The sponsor defined interference as a difference in recovery between the test sample and control greater than $10 \%$ .

Hemoglobin hemolysate (up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin (up to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), lipid (up to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , and cholesterol (up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ did not interfere with the test. A panel of commonly ingested substances, over-the-counter drugs and cardiac drugs did not interfere with the assay. A list of these substances can be found in the package insert.

4. Clinical cut-off:

A cut-off range of $0 . 6 { - } 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ was established for the Dade Behring Stratus Cardiac TnI assay in k951890. A previous method comparison study (k973650) with the Cardiac Troponin I method for the Dimension RxL demonstrated substantial equivalence of that assay to the Stratus Cardiac TnI assay. A method comparison of the current device to Dimension RxL was performed to support the current Dimension Vista TnI assay (see method comparison above).

# 5. Expected values/Reference range:

In a study of 199 serum samples from apparently healthy individuals, the upper limit of the $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile for the Dimension VISTA™ CTNI method was determined to be $0 . 0 4 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

# N. Proposed Labeling:
