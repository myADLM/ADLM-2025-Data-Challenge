# Safety and Effective Information

# Predicate Device:

Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to TaiDoc Technology Corporation. K042005, Achtung TD-4207/ Clever Chek TD-4209/ Clever Chek TD-4222 Glucose Test Systems.

# Indications for Use:

The Prodigy Blood Glucose Test System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood taken from the finger. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and are not intended for use on neonates.

# Device Description:

The Prodigy glucose test system consists of a meter and test strips. The system utilizes an electrochemical method-based meter and dry reagent biosensor (test strips) for blood glucose testing. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample, providing a quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh whole blood and control solutions.

# Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device:

The results of clinical and non-clinical testing indicate that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate.
