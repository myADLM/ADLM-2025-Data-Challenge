# Intended Use of the Device:

#

The i-STAT BNP test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in whole blood or plasma samples using EDTA as the anticoagulant. BNP measurements can be used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of congestive heart failure.

The cartridge is to be used with the i-STAT 1 Analyzer bearing the (Immuno) symbol, but not with the i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyzer or the Philips Medical Systems (formerly Agilent Technologies) Blood Analysis Module (BAM). As part of the i-STAT System, the BNP test is to be used by trained health care professionals in accordance with a facility's policies and procedures.

# Controls:

The i-STAT BNP Controls are assayed liquid plasma used to verify the integrity of newly received iSTAT BNP cartridges.

# Description of the Device:

#

The i-STAT BNP test is contained in a single-use test cartridge. In use, the user scans a bar code and then places approximately $1 7 \mu L$ of whole blood or plasma in the cartridge.After the cartridge isc intoeheally lT Analyz layal te performed automatically. Patient and use information may be entered into the analyzer via a keypad during the automated analysis cycle.

As the analyzer performs several quality checks and controls the temperature of the sensors via resistive heating to the underside of the sensor chips, the substrate/wash fluid is released into a conduit within the cartridge and a metered volume of the sample over the sensor chips. The enzyme-linked antibody conjugate dissolves into the sample and the sample incubates for a controlled time. The sample is then pushed into a waste chamber and the substrate/wash solution is brought over the sensors. The alkaline phosphatase captured on the BNP sensor cleaves the substrate present in the substrate/wash fluid, giving rise to an amperometric signal that is measured.

# Controls:

The i-STAT BNP Controls are supplied in three levels packaged as six vials of one level per box with each vial containing 1 mL of control material.The three levels are in frozen liquid form, require no reconstitution or dilution, and are each comprised of a different level of BNP, a chemical synthetic peptide, prepared in human EDTA plasma and preserved with sodium azide. The first level of BNP is set at a typical diagnostic cutoff level while the second and third are set at higher levels spanning the range of the test. The BNP value will be provided in the value assignment sheet for each level.

# Calibration verification controls:

The i-STAT BNP Calibration Verification Control Set is packaged as a tri-level set comprised of two vials of each of three levels per box. The three levels in the BNP Calibration Verification Control Set are exactly the same materials as those used in the Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 control products. The only difference between this product and the i-STAT BNP Controls is the number of vials and the number of levels that are packaged together.

# Summary of Performance in Support of Substantial Equivalence:

Studies established that the i-STAT BNP test is insensitive to hematocrit levels from 0 to 60 %PCV.   
The i-STAT BNP assay is not significantly influenced by the presence of NT-pro-BNP, ANP or CNP at $1 0 0 0 \ p g / m L$ or $2 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m L }$ .   
Studies established that there are no significant interference effects on the i-STAT BNP test from common medications, particularly those commonly prescribed to patients with   
cardiovascular conditions.   
Studies established that the lower limit of detection (LLD) for the i-STAT method is 15 pg/mL versus $5 . 0 \ p g / \mathsf { m L }$ for the Triage BNP test.   
The imprecision of the i-STAT BNP test using plasma controls was established using in-house studies. The Level 1 Control $\% C V$ was $1 1 . 1 \%$ at $1 2 6 p g / m L$ ; the Level 2 Control $\% c v$ was EY $8 . 1 \%$ at $1 5 5 1 p g / m L$ , and the Level 3 Control $\% C V$ was $9 . 8 \%$ at $3 3 3 7 p g / m L$ This includes within-lot, lot-to-lot, vial-to-vial, analyzer-to-analyzer,and operator-to-operator components of the imprecision.

Studies conducted in-house compared the results of the i-STAT BNP test to those of the BNP test on the Abbott ARCHITECT. EDTA-anticoagulated samples were analyzed on both systems. The methods were compared using Deming regression analysis. The results are summarized in the table below:

# Controls/calibration verification controls:

The within-level vial-to-vial imprecision for all three levels of the i-STAT BNP controls was found to range from $0 . 8 \%$ to $5 . 8 \%$ testing three lots of each control level. Studies demonstrated that al three levels meet the claim f 4 hours' stability after the product has been thawed.

# Conclusions:

#

Based on the data, the i-STAT BNP test is insensitive to hematocrit level from $0 - 6 0 \ \% \mathsf { P C V }$ ,is not significantly influenced by the presence of related peptides, shows no significant interference ugns prb ower men LD s BPStudies using plasma controls indicate adequate imprecision for low, mid-range, and high results.Clinical data indicates acceptable correlation to the predicate device.

# Controls/calibration verification controls:

The i-STAT BNP Controls Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, and the i-STAT BNP Calibration Verification Control Set are substantially equivalent to the previously cleared Triage $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ BNP Calibration Verification Controls as indicated by the data.
