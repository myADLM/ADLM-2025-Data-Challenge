# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A - Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices   
CLSI EP-17A - Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation

# L. Test Principle:

The reagents include $\mathfrak { a }$ -naphthylphosphate, which is converted to $\mathfrak { a }$ -naphthol in the presence of ACP; and FAST RED TR, which reacts with $\mathfrak { a }$ -naphthol to produce a chromogen. The increase in absorbance at $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the concentration of ACP in the sample. The test is run in the absence and presence of tartrate. The difference between the two values for each sample is attributed to the prostatic isoenzyme.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: Evaluations were performed on the Synchron CX and LX.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision was evaluated at the manufacturer's site using the manufacturer’s serum control material as well as serum pools spiked with (potato) acid phosphatase. Calculations, based on 2 runs/day, with 2 replicates per run, over 20 consecutive days, were performed according to CLSI (NCCLS) EP5A.

Data presented in the $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ was obtained from a single instrument. The manufacturer reports that results form 4 instruments were similar. Results in the 510(k) met the following manufacturer’s acceptance criteria:

Within-run: $\mathrm { S D } < 1 . 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ (below 33.3U/L) or $< 3 . 0 \%$ CV (above $3 3 . 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ ) Total: $\mathrm { S D } < 1 . 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ (below $3 3 . 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ ) or $< 4 . 5 \%$ CV (above $3 3 . 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Evaluations were based on multiple inter-dilutions of spiked patient specimens with zero-level serum samples. Seven dilution levels across the range of the assay were prepared and each level was evaluated in triplicate. Linearity of non-prostatic acid phosphatase (NPAP) and total acid phosphatase (TACP) were measured separately. Target values were defined based on the middle dilution levels and the dilution factors. The assay range is $2 . 0 { - } 3 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { u g / m l }$ . Average recovery (of triplicates at each level), relative to the target value, was near $100 \%$ for TACP and within $+ / - 5 \%$ of $100 \%$ for NPAP.

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method): Controls were cleared under $\mathrm { k } 8 2 2 6 4$ and were not reviewed in this $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ . The assay is a non-calibrated enzymatic assay.

The following are used to evaluate comparison across lots:

i. Each new lot of reagent is tested for recoveries using 3 levels of control materials, and a previous lot of reagent is tested at the same time as a reference. The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for new lots is to recover within insert range of the Level 1 control, within $\pm 2 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ of the insert mean for Level 2 and within $\pm 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ of the insert mean for Level 3 control values. ii. Acceptance criteria for the methods comparison studies are slopes of $1 . 0 \pm$ 0.15, intercepts of within $\pm 2$ S.D $\mathrm { \Delta } ) \mathrm { r } \pm 2 \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ and an R $\mathbf { o f } \geq 0 . 9 9 0$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The evaluation of limit of detection was based on the CLSI Protocol EP-17A. A saline blank and a low level sample, were evaluated. Results are shown below. Additional sensitivity testing, performed using human albumin in saline as a blank yielded similar results.

e. Analytical specificity:

Endogenous compounds were spiked into pooled patient serum samples containing three levels of ACP. Samples at each level were spiked with interferent to concentrations as high as $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin, $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Intralipid, and $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin and results were compared to those of control samples without interferent. Recovery relative to the control were within $+ / { - } 2 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ , or $6 \%$ of expected results for samples containing intralipid and bilirubin. Reduced recovery was observed in some samples containing hemoglobin near $1 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , though all results were within $+ / { - } 4 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .
