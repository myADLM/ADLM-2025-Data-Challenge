8. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Verification and validation of test results were evaluated to establish the performance, functionality and reliability of The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The evaluation included with precision, linearity, interference, environment factors (ex. Temperature, humidity and altitude), hematocrit and control solution.

9. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed: The clinical test was designed in Alternative site testing study as below

Test capillary blood by technician Study:   
It shows similarly slope and intercept for difference position of capillary blood test by technician. Test capillary blood by patient Study:   
It shows similarly slope and intercept of difference positions of capillary blood test by Patient.

The "Alternative Site Test" clinical evaluation shows substantially equivalent to Rightest used in finger, palm and arm position. They all have similar slope and intercept of Rightest value versus YSI 2300D. So the result tells us Rightest blood glucose monitoring system is suitable to be used in finger, palm and arm.

# 10. Conclusions:

Results of clinical testing demonstrate that the performance of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Alternative Site Testing) testing capillary whole blood is substantial equivalence of Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The precision and accuracy of Rightest is suitable for its in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management at home and in clinical settings.

Dear Ms. Goldstein-Falk:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
