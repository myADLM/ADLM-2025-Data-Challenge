# I. Device Description:

The TSH method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay $( \mathrm { L O C I } ^ { \mathrm { T M } } )$ technology. The $\mathrm { L O C I } ^ { \mathrm { T M } }$ reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-TSH monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-TSH monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-TSH-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added to bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the TSH concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Two patient serum pools and three control materials were assayed. During each day of testing, two separate runs, with two test samples, for each test material were analyzed for 20 days. The assays were run on a single analyzer using one lot of reagent. Results for precision are summarized below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linear range of the Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Flex® reagent cartridge was confirmed by assaying samples prepared from dilutions of the Level C calibrator. The TSH concentrations observed in the samples ranged from 0.008 to $1 0 2 . 9 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The means of the observed values for each sample were plotted versus the expected values. The linear relationship appeared acceptable by visual examination. Results are summarized below.

Least squares regression analysis gave the following: Observed $=$ 0.98(Expected) – 0.32; $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 9$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The LOCI I calibrator (k053531), is used to calibrate the Dimension Vista™ flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge. The calibrator is referenced to the WHO $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ IRP 80/558 standard. See k053531 for more information.

Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone $\mathrm { F l e x } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ reagent cartridges were stored in a controlled environment at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . QC materials (3 levels of Bio-Rad Lyphochek Immunoassay Plus Control, lot 40150) and a human serum pool were aliquotted and frozen at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . On each measuring day, one aliquot was thawed, the Dimension Vista TSH method was calibrated, and the QC material and serum pool run in 5 replicates. The analyte values obtained on each day were averaged over the replicates. At the end of the study, the mean values for each day were graphed against the day, inspected visually, and analyzed by linear regression. The Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Flex® reagent cartridge was shown to be stable up to 366 days.

# d. Detection limit:

Functional sensitivity was determined by measuring eight serum pools ranging in concentration from 0.004 to $0 . 0 2 1 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . Each sample was tested twice a week for approximately six weeks. The concentration at which assay imprecision was calculated to be $20 \%$ CV (by interpolation) is 0.005 $\mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To test the crossreactivity of this device to similar endogenous analytes, serum samples were spiked with hCG, LH, and FSH at 200000, 1000, and 1000 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ , respectively, and compared to a non-spiked base pool. No analytes tested significantly cross-reacted in this analysis.

A patient serum sample was spiked with specific concentrations of potential interfering substances, and the TSH values were obtained using the Dimension VistaTM Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Flex® reagent cartridge then compared to a non-spiked control sample. Bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference. No interference was found. Results are summarized below.

The potential for a high dose hook effect was evaluated for this assay by spiking a human serum pool that was initially $0 . 8 0 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ TSH to 30,000 $\mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ TSH. The spiked pool was serially diluted into the assay range. Data shows no overlap in instrument response demonstrating thatthere is no high dose hook effect up to $3 0 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .
