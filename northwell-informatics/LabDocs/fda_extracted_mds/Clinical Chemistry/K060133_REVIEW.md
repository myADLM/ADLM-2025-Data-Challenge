# I. Device Description:

The $\mathrm { A C B @ }$ Test Assay Verification Set (AVS) is an assayed control material with established albumin cobalt binding capacity. It is a single use, non-sterile, in vitro diagnostic device consisting of twenty (20) single vial $0 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ aliquots of serum based samples. The samples are assigned IMA values over the physiological range $( 4 0 { - } 1 8 0 \mathrm { U / m L } )$ and at points just above and just below the $8 5 \mathrm { U / m L }$ cut-off. Sample value range is such that an analytical correlation study can be evaluated by the user to determine whether their analyzer is accurately measuring IMA levels in clinical specimens. The AVS device is supplied in frozen liquid form and is stable up to the expiry date.

# L. Test Principle:

Not Applicable. This submission is for clearance of control material.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use. c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

Traceability:

The Ischemia Assay Verification Set (AVS) is manufactured from commercially available pooled serum (off-the-clot), cobalt chloride and EDTA. Each material is tested individually for expected value. The final formulation is standardized for assay level internally using the Ischemia Technologies Albumin Cobalt Binding $( \mathrm { A C B @ } )$ Test with known concentrations of cobalt chloride in serum and EDTA.

The serum is tested in duplicate using the ACB Test on the Cobas Mira Plus analyzer. Values for serum must fall within 60- $1 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ . Cobalt chloride and EDTA stock solutions are prepared in volume ranges from $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ to $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ and tested, in duplicate, using the ACB Test on a calibrated analyzer. The average ACB value is plotted against the volume of added cobalt chloride and EDTA and the curve fit must be linear with an $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value $\mathrm { o f } \geq 0 . 9 5$ .

The AVS formulation is evaluated by running the ACB Test, in duplicate, on increasing volumes of cobalt chloride in a serum and EDTA matrix using a calibrated analyzer. Average values are plotted against the volume of cobalt chloride and the curve generated must be linear with an $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value of $\geq 0 . 9 5$ . Initial target values are then confirmed internally prior to bulk formulation filling.

Each of the 20 AVS levels is dispensed from the bulk formulation in $0 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ aliquots and in appropriate dilution level into Micro

Tubes with caps labeled with lot number and assay level (1-20).   
Product is boxed and placed in a $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ freezer.

Controls and Calibrators:

There are no additional controls or calibrators used for AVS other than those cleared for use under the Albumin Cobalt Binding Test 510(k) s
