# I. Device Description:

The Mission CompleteTM Linearity Control are assayed materials used for confirming the calibration and linearity of blood gas, electrolyte, and metabolite instruments measuring $\mathsf { p H }$ , $\mathsf { p C O } _ { 2 }$ , ${ \mathsf { p O } } _ { 2 }$ , $\mathrm { N a } ^ { + } , \mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ , Cl- , $\mathrm { C a } ^ { + 2 }$ , glucose, and lactate. The device is intended to confirm the calibration of an instrument. The device is not intended for use as a calibrator.

The control material is provided in 5 levels of control chosen to cover the clinically relevant range of each analyte. The control material is packaged in sealed glass ampules. Each ampule contains $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of solution. The material is stable for 3 years if stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable of a device of this type. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable of a device of this type. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The control material is prepared gravimetrically from analytic grade material. $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ are introduced into the solute by bubbling. Confirmation of the analyte concentration is obtained through comparison to a NIST standard. The company uses NIST 919a as reference material for $\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ and Cl- . For $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ , the company compares to NIST 918a. For $\mathrm { C a } ^ { + 2 }$ , the company compares to NIST 915a. The company confirms the glucose concentration of their controls by comparison to NIST 917b. The concentration of lactate is obtained via comparison to a Pointe Lactate standard.

The company substantiated their claim for a 3 year shelf life via accelerated aging studies. Samples demonstrated a change in concentration of less that $+ / .$ - $5 \%$ , the acceptance criteria used by the company. The data supplied by the company supports the 36 month shelf life if stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable of a device of this type.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable of a device of this type.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable of a device of this type.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable of a device of this type.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable of a device of this type.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable of a device of this type.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable of a device of this type.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Not applicable of a device of this type.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable of a device of this type.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable of a device of this type.
