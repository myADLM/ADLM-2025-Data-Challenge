Proprietary Name:

AlbuTro! Low and AlbuTrol High

Classification Name:

Quality control material (assayed and unassayed) (21 CFR 862.1660, Product Code JJX)

Common Name:

AlbuTrol

Equivalent to:

MAS® UA Control, 510(k) document control number K023928

# Description

AlbuTrol is an assayed urine albumin control material. AlbuTrol control material is filled of in dropper bottles. Each dropper bottle contains 1.0 mL human urine with a specific amount of human albumin. AlbuTrol provides two physiologically relevant levels covering the clinically interesting ranges of urine albumin: \~25 mg/L albumin and \~75 mg/L albumin.

I he assigned values of each batch are printed on both the carton box and the dropper bottles.

AlbuTrol is packed in carton boxes. Each carton box contains 2 dropper bottles of the same level on a carton tray. An insert with Intended Use is packed in each box of AlbuTrol.

# Intended Use

AlbuTrol is an assayed albumin control intended for professional use in the verfication of the precision and accuracy of the HemoCue Urine Albumin system and the HemoCue Albumin 201 system. On these systems, AlbuTrol performs in the same way as human urine does. AlbuTrol is for in vitro use only. AlbuTrol is for professional use only.

# Technological Characteristics

AlbuTrol is flled in 3 mL. dropper bottles made of Low Density Polyethylene. Each dropper bottle is capped with a dropper tip and a colored cap, both made of polypropylene.

Values of AlbuTrol are assigned on factory calibrated HemoCue Albumin 201 systems. The stability of AlbuTrol is 9 months from value assignment.

To obtain a drop of control material the dropper bottle needs to be pressed slightly. After dispense of a drop of the control material onto a hydrophobic surface, for example a plastic film, the sample is drawn into the microcuvette by capillary force. After that the microcuvettes need to be inserted into the system for measuring immediately.

# Assessment of Performance

Studies were conducted in-house to demonstrate the performance on the HemoCue Urine Albumin system and the HemoCue Albumin 201 analyzing system.

# Conclusion

The AlbuTrol control materials are convenient control materials for professional use in the verfication of the precision and accuracy of the HemoCue Urine Albumin system and the HemoCue Albumin 201 system.

Dear Mr. White:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
