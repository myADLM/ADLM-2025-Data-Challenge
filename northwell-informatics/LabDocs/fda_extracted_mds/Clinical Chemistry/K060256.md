3.1 Proprietary Names: UniCel©® DxC 600i Synchron® Access@ Clinical System

3.2 Classification Names: Discrete photometric chemistry analyzer for clinical use [862.2160]

# 4.0 Legally Marketed Device

The UniCel DxC 60Oi System claims substantial equivalence to the SYNCHRON LXi 725 System (Docket Number K023049) currently in commercial distribution.

# 5.0 Device Description

The UniCel DxC 600i System combines the UniCel DxC 600 analyzer and Access 2 immunoassay analyzer into a single instrument presentation. Samples are loaded from a single point of entry through the Closed Tube Aliquoter (CTA) connector unit. The CTA functions as a sample processing manager by aliquotting and routing samples to the Access 2 and/or DxC 600 modules according to programming requirements. The DxC 600 and Access 2 systems then deliver samples to the appropriate reaction vessel along with reagents and reaction constituents. The DxC 600-based console functions as the main user interface for managing routine operations such as sample programming, results management, and QC functions.

The DxC 600i system provides analysis of up to 94 analytes per sample, operating in conjunction with the existing reagents, calibrators, and controls designed for use with Beckman Coulter's SYNCHRON and Access instrument families. The instrument features bar code identification of samples and reagents, Closed Tube Sampling (CTS), and obstruction detection and correction capability. DxC 600i system components include the DxC 600 analyzer and console, the CTA module, and the Access 2 module and console. The subsystem hardware components for the analytical units include reagent storage compartments, sample and reagent delivery systems, cap piercing assemblies, sample carousels and cranes, hydropneumatics, fluidics, photometric detectors, electronics, and power supplies.

The DxC 600i System incorporates the following upgrades to the LXi 725 System:

# 1. General Chemistry Module

The UniCel DxC 600 System (previously reviewed/cleared under K042291) replaces the LX20 PRO System as the general chemistry module and main system console." The DxC 600 implements a dual-carousel refrigeration unit to increase reagent cartridge storage capacity and expand the onboard test menu. The DxC 600 offers robustness and feature enhancements over the LX20 PRO, and has a smaller instrument footprint to reduce the overall size of the " configuration.

# 2.Hardware Modifications

The CTA unit upgrades address parts obsolescence and performance quality issues related to the barcode reader, syringe module and pump. The Access 2 module has updated electronic components to support the obstruction detection feature. There are also instrument cover changes to match the DxC 600 design.

# 3. Software Modifications

The DxC 600i System utilizes DxC operating software version 1.4. Version 1.4 contains the information necessary to configure, order, and report results for Access 2 tests and an updated chemistry database. The Access 2 module operating software is updated to achieve alignment with stand-alone Access 2 operating software. The CTA module software is updated to implement robustness improvements and new features.

# 6.0 Intended Use

The UniCel® DxC 600i System combines the UniCel® DxC 600 analyzer and the Access® 2 analyzer into a single instrument presentation. Samples are loaded from a single point of entry through a Closed Tube Aliquoter (CTA) unit. The CTA functions as a sample processing manager by aliquotting and routing samples to the Access 2 and/or UniCel DxC 600 analyzer according to programming requirements.

The UniCel DxC 600 Synchron® Clinical System is a fully automated, computercontrolled clinical chemistry analyzer intended for the in vitro determination of a variety of general chemistries, therapeutic drugs, and other chemistries of clinical interest in biological fluids such as serum, plasma, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid, (sample type is chemistry dependent).

The Access 2 Immunoassay Analyzer is a microcomputer controlled, random access instrument. The analyzer performs enzyme immunoassays utilizing paramagnetic particle solid phase and chemiluminescent detection. The Access 2 Analyzer is intended for the in vitro determination of a variety of analytes of clinical interest in biological fluids such as serum, plasma, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid, (sample type is chemistry dependent).

# 7.0 Comparison to the Predicate

The SYNCHRON LXi 725 system has been upgraded to a DxC 600i System through 1) replacement of the LX20 PRO module with a modified DxC 600 PRO analyzer, 2) modified CTA and Access 2 hardware elements and instrument covers, and, 3) software updates to the DxC 600, Access 2, and CTA modules. There is also a name change to UniCel DxC 600i System.
