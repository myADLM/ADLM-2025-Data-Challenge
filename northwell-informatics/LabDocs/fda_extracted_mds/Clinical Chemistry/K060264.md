# K. Test Principle:

The automated Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IRON method is an adaptation of direct iron assays using the chromophore Ferene ® . Under acidic conditions, iron (Fe+++) bound to the protein transferrin is released. In the presence of the reducing agent ascorbic acid, (Fe+++) is reduced to (Fe++). (Fe ++) forms a blue complex with 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis-2-(5-furyl sulfonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine, disodium salt (Ferene $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ). The absorbance of the complex, measured using a bichromatic (600, 700 nm) endpoint technique, is directly proportional to the concentration of transferrin-bound iron in the serum.

# L. Performance Characteristics:

1.Precision/Reproducibility:

Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices (EP5- A2). Commercial controls and serum and plasma pools were analyzed in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations were calculated by analysis of variance method.

a. Reproducibility testing was done in accordance with the CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods (EP5-A2, 2004).   
b Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days. The repeatability andwithin-lab standard deviations were calculated by analysis of variance method.   
c. Using reduced sample size $( 2 5 { \mathrm { u L } } )$

2. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Solutions of NIST SRM 937 were prepared by sequential mixing to create equally spaced samples ranging from 0 to 2000 µg/dL iron. The linearity of iron on the Dimension® RxL by the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IRON assay was evaluated by comparing observed versus expected values across the expected range. A linear regression analysis was performed on the data and plotted. The observed linearity across the reportable range has a correlation coefficient of 0.999 (using Pearson correlation calculation), slope of 0.999, and an intercept of 0.178. The assay range claim is $5 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ to $1 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathbf { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ .

3. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

The recommended reference material for the Dimension® IRON method is the Dimension® IRON Calibrator (Cat. No. DC85). The assigned values of this product are standardized to SRM NIST 937 Iron Metal Clinical Standard which is a Standard Reference Material of the National Institute of Standards & Technology.

4 Detection limit:

The analytical sensitivity of Dimension® IRON is 5 µg/dL [0.9 μmol/L]. The analytical sensitivity represents the lowest concentration of iron that can be distinguished from zero. This sensitivity is defined as the mean value (n=20) plus two standard deviations of the low level $( 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { d L }$ $[ 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } ]$ IRON Calibrator.

5. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed according to the CLSI/NCCLS Protocol EP-7A. Systematic inaccuracies (bias) due to these substances are less than 10% at an iron concentration of 26 to 38 µg/dL [4.7 to 6.8 µmol/L] and 118 to 136 μg/dL [21.1 to 24.3 μmol/L]. A summary of potential interfering substances and the substances that do not interfere with the Dimension $\mathfrak { B }$ IRON method when present in serum at the concentrations indicated can be found in the package insert.

6. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 147 samples were tested using the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ IRON and IRN assays on a Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ RxL clinical chemistry system. 99 individual patient serum samples and 48 individual patient serum samples that were spiked with various amounts of NIST-937 reference iron material were tested. Studies were performed using routine methods for quality control, maintenance and calibration as described in the instrument instructions for use.

Linear regression analysis was performed using the SAS® System. The model equation for regression statistics is: Result of Dimension® system = (Slope x comparative method result) + Intercept. The range of IRON values in the correlation study was: 9 to $9 6 3 ~ \mu \mu / \mathrm { d L }$ . The linear regression statistics are presented in the table below.

# Method Comparison

<table><tr><td>Comparative Method</td><td>Slope</td><td>Intercept ug/dL</td><td>Correlation Coefficient</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>Dimension® IRN (DF49A)</td><td>0.980</td><td>-0.488</td><td>0.9996</td><td>147</td></tr></table>

.Matrix comparison

129 matched specimens of serum and heparinized plasma were drawn and processed by the IRON method on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system. Linear regression analysis showed excellent agreement between serum, lithium heparin plasma and sodium heparin plasma specimens. No clinically significant difference was observed between serum and plasma samples.

Sodium heparin plasma versus serum: n = 129, y = 0.988x + 0.804, r = 0.999 Lithium heparin plasma versus serum: n = 129, y = 0.985x + 1.42, r = 0.999 Lithium heparin plasma verus sodium heparin plasma: n = 129, y = 0.997x + 0.666, r = 0.999

8. Reference Interval

Males: $6 5 \mathrm { - } 1 7 5 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ $[ 1 1 . 6 { - } 3 1 . 3 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } ] ^ { 1 }$

Females: $5 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 7 0 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ [9.0- 30.4 μmol/L]

Normal reference intervals can differ by as much as $3 5 \%$ between commercial iron methods², therefore it is advised that each laboratory establish its own expected values for iron as performed on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system.
