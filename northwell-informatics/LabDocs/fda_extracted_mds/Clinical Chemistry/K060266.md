# K. Test Principle:

The Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Iron Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product intended to be used to calibrate the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IRON (Cat # DF85) method for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system.

# L. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability

Target shelf life for the Dimension® IRON Calibrator is 12 months. Studies require 13 months of real time testing on three lots of product. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at 4°C with product stored at -20°C to ensure that analytical system drift is dissociated with calibrator drift.

2. Traceability:

The assigned values of the IRON calibrator are standardized to NIST SRM 937 (NIST SRM: National Institute of Standards and Technology- Standard Reference Material). Six working Iron Standard Solutions of NIST SRM 937 (0, 25, 50, 75, 500, $1 0 7 5 \mu \mathrm { g / d L } ,$ . are prepared and used to assign each new lot of calibrator.

# 3Value Assignment

The new calibrator levels are made by adding acid dissolved NIST 837 into base matrix. The new calibrator lots are assigned verses the six working standard solutions prepared from NIST SRM 937(Reference Lot). The new calibrator lot must have acceptable recovery verses the Reference Lot and a Control Calibrator Lot (Control Calibrator Lot = Any Approved Calibrator Lot).

Dear Ms. Tasker:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to evi a aveassianc  e iin  eal and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
