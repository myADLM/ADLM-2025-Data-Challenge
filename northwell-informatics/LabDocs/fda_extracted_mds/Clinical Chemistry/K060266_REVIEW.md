Calibrator shelf life was determined by comparing results of three different lots of the product stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with product stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ over 13 months. Product was stored at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ throughout testing cycle and tested at month 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 18, 24, 25 (using 5 replicates per calibrator level). The control material was stored at ${ } - 2 0 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested at the same frequency. Stress testing was also performed using one lot of product stored at $2 - 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ throughout testing cycle and tested at days 7, then months 6,7,12 and 13 (using 5 replicates per calibrator level) under hot (stressed shipping) conditions ((a) Store product at $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for $3 6 \mathrm { h }$ , $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 12h, then $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for $4 \mathrm { { h } }$ then stored long term at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . (b) Store product at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for $4 8 \mathrm { h }$ , then $3 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ for $6 \mathrm { { h } }$ then store long term at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . (c) Store product at $1 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ c }$ for 54h, then store long term at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ .) and cold (stressed shipping) conditions (three freeze/thaw cycles then stored long-term $\textcircled{4} 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Calibrator shelf life was determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ with product stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ to ensure that analytical system drift is dissociated with calibrator drift. The drift at each test level must meet the following sponsor-set criteria:

Less than or equal to 5ug/dL for Level 1 $( 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ Less than or equal to $5 \%$ CV Level 2 $( 5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ and Less than or equal to $8 \%$ CV for level 3 $( 1 0 7 5 ~ \mu \mathbf { g } / \mathrm { d L } )$ ).

Using this criteria, the sponsor claims the time frame which the criteria are met and applies that time frame as the stability for unopened product stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ IRON Calibrator is in a single-use glass ampule product. According to the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ IRON Calibrator Instructions for Use, opened ampules should be used immediately and any portion not used should be discarded. As such, no “Opened Product” stability studies were performed.

The target concentrations will be 0, 500 and $1 0 7 5 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ . This strategy supports a preference by the customer to have an assay range that is never lower than the lowest level of calibrator and never higher than the highest level of calibrator in order to be in compliance accrediting agencies and demonstrate linearity with each lot of reagent. The intermediate level was chosen based on a level to achieve the best linear curve fit.

Assay Range: $5 - 1 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$

Calibrator Target Levels: 0, 500, 1075 μg/dL (These levels may vary based on lot to lot assignment.)
