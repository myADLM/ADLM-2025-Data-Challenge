Date of Summary: March 1, 2006

DEVICE NAME:

Proprietary Name: iChem $1 0 0 ^ { \dag \mathsf { M } }$ Urine Chemistry Analyzer Common/Usual Name: Urine Analyzer Classification Name: Automated Urinalysis System

PREDICATE DEVICE:

ARKRAY AUTION JET "AJ-4270 Urine Analyzer (k030600)

# DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The iChem "100 Urine Chemistry Analyzer is a semi-automated benchtop instrument for the rapid analysis of urine test strips. The iChem100 is designed to analyze and generate results for iChem10 SG Urine Chemistry Strips.

INTENDED USE:

The Chem100 Urine Chemistry Analyzer is a semi-utomated benchtop instrument for the pi aalysisf urine est strips.The Chem10 is designed o analyze and generate results for Chem Urine Chemistry Strips only (Glucose, Protein, Bilirubin, Urobilinogen, pH, Specific Gravity,

# INTENDED USE (CONTINUED):

Blood, Ketones, Nitrite, Leukocyte Esterase, Ascorbic Acid and Color). The iChem 100 is intended for use exclusively by healthcare professionals. The results obtained from the iChem 0 re useful in the evaluation  renal,urinary, and metabolic disorers

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

The indicated use of the proposed and predicate urine analyzers is the same. Both systems (instruments and associated strips) provide qualitative and semi-quantitative measurements of urine analytes using multi-parameter test strips.

The overall design of the proposed iChem 100 Urine Analyzer is very similar to the predicate. Boaza and place the test strip on a tray in the analyzer. The analyzers then time the reaction on the strip and automatically move the test strip to the Optical Block for analysis.

The proposed iChem 100 Urine Analyzer and the predicate AUTION JET™ AJ-4270 use reflectance spectroscopy for the measurement of all urine analytes. The proposed iChem 100 Urin Analyzer, and he predicat AUTN JET use reflecanc specrosopy or urie clo determination. The proposed device implements the sensing function with a CMOS camera, compared to a photodiode used on the predicate device. Both units are microprocessor controlled.

The iChem 100 Urine Analyzer is indicated for use with iChem 10 SG Urine Chemistry test strips. The proposed iChem 10 SG strips are similar to the AUTION Sticks10EA that are indicated for use with he predicate AUTION JET AJ-4270, with he exception that the iChem 10 SG test strips contain a reagent pad for the measurement of Ascorbic Acid. The measurement of ascorbic acid on the iChem 100 is intended as a warning to the operator of potential interference with other tests due to elevated levels of ascorbic acid. The AUTIN Sticks EA do not contain a reagent pad for the measurement of Ascorbic Acid

The mechanisms of action for the chemical reactions used for the determination of urinary analytes, including glucose and occult blood, are similar for the proposed iChem 0 SG strips and the predicate AUTION JET™M 10 EA test strips.

# PERFORMANCE TESTING

Non-clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the iChem 100 Automated Urine Analyzer. A correlation study demonstrated substantial equivalence when results from the Che0 wee compared to the predicate deviceAdditional studies or precision and linearity demonstrated acceptable peormance  theihem0 System or  tended

Dear Mr. Haddock:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devics hat have bee cassif rance wit he provisions  the Federal FoDr and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
