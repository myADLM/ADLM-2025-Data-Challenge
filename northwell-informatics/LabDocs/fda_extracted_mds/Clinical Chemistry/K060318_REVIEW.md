# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies across the measuring range of the assay were performed via protocols based upon CLSI EP6-A. The studies demonstrated linearity of the assays and the linear regression statistics listed below. In addition, post dilution studies were performed to validate the automated dilution function and range.

# ABX PENTRA AST CP

The measuring range of the assay is $4 - 6 0 0 { \mathrm { U / L } }$ ; Post dilution up to 1800 U/L.

Linear regression statistics: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 3 3 \mathbf { x } + 1 . 2 6 3 3 \ \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 8$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# ABX PENTRA AST CP

Reagent Shelf-life: Real time stability of the reagent stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ has been evaluated on 3 different lots. Results support a real time stability of at least 24 months.

Reagent Stability on board: Reagent stability on-board has been evaluated by testing accuracy and linearity periodically. From the results, the reagent stability on-board (refrigerated area) after opening is 55 days.

# ABX PENTRA N Control & ABX PENTRA P Control traceability

The values of the ABX PENTRA Controls are assigned from the ABX PENTRA calibrator, reagents and analyzers. The target value is determined by the median of results from 150 measurements/parameter. Confidence range is determined as the calculated range in percent which is based on the experimental results from the previous target value trials. The range declared in the target value sheet is equal to the assigned value $+ / - 3$ standard deviations (3 SD).

# ABX Pentra Multical traceability

ABX Pentra Multical is prepared from reference materials. Commercial calibrators are standardized by means of a Master Lot which is stored at - $8 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Two controls are used to ensure that the calibration values of the Master Lot, as well as the entire measurement system (calibrator, reagent, and analyzer), remain stable during the storage period. The target value is determined by the median of results from 150 measurements/parameter.

# ABX PENTRA N Control, ABX PENTRA P Control, and ABX PENTRA Multical

Protocols and acceptance criteria for open and closed stability of the controls and calibrators were described and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

# ABX PENTRA AST CP

Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) was calculated from 30 measurements of saline water $( 0 . 9 \ \mathrm { g } / 1 )$ using the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986, (44), 686-745).. The claimed MDL value is $4 \mathrm { U } / 1$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

# ABX PENTRA AST CP

Hemoglobin up to $9 5 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ , total bilirubin up to $2 4 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $4 1 5 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ , direct bilirubin up to $2 0 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $( 3 6 2 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ and triglycerides (as Intralipid $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ , representative of lipemia) up to $4 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m m o l } / 1$ $( 4 0 2 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d l } )$ do not interfere with AST determination by this test.

Study materials: Substances were added to pooled Human serum at two different AST activities (normal and high). The base serum with each substance was then serially diluted with the same base serum that was added saline instead of substance to adjust AST activity.

Method : Based upon the Valtec guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986, (44), 686-745)

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A total of 103 samples were compared with the Roche Direct AST Bilirubin reagent (predicate) on the Roche MIRA Plus. Regression statistics were as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 6 5 4 \mathrm { x } + 4 . 0 4 3 1 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 6 3
$$

Additional studies were performed to provide complementary data covering the low end of the AST assay range.

Sample range $3 . 6 - 9 . 6 ~ \mathrm { U / L }$ , $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 0$ , $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 8 8 2 1 \mathrm { x } = 1 . 3 8 4 $ 1, $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 1 8 3$ .

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

To demonstrate equivalence of AST in serum and Plasma Heparin-Lithium samples, comparison study was performed. 43 samples were evaluated on ABX Pentra 400 analyzer using ABX Pentra AST CP reagent. $\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 2 7 \mathrm { x } +$ $0 . 4 3 3 4 \mathrm { \ r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 9 .$ . The results show that there is no significant difference between serum specimens and Heparin-Lithium Plasma.
