# Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

# Comparison Studies:

Clinical evaluations were performed to determine the safety and efficiency of Teco Blood Specimen Collection Devices: Vacu lab Plain Tube and Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube. The devices were compared demonstrated that the Teco Blood Specimen Colection Devices: Vacu lab Plain Tube and Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube provide clinically equivalent chemistry analyte results when compared to the BD Vacutainer Pius SST M Tube.

Four studies were conducted to evaluate the use of Teco Blood Specimen Collection Devices: Vacu lab Plain Tube and Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube in chemistry assays.

Study I was conducted to evaluate the use of the Vacu Lab Plain Tube. The objective of the studes was to demonstrate substantial equivalence  the Becton Dickinson ( Vacutainer  Pus T  Tube (K023075) when samples from these tubes are used in chemistry assays included total protein, Albumin, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, r-GT, Cholesterol. A total 66 paired samples were collected from outpatients and samples were tested on Hitachi 717. The Vacu Lab Plain Tube demonstated equivalent results to the predicate device.

Study II was continuous conducted to evaluate the use of the Vacu Lab Plain Tube. Randomly collect outpatient blood samples 25. Draw the same amount blood from each patient into the Vacu Lab Plain Tube an D Vacutainer  Plus SST  Tube and Centriuge 10 minutes. Test he supernatant. Assys performed on Beckman CX7, Hitachi 912 and Elisa Reader TC98 included potassium, glucose, creatinine, calcium, chloride, creatinine kinase (CK), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), magnesium, phosphorous, triglyceride, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, CK-MB, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Free T, rr, prolacn, total prote, bun, total bilubi, rec bilibi AST, ALT.ALP.-GT and Cholesterol. Test conducted within 8 hours after collecting samples. The Vacu Lab Plain Tube demonstrated equivalent esults e redicatedvi.

Study III was conducted to evaluate the use of Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube. The objective of the m usal euivac   Bec c u ST Tube (K023075) when samples from these tubes are used in chemistry assays included total protein, Albumin, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, r-GT, Cholesterol. A total 70 paired samples were collected from outpatients and samples were tested on Hitachi 717. The Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube demonstrated equivalent results to the predicate device.

Study IV was continuous to evaluate the use of Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube. Randomly collect outpatient blood samples 25. Draw the same amount blood from each patient into Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube and B Vacutainer Plus ST Tube and Centrifuge 10 minutes. Test the supernatant Assays performed on Beckman CX7, Hitachi 912 nd Elisa Reader TC98 included potaum, glucose, creatinine, calcium, chloride, creatinine kinase (CK), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), magnesium, phosphorous, triglyceride, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, CK-MB, thyroid stimulating hoe TH), Free T n, procn, toa prot, alu, oal bilbn,dc blbn AST, ALT, ALP,r-GT and Cholesterol. Test conducted within 8 hours after collecting samples. The Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube demonstrated equivalent results to the predicate device.

All comparison studies yield correlation coefficient $\gtrsim 0 . 9 5$ An acceptable correlation coefficient for all comparison studies is $\ge 0 . 9 5$

# Stability Studies of Specimens

Studies were conducted to compare fresh specimens (8 hours after collecting samples) and 72 hours stored at 2-8 °C. All results showed no significant different from fresh specimens and 72 hours stored at 2-8 °C.

All comparison studies yield correlation coefficient $\ge 0 . 9 5$ . An acceptable correlation coefficient for all comparison studies is $\ge 0 . 9 5$

# Shelf- life Studies

The shelf studies are based on accelerated aging theory, Qo method.Put tubes in 60 centigrade oven for 50 days, to achieve equivalency at least 24 months of real life aging of Vacu Lab Plain Tube and Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube at 4-30 centigrade. The calculation as below:

The real time shelf life $\asymp$ Oven agi y ${ ^ { \mathrm { 1 0 } } } _ { = 5 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ 2 ~ } }$ (60-20)/10 =50 x 2 4=800 days. So we claimed that the shelf life is 2 years.

Note: $\mathrm { ~ Q ~ } _ { 1 0 }$ reaction-rate coeffiecient 2.

Average Storage temperature: 20 centigrade.

Procedure: Put Vacu Lab Plain Tube and Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube into 60 centigrade oven for 50 days. After 50 days, we collected 25 outpatient blood specimens. We drew each patient blood into vacu Lab Plain Tubes, Vacu Lab Gel & Clot activator Tubes and BD vacutainer TM Plus SST Tm Tubes to compare studies. All tests were undertaken on Hitach912 and Elisa Reader TC 98. The results of comparison studies did not show any significant difference from the results of BD vacutainer TM Plus SST Tm Tubes.

All comparison studies yield correlation coefficient ≥ 0.95. An acceptable correlation coefficient for all comparison studies is $\ge 0 . 9 5$
