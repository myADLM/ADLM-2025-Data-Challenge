# G. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section:   
21 CFR 862.1675

2. Classification: Class II

3. Product code: JKA

4. Panel:

75 (Clinical Chemistry)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

The Vacu Lab Plain Tube is a sterile, plastic, evacuated blood collection tube with a silica clot activator that provides a means of collecting, transporting, separating, and processing blood in a closed tube. The specimens are used for clinical laboratory assays involving the use of patient serum.

The Vacu Lab Gel & Clot Activator Tube is a sterile, plastic, evacuated blood collection tube with a silica clot activator and a barrier gel that provides a means of collecting, transporting, separating, and processing blood in a closed tube. The specimens are used for clinical laboratory assays involving the use of patient serum.

2. Indication(s) for use: Refer to intended use above

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

Prescription Use only.

These blood collection tubes are not intended to be used to collect blood specimens for therapeutic drug monitoring.

4. Special instrument requirements:

Not applicable

# I. Device Description:

The Teco Diagnostics Vacu Lab Plain Tube is a sterile, plastic, evacuated blood collection tube. It consists of a closure assembly, a silica clot activator, and a silicone surfactant coated on the inside of the plastic tube. The Teco Diagnostics Vacu Lab Gel and Clot Activator Tube is identical to the Plain Tube except for the addition of a barrier gel that separates the serum from the cells when centrifuged.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

To demonstrate comparable performance with the predicate device, the sponsor collected blood samples into the Plain Tube, the Gel and Clot Activator Tube, and the predicate tube. The specimens were allowed to clot, and the serum was removed for testing immediately after centrifugation. Serum from the three tubes was then tested on two different analyzers for total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, r-GT, cholesterol, potassium, glucose, creatinine, calcium, chloride, creatine kinase, hCG, magnesium, phosphorous, triglyceride, uric acid, BUN, sodium, CKMB, TSH, free T4, ferritin, and prolactin. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was that the $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 }$ value from linear regression $\mathsf { b e } \geq 0 . 9 5$ . Linear regression was performed using the predicate (independent variable) vs. the Plain Tube (dependent variable) and the predicate (independent variable) vs. the Gel and Clot Activator Tube (dependent variable). All of the comparisons met the acceptance criteria.

# b. Matrix comparison:

Not applicable. These blood collection tubes are for serum only.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
