3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not Applicable (N/A)

# I. Device Description:

The calibrators contain tacrolimus in preserved whole blood hemolysate. The calibrator kit consists of one vial of each calibrator level with target concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ of tacrolimus.

The calibrators contain human blood components. Each lot was tested and found to be non-reactive for Hepatitis B Suface Antigen (HBsAg), Antibody to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV 1/2), Antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Antibody to Syphilis.

L. Test Principle: N/A

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: N/A

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

N/A

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The tacrolimus frozen liquid stock solution was prepared gravimetrically from commercially available pharmaceutical grade tacrolimus. Calibrators are prepared by directly spiking the stock solution into whole blood hemolysate to form the target concentrations. Verification occurred via recovery against a master lot. The master lot is formulated by diluting the stock into the whole blood hemolysate with the preservatives at six different levels and stored at $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The potential master lot of calibrators is assigned by multiple runs using the Emit Tacrolimus Assay calibrated with the existing master lot of calibrators verified by LC/MS.

Shelf-life and open vial stability was conducted using real-time data from 3 lots of calibrators. Each level of calibrators was tested in duplicate and replicates of 6 with commercially available control material. The calibrators (stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) were tested at 0,1,2,3,7,9,13,15,22,25,31 and 37 months. An open vial stability (stored at $9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) study was conducted at 0, 8 and 12 weeks. Verification of the 8 week open vial stability throughout the 36 month shelf life, the open vial stability was repeated from 7 to 37 months at 6 month intervals. The study results support the sponsors 8 week open vial and 36 month shelf life stability.
