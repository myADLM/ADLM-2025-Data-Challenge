CFR/Class ⅡI

This summary of $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

The assigned $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ number is KO60383

# Test Description:

The Glucose assay is used for the quantitation of glucose in human serum, plasma, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) specifically oxidizes G-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH). One micromole of NADH is produced for each micromole of glucose consumed. The NADH produced absorbs light at 340 nm and can be detected spectrophotometrically as an increased absorbance.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Glucose assay is substantially equivalent to the Glucose/HK assay (K953847) on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer. Both assays yield similar Performance Characteristics.

# Similarities:

Both assays are in vitro enzymatic chemical reaction assays.   
Both assays can be used or the quantitative analysi o glucose.   
Both assays yield similar results.   
•Both assays are based on the hexokinase/G-6-PDH methodology.

# Differences:

# None

# Intended Use:

The Glucose assay is used for the quantitation of glucose in human serum, plasma, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

# Performance Characteristics:

Comparative performance studies were conducted using the AEROSET® and ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Systems. The Glucose assay method comparison yielded acceptable correlation with the Glucose/HK assay on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer. The AEROSET System showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9995, slope of 1.09, and Y-intercept of - $5 . 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum application, a correlation coefficient of 0.9998, slope of 1.09, and Y-intercept of - $1 . 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the urine application, and a correlation coefficient of 0.9998, slope of 1.09, and Y-intercept of - $4 . 2 9 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the CSF application when compared to the Hitachi 917 Analyzer. The ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9993, slope of 1.06, and Y-intercept of - $4 . 5 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum application, a correlation coefficienit of 0.9998, slope of 1.04, and Y-intercept of $- 2 . 6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the urine application, and a correlation coefficient of 0.9997, slope of 1.04, and Y-intercept of $- 3 . 8 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the CSF application when compared to the Hitachi 917 Analyzer. The ARCHITECT c8000 System showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9996, slope of 0.97 and Y-intercept of $0 . 8 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum application, a correlation coefficient of 0.9999, slope of 0.96, and Y-intercept of $\mathrm { \cdot 1 . 3 6 ~ m g / d L }$ for the urine application, and a correlation coefficient of 0.9998, slope of 0.95, and Y-intercept of $0 . 2 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the CSF application when compared to the AEROSET System. The Glucose assay method comparison yielded acceptable correlation between the AEROSET System and the ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System.

Precision studies were conducted using the Glucose assay. On the AEROSET System, the total $\% \mathbf { C V }$ for Level 1 is $1 . 0 6 \%$ , and Level 2 is $1 . 4 1 \%$ for the serum application, the total $\% C V$ for Level 1 is $1 . 6 6 \% ,$ and Level 2 is $1 . 3 5 \%$ for the urine application, and the total $\% C V$ for Level 1 is $1 . 5 5 \%$ , and Level 2 is $1 . 6 9 \%$ for the CSF application. On the ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System, the total $\% \textcircled { \times } \mathbf { V }$ for Level 1 is $2 . 1 5 \%$ , and Level 2 is $1 . 5 1 \%$ for the serum application, the total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for Level 1 is $1 . 0 1 \%$ , and Level 2 is $0 . 8 0 \%$ for the urine application, and the total $\% \mathrm { { C V } }$ for Level 1 is $1 . 0 7 \%$ , and Level 2 is $1 . 1 7 \%$ for the CSF application.

The Glucose assay is linear from 5 to $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum/plasma application. The Glucose assay is linear from 1 to $8 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the urine/CSF application. The limit of quantitation (sensitivity) of the Glucose assay is $5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum application, and $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the urine/CSF applications.

These data demonstrate that the performance of the Glucose assay is substantially equivalent to the performance of the Glucose/HK assay on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer.

# Conclusion:

The Glucose assay is substantially equivalent to the Glucose/HK assay on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer as demonstrated by results obtained in the studies.

Dear Ms. Morris:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
