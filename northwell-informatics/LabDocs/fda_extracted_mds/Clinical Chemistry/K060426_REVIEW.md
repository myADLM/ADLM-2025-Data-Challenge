# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A, Evaluation of the Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The D-Glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose preparation. Stability characteristics of the Liberty Glucose Control were determined using the Arrhenius model of accelerated elevated temperature and real time studies to determine estimated storage stability at $2 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial stability was determined to be 90 days at $2 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

The expected values were determined by repeat testing on each glucose monitor (Bayer Ascensia DEX 2/DEX and Breeze). Statistical analysis of the data obtained resulted in one range for the three glucose monitors. The expected results may change with each new lot, but the control range is listed in the product insert. In addition, the product insert alerts the user to use the control range indicated in the control’s product insert rather than the glucose test strip product’s insert.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
