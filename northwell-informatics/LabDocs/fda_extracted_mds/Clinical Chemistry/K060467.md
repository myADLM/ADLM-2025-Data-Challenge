# Safety and Effective Information

# Predicate Device:

Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to TaiDoc Technology Corporation. K042005, Achtung TD-4207/ Clever Chek TD-4209/ Clever Chek TD-4222 Glucose Test Systems.

# Indications for Use:

The Prodigy Blood Glucose Test System is intended for use in the quantitative

measurement of glucose in capillary whole blood from the fingertip and palm. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and are not intended for use on neonates.

# Device Description:

The Prodigy glucose test system consists of a meter and test strips. The system utilizes an electrochemical method-based meter and dry reagent biosensor (test strips) for blood glucose tcsting. Thc size of the curent is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample, providing a quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh whole blood and control solutions. The system also provides voice broadcast function when the meter is used to test.

# Safety and Effectiveness, comparison to predicate device:

The results of clinical and non-clinical testing indicate that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate.

Dear Mr. Kamm:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations afecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
