# I. Device Description:

The Prodigy Blood Glucose Test System consists of a meter, two levels of control solution and test strips. The system utilizes an electrochemical method based meter and dry reagent biosensor (test strips) using glucose oxidase for blood glucose testing. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample, providing a quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh whole blood and control solutions. The system also provides voice broadcast function when the meter is used to test.

# L. Test Principle:

Quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood with an electrochemical biosensor begins when a drop of blood is introduced on the side of the test strip. The electrons produced from the reaction form a current. Under the potential provided from the meter, a current is generated from the electrons produced during glucose oxidation. The current is calibrated to measure the glucose concentration in the whole-blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Within-day imprecision was evaluated by spiking venous whole blood samples to provide 5 levels of glucose concentration. Each sample was tested ten times using ten different meters (100 measurements for each of the five levels for 500 total measurements). Three different lots of reagent (test strips) were used. Results are summarized below:

Day to day imprecision was evaluated by testing 3 levels of control solutions using 10 different meters for 10 days. Each of the 3 control solutions was tested on all 10 meters each day, for 300 total measurements. Three different lots of reagent (test strips) were used. Results are summarized below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Spiked recovery was evaluated by preparing spiked glucose samples across the measuring range $\left( 2 0 { - } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } \right)$ . Whole blood was depleted of glucose by allowing it to sit at room temperature. The blood was then spiked to 9 targeted glucose concentrations (20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 200, 320, 420, and $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Values were

verified using a YSI-2300 glucose analyzer. Each sample was measured 10 times on the Prodigy meter. The mean of each sample was plotted against the YSI-2300 value with a resultant regression equation of $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 0 9 7 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 3 1 3 4$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 7 8$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Two levels of control material (normal and high) are provided for use with the test system. The controls are prepared gravimetrically in an aqueous matrix. Expected values are verified for each manufactured lot. The open and closed stability were tested.

d. Detection limit:

The reportable range of the assay is $2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . See linearity study above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The hematocrit effect was evaluated at $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $60 \%$ hematocrit levels. Samples in the five different concentrations were measured by using YSI2300 as a reference method. The results of mean difference analysis showed no significant hematocrit effect from $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ for samples with glucose concentration levels from 40 to $4 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sponsor defined significant effect as glucose value $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at concentrations $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and glucose value $\pm 2 0 \%$ at concentrations $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Altitude showed no significant effect up to 10, 744 feet. The sponsor defined significant effect as glucose value $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ at concentrations $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and glucose value $\pm 2 0 \%$ at concentrations $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The sponsor tested the effects of temperature, humidity, and resistance to drop and vibration on the meter’s performance. The sponsor claims that there is no effect of these factors on glucose results (defined as within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ difference in samples below $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 2 0 \%$ in samples above $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and repeatability of $< 5 \%$ CV at all glucose levels before and after each challenge).

The sponsor tested 6 exogenous and 2 endogenous substances for interference with their meter. No interference (defined as $\leq 1 0 \%$ ) was seen up to the following concentrations:

Acetaminophen – up to 5 mg/dL Ascorbic acid – up to $2 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Dopamine – up to 2 mg/dL L-dopa – up to 3 mg/dL

Methyl dopa – up to $0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

Tolbutamide – up to 200 mg/dL

Uric acid – up to 10 mg/dL

Triglyceride – up to 2000 mg/dL

The package insert states that no interferences are seen at normal physiological levels of these potential interferents as the levels at which interference is seen are above the normal observed physiological concentrations of these substances.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Healthcare professionals obtained capillary samples from 120 patients at 3 sites (40 per site). The samples ranging in concentration from $3 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested on the Prodigy meter (test method) and the Roche Accu-chek meter (comparator method) and the values were compared.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Lay users $( { \tt n } = 1 2 0 )$ ) were given the instructions for use and asked to fill out a questionnaire related to the readability of the Owner’s Manual and ease of use of the meter. The evaluation results were acceptable. The lay users obtained blood samples from the fingertip using the device and the results were compared to the results obtained on the YSI-2300. The YSI-2300 vs. lay user regression statistics are as follows: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 3 6 \mathrm { x } - 8 . 0 8 7$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 6 9$ , for samples ranging in glucose concentration from $2 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 4 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

In order to assess the accuracy of palm site testing compared to fingertip testing, samples were taken by healthcare professionals from the fingertip and palm of 120 subjects at time of steady state (more than 2 hours since the last meal) and run on the Prodigy meter. The palm vs. fingertip regression statistics on the Prodigy meter are as follows: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 1 2 \mathrm { x } - 4 . 4 1 7 1$ , for samples ranging in glucose concentration from 29 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 4 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

A consumer study was performed to evaluate the use of the Prodigy meter using the palm as an alternative site. The studies were conducted at time of steady state. Sixty lay users read the Owner’s Manual, obtained palm blood samples and performed the blood glucose test on the Prodigy meter. The lay users also obtained fingertip blood samples and performed the blood glucose test on the Prodigy meter. The lay users also filled out a questionnaire related to the ease of obtaining and measuring the sample from the palm. The results of the questionnaire were acceptable. The lay user palm vs. lay user fingertip glucose regression statistics are as follows: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 3 6 8 \mathrm { x } -$ 3.9975, ${ \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 8 4 7 }$ , for samples ranging in glucose concentration from $4 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 0 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .
