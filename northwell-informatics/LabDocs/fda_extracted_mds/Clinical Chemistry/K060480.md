# Predicate Device

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Assay is substantially equivalent to the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Assay (K983990-original formulation). The only modifications made to the proposed VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Assay are to the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Reagent Pack. There are no modifications being made to the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Calibrators or the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Metabolism Controls, which were previously cleared under K983990.

# 5 Device Description

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System uses luminescence as the signal in the quantitative and semi-quantitative determination of selected analytes in human body fluids, commonly serum and plasma. Coated microwells are used as the solid phase separation system.

The system is comprised of there main elements:

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products range of immunoassay products in this case VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Reagent Pack, VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Calibrators (cleared under K983990) and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Metabolism Controls (cleared under K983990), which are combined by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System to perform the VITROS Cortisol assay. The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System - instrumentation, which provides automated use of the immunoassay kits. The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System was cleared for market by a separate 510(k) pre-market notification (K962919). Common reagents used by the VITROS System in each assay. The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Signal Reagent and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Universal Wash Reagent were cleared as part of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total T3 Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total T3 Calibrators 510(k) premarket notification (K964310).

# Note: High Sample Diluent B was cleared as part of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total B-hCG Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total B-hCG Calibrators 510(k) premarket notification (K970894).

The VITROS System and common reagents are dedicated specifically for use only with the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products range of immunoassay products.

# 6 Device Intended Use

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Cortisol Reagent Pack

For the in vitro quantitative measurement of cortisol in human serum, plasma (heparin or EDTA) or urine.

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Calibrators

For the in vitro use in the calibration of the VITROS Immunodiagnsotic System for the quantitative measurement of cortisol in human serum, plasma (heparin or EDTA) or urine.

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Metabolism Controls

For the in vitro use in monitoring the performance of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System when used for the measurement of cortisol in human serum, plasma (heparin or EDTA) or urine.

# Comparison to Predicate Device

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Reagent Pack is substantially equivalent to VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Reagent Pack (K983990) cleared by the FDA for in vitro diagnostic use.

Table 1 lists the characteristics of the VITROS Cortisol Reagent Pack (new formulation) and the VITROS Cortisol Reagent Pack (K983990- original formulation). There are no modifications to the current VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Calibrators (cleared under K983990), and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Metabolism Controls (cleared under K983990).

# 10 Conclusions

The information presented in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the performance of the proposed VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Cortisol Assay is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate device.

Equivalent performance was demonstrated using manufactured reagents, positive and negative controls and testing human samples throughout the assay range.

The information presented in the premarket notification provides a reasonable assurance that the proposed VITROS Cortisol Assay is safe and effective for the stated intended use.
