# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A, Evaluation of the Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The D-Glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose preparation. Stability characteristics of the Liberty Glucose Control were determined using the Arrhenius model of accelerated elevated temperature and real time studies to determine estimated storage stability at $2 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial stability was determined to be 90 days at $2 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ .

The expected values were determined by repeat testing on the TheraSense FreeStyle glucose monitor. Statistical analysis of the data was used to determine the range for the monitor. Expected results may change with each lot, but the control will list the range in the product insert. In addition, the product insert alerts the user to use the range indicated in the control’s product insert rather than the glucose test strip product’s insert.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable.   
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
