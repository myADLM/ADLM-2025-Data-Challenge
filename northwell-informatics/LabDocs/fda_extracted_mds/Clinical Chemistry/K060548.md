# 4. Device Description(s):

# BhCG

# Method

The Stratus® CS Acute CareTM BhCG method is a solid phase, two-site sandwich fluorometric immunoassay based upon Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPlA) technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal βhCG antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the βhCG TestPak. The dendrimer binds clcctrostatically to the glass fibers and immobilizes the capture antibody to the paper. Sample is then added, whereupon βhCG reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate, consisting of enzyme-labeled (alkaline phosphatase) monoclonal antibody directed against a distinct antigenic site on the βhCG molecule, is pipetted onto the reaction zonc of the paper. During this sccond incubation period, thc unbound, labeled antibody is radially eluted with a wash solution. By including substrate (4- methylumbeliferyl phosphate) for the cnzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultancously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of $\beta \mathfrak { h } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { C }$ in the sample.

Utilization of two monoclonal antibodies which are specific for distinct antigenic sites on the $\beta$ subunit of hCG allows the assay to measure the total βhCG in the sample, vis, both the intact hCG dimer and the free $\beta$ subunit. Concentration is measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# Calibrator

The Stratus® CS Acute Care BhC'G calibrator $( \beta \mathsf { l n C G } \mathsf { C a l f ^ { \circ } a k } )$ contains human hCG in a bovine serum matrix with preservatives. The BhCG CalPak is a single-use liquid product which contains one calibrator level at an approximate coneentration of 950 mIU/ml\* [IU/L] in each of threc wels. The kit consists of five CalPaks at a single calibrator level.

# Diluent

The Stratus $\mathfrak { R }$ CS Acute Care βhCG Diluent (βhCG DilPak) contains a liquid buffered bovine protein protcin matrix with stabilizers and $0 . 0 9 \%$ sodium azide. The kit consists of 5 DilPaks with diluent in one well.

# NT-proBNP

# Method

The Stratus $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CS Acute CarerM NT-proBNP method is a 1wo-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPlA) technology. In this procedure, dendrimer linked polyclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the pBNP TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper where it rcacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labcled polyclonal antibody direeted

against a second distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound NT-proBNP, forming an antibody-antigen-labcled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later cluted from the ficld of view of the Stratus@ CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultancously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample. The reaction rate can then be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via froni surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

The modification of these two methods by adding point of care to thc intended use is supported by data included in Section 18 (βhCG) and Section 19 (NT-proBNP).

Method comparison and precision analyses wcre performed at three different locations (clinical laboratory (LAB), Emergency Departmcnt (ED) and Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) within either one (βhCG) or two (NT-proBNP) external evaluation sites. This data and a summary of information on the operators and their trainig, from cither the ED or CCU, i.e. "non-lab" operators, is also included in Sections 18 and 19.

This data supports us of these products by train health care profesionals in the clinical laboratory and point of care (POC) settings.

Dear Ms. Jurga:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
