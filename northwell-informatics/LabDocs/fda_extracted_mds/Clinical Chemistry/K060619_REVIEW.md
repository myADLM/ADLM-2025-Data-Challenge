# L. Test Principle:

Carbon dioxide is determined spectrophotometrically based on two coupled enzyme reactions including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). PEPC catalyzes the first reaction and produces oxaloacetate. In the presence of MDH, the reduced cofactor is oxidized by oxaloacetate. This results in a decrease in absorbance at 405 or $4 1 5 \mathrm { n m }$ that is directly proportional to carbon dioxide concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision at normal and abnormal high levels was evaluated on the Cobas Mira instrument according to CLSI EP5-A. In the study, two specimens containing $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { m M C O } _ { 2 }$ were tested with two runs per day with duplicates over 20 working days. The results are below.

The precision of the Diazyme Carbon Dioxide Enzymatic Assay was also evaluated on the Cobas Mira instrument with samples in the abnormal low range. In the study, twenty specimens containing approximately $1 6 \mathrm { m M C O } _ { 2 }$ were tested in three separate runs over two days. The concentrations ranged between $1 5 . 3 9 - 1 6 . 9 6 \mathrm { m M C O } _ { 2 }$ . The results are below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Two protocols were followed to demonstrate linearity. In Protocol A, six levels of commercial Casco $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ standard ranging from 0 to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ were tested in triplicate on the Cobas Mira automated analyzer. In Protocol B, eleven levels of linearity set prepared by diluting a serum control containing $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ with saline (according to CLSI EP6-A) were tested. Protocol A yielded recoveries ranging from approximately $9 9 \%$ to $1 0 5 \%$ . Protocol B yielded recoveries ranging from approximately $90 \%$ to $106 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The calibrator and controls are prepared by diluting sodium bicarbonate solution with saline to the target value(s).

Value assignment of the calibrator on the Cobas Mira instrument consisted of the following. The prepared lot of calibrator was tested in 10 runs on the instrument using a commercially available assay and a primary $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reference standard with traceability to NIST 351 and NIST 924 Carbonate Standards. The mean value of the calibrator and $\% C V$ were calculated from replicate analysis.

The same lot of calibrator was tested in 10 runs on the instrument using the Diazyme Carbon Dioxide Enzyme Assay, the same primary $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reference standard, and two patient serum samples previously tested with the commercially available device. The mean value of the calibrator and the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated from replicate analysis.

Value assignment of the controls on the Cobas Mira instrument consisted of the following. One lot of the Level 1 and Level 2 controls, along with the primary $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reference standard and two patient serum samples previously tested with a commercially available assay, were tested with 5 runs on the Cobas Mira using one lot of the assay. The mean values and ranges of the controls were calculated.

To assess reagent and calibrator stability, three lots of the assay kits with three lots of calibrators after opening were tested. The results demonstrated that the reagents and calibrators are stable for about 12 days at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and for at least 10 weeks at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The shelf-life of the assay kit is at least 12 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

The real time stability study is ongoing.

To assess open bottle stability of the controls, three lots of Diazyme Carbon Dioxide Controls were tested. The results demonstrated that the reagents and calibrators are stable for about 12 days at $3 7 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and for at least 12 weeks at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The shelf-life of the assay kit is at least 12 months at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . The real time stability study is ongoing.

# d. Detection limit:

To demonstrate limit of detection (LOD), a $1 \ \mathrm { m M } \ C \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ sample was tested in 12 replicates on the Cobas Mira. The LOD, defined as the mean $+ \ 3 \mathrm { S D }$ , is $1 . 1 2 \mathrm { m M C O } _ { 2 }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To determine the level of interference from substances normally present in serum, the device was tested with $2 5 \mathrm { m M }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { m M } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ serum samples spiked with varying concentrations (according to CLSI EP7-A). Five levels for each substance were tested in triplicate. Less than $10 \%$ deviation from 25 $\mathrm { m M }$ and $4 0 \mathrm { m M }$ was observed when tested up to the concentrations below.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Performance of the Diazyme Carbon Dioxide Enzymatic Assay was compared with performance of a commercially available assay on a Cobas Mira analyzer. Sixty serum (consisting of pooled and individual patient samples) and sixty individual patient plasma samples were analyzed. Some samples were spiked with stock solution of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ to target concentrations, to ensure distribution across the reportable range. Serum samples ranging from 5.9 to $4 4 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9859. Linear regression analysis resulted in the following equation: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 4 4 7 \mathbf { x } - 0 . 9 7 4 2$ . Plasma

samples ranging from 5.85 to $4 0 . 6 4 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9731. Linear regression analysis resulted in the following equation: $\mathbf { y } =$ $0 . 9 8 6 3 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 1 4 8 6$ .
