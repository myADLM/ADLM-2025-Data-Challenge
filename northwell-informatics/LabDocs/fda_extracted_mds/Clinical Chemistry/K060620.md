# Device name

Proprietary name: ACCU-CHEK $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Aviva Test Strips

Common name: Whole blood glucose test system

Classification name: 75, LFR, Glucose Dehydrogenase, glucose

# Predicate device

The Roche Diagnostics ACCU-CHEK Aviva system cleared under K043474 on April 27, 2005.

Device Description

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Test Strips are stored within a desiccated vial. A test strip is removed from the vial and inserted into the meter. Upon insertion, the meter is activated. Blood is applied to the end of the test strip, and a glucose result is reported.

The test principle is:

Blood from the test site works with the chemicals in the test strip to make a small electrical current in the test strip. The meter reads the current and gives a blood glucose results.

# 5) Intended use

The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Test Strips are used with the ACCU-CHEK Aviva meter. The ACCU-CHEK Aviva system is designed to quantitatively measure the concentration of glucose for monitoring glucose in the home or in health care facilities. Testing sites include traditional fingertip site along with palm, forearm, upper arm, thigh, and calf.

Professionals may use the test strips to test capillary, venous, arterial, and neonate samples; home use is limited to capillary whole blood testing.

The proposed modification is relatively modest in scope. The following is a list of some of the claims and features unaffected by the proposed modifications.

Dear Mr. Thiel:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
