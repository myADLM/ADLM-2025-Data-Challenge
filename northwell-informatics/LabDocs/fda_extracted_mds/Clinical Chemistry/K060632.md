# 5 Device Description

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System uses luminescence as the signal in the quantitative and semi-quantitative determination of selected analytes in human body fluids, commonly serum and plasma. Coated microwells are used as the solid phase separation system.

The system is comprised of there main elements:

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products range of immunoassay products in this case the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products NTproBNP Reagent Pack, the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products NT-proBNP Calibrators, and the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products NT-proBNP Range Verifiers (which are combined by the VITROS Immunodiagnostic system to perform the VITROS NTproBNP assay) and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products High Sample Diluent B.

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System - instrumentation, which provides automated use of the immunoassay kits. The VITROS Immunodiagnostic System was cleared for market by a separate 510(k) pre-market notification (K962919).

Common reagents used by the VITROS System in each assay. The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Signal Reagent and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Universal Wash Reagent were cleared as part of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total T3 Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total T3 Calibrators 510(k) premarket notification (K964310).

# Note: High Sample Diluent B was cleared as part of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total β-hCG Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total B-hCG Calibrators 510(k) premarket notification (K970894).

The VITROS System and common reagents are dedicated specifically for use only with the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products range of immunoassay products.

# Device Intended Use

VITROS Immunodiagnostics NT-proBNP Reagent Pack: For the in vitro quantitative measurement of N-terminal pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) in human serum and plasma (EDTA or heparin) to aid in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure and for the risk stratification of acute coronary syndrome and congestive heart failure. The test is further indicated as an aid in the assessment of increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at risk for heart failure who have stable coronary artery disease.The test can also be used in the assessment of heart failure severity in patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure.

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products NT-proBNP Calibrator For in vitro use in the calibration of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic System for the quantitative measurement of N-terminal pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) in human serum and plasma (EDTA or heparin).

VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products NT-proBNP Range Verifiers For the in vio us inverifyin the calbratin ange he VITROS Immunodiagnostic System when used for the quantitative measurement of N-terminal pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP).

Dear Ms. Water:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). Youmay obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
