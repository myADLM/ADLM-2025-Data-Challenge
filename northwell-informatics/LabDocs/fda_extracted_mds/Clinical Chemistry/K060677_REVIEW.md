“In vitro diagnostic for the quantitative determination of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) in human serum by means of particle-enhanced immunonephelometry using the $\mathbf { B N ^ { \mathrm { T M } } }$ II and BN ProSpec $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ System. The N Latex CDT assay must be run concurrently with the $_ \mathrm { N }$ Antisera to Human Transferrin

assay so that the result can be expressed as a relative ratio, i.e., $\% { \bf C D T }$ of the total transferrin. The calculation of $\% { \bf C } { \bf D } { \mathrm { T } }$ can be used as a tool to identify possible chronic heavy alcohol consumption.”

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): Indicated for prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements: BN II and BN ProSpec System

# I. Device Description:

The N Latex CDT Kit consists of reagents, standards, and controls. There are three reagents: Reagent 1 contains a suspension of polystyrene particles coated with CDT, Reagent 2 contains a suspension of polystyrene particles coated with anti-CDT mouse monoclonal antibodies, while the Supplementary Reagent is a buffered saline solution. Standards and controls contain stabilized human serum matrix and known concentrations of CDT.

Note: This assay and the N Antiserum to Human Transferrin Assay must be used in conjunction to calculate %CDT. CDT values obtained from this assay and transferrin values obtained from the transferrin assay are used to calculate %CDT by onboard software. Transferrin assay components were not evaluated in this submission (see k972840).

All human source materials were tested for HBsAg, HCV, and HIV-1/2 and found to be negative.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s): Axis-Shield %CDT

2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k992502

3. Comparison with predicate:

The devices have a similar intended use, consist of assay reagents, calibrators, and controls, and are based on immunoassays that use mouse monoclonal antibodies. Both assays report $\% { \bf C } { \bf D } { \mathrm { T } }$ $\mathrm { ( m g / m L }$ CDT divided by $\mathrm { m g / m L }$ total transferrin).

The assays differ in technology, preparation technique and unit of measure. The predicate method utilizes an ion-exchange column to separate CDT isoforms from other transferrin molecules. The CDT content in the eluted fraction is then determined by a turbidimetric immunoassay. The N Latex CDT assay does not have a separation step but relies on the ratio of the results of two separate assays to calculate $\% { \bf C } { \bf D } { \mathrm { T } }$ . The measuring ranges of the assays differ.

# L. Test Principle:

This is a competitive immunoassay; CDT in the sample competes with CDT-coated polystyrene particles for a limited number of mouse monoclonal anti-CDT binding sites on polystyrene particles. CDT in the sample inhibits the aggregation of the polystyrene beads resulting in lower turbidity and therefore less scattered light. The ratio of scattered light to directed light is compared to a known standard to calculate the concentration of CDT.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Imprecision was determined by measuring two controls and two serum pools (one low, one high) eight times a day over five days $( \mathbf { n } = \mathbf { 4 0 } ) _ { , }$ ) using a BN II system. Imprecision results were within the acceptance criteria set by the sponsor.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity of the N Latex CDT Kit was evaluated by serially diluting a known sample with high concentrations of CDT and transferrin with N Diluent. Each dilution was tested five times on a BN ProSpec System and the mean $\%$ recovery was calculated.

Recovery of samples relative to the target value ranged from $94 \%$ to $12 1 \%$ (mean recovery $102 \%$ ) for $\% { \bf C D T }$ and $9 8 \%$ to $120 \%$ for $\mathrm { m g / L }$ CDT (mean recovery $104 \%$ ). Recovery was within the sponsor’s acceptance specifications.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The standards and controls are calibrated against an internal master calibrator that is in turn calibrated against CRM 470, a reference standard for transferrin. The master calibrator value is corrected for the difference in masses between the carbohydrate portions of CDT and normal transferrin.

Stability: Unopened assay components were shown to be stable for 12 month at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ by real-time testing. Opened, all components are stable for two weeks stored at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . On-board stability for all components is a minimum of three days.

d. Detection limit:

Twenty replicates of the N-Diluent were run on a BN ProSpec. The analytical sensitivity of the N Latex CDT assay was defined as the mean value plus two standard deviations. The resulting value, $0 . 0 0 3 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ was within the sponsor’s acceptance criterion.

e. Analytical specificity:

Normal serum samples were spiked with the compounds below at various concentrations and the concentration of CDT was compared to that of an unspiked sample as determined on a BN II System. The sponsor reports no interference (defined by the sponsor’s acceptance criterion as less than $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the unspiked sample) up to the concentrations listed in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Serum samples $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } = 1 1 6 )$ were evaluated with the N Latex CDT Assay and the predicate Axis-Shield $\% { \bf C D T }$ assay on a BN II System. The majority $\mathbf { \bar { n } = }$ 101) of the samples were collected from patients undergoing routine CDT testing; the balance were spiked samples. These patients were suspected of having heavy alcohol consumption but other clinical details were not available. Sample concentrations ranged from 1.1 to $3 2 . 0 \ \% \mathrm { C D T }$ . Regression analysis of the results yielded the following equation: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 7 2 0 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 7 5 \%$ CDT, $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9$ .
