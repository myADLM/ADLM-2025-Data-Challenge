# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A, Evaluation of the Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The D-glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose preparation.

The stability of the product was determined by accelerated and real-time stability studies. Accelerated studies were performed at 37, 45 and $5 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Using the Arrhenius model, the results indicated shelf life stability for 24 months according to the sponsor’s criterion of $\leq 5 \%$ loss. Real time studies are on-going to confirm accelerated findings. The open vial stability was determined by testing simulated use of opening vial for 10 minutes then closed. The results indicated open vial stability for 90 days according to the sponsor’s criterion of $\leq 5 \%$ loss from day 1.

The expected values for the monitors were determined by testing three lots of strips in replicates of 10. The mean, standard deviation and $\%$ CV were

obtained for each monitor. Analysis of the data resulted in assigned ranges of the following $\pm \%$ of the calculated mean:

Roche Accu-check Active - $\cdot \pm 1 4 . 5 \%$ Bayer Ascensia Microfill - $\pm 1 2 \%$ LifeScan OneTouch Ultra - $\mathbf { \Delta } \cdot \pm \ 1 7 \%$ LifeScan FastTake - $\pm 1 8 \%$

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:
