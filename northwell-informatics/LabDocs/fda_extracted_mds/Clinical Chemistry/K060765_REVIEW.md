4. Special instrument requirements:

The microcuvettes and HemoCue 201 RT analyzer are not intended for use with other components. They are mutually exclusive.

# I. Device Description:

The HemoCue Glucose 201 RT Analyzer is a portable device. The main parts are the cuvette holder (brings the microcuvette in correct measuring position), the optronic unit (a photometer which performs the measurement in the microcuvette) a display, a power adaptor and embedded software.

The single-use Microcuvette contains reagents deposited on its inner walls and serves both as a pipette and as a measuring cuvette. A blood sample of approximately $4 \mu \mathrm { L }$ is drawn into the cavity by capillary action. The filled microcuvette is inserted into the HemoCue Analyzer. The measurement takes place in the analyzer in which the transmittance is measured and the absorbance and glucose level is calculated. The calibration of the analyzer is traceable to the ID (Isotope Dilution) GC-MS method. The HemoCue is factory calibrated and needs no further calibration. The reportable range is $1 2 { - } 5 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The instrument may be customized for use with or without plasma conversion of whole blood measurements. Plasma equivalents are determined by multiplying the whole blood reading by a factor of 1.1.

The sponsor indicates the device does not contain human source material.

The reportable range of the candidate device has been expanded from $4 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to 560 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Modifications have been made to the candidate device with regard to the chemical make-up of the microcuvette, storage requirements, dimensions, algorithm, and the software.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

The sponsor referenced the following guidance document(s) or standards:

CLSI document EP9-A. Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples;   
Approved Guideline- Second Edition. CLSI document EP5-A. Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices;   
Approved Guideline.

CLSI document EP7-A. Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline.

CLSI document EP6-A. Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedure: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline.

Guidance for Industry - Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices Containing Off-theShelf (OTS) Software issued January 14, 2005.

The sponsor did not indicate any deviation from these guidances.

# L. Test Principle:

The chemical reaction in the cavity of the HemoCue Glucose 201 RT microcuvettes has two phases, hemolysis and the glucose reaction. The glucose reaction is a modified glucose dehydrogenase method in which a tetrazolium salt (MTT) is used to obtain a quantification of glucose in visible light. $\beta$ -D-glucose is transformed to $\beta$ -D-glucose using mutarotase.

Glucose dehydrogenase acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of $\beta$ -D-glucose, to form NADH, which in the presence of diaphorase produces a colored formazan with MTT. The measurement takes place in the analyzer in which the transmittance is measured and the absorbance and glucose level is calculated.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Studies were conducted according to CLSI EP-5A guidance “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guidelines.” One batch of Microcuvettes, 5 analyzers, 5 operators, and 3 levels of commercial control were used in the study. Each operator ran duplicate samples twice a day for 20 days. Four hundred samples were run at each level. Results of the studies are presented below.

Precision was also established in POC studies. See the Method Comparison data in section M2, below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To verify linearity, the sponsor followed “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical methods”, CLSI Document EP6-A Vol. 21 No. 28. Five HemoCue 201 RT analyzers were used in the study. Four replicates per level were evaluated on each analyzer. Whole blood concentrations and plasma equivalent converted results (multiplied by 1.1) both appear linear. Samples were EDTA whole blood hemolysates spiked with Glucose to eleven different concentrations ranging from $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 6 0 0 ~ m g / d L }$ . Results of the study support the claimed reportable range ( $1 2 { - } 5 6 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

No calibrators are required. The device is factory calibrated. Calibration is traceable to an ID-GCMS (Isotope Dilution- Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) system.

Users are instructed to follow local, state, and federal guidelines regarding quality control procedures.

A commercial control material is identified in the labeling, i.e., Eurotrol GlucoTrol-NG. This control was originally cleared during the review of k964053 under the name HemoCue GlucoTrol-NG.

The instrument contains electronic checks which validates that inputs from the LEDs are linear to the output signal of the detector. The sponsor states this indicates the electronics in the device are stable.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor determined the lower limit of detection (LLD) for the HemoCue Glucose 201 RT system, defined as the lowest concentration which is measured by the analyzer with precision less than or equal to a $20 \%$ CV. To establish this, EDTA samples were aged to concentrations down to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and analyzed in replicates on multiple analyzers. A concentration of $1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ generated a $20 \%$ CV.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor evaluated the potential for interference from different compounds, proteins and $\mathsf { p H }$ levels. The cross reactivity of the enzyme Glucose Dehydrogenase (GDH) with various types of sugar species was also evaluated. The accepted deviation between the test sample (containing the interfering substance) and the mean values for the reference sample (not having the interferents) was $< 1 0 \%$ . Warnings are included in labeling for those with greater than $10 \%$ difference.

The sponsor states that they followed “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry”, CLSI Document EP7-A vol. $2 2 \mathrm { N o } 2 7$ . The cross-reactivity of the sugar species was analyzed according to an internal procedure.

Five replicates were run on each of five HemoCue Glucose 201 RT analyzers. Results appear below:

\*ID-GC/MS stands for Isotope Dilution-Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer

Data collected during the study was also used to characterize precision. Portions of the analyses are presented here. Performance among all studies appears comparable.

# Study A- Comparison to ID-GC/MS

Operators were provided with the HemoCue system and the instructions for use, in English, in order to evaluate readability of the labeling. Venous specimens were collected in EDTA tubes. All samples were analyzed in duplicate by the HemoCue and a single measurement was taken on the ID GC-MS reference method. After the study was completed the operators were given a questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of the labeling. A copy of the questionnaire is included in the submission. Results from the questionnaire were favorable.

Study Results:

Total mean difference between Glucose 201RT system and the comparative method was $0 . 2 3 \%$ .   
$\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 6$ for Glucose 201RT system individual results versus the comparative method. Bias (Glucose 201 RT – Comparative method) was $0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$   
The total standard deviation, SD, between duplicates was $3 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the Glucose 201RT system.
