# Device Name:

Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ Ketone Test Strips Optium Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips

Common Name: Blood Ketone Test Strips

# Classification:

Ketone Test System Class I per 21 CFR 862.1435

Product Code: JIN

# Predicate Device:

Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips, K983504   
Optium Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips, K040814

# Description:

The Precision® Xtra™ Diabetes Monitoring System utilizes amperometric biosensor technology to generate a current. The size of the current is proportional to the amount of $\beta .$ hydroxybutyrate $\mathrm { \cdot } \mathrm { \beta }$ -ketone) present in the sample, providing a quantitative measure of $\beta$ -ketone in whole blood and control solutions.

# Intended Use:

The Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips are intended for in vitro diagnostic use (i.e., external use only) for the quantitative measurement of $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate $\beta$ -ketone) in fresh capillary

whole blood. The Precision Xtra Blood $\beta .$ -Ketone Test Strips are indicated for home (lay user) or professional use. Healthcare professionals may also use venous whole blood samples, provided the samples are used within 30 minutes of collection.

# Comparison to

Predicate Device: The Precision Xtra Blood $\beta .$ -Ketone Test Strips/ Optium Blood $\beta$ Ketone Test Strips use the same fundamental scientific technology and have the same intended use as the predicate Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips (K983504) and Optium Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips (K050814).

# Performance Studies:

The performance of the Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips was verified through non clinical testing in the laboratory. The studies demonstrated that the Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips/ Optium Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips are substantially equivalent to the current Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips/ Optium Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips for blood $\beta$ ketone measurements.

# Conclusion:

Results of non clinical testing demonstrate that the performance of the Precision Xtra Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips/ Optium Blood $\beta$ - Ketone Test Strips, when used according to the intended use stated above, are acceptable and comparable to the performance of the previously mentioned predicate device for $\beta$ ketone testing.

Dear Ms. Trejo:

We have revicwed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subjcct to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either classII (Special Controls) or class III (PMA). it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements. including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 ('FR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

# Indications for Use

510(k) Number (if known):__K060768

# Device Name: Precision Xtra Blood β-Ketone Test Strips Optium Blood β-Ketone Test Strips

Indications For Use:

The Precision Xtra / Optium Blood $\beta$ -Ketone Test Strips are intended to quantitatively measure blood $\beta$ -Ketone (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The test strips are for use outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) and are for self-testing or healthcare professional use. Healthcare professionals may also use venous whole blood samples, provided the samples are used within 30 minutes of collection. The test strip is to be used for ketone concentrations in persons with diabetes and other conditions.
