# Device Description

The Access Folate reagents, Access Folate Calibrators, Access Folate Lysing Agent, Folate Calibrator S0 and the Access Immunoassay Analyzers (Access, Access 2, Synchron $L X ^ { \textcircled { 8 } } i 7 2 5$ UniCel $D \times 1 ^ { \mathsf { T M } }$ 800, and UniCel DxC 600i) comprise the Access Immunoassay Systems for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, plasma (heparin) and red blood cells.

# Intended Use

The Access Folate assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, plasma (heparin) and red blood cells using the Access Immunoassay Systems.

Folate levels in both serum and red blood cells are used to assess folate status. The serum folate level is an indicator of recent folate intake. Red blood cell (RBC) folate is the best indicator of long term folate stores. A low RBC folate value can indicate a prolonged folate deficiency.

# Summary of Technological Characteristics

The device modification consists of a change in buffers for pH adjustment and the reestablishment of the reference interval to reflect the prevalence of folic acid fortification of foods. The modification does not affect the intended use or indications of the device or alter the fundamental scientific technclogy of the device. The modification does not affect the safety and efficacy of the device.

# Conclusion

The modified Access Folate on the Access Immunoassay Systems is substantially equivalent to the Access Folate assay for the quantitative determination folic acid levels in human serum, plasma (heparin) and red blood cells.

Dear Ms. Anderson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market thc device referenced above and have dctermined the device is substantially cquivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally markcted predicate deviccs marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassificd in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subjcct to the gencral controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labcling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into cither class I1 (Special Controls) or class II (PMA). it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 ( FR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 (FR Part 820).
