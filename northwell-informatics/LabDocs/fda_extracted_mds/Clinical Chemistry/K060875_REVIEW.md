3. Product code: MMI

4. Panel: 75 - Chemistry

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for Use below

2. Indication(s) for use:

The Abbott $\mathsf { A x S Y M } ^ { \odot }$ Troponin-I ADV reagent is a Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) for the quantitative determination of cardiac Troponin-I (cTnI) in human serum or plasma on the AxSYM System. Troponin-I values are used to assist in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and in the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina and non-ST angina) with respect to relative risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, or increased probability of ischemic events.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For in vitro diagnostic use only

4. Special instrument requirements: Abbot AxSYM Analyzer

# I. Device Description:

The Abbott AxSYM® Troponin-I ADV assay is supplied as a 100 test reagent pack consisting of Reagent Bottles 1 – 4 as follows:

Reagent Bottle 1

Conjugate 2 Anti-biotin (mouse monoclonal): alkaline phosphatase (E.coli) conjugate in TRIS buffer with protein (mouse and bovine) stabilizers.

Reagent Bottle 2

Microparticles, Anti-troponin-I (mouse monoclonal) coated microparticles in TRIS buffer with protein (mouse, goat, and bovine) stabilizers.

Reagent Bottle 3

Conjugate 1, Anti-troponin-I (mouse monoclonal): biotin conjugate in TRIS buffer with protein (mouse and bovine) stabilizers

Pre-incubation diluent, diluent containing protein (mouse, goat, bovine, and E coli lysate) stabilizers in TRIS buffer.

Abbott $\mathsf { A x S Y M } ^ { \otimes }$ Troponin-I ADV Standard Calibrators are supplied as 6 x 4 mL bottles, Calibrator A contains gelatin (porcine) solution and Calibrator B through F contain a recombinant human cardiac troponin – I – C complex in a protein (bovine) solution.

Abbott AxSYM® Troponin-I ADV Controls are supplied as $3 \times 8 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ bottles containing a recombinant human cardiac troponin – I – C complex in a protein (bovine) solution.
