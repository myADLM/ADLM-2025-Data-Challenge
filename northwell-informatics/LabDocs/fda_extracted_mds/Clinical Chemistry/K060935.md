# 3.0 Device Name(s):

3.1 Proprietary Names SYNCHRON Systems Creatinine Reagent

3.2 Classification Names [862.1225 Creatinine test system]

# 4.0 Legally Marketed Device

The SYNCHRON Systems Creatinine Reagent claims substantial equivalence to the SYNCHRON Systems Creatinine Reagent currently in commercial distribution. FDA 510(k) Number K042291.

# 5.0 Device Description

The SYNCHRON Systems Creatinine (CREA) reagent is designed for optimal performance on SYNCHRON CX and UniCel DxC SYNCHRON instrument models. The reagent kit contains two 300-test cartridges that are packaged separately from the associated calibrator.

The candidate CRTX User Defined application is designed for optimal use on UniCel DxC Systems as a sample-blanked method to reduce bilirubin interference in serum and plasma samples.

CREA reagent, when used in conjunction with UniCel® DxC 600/800 System(s), SYNCHRON® Systems Multi Calibrator and the CRTX Application Sheet, is intended for the quantitative determination of Creatinine concentration in human serum or plasma as a User Defined Reagent (UDR) application.

Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes.

7.0 Comparison to the Predicate (Description of the Modification to the Legally Marketed Device)

The creatinine-triggered assay offers an alternative parameter set designed to work with the existing SYNCHRON Creatinine Reagent. The creatinine-triggered reagent application effectively reduces the interference seen with bilirubin when using the creatinine assay for serum and plasma samples. The creatinine-triggered assay uses a reaction trigger cycle employed for sample blanking. Use of the trigger cycle will reduce the sample throughput when compared to the system bar-coded creatinine assay.

# 8.0 Summary of Performance Data

Performance data from verification testing supports equivalency.

Dear Ms. Hellie:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The DA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
