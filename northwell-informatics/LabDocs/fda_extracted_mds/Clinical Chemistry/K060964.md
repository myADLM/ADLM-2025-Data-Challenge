# Name of Device

Trade/Proprietary Name: ARCHITECT® BNP Assay Common/Usual Name: BNP (B-Type Natruretic Peptide) Test Classification Name: Test, Natriuretic Peptide

# Predicate Device

ABBOTT AxSYM@® B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) Test

# Device Description

ARCHITECT BNP assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human EDTA plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, refereed to as Chemiflex®.

In the first step, sample and anti-BNP coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. BNP present in the sample bind to the anti-BNP coated microparticles. After washing, antiBNP acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of BNP in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT / System optics.

For additional information on system and assay technology, refer to the ARCHITECT System Operations Manual, Section 3.

# Intended Use

# Reagent Kit

The ARCHITECT BNP assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human EDTA plasma on the ARCHITECT i System. BNP values are used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity of heart failure.

# Calibrator Kit

The ARCHITECT BNP Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human EDTA plasma. Refer to the ARCHITECT BNP reagent package insert and ARCHITECT $j$ System for additional information.

# Control Kit

The ARCHITECT BNP Controls are for the estimation of test precision and the detection of systematic analytical deviations of the ARCHITECT i System (reagents, calibrators, and instrument), when used for the quantitative determination of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human EDTA plasma. Refer to the ARCHITECT BNP reagent package insert and ARCHITECT i System for additional information.

# Statement of Substantial Equivalence

The ARCHITECT BNP assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human EDTA plasma on the ARCHITECT i System. BNP values are used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity of heart failure.

The ARCHITECT BNP Assay kit is substantially equivalent to the AxSYM BNP Assay. Both of the devices are IVD products and are indicated for the quantitative determination of BNP assay values (human B-type natriuretic peptide) and used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity of heart failure.

A study was performed with guidance from NCCLS Protocol EP9-A21 to compare the ARCHITECT BNP assay to the AxSYM BNP assay. EDTA plasma samples form 171 individuals (128 heart failure patients, 43 non-heart failure individuals) were tested with both assays. These samples were collected from populations of individuals with and without heart failure. The results from the Passing-Bablok² linear regression analysis is summarized in the following table.\*
