# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline EP5-A2; CLSI guideline EP9-A2; CLSI EP7-A; European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Standard 13640 “Stability Testing of In-Vitro Diagnostic Reagents.”

# L. Test Principle:

ARCHITECT BNP Assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in human EDTA plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ . In the first step, sample and anti-BNP coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. BNP present in the sample binds to the anti-BNP coated microparticles. After washing, anti-BNP acridium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLU’s). A direct relationship exists between the amount of BNO in the sample and the RLU’s detected by the ARCHITECT I System optics.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The study was conducted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP5-A2. A three member panel was assayed in replicates of two at two separate times of the day for 20 days ( $\mathrm { \Delta } \ln = 8 0$ for each panel member). Testing was performed on two ARCHITECT Systems using a single calibration on each instrument. Within run $\mathrm { C V } ( \% )$ ranged from 0.9 to $5 . 6 \%$ . Total $\mathrm { C V } ( \% )$ ranged from 1.7 to $6 . 7 \%$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Aliquots of 5 EDTA plasma pools were augmented by the addition of BNP antigen to concentrations within the assay dynamic range. These plasma samples were diluted with normal plasma (BNP concentration $< 1 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ) containing protease inhibitors. The undiluted and diluted samples were tested in replicates of two using the ARCHITECT BNP assay. The range of average recoveries for the samples assayed using the routine protocol for the ARCHITECT BNP assay was $9 1 . 1 \%$ to $1 1 2 . 2 \%$ for dilutions to 1:30. The range of average recoveries for the samples assayed using the STAT protocol for the ARCHITECT BNP assay was $9 1 . 2 \%$ to $9 6 . 9 \%$ for dilutions to 1:30.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ARCHITECT BNP Calibrators are traceable to an internal reference standard that has been prepared gravimetrically with synthetic BNP. The internal reference standard underwent a one-time value assignment to align with the AxSYM BNP assay with a decision threshold of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

Stability studies were performed to evaluate the intended storage (open and closed vial) for the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrators and Controls. The data support a closed vial shelf life of 9 months for the calibrators and controls. A study was conducted to evaluate the open vial stability of the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator Kits and ARCHITECT BNP Control Kits when all bottled components are manually opened and closed. The study was performed to support the package insert claim instructing the end user to tightly close the caps on the bottles after each use and return to $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ storage. Three lots each of the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator Kits and ARCHITECT BNP Control Kits were evaluated during this study. At time zero, all of the bottles set aside for this study were opened and closed and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ continuously. One of the kit lots for each product (one lot of the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator Kit and one lot of the ARCHITECT BNP Control Kit) was stored inverted. Each of the three lots of ARCHITECT BNP Calibrators and Controls were tested monthly following the Time Zero test point. This study supports a shelf life of 9 months and verifies the package insert instructions for the ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator Kits and ARCHITECT BNP Control Kits

# d. Detection limit:

A study was conducted to determine the lowest measurable BNP concentration that can be distinguished from zero for the ARCHITECT BNP assay. The acceptance criterion for the analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) for the ARCHITECT BNP assay is $< 1 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The Minimal Detectable Dose (MDD) of the ARCHITECT BNP assay was determined by testing ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator A $( 0 \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ in replicates of 10 followed by two replicates of ARCHITECT BNP Calibrator B (75 $\mathrm { p g / m L } )$ , on each of three instruments (two instruments were run using the STAT assay protocol and one instrument was run using the Routine assay protocol), using two lots of reagents and two lots of calibrators $[ \mathtt { n } = 1 8$ runs). The mean values and the standard deviations of the 18 sets of A Calibrators and the mean values of the 18 sets of B Calibrators were used to determine the MDD for each run. Analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) is defined as the concentration at two standard deviations (SD) above the mean MDD, and represents the lowest measurable concentration of analyte that can be distinguished from zero. The Analytical Sensitivity (LOD) of the ARCHITECT BNP assay was calculated to be $3 . 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , which meets the acceptance criteria, and supports the package insert claim for sensitivity of $1 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The ARCHITECT BNP assay was evaluated for analytical specificity in a study where cross-reactivity with human ANP, Angiotensin I, II, and III, CNP, and NT-proBNP was measured by the assay. Each potential cross reactant was added to protease-inhibitor treated plasma and then assayed.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Cross-reactant Concentration %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-reactant ANP</td><td>(pg/mL) 1000</td><td>% Cross-reactivity</td></tr><tr><td>Angiotensin I</td><td>600</td><td>&lt;10 &lt;10</td></tr><tr><td>Angiotensin II</td><td>600</td><td>&lt;10</td></tr><tr><td>Angiotensin III</td><td>1000</td><td>&lt;10</td></tr><tr><td>CNP</td><td>1000</td><td>&lt;10</td></tr><tr><td>NT-proBNP (47-76)</td><td>1000</td><td>&lt;10</td></tr></table>
