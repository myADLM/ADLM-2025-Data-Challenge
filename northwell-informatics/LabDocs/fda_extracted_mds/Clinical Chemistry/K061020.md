# Device Description:

Dade Behring Dimension Vista™ Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridges are prepackaged in-vitro diagnostic test methods (assays) that are specifically designed to be used on the Dade Behring Dimension Vista™M Integrated system, a floor model, fully automated, microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system. The Dimension Vista™M system was previously cleared with seven associated test methods (K 051087).

This Special 510(k) is submitted for a packaging modification to in-vitro diagnostic devices that have been cleared under the 510(k) process for use on Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems. The packaging change is to allow use on the Dimension VistaTM system.

The ALB, AST, CRBM, ALT, and TIBC reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Flex® reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modification, does not affect the intended use of the devices, nor does it alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

# Intended Use:

Dimension VistaTM Albumin (ALB) Flex® reagent cartridge: The ALB method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of albumin in human serum and plasma on the Dimension VistaSystem.

Dimension VistaTM Aspartate amino transferase (AST) Flex® reagent cartridge: The AST method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of aspartate aminotransferase in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista™M System.

Dimension Vista™M Carbamazepine (CRBM) Flex® reagent cartridge: The CRBM method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of carbamazepine in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista™M System. Carbamazepine measurements may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbamazepine overdose and in therapeutic drug monitoring.

Dimension Vista™M Alanine amino transferase (ALT) Flex® reagent cartridge:

The ALT method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of alanine

Dimension Vista™M Total Iron-binding capacity (TIBC) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge: The TIBC method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of total n bindi cpaciy hman eru nd plasma he Dmensin isSys.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

Both the Dimension Vista™M Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges and the predicate Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EY reagent cartridges contain prepackaged reagents in flexible plastic, cartridges. A comparison of the important similarities and differences between the two Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ cartridges is provided in the following table:

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

The Dade Behring Dimension Vista™M Flex® reagent cartridges and the Dimension® Flex® reagent cartridges are designed similarly for the same purpose. Both contain prepackaged reagents for in-vitro diagnostic tests that are processed on microprocessorcontrolled, integrated instrument systems to analyze a variety of analytes in human specimens.

The ALB, AST, CRBM, ALT, and TIBC reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Flex® reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modifications, do not affect the intended use of the devices, nor do they alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

Comparative testing described in the protocol included in this submission demonstrates equivalent performance.

# Conclusion:

The Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges, containing reagents for testing ALB, AST, ALT, CRBM, and TIBC on the Dimension $\textcircled{8}$ Vista™M Integrated system are substantially equivalent in design, principle, and performance to the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges. They have the same intended use and indications for use. Comparative testing also demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.
