# I. Device Description:

The Bayer ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IMS cPSA Controls are bovine serum based with non-serum constituents added. The analyte in the control material is cPSA. The cPSA control kit consists of three different levels of control materials. Level 1 control is manufactured to a clinically significant decision point, between normal and patient groups. Level 3 control is manufactured to the upper analytical range of the assay. Level 2 control is manufactured to a level in between Level 1 and Level 3 controls.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Guidance for Industry “Points to consider guidance document on assayed and unassayed quality control material”.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable. c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The ADVIA IMS cPSA controls are traceable to Stanford University PSA reference material. This standard consists of $90 \%$ purified PSA- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf Q } _ { 1 }$ - antichymotrypsin (ACT) and $10 \%$ free PSA (90:10) mixture on a molar basis. Value assignment of production lots is done by a nested study that uses a Master Lot of product traceable to the Stanford PSA standard.

Unopened controls are stable when stored at ${ \mathrm { < = - 1 0 ^ { \circ } C } }$ in a non frost-free freezer, until the expiration date on the label. Opened controls are stable for 35 days, when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable. b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable. b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable. c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable

N. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
