# I. Device Description:

The Bayer ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IMS PSA Calibrator and ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IMS cPSA Calibrators are prepared in bovine serum with non-serum constituents added. There are six PSA levels each for the ADVIA $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ IMS PSA and cPSA Calibrators. The levels for PSA Calibrator are 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ . The cPSA Calibrator values are assigned to specific lots and are not assigned specific values.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Abbreviated 510(k) submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The ADVIA IMS PSA and cPSA calibrators are traceable to Stanford University prostate specific antigen reference material which consists of $90 \%$ purified PSA- ${ \bf q } _ { 1 }$ -antichymotrypsin (ACT) and $10 \%$ free PSA (90:10) mixture on a molar basis.

# Stability:

# PSA Calibrators:

Unopened calibrators are stable when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , until the expiration date on the label.

Opened calibrators are stable for 30 days, when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .

# cPSA Calibrators:

Unopened calibrators are stable when stored at ${ \mathrm { < = - 1 0 ^ { \circ } C } }$ in a non frost-free freezer, until the expiration date on the label. Opened calibrators are stable for 35 days, when stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ .
