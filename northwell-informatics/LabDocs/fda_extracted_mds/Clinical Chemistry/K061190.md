# Device Description

The Access Intact PTH reagents, calibrators, and the Access Immunoassay Analyzers (Access, Access 2, Synchron LXi 725, UniCel DxC600i, and UniCel Dxl 800) comprise the Access Immunoassay Systems for the determination of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in human serum and plasma.

# Intended Use

The Access Intact PTH assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of intact parathyroid hormone (parathyrin, PTH) levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. It is indicated to aid in the differential diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, or hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be used intraoperatively. Assay results should be used in conjunction with other clinical data to assist the clinician in making individual patient management decisions.

# Summary of Analytical Studies

Imprecision: Imprecision was tested for concentrations from approximately 12 to $1 4 0 0 ~ \mathsf { p g / m l }$ Total imprecision ranged from $2 . 8 \%$ to $6 . 4 \%$ CV for the routine mode and $3 . 1 \%$ to $1 0 . 6 \%$ CV for the intraoperative mode.

Dilution Recovery (Linearity): Multiple dilutions of EDTA plasma samples were analyzed in the routine mode and intraoperative modes. Mean $\%$ recovery ranged from $91 \%$ to $103 \%$ for the routine mode and $8 5 \%$ to $9 8 \%$ for the intraoperative mode.

# Methods Comparison:

A comparison of 500 values using the Access Intact PTH assay routine mode and a commercially available immunoassay system gave the following statistical data using Deming calculations: Range of observations=16-2627 pg/mL, Intercept=-11.5 pg/mL, Slope $_ { 1 } = 1 . 0 9$ ,Correlation coefficient $\langle r \rangle { = } 0 . 9 9$ .

A comparison of 493 values using the Access Intact PTH assay routine mode and the intraoperative mode on the Access Immunoassay system gave the following statistical data using Deming calculations: Range of observations=13-2848 pg/mL, Intercept: $= 9 . 6 9 p g / m L$ , Slope ${ \tt 1 0 . 9 4 }$ , Correlation coefficient ${ \mathit { \Omega } } ( { \mathsf { r } } ) { = } { \hat { 1 } } { . } 0 0$ .

A comparison of 393 values using the Access Intact PTH intraoperative mode and a commercially available immunoassay system gave the following statistical data using Deming calculations: Range of observations=8-2453 pg/mL, Intercept=0.13 pg/mL, Slope $\mathtt { - 0 . 8 7 }$ , Correlation coefficient $( r ) = 1 . 0 0$ .

Analytical Specificity: There was no significant interference from potential sample contaminants (bilirubin, hemoglobin, human serum albumin, and triglycerides) in either the routine or intraoperative modes.

Stability: Intact PTH reagents are stable for 28 days after opening. Intact PTH calibrators are singe use only.The calibration is stable for 28 days.

# Summary of Clinical Studies

To establish a reference range, PTH concentrations were measured in 289 matched human EDTA plasma and serum samples from apparently healthy male and female subjects aged 19-67 years. Because of significant seasonal variations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the samples were collected during three time periods in two geographic latitudes. Additional testing was performed to exclude individuals with abnormal serum calcium, creatinine or 25-hydroxyvitamin D. A $9 5 \%$ E non-parametric reference interval of 12-88 pg/mL was determined. Routine and intraoperative mode reference intervals are equivalent.

# Conclusion

Intact PTH and Intact PTH Calibrators on the Access Immunoassay Systems is substantially equivalent to the Roche Elecsys Parathyroid Hormone Test System and the Immulite/Immulite 1000 Turbo Intact PTH assay for the quantitative determination of intact PTH levels in human serum and plasma.
