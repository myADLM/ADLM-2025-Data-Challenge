This summary of 510(k) safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

The assigned 510(k) number is: k 0 6 1193

# Test Description:

Creatinine is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative analysis of creatinine in human serum, plasma, or urine. At an alkaline $\mathsf { p H } ,$ creatinine in the sample reacts with picrate to form a creatinine-picrate complex. The rate of increase in absorbance at ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { n m }$ due to the formation of this complex is directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine in the sample.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Creatinine assay is substantially equivalent to the Roche Creatinine assay (K941837) on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer. Both assays yield similar Performance Characteristics.

# Similarities:

Both assays can be used for the quantitation of creatinine.   
Both assays yield similar results.   
Both assays are based on the modified Jfe (creatinine alkaline picrate methodology. Both assays use serum, plasma, and urine

# Differences:

# None

# Intended Use:

The Cret   e  i rp urine.

# Performance Characteristics:

Comparative performance studies were conducted using the AEROSET System.

The Creatinine assay method comparison yielded acceptable correlation with the Creatinine assay on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer. The AEROSET System showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9996, slope of 0.98, and Y-intercept of - 0.19 mg/dL for the serum application and a correlation coefficient of 0.9992, slope of 0.94, and Y-intercept of  3.66 mg/dL for the urine application when compared to the Hitachi 917 Analyzer. The ARCHITECT c8000 System showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9993, slope of 0.96, and Y-intercept of  0.24 mg/dL for the serum application and a correlation coefficient of 0.9990, slope of 0.93, and Y-intercept of  4.16 mg/ for the urie application when compared to the Hitaci 917 Analyzer. The ARCHITECT c8000 System showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9996, slope of 0.98, and Y-intercept of  0.06 mg/dL for the serum application and a correlation coefficient of 0.9997, slope of 0.99, and Y-intercept of - 0.51 mg/dL for the urine application when compared to the AEROSET System. The Creatinine assay method comparison yielded acceptable correlation between the AEROSET System and the ARCHITECT c8000 System.

Precision studies were conducted using the Creatinine assay. On the AEROSET System, the total $\% \mathbf { C V }$ for Level 1 is $4 . 9 5 \% .$ and Level 2 is $3 . 1 8 \%$ for the serum application and the total $\% \times \mathrm { v }$ for Level 1 is $2 . 4 1 \%$ , and Level 2 is $2 . 4 1 \%$ for the urine application. On the ARCHITECT $\pmb { c 8 0 0 0 }$ System, the total $\% \times \mathrm { c v }$ for Level 1 is $3 . 1 0 \% ,$ and Level 2 is $1 . 5 4 \%$ for the serum application and the total $\% C V$ for Level 1 is $0 . 9 4 \%$ and Level 2 is $0 . 9 9 \%$ for the urine application.

The Creatinie assayis inear from0.20 to $3 7 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum application.

The Creatinine assay is inear from 5.0 to $7 4 0 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the urine application. The limit of qantitation (sensitivity) of the Creatinie assay is 0.10 mg/L for the serum application, and ${ 2 . 0 \ m g / \mathrm { d L } }$ for the urine application.

The dat demonstrate that the perormancef the Creatinie assay is substantially equivalent to the performance of the Creatinine assay on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer.

# Conclusion:

The Creatinine assay on the AEROSET and the ARCHITECT c8000 Systems is substantially euivalent theRocheCreatinassay  the Hitachi91Analyzer demostrae by results obtained in the studies.

Dear Ms. Morris:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28. 1976. the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PM.A). You may. therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA). it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition. FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the . Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809): and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
