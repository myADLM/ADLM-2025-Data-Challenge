# I. Device Description:

The CHEM 4 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of Albumin (ALB) and Total Protein (TP) methods on the Dimension Vista™ System. The kit consists of three vials of one level which are ready for use (no preparation is required). The volume per vial is $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ . System water is used as the TP and LAB zero calibrator (Level 1) for the Dimension Vista™ System. The vials contain sodium azide (less than $0 . 1 \%$ ) as a preservative.

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Value assignment: The new calibrator is made by adding calculated quantities of albumin to the base matrix (human serum) which already contains total protein. The concentration is verified using an instrument calibrated with the primary and secondary standards. The final bottle assignment is assigned for the level of the commercial lot by testing $\Nu { = } 9 0$ replicates with multiple reagent lots on multiple instruments.

The assigned values of the ALB/TP calibrator are standardized to the following reference materials:
