# I. Device Description:

The GlucoPlus Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a hand-held blood glucose meter, test strips, and control materials. The user enters a code for each lot of test strips manually; the meter software contains specific calibration information for each code. The meter is turned on by strip insertion; the user then supplies finger-tip blood or control solution to the strip and the meter starts the assay, which completes in 15 seconds. The meter’s software converts the results read off the test strip into a plasma glucose concentration and displays the value on the meter’s LCD screen.

# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on the release of electrical potential after a two-step reaction where glucose and ferricyanide, in the presence of glucose oxidase, are converted into gluconolactone and ferrocyanide. Ferrocyanide, when electrical current is applied, becomes ferricyanide and releases electrons; the increase in current measured by the meter is proportional to the glucose concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision testing in the manufacturer’s facility was based on CLSI EP5-T2.

Within-run precision was established using whole blood samples from nondiabetic volunteers spiked or glycolyzed to yield 6 glucose concentrations ranging from $4 0 - 5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Results were compared to YSI values. One strip lot was tested. Within-run precision was tested on twenty replicates of each glucose level. Between-day precision was tested by testing two levels of control materials (approximately 100 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) tested four times a day over 20 days. Testing results are summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Heparinized venous whole blood was spiked or glycolyzed to six concentrations between $4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 9 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (confirmed by YSI) then tested with the GlucoPlus and YSI. Six samples were tested for each method for each of three lots. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the GlucoPlus and the YSI method: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 7 2 \mathrm { x } + 2 . 2 7$ , $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 9$ (all lots combined).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Control materials are traceable to YSI standards which are traceable to NIST SRM #917A (Clinical Dextrose). Real-time shelf life studies performed by the manufacturer indicate that control solutions and the unopened test strips have at least a 17 month life-span. Once the control solution or strip container is opened, they have been shown to be stable for 3 months.

d. Detection limit:

See linearity study above; the meter will report ‘LO’ for values less than 40 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Assay interferents were tested in a dose-response manner following CLSI EP7-A guidelines. Aliquots of the blood were supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and measured on a YSI analyzer. The interferent was prepared with an appropriate solvent, and spiked into the 100 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ blood. A control pool was prepared by supplementing the blood with solvent minus the interferent. A series of four to five levels that included the maximum concentration of the substance that would be expected to be encountered in clinical practice were used for each interferent. The sponsor defined interference as the level of compound that caused $\geq \pm 1 0 \%$ difference between the interferent-spiked sample and a sample that did not contain interferent.

The table below shows the effect of common interferents at the upper end of normal or therapeutic levels on GlucoPlus test levels:

These results suggest that L-dopa, tetracycline, and uric acid at physiologically relevant levels may cause blood samples to produce an artificially high value. Care should be exercised by people with gout, undergoing dialysis, taking chemotherapy or radiation treatments, with Parkinson’s disease, and those taking tetracycline or related antibiotics.

# Hematocrit Effect:

The effect of sample hemoglobin variation on the GlucoPlus system was tested experimentally by preparing samples of known hematocrit (Hct) and spiking aliquots of these samples with three different levels of glucose. These samples were run on the GlucoPlus and YSI; there was less than a $1 \pm 1 4 \%$ bias across the claimed range of $3 0 \sim 5 5 \%$ Hct.

The meter was tested at different altitudes to assess the effect of low oxygen levels on meter performance. No effect on performance was found when the two control solutions were tested up to 8800 ft. above sea level. Higher elevations were not tested. The sponsor presented data that supported using the test system between $1 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $20 - 8 0 \%$ relative humidity.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: GlucoPlus Consumer Studies: The consumer study was performed at one site with 120 lay-users and a technician. The lay-users ranged in age, education, and were about equally divided between males and females. The native language of most of the participants was English. Labeling materials were in English. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood using the instructions in the User’s Guide. A trained technician then performed another fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter. Capillary blood was collected and measured on a YSI analyzer. Samples ranged from $5 7 - 4 8 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Linear regression analysis of the data yielded the results below:

Lay users vs. YSI $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 6 \mathrm { x } - 7 . 9$ ${ \mathrm { r } } = 0 . 9 8 5$ Technician vs. YSI $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 5 \mathrm { x } - 6 . 6$ $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 8 9$

GlucoPlus POC Studies:

The point-of-care (POC) study was performed at three sites on a total of 100 diabetic participants by one technician at each site. Each participant was tested twice – once each with two GlucoPlus meters - and once with the predicate meter. Linear regression analysis of the data yielded the results below:

In this study, 28 of 28 samples that were $< 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 170 of 172 samples that were $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were within $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the reference value.

# b. Matrix comparison:

This System is cleared for use with fingerstick capillary samples. The meter’s software adjusts the whole-blood glucose reading to a plasma-equivalent reading.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: See Method Comparison Studies section above.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is $7 0 - 1 0 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . One to two hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than 140 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . A medical professional should determine the range that is appropriate for diabetes patients.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
