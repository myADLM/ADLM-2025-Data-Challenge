# Device Description:

Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are prepackaged in-vitro diagnostic test methods (assays) that are specifically designed to be used on the Dade Behring Dimension Vista™M Integrated system, a floor model, fully automated, microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system. The Dimension Vista™M system was previously cleared with seven associated test methods (K 051087). This Special 510(k) is submitted for a packaging modification to in-vitro diagnostic devices that have been cleared under the 510(k) process for use on Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems. The packaging change is to allow use on the Dimension VistaTM system.

The CO2, CREA, and LDH reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Flex® reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modification, does not affect the intended use of the devices, nor does it alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

# Intended Use:

Dimension Vista™M Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge: The CO2 method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurerment of carbon dioxide in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista System.

Dimension Vista™M Creatinine (CREA) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge: The CREA method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of creatinine in human serum, plasma, and urine on the Dimension Vista™M System.

Dimension Vista™M Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Flex® reagent cartridge: The LDH method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of lactate dehydrogenase ihuman serum and plasma on the Dimension VistSystem.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

Both the Dimension Vista™M Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges and the predicate Dimension® Flex® reagent cartridges contain prepackaged reagents in flexible plastic, cartridges. A comparison of the important similarities and differences between the two Flex $\otimes$ cartridges is provided in the following table:

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

The Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridges and the Dimension® Flex $\otimes$ reagent cartridges are designed similarly for the same purpose. Both contain prepackaged reagents for in-vitro diagnostic tests that are processed on microprocessorcontrolled, integrated instrument systems to analyze a variety of analytes in human specimens.

The CO2, CREA, and LDH reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the $\mathbf { F l e x @ }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $\otimes$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modifications, do not affect the intended use of the devices, nor do they alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

Comparative testing described in the protocol included in this submission demonstrates equivalent performance.

# Conclusion:

The Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges, containing reagents for testing CO2, CREA, and LDH on the Dimension $\otimes$ Vista™M Integrated system are substantially equivalent in design, principle, and performance to the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ system Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges. They have the same intended use and indications for use. Comparative testing also demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.

Dear Ms. Piestrak:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

I your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 1, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
