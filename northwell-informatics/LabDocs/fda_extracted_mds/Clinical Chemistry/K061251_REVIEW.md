# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Iron Standard – SRM937

# L. Test Principle:

Refer to the calibration procedure is in the Calibration section of the Operator’s Guide for the Dimension Vista™ System.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Primary Standards are traceable to NIST reference material (SRM937).

TIBC calibrator is prepared in a bovine albumin base matrix. A calculated quantity of human transferrin is added to the base material using standard gravimetric procedures. The concentration is verified to be within acceptable ranges using an instrument calibrated with Primary Standards. The values are assigned to each lot using multiple reagent lots on multiple instruments.

Each donor unit used in the preparation of this product was tested by FDAapproved methods for the presence of antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency

Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and Type 2 (HIV-2), as well as for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and found to be negative (not repeatedly reactive).

Several studies are conducted to support product stability:

For shelf life testing, product is stored at $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ throughout the testing cycle and tested on days 0, 3, 7, 35, 98, 189, 280, 325, 371, 462, 553, 664, and 735. Identical lot of calibrator product stored at $- 2 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and tested at the same frequency.

For freeze – thaw testing, the product is frozen and thawed three times over three days and then stored at $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Testing occurs over a 13 month period.

For stress testing, the product is first stored at $3 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 36 hours, $3 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 12 hours, and then $4 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 4 hours. Next, the product is stored at $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 48 hours, then $3 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 6 hours. Lastly, the product is stored at $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for 54 hours. After storage at these three conditions, the calibrators are stored at $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and tested over a 24.5 month period.

For open vial stability testing, vials are opened/punctured on day zero. A portion for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at $2 { - } 8 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ . Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 32 vs. freshly opened vials.

The $4 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ material values are recovered vs. the calibrations. Recovery vs. time is monitored and percent change over time is determined.
