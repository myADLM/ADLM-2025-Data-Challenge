# K. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability:

Calibrator shelf life for the Dimension Vista™M Enzyme 2 Calibrator is determined to be 12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 \%$ with control stored at $- 7 0 \%$ The method is calibrated from this stored material. The $4 \%$ material values are recovered versus the

calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is determined where the allowable shelf life percent change should be $\leq 5 \%$ Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc.

A vial that is punctured (opened) by the instrument and stored on board has a seven day stability claim.

An vial that is uncapped, recapped and stored in a refrigerator, not on instrument, has a stability claim of 31 days.

Both opened and punctured vials are tested on day zero. A quantity sufficient for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at $2 - 8 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 32 versus freshly opened vials.

# 2. Traceability:

The assigned values of the Enzyme 2 Calibrator are standardized to a master pool that is assigned by the Dimension $\mathfrak { B }$ clinical chemistry system.

# 3. Value Assignment:

To manufacture a calibrator lot, calculated quantities of a verified stock solution are added to a bovine serum albumin base at target concentrations. The concentration of each level is verified on an instrument calibrated with an approved Master Pool. The Master Pool values are assigned for each level on multiple Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EY instruments.

Re: k061390 Trade/Device Name: Dimension Vista™M Enzyme 2 Calibrator (AST/ALT Calibrator-KC320) Regulation Number: 21 CFR $\ S$ 862.1150 Regulation Name: Calibrator Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: JIX Dated: May 17, 2006 Received: May 18, 2006

Dear Mr. Carrio:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either classII (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Interet address
