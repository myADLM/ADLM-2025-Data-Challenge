L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The assigned values of the Enzyme 2 Calibrator are verified on a Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ instrument calibrated with an approved Master Pool. Master Pool values is assigned on multiple Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry instruments.

Stability: Calibrator shelf life for the Dimension Vista™ Enzyme 2 Calibrator was determined to be 12 months. A vial that has been punctured (opened) by the instrument and stored on board has a seven day stability claim. Stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable

# N. Proposed Labeling:
