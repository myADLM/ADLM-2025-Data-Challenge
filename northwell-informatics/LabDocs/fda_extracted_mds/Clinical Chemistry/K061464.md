3. Device name

Trade or Proprietary Name: VITROS Chemistry Products TIBC Kit VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 4

Common Name: TIBC test Classification Name: Iron binding capacity test system (21 CFR 862.1415).

Common Name: Calibrator Kit 4 Classification Name: Calibrator (21 CFR 862.1150)

Predicate device

The VITROS TIBC assay (modified device) is substantially equivalent to the VITROS TIBC assay (original). This assay was originally cleared under the KODAK EKTACHEM product branding (K931493).

# 5. Device description

The VITROS TIBC assay is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products TIBC Kit, VITROS Chemistry Products Fe Slides, and the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 4 on VITROS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS TIBC Kit consists of VITROS TIBC Columns (containing alumina) and VITROS Iron Saturating Reagent.

Total iron-binding capacity is determined by pretreating a sample using the method of Starr.' Excess iron citrate reagent is added to the sample to saturate all available apotransferrin sites. After an incubation period of five minutes, the treated sample is applied to an alumina column where iron that is not bound to transferrin is adsorbed.

The transferrin-bound iron contained in the eluate represents the total iron-binding capacity of the sample.

A drop of eluate is deposited on the VITROS Fe Slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading layer to the underlying layers. After the addition of the eluate, the slide is incubated at 37°C. Two reflection density measurements at 600 nm are made at approximately one and five minutes. The difference in reflection density is proportional to the iron concentration in the sample.

Once a calibration has been performed for each slide lot, total iron binding capacity in unknown samples can be determined using the softwareresident two-point rate math model and the change in reflectance calculated for each unknown test slide.

VITROS Calibrator Kit 4 contains four levels of lyophilized standards with corresponding diluents. The standards are prepared from processed bovine serum and bovine serum albumin to which organic analytes, inorganic salts, electrolytes, stabilizers, and preservatives have been added. The diluents are prepared from processed water. Once reconstituted, the standards are used to calibrate VITROS Chemistry Systems for the quantitative measurement of total iron binding capacity in serum. Calibration of the VITROS TIBC assay requires the use of three of the four levels (bottles 1, 3 and 4).

6. Device intended use

# 8.Conclusions

The information presented in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the performance of the VITROS TIBC assay (modified device) for use with human serum is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate device.

Equivalence was demonstrated using manufactured reagents along with quality control fluids, proficiency samples and human serum samples with measured TIBC values spanning the assay range.

The information presented in the premarket notification provides a reasonable assurance that the VITROS TIBC assay (modified device) for use with human serum is safe and effective for the stated intended use.

Dear Ms. Phillips:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.
