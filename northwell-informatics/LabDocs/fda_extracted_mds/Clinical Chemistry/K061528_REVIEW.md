2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k020208   
3. Comparison with predicate: Comparison with a predicate was outlined in k041107.

# L. Test Principle:

Once a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber of the test strip, glucose measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, producing gluconolactone. The current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision and reproducibility were demonstrated in k041107. b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Linearity and the reportable range were demonstrated in k041107.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Two levels of control material (normal and high) are provided for use with the test system. The target values are $1 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and are prepared gravimetrically in an aqueous matrix. The open, closed, and transport stability testing protocols were described in k041107.

d. Detection limit:

The detection limit of $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was demonstrated in k041107.

e. Analytical specificity:

In k041107, the sponsor established that hematocrit $( 2 0 - 6 0 \% )$ , temperature, humidity, drop (impact) effects and vibration, and high altitude (3275 meters) did not affect the meter’s performance. No interference (defined as $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of control) was observed up to the following concentrations in k041107:

Acetaminophen – up to $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Ascorbic acid – up to $1 . 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Dopamine – up to $2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ L-Dopa – up to $3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Methyl Dopa – up to ${ > } 0 . 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Tolbutamide – up to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Uric acid – up to $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Triglyceride – up to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

The insert states that no interferences are seen at normal physiological levels of these potential interferents as the levels at which interference is observed are above the normal physiological concentrations of these substances.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Demonstration that the SelfCheck Gluco is substantially equivalent to a standard clinical chemistry method (YSI-2300) can be found in k041107.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable.   
b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable.   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The sponsor included the following Expected Values for normal glucose levels in their strip labeling:

<table><tr><td>Status</td><td>Range (mg/dL)</td><td>Range (mmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td>Before meals</td><td>70-110</td><td>3.9-6.1</td></tr><tr><td>2 hours after meals</td><td>&lt;120</td><td>&lt;6.7</td></tr></table>

N. Instrument Name: SelfCheck Gluco

# O. System Descriptions:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.

FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types in k041107. See k041107 for more information.

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

A code strip is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that batch.   
No further calibrations are required of the user.

. Quality Control: Two levels of quality control material are provided with the system.

# P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
