# Device Identification:

Trade Name: AmnioStat-FLM-PG   
Common Name: AmnioStat   
Classification Name: Lecithin/Sphingomyelin Ratio in Amniotic Fluid (21 CFR, 862.1455)

# Predicate Device:

AmnioStat-FLM (K822150), Lecithin/Sphingomyelin ratio in amniotic fluid test system (21 CFR 862.1455)

# Description:

The AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit is an immunological semi-quantitative agglutination test for determining the presence of phosphatidylglycerol in human amniotic fluid at concentrations indicative of fetal lung maturity. The AmnioStatFLM-PG Kit is comprised of five (5) components and a disposable agglutination cards (cardboard with laminate). The five (5) components that comprise the kit include three (3) kit controls, Negative Control, Catalog #91013, Low Positive Control, Catalog #91027, High Positive Control, Catalog #91028, two (2) reagents, Reagent A, Catalog #91012 and Reagent B, Catalog #91029, and one (1) Buffer, Catalog #91011.

The three (2) controls (negative, low positive, and high positive) in the AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit are run with each test. The AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit can be used to run six (6) patient test samples. Each patient sample is run on an individual agglutination card with a set of controls. Please refer to the photographs of the AmnioStat-LM-PG Kit presented in Appendix D of the submission.

The AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit is a next generation kit based upon the same immunological agglutination test as AmnioStat-FLM (K822150) previously cleared for marketing. The immunological agglutination reaction is the same between the AmnioStat-FLM (K822150) and the AmnioStat-FLM-PG kit. The AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit incorporates the use of Sudan Black B into one of the kit reagents which makes the differentiation of the three (3) kit controls more distinguishable. The AmnioStat-FLM (K822150) is performed on a glass slide that requires the use of a mirror to distinguish and differentiate the kit controls based upon clarity of the background and the size of the agglutinated particles. The AmnioStat-FLM-PG is performed on a disposable agglutination card that is white and does not require the use of a mirror to distinguish and differentiate the kit controls.

# Intended Use:

AmnioStat-FLM-PG is intended for use as an immunologic semiquantitative agglutination test for determining the presence of phosphatidylglycerol in human amniotic fluid at concentrations indicative of fetal lung maturity.

The AmnioStat-FLM-PG test kit is to be used by laboratory personnel in a hospital and/or clinical laboratory.

# Performance Data:

The AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit has been evaluated by five (5) independent field laboratories that currently use the AmnioStat-FLM test kit. The response and feedback from the laboratories that evaluated the kit indicates it was well received in terms of its application, ease of use, and effectiveness in the determining fetal lung maturity in human amniotic fluid.

In addition, clinical comparison data was also generated for seventy-three (73) patient samples that were tested between the two (2) clinical laboratories. The results of the comparison study yielded no false positive test results and demonstrated that the AmnioStat-FLM-PG kit performs in accordance with the intended use of the product.

# Additional Information:

Functionality of the three (3) kit controls (negative, low positive, and high positive) in the AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit with regards to differentiation in appearance is performed as a condition of release. Please refer to the proposed labeling presented in Section 14 of this submission.

# Conclusion:

The results from the field testing of this product demonstrates that the AmnioStat-FLM-PG Kit is suitable for its intended use, meets the criteria as outlined in 21 CFR Section 862.1455, Lecithin/Sphingomyelin ratio in amniotic fluid test system.

Dear Mr. Lee:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
