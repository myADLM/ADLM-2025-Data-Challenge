# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

L. Test Principle: AmnioStat-FLM-PG is an immunological agglutination test.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The AmnioStat-FLM-PG test kit produces reproducible results for the three (3) kit controls. As prescribed in the Assay Protocol for the Preparation of Lipid Particles, ten (10) separate “negative”, “low positive”, and “high positive” PG Controls were prepared and separately reacted with Reagent B. In each of the ten (10) tests performed, the “negative” controls gave no agglutination, the “low positive” controls gave agglutination patterns that were less than the “high positive” control, and the “high positive” controls gave agglutination reactions at least three (3) times higher than the “low positive” controls (as judged by visual inspection and scoring).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): See k822150.

d. Detection limit: See Assay cut-off below.

e. Analytical specificity: See k822150.

f. Assay cut-off:

AmnioStat-FLM-PG produces a "high positive" result with specimens containing PG at a concentration of approximately $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ or greater. A "low positive" result is obtained with specimens containing PG at approximately $0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . A "negative" result is obtained when PG is absent, or present at concentrations below $0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The AmnioStat-FLM-PG test kit was compared to the AmnioStat-FLM test kit. The test results are shown in the Table 1 below:

TABLE 1   

<table><tr><td colspan="4">AmnioStat-FLM</td><td colspan="3">AmnioStat-FLM-PG</td></tr><tr><td>LBC # Samples ( )</td><td>Neg</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Neg</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Immature</td><td>TND*</td><td>Pos TND</td><td>Pos TND</td><td>12</td><td>Pos</td><td>Pos</td></tr><tr><td>(12)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Borderline (9)</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mature (12)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr></table>

$\ast _ { \mathrm { T N D } } =$ test not done. In addition to the test kit comparison, the test facility also performed a Lamellar Body Count (LBC). If the LBC is less than 30,000 the AmnioStat-FLM test is not performed.

The AmnioStat-FLM-PG test kit was also compared to another commercially available test kit. The test results are shown in Table 2 below:

TABLE 2   

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">LBC # Samples</td><td rowspan="2">Abbott TDX-</td><td colspan="3">AmnioStat-FLM-PG</td></tr><tr><td>Neg</td><td>Low Pos</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>( )</td><td>FLM*</td><td></td><td></td><td>Pos</td></tr><tr><td>Immature (3) Borderline (1)</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mature (4)</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr></table>

\*The cut off values for scoring fetal lung maturity indices are: immature $= < 3 6$ $\mathrm { m g / g }$ , borderline $= 3 6 { - } 5 4 \mathrm { m g / g }$ , and mature $= > 5 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / g }$ . Out of the eight (8) amniotic fluid samples tested by the commercially available method, five (5) amniotic fluid samples had results equating to “immature” and three (3) amniotic fluid samples had results equating to “mature.”

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

Summaries of the three published clinical studies were provided to support use of both transabdominal amniocentesis samples and vaginal pool samples.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

Clinical testing was performed using the AmnioStat-FLM-PG test kit and the Lamellar Body Count (LBC) at two (2) independent laboratories and involved a total of seventy-three (73) patient transabdominal amniocentesis samples. The test results obtained from the comparison study yielded no false positive test results and demonstrated that the AmnioStat-FLM-PG test kit performs in accordance with the intended use of the product.

In clinical studies in which AmnioStat-FLM-PG was compared to the analysis of PG using TLC, the two tests were found to be concordant $i n \ge 8 7 \%$ of the cases.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: The reference range is based on literature.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
