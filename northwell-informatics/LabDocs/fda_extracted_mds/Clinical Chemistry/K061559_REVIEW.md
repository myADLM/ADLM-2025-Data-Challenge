# L. Test Principle:

Glucose: This test is based on the enzymatic reaction that occurs between glucose oxidase, peroxidase and chromogen. Glucose if first oxidized to produce gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of glucose oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with potassium iodide chromogen in the presence of peroxidase. The extent to which the chromogen is oxidized determines the color which is produced, ranging from green to brown. Low amounts of glucose are normally excreted in urine. Glucose concentrations as low as $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , read at either 10 or 30 seconds, may be considered abnormal if results are consistent. At 10 seconds, results should be interpreted qualitatively. For semi-quantitative results, read at 30 seconds only.

Bilirubin: This test is based on azo-coupling reaction of bilirubin with diazotized dichloroaniline in a strongly acidic medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce a pinkish-tan color proportional to its concentration in urine. In normal urine, no bilirubin is detectable by even the most sensitive methods. Even trace amounts of bilirubin require further investigation. Atypical results (colors different from the negative or positive color blocks shown on the color chart) may indicate that bilirubin-derived bile pigments are present in the urine specimen, and are possibly masking the bilirubin reaction.

Ketone: This test is based on ketones reacting with nitroprusside and acetoacetic acid to produce a color change ranging from light pink for negative results to a darker pink or purple color for positive results. Ketones are normally not present in urine. Detectable ketone levels may occur in urine during physiological stress conditions such as fasting, pregnancy and frequent strenuous exercise. In starvation diets, or in other abnormal carbohydrate metabolism situations, ketones appear in the urine in excessively high concentration before serum ketones are elevated.

Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated polyelectrolytes in relation to ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, colors range from deep blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green in urine of increasing ionic concentration. Randomly collected urine may vary in specific gravity from 1.003-1.035. Twenty-four hour urine from healthy adults with normal diets and fluid intake will have a specific gravity of 1.016-1.022. In cases of severe renal damage, the specific gravity is fixed at 1.010, the value of the glomerular filtrate.

Blood: This test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin which catalyzes the reaction of cumene-hydroperoxide and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color ranges from orange to green to dark blue. Any green spots or green color development on the reagent area within 60 seconds is significant and the urine specimen should be examined further. Blood is often, but not invariably, found in the urine of menstruating females.

pH: This test is based on a double indicator system which gives a broad range of colors covering the entire urinary pH range. Colors range from orange to yellow and green to blue. The expected range for normal urine specimens from newborns is pH 5-7. The expected range for other normal urine specimens is $\mathrm { p H } 4 . 5 – 8$ , with an average result of $\mathrm { p H } 6$ .

Protein: This reaction is based on the phenomenon known as the "protein error” of pH indicators where an indicator that is highly buffered will change color in the presence of proteins (anions) as the indicator releases hydrogen ions to the protein. At a constant $\mathrm { p H }$ , the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow to yellow-green for negative results and green to green-blue for positive results. $\mathrm { 1 - 1 4 \ m g / d L }$ of protein may be excreted by a normal kidney. A color matching any block greater than trace indicates significant proteinuria.

Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction between pdiethylaminobenzaldehyde and urobilinogen acid in strongly acidic medium to produce a pink color. Urobilinogen is one of the major compounds produced in heme this test is $\mathrm { 0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0 \ m g / d L }$ $( 3 . 5 { - } 1 7 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L } )$ . A result of $2 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 3 5 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ may be of clinical significance, and the patient specimen should be further evaluated.

Nitrite: This test depends upon the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram negative bacteria in the urine. In an acidic medium, nitrite in the urine reacts with p-arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1 N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine to produce a pink color. Nitrite is not detectable in normal urine. The nitrite area will be positive in some cases of infection, depending on how long the urine specimens were retained in the bladder prior to collection. Retrieval of positive cases with the nitrite test ranges from as low as $40 \%$ in cases where little bladder incubation occurred, to as high as approximately $80 \%$ in cases where bladder incubation took place for at least 4 hours.

Leukocytes: This test reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. The esterases cleave a derivatized pyrazole amino acid ester to liberate derivatized hydroxy

pyrazole. This pyrazole then reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color. Normal urine specimens generally yield negative results. Trace results may be of questionable clinical significance. When trace results occur, it is recommended to retest using a fresh specimen from the same patient. Repeated trace and positive results are of clinical significance.

Ascorbic acid: This test involves decolorization of Tillmann’s reagent. The presence of ascorbic acid causes the color of the test field to change from blue-green to orange.

Three lots of the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips were used. Tests in duplicates were performed with 10 repeats by 5 operators per day for 10 days. A total of 3,000 strips were used for testing $( 3 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 5 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 0 = 3 , 0 0 0$ strips). Results were read by comparing color reaction to the color blocks on the canister label according to the instructions on the package insert. The results indicate that the values obtained were all within the expected values for the control materials.

As the urinalysis controls did not have an ascorbic acid level, the sponsor used two ascorbic acid standard positive solutions, $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Testing was performed according to the package insert and the results were determined by visually comparing the reaction colors with the color chart. The ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips from 3 lots were used and tests were performed in replicates of 10 for 2 runs by 10 operators per day for 10 days. The results indicate that the values obtained were all within the expected values for the control materials.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor did not indicate any degree of traceability for their devices. Control materials are not specifically identified in the labeling, but the sponsor indicates in the labeling that for best results, performance of reagent strips should be confirmed by testing known positive and negative specimens/controls whenever a new test is performed, or whenever a new canister is first opened.

The recommended storage temperature range for the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips is between $2 - 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Opened canister stability claim of the strips is that the strips are stable for at least 3 months. Unopened canister stability claim of the strips is that the strips are stable for 24 months from the date of manufacture.

# d. Detection limit:

The sensitivity of the assay was validated by spiking positive urine samples of known concentrations for each analyte. These positive samples of each analyte were then diluted to the lowest “positive” concentrations indicated on the ACON color chart. For each analyte, aliquots of the lowest positive samples were further diluted to 4:1 or $80 \%$ , 3:2 or $60 \%$ , 1:1 or $50 \%$ and 1:3 or $2 5 \%$ of the originals with negative urine. Urine samples including negative and all spiked and diluted samples were then tested with three lots of the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips. For three consecutive days, each sample was tested 21 times by three operators (7 strips per operator per day). A total of 189 strips were used for each concentration tested (3 operators x 3 days x 7 strips $\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 3 ~ \mathrm { l o t s } = 1 8 9$ strips). The minimum sensitivity level for each analyte of the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips is defined by the sponsor as the lowest level at which over $67 \%$ (2/3) of the test results are positive when the diluted positive samples for an analyte of known concentrations were tested. The results of each analyte sensitivity pad are summarized below. Gray blocks identify the low range (sensitivity) of each analyte.

The sponsor also performed interference studies that were analytes that the urinalysis strips detect in order to determine if an analyte is detected by the strip is abnormally high will it affect the results of other test pads on the strip. Urine samples were spiked with different analytes to the known concentrations which were then confirmed as positive urine samples by Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips and Clinitek Status Analyzer. These positive urine samples were then spiked with possible interfering substances, one at a time to the levels listed in the following tables. The urine samples were tested with the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips in 5 replicates. Results were read by comparing color reaction to the color blocks on the canister label according to the Instructions on the package insert.

# Acceptance Criteria

The reagent pad must produce expected color-reaction when testing with the corresponding spiked samples.

The test results on the Specific Gravity reagent pad are not affected by Glucose levels tested.

The sponsor also examined the effect of excess urine sample “runover” phenomenon between $\mathsf { p H }$ and Protein pads when the excess urine was not removed immediately. The pH standard solutions, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0, prepared with fresh negative urine were used in the study.

Testing protocol #1: Dip the ACON Urinalysis Reagent Strips into standard urine solutions and take out immediately, remove excess urine from the strips right away according to the package insert. Read results in the scheduled time. Tests were repeated 10 times for each solution.

Testing protocol $\# 2$ : Dip the strips into standard urine solutions and take out immediately, did not remove excess urine from the strips. Read results in the scheduled time. Tests were repeated 10 times for each solution.

Testing was performed and results were determined visually by comparing the reaction colors with the color chart. Results were summarized in the following table.

From the testing results, if the excess urine was not removed immediately, the edge of $\mathsf { p H }$ reagent pad became red as the result of the acidic component runover from the Protein pad onto the $\mathsf { p H }$ pad.

The sponsor also indicates that urinalysis reagent strips may be affected by substances that cause abnormal urine color such as drugs containing azo dyes (e.g. Pyridium® , Azo Gantrisin® , Azo Gantanol® ), nitrofurantoin (Microdantin® , Furadantin®), and riboflavin. The color development on the test pad may be masked or a color reaction may be produced that could be interpreted as false results. In addition, the sensitivity of the Nitrite pad is reduced for urine specimens with highly buffered alkaline (e.g. Sodium Bicarbonate).
