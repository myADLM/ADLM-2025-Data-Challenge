# 5. Device description

The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Reagent is used in conjunction with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 27 and VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 2 (BSA/Saline) on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems to quantitatively measure total homocysteine (HCY) concentration in human serum and plasma.

The quantitative measurement of homocysteine (HCY) is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Reagent in conjunction with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 27 and on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems. The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Reagent consists of two dual chambered reagent packs containing three ready-to-use liquid reagents. Disulfide linked homocysteine (oxidized forms) in the sample is reduced by Tris (2-Carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) to form reduced homocysteine. Reduced homocysteine reacts with serine in the presence of cystathionine $\beta$ -synthase (CBS) to form L-cystathionine. L-cystathionine is broken down by cystathionine $\beta$ -lyase (CBL) to produce homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using NADH as coenzyme. The concentration of HCY is directly proportional to the amount of NADH converted to $\mathrm { N A D } ^ { + }$ and is measured spectrophotometrically at $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ Once a calibration has been performed, the HCY concentration in each unknown sample can be determined using the stored calibration curve and the measured absorbance obtained in the assay of the sample.

The VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 27 are prepared from an aqueous solution containing amino acids and inorganic acid. These standards are used to calibrate VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems for the quantitative measurement of homocysteine (HCY).

The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Performance Verifiers I, II and III are prepared from processed human serum to which amino acid and preservative have been added. These are assayed controls used to monitor performance of VITROS HCY Reagents on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS Chemistry Products FS Diluent Pack 2 (Saline/BSA) is a common reagent that is used by multiple assays on the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System. This is a dual chambered package containing two ready-touse liquid diluents. Diluent 1 is prepared from processed water to which inorganic salt has been added. Diluent 2 is prepared from processed water to which bovine serum albumin, inorganic salts and preservatives have been added.

The VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System is a clinical chemistry instrument that provides automated use of the VITROS Chemistry Products MicroTip® and MicroSlides® range of products. The VITROS 5,1 FS System was cleared for market by $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ premarket notification (K031924).

# Device intended uses

VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Reagent : For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Reagent is used to quantitatively measure total homocysteine (HCY) concentration in human serum and plasma. Serum and plasma homocysteine levels can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients suspected of having hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria.

VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Performance Verifiers I, II & III: For in vitro diagnostic use only. VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Performance Verifiers are assayed controls used to monitor performance of VITROS HCY Reagents on VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems.

# 7.Comparison to predicate devices:

The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Reagent and VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 27 are substantially equivalent to the BIO-RAD HOMOCYSTEINE by HPLC test (K993107) (predicate device), which was cleared by the FDA for IVD use.

A least squares linear regression analysis demonstrated the following relationship: $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 \ \mathbf { x } \ + 1 . 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } ,$ , with a correlation coefficient $= 0 . 9 7$ where $\mathbf { y } =$ results obtained using the VITROS Chemistry Products HCY assay and $\mathbf { x } =$ results obtained with the commercially available system BIO-RAD HOMOCYSTEINE by HPLC test in conventional/SI units $\scriptstyle ( \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ .

The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY Performance Verifiers I, II & III are substantially equivalent to the VITROS Chemistry Products AAT Performance Verifiers I, II & III (K052819) (predicate device) which was cleared by the FDA for IVD use.

In addition to correlation studies, bench testing was performed to determine assay precision, linearity, specificity, expected values, limit of detection, dilution and specimen matrix of the VITROS HCY assay.
