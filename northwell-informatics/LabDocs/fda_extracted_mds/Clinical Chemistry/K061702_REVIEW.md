Traceability

The assigned values of the Creatine Kinase Calibrator are traceable to Master Pool, Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry system.

# Value Assignment

The new calibrator Master Pool is made by gravimetrically adding quantities of creatine kinase to bovine serum albumin base to target concentrations. The concentrations are verified against a previously approved Master Pool lot. The final bottle value for the Master Pool is assigned for each level by testing $\Nu =$ 45 replicates on multiple instruments.

A stock solution is prepared for the new commercial calibrator lot by gravimetrically adding quantities of creatine kinase to bovine serum albumin base to target concentrations. The stock solution is verified by comparing the recovery of the stock solution versus the Master Pool assigned bottle values. For the commercial calibrator lot, calculated quantities of the stock solution are added to the bovine serum albumin base to target concentrations. The concentration of each level is verified to be within acceptable range by using an instrument calibrated with Master Pools. The final bottle value is assigned to each level and verified using a released commercial lot of calibrator on multiple instruments for $\mathrm { N } = 4 5$ total replicates.

# Stability

Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™ Creatine Kinase Calibrator is 12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ with control stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The method is calibrated from this stored material. The ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ material values are recovered versus the calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is determined where the allowable shelf life percent change should be $\leq 5 \%$ . Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc.

A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board is stable for seven days. An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator is stable for 30 days. For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. A quantity sufficient for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at $2 - 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 32 versus freshly opened vials.
