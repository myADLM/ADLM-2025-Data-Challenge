# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable to this submission. $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable to this submission.

The sponsor demonstrated the stability of their device using real-time data. To assess the shelf life of their device, the company compared concentration measurements made on unopened material stored at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to material stored at ${ \displaystyle - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ . The company made 5 replicate measurements at each level on days 0, 3, 7, 35, 98, 189, 280, 325, and 371. Data supplied by the company supports the claimed shelf life of 12 months.

To demonstrate the stability of their opened, refrigerated device, the company punctured vials on day zero, removed material, and returned the device to storage at $2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 8 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The company performed 5 replicate measurements on each level of calibrator. Material stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ was used as a comparator. The company performed subsequent measurements on days 8, 15, 22 and 32. The data supplied by the company supports the claimed opened, refrigerated shelf life of 30 days.

The company verifies the target concentration of the calibrator material following an internally established manufacturing procedure: the new calibrator is made by adding by weight aqueous solutions of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium salicylate, and glycerol reference materials to a stock solution at target concentrations. The company validates the traceability and expected value of the device through 45 replicate measurements across multiple instruments calibrated with primary standards. A previously released lot of calibrator is used as control material.
