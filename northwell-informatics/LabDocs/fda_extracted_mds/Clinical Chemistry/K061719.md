# Date of Preparation:

June 16, 2006

Name of Products:

Dimension Vista™M TBIL Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridge Dimension VistaTM TDBIL Calibrator

FDA Classification Name: Bilirubin (total or direct) test system Bilirubin Calibrator

# Predicate Device:

Dade Behring Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TBIL Flex® reagent cartridge and TBIL/DBIL Calibrator (k861700)

# Device Description:

TBIL Flex® reagent cartridge Diazotized sulfanilic acid is formed by combining sodium nitrite and sulfanilic acid at low pH. Bilirubin (unconjugated) in the sample is solubilized by dilution in a mixture of caffeine/benzoate/acetate/EDTA. Upon addition of the diazotized sulfanilic acid, the solubilized bilirubin including conjugated bilirubins (mono and diglucoronides) and the delta form (biliprotein-bilirubin covalently bound to albumin) is converted to diazo-bilirubin, a red chromophore representing the total bilirubin which absorbs at ${ 5 4 0 } \mathrm { n m }$ and is measured using a bichromatic (540, $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ endpoint technique. A sample blank correction is used.

Solubilized bilirubin $^ +$ Diazotized sulfanilic acid $>$ Red chromophore (absorbs at $5 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$

Total bilirubin and Direct bilirubin calibrator.

The TDBIL calibrator is a two level calibrator. Level 1, purified water, is provided through the on-board Dimension VistaTM system. Level 2 is a lyophilized human serum based material spiked with ditaurobilirubin and traceable to NIST Standard Reference Material 916a.

# Intended Use:

# TBIL Flex® reagent cartridge:

The TBIL method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of total bilirubin in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista™ System. Measurements of total bilirubin are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver, hemolytic hematological and metabolic disorders, including hepatitis and gall bladder disease.

TDBIL Calibrator:   
The TDBIL CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for calibration of the Direct Bilirubin (DBIL) and Total Bilirubin (TBIL) methods on the Dimension Vista™M System.

# Comparison to the predicate device:

The TBIL Flex® reagent cartridge and TDBIL Calibrator are substantially equivalent in intended use, principle and performance to the predicate Dade Behring TBIL assay and TBIL/DBIL Calibrator, k861700. The assays are in vitro assays with intended use for the measurement of total bilirubin in human serum and plasma. Both calibrators are for use of calibration of the total and direct bilirubin in vitro assays.

A summary of the features of the predicate and Dimension Vista™M TBIL Flex® reagent cartridge assays is provided in the following chart. Although the intended use statements have been modified for the test assay to align with CFR 862.1110, there are no different claims for the test assay.

Dear Mr. Plummer,

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
