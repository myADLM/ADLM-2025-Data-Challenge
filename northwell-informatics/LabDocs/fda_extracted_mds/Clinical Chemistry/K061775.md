# Creatinine HA

This summary of $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 807.92.

The assigned $\bf 5 1 0 ( k )$ number is: K061775

# Test Description:

Creatinine is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of creatinine in serum, plasma or urine. Creatinine is produced directly from creatinine phosphate or by the dehydration of creatine in the muscles and nerves. The amount of metabolically produced creatinine in the urine is conveniently used to test glomerular function. Therefore, creatinine measurement is one of the essential clinical tests in the diagnosis of uremia and renal diseases such as renal insufficiency and nephritis, and in monitoring renal diseases. The enzymatic methods with high specificity are widely used to measure creatinine. L-Type Creatinine M is a reagent kit for creatinine assay based on the enzymatic method employing creatininase, creatinase, sarcosine oxidase and N-(3-sulfopropyl)-3-methoxy-5-methylaniline (HMMPS) as a new color agent.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The L-Type Creatinine M is substantially equivalent to the Wako Creatinine HA 510(k) #K842847. Both assays yield similar Performance Characteristics.

# Similarities:

Both assays can be used for the quantitative of creatinine.   
Both assays yield similar results.

# Intended Use:

L-Type Creatinine M is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of creatinine in serum, plasma or urine.

Indications for use:

Creatinine measurement is one of the essential clinical tests in the diagnosis of uremia and renal diseases such as renal insufficiency and nephritis, and in monitoring renal diseases.

# Performance Characteristics:

A comparison of the L-Type Creatinine M and a similar Creatinine HA (modified Jaffé method) was performed using a Hitachi 917. The test results provided the following data:

A correlation coefficient of 0.999, slope of 1.049 and a Y-intercept of $- 0 . 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum application and a correlation coefficient of 0.998, slope of 1.038 and a Y-intercept of 0.94 for the urine application. A direct comparison between serum and plasma samples, both run on the Ltype Creatinine M method, yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.999, slope of 1.002 and a Yintercept of -0.04 for the serum/plasma application.

# Precision Studies

Precision studies were conducted using the L-Type Creatinine M assay on the Hitachi 917.

Within-run precision:

The within-run precision: $\mathfrak { n } { = } 2 1$ using 3 levels of controls.The within-run $\%$ CV ranged from 0.42 to 2.38 for serum/plasma and from 0.41 to 0.68 for urine.

Total precision:

Total precision data was collected according to CLIS EP5-A1 guideline over a period of 21 days.   
The total $\%$ CV ranged from 0.40 to 1.59 for serum/plasma and from 0.37 to 0.50 for urine.

Measurement of creatinine in serum and plasma is linear in the range from $0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to 100 ${ \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . Measurement of creatinine in urine is linear in the range from $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . If the creatinine value exceeds the upper limit of measurable range, dilute the sample with saline, repeat the assay, and multiply the result by the dilution factor.

# Conclusion:

These data demonstrate that the performance of the L-Type Creatinine M assay is substantially equivalent to the Wako Creatinine HA assay on the Hitachi 917.

Dear Ms. Creasy:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
