# I. Device Description:

The Wako L-Type Creatinine-M Test is a two reagent system for use on an automated analyzer such as the Hitachi 917. Both reagents contain enzymes with stabilizers and/or buffers. The test is calibrated by using a calibrator with values determined by using enzymatic reagents and SRM914a (NIST) creatinine standard material as the primary standard. The calibrator matrix is an aqueous solution containing $\mathsf { p H }$ , viscosity, and specific gravity adjustors.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline

CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline

# L. Test Principle:

Creatinine present in samples is acted upon by creatininase, creatinase, sarcosine oxidase, and HMMPS to form a blue pigment. The creatinine concentration is obtained by measuring the absorbance of the blue pigment.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within run precision was evaluated by testing 3 serum and 3 urine samples in one run 21 times. The results are summarized below.

<table><tr><td>Sample#</td><td>Replicates</td><td>Mean(mg/dL)</td><td>CV(%)</td></tr><tr><td>Serum1</td><td>21</td><td>0.84</td><td>2.38</td></tr><tr><td>Serum2</td><td>21</td><td>7.16</td><td>0.42</td></tr><tr><td>Serum3</td><td>21</td><td>96.58</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td>Urinel</td><td>21</td><td>23.74</td><td>0.51</td></tr><tr><td>Urine2</td><td>21</td><td>102.49</td><td>0.42</td></tr><tr><td>Urine3</td><td>21</td><td>180.67</td><td>0.68</td></tr></table>

Total Precision was evaluated following CLSI EP-5A by performing two runs per day, with each run testing 3 serum and 3 urine samples in duplicate for 21 days. The results are summarized below.

<table><tr><td>Sample#</td><td>Replicates</td><td>Mean(mg/dL)</td><td>CV(%)</td></tr><tr><td>Serum4</td><td>21</td><td>1.26</td><td>1.59</td></tr><tr><td>Serum5</td><td>21</td><td>7.22</td><td>0.88</td></tr><tr><td>Serum6</td><td>21</td><td>95.14</td><td>0.40</td></tr><tr><td>Urine4</td><td>21</td><td>24.13</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>Urine5</td><td>21</td><td>104.36</td><td>0.37</td></tr><tr><td>Urine6</td><td>21</td><td>184.45</td><td>0.42</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

High level creatinine samples were created by spiking creatinine into pooled serum and urine samples at concentrations $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ above the upper end of the measuring ranges. These samples were then sequentially diluted with low level serum and urine samples, respectively. Both the serum and urine samples had measured results within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the expected values. A slope close to 1 and correlation coefficient of 0.99 was calculated for both the serum and urine linearity samples. These results demonstrated that with this assay the measurement of creatinine is linear in the range of $0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to 100 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ in serum or plasma and $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in urine.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The creatinine calibrator value is traceable to NIST SRM914a. The assigned value of the calibrator is determined by enzymatic methods.

The calibrators are stable until the expiration date when stored at $2 - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once opened the calibrator is stable for 3 months when tightly recapped and stored in the original container at $2 - 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of detection was determined at outlined in CLSI EP-17A. The limit of detection was determined to be $0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in urine and $0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in serum/plasma.

e. Analytical specificity:

Interfering compounds were evaluated by spiking various concentrations of the interferants into a creatinine sample and comparing the results of the interferent spiked samples with an unspiked creatinine reference sample. Non-interference was defined as a recovery of $9 0 \% - 1 1 0 \%$ of the unspiked reference sample. The highest concentration of each compound that did not interfere is shown below.

Interfering compound Maximum concentration tested Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL Bilirubin 50 mg/dL Conjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL Intralipid 5% Ascorbic Acid 50 mg/dL Creatine 50 mg/dL EDTA 0.5% Sodium Citrate 2.0% Ammonium Oxalate 0.8% Sodium Fluoride 2.0% Heparin Sodium 0.5%

The sponsor also compared 60 urine samples ranging from 30.44 to 197.01 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ creatinine to the predicate device. Linear regression produced a slope of 0.99, a y-intercept of 1.24, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999.

b. Matrix comparison:

A method comparison was performed using the L-Type creatinine method with 60 matched serum-plasma samples ranging in concentration from 0.48 to $9 8 . 5 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ creatinine (in serum). Linear regression produced a slope of 1.00, a y-intercept of -0.04, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999.
