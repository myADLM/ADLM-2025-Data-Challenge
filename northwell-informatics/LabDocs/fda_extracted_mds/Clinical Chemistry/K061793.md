# K. Test Principle:

The automated Dimension Vista™M IRON method is an adaptation of direct iron assays using the chromophore Ferene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ . Under acidic conditions, iron $( \mathsf { F e } ^ { + + + } )$ bound to the protein transferrin is released. In the presence of the reducing agent ascorbic acid, $( \mathrm { F e + + + } )$ is reduced to $( \mathsf { F e } + + )$ . $( \mathrm { F e } + + )$ forms a blue complex with 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis2-(5-furyl sulfonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine, disodium salt (Ferene $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ). The absorbance of the complex, measured using a bichromatic (600, $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m } ,$ endpoint technique, is directly proportional to the concentration of transferrin-bound iron in the serum.

# L. Comments on Substantial Equivalence/Conclusion:

The performance testing according to the verification and validation test protocols demonstrate that the Dimension VistaTM IRON Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge is substantially equivalent to the designated predicate device.

Dear Ms. Tasker:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devics that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of theFederal FoodDrug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either classII (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
