# 4. Device Description(s):

Method The PBNP method is a one-step sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on Luminescent Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCITM) technology. LOCTTM reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated polyclonal antibody fragment which recognize an epitope located in the

N-terminal part of proBNP. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second antibody specific for a second independent epitope on NT-proBNP and contains chemiluminescent dye.

Sample is incubated with Chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a particle/NTproBNP/biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads then are added and bind to the biotin to form a bead-aggregated immunocomplex. Illumination of the complex by light at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads, which diffuses to the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is directly proportional to the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample.

# Calibrator

The PBNP Calibrator is a frozen liquid product containing synthetic human N-terminal pro-brain naruretic peptide in a bovie lbumn matrix with stabilizers and preervativ.The ki consists oeight vials, two each of four levels (A, B, C, and D), $1 . 0 \mathrm { m l }$ per vial for levels A, C, and D and $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ per vial for level B. Description of the manufacturing, value assignment and stability testing processes are provided in Section 21.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

# Method

The PBNP method is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative measurement of N-terminal proau  -     e System. In individuals suspected of having congestive heart failure (CHF), measurements of NTproBNP are used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity. The test is further indicated for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome and heart failure.

# Calibrator

The NT-proBNP (PBNP) Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product intended to be used for calibration of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (PBNP) method for the Dimension Vista™ System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed:

Substantial Equivalence:

Thee products are substantially equivalent to other B-type natriuretic peptide test systems, such as the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ proBNP immunoassay and proBNP CalSet Calibrator (K032646/K022516).

See examples of the predicate device labeling in Section 12.1.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

# Method

The proposed Dade Behring Dimension Vista™M PBNP method and the predicate Roche Diagnostics Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ proBNP immunoassay are both in vitro diagnostic immunoassays intended for the quantitative measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in human serum and heparinized plasma. See Section 12.1 for a copy of the predicate labeling. The Dade Behring Dimension Vista™M PBNP Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ method utilizes the Roche polyclonal (sheep) antibody/antigen set.
