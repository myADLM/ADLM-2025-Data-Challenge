L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability:

The assigned values of the Alkaline Phosphatase Calibrator are traceable to Master Pool, Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Clinical Chemistry System.

# Stability:

Target shelf life for the ALP calibrator is 12 months. Calibrator shelf life (long term) stability is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ with control stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ . Percent change should be less than or equal to $6 \%$ . Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc. Open vial (in use) stability is 7 days if kept on the instrument and 30 days if stored in the refrigerator.

# Value Assignment:

The new calibrator Master Pool is made by gravimetrically adding quantities of alkaline phosphatase to StabilZyme $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AP to target concentrations. Three levels of Master Pool are prepared and stored at $\mathrm { - 7 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ . The concentrations are verified using a previously approved Master Pool lot as a control. The final bottle value for the Master Pool is assigned for each level by testing $\Nu =$ 45 replicates on multiple instruments. A stock solution is prepared for the new commercial calibrator lot by gravimetrically adding alkaline phosphatase to StabilZyme $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AP to target concentration. The stock solution concentration is verified by comparing the Master Pool assigned bottle values. For the commercial calibrator lot, calculated quantity of the stock solution is added to StabilZyme $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AP to target concentrations. The concentration of the commercial lot is verified to be within acceptable range by using an instrument calibrated with Master Pools. The final bottle value is assigned to the commercial lot level and verified using a previously released commercial lot of calibrator on multiple instruments for $\mathrm { N } = 4 5$ total replicates.
