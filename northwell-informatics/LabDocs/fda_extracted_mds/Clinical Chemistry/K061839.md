# Date of Preparation:

June 28, 2006

Name of Products: DBIL Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge

FDA Classification Name: Bilirubin (total or direct) test system

Predicate Device: Dade Behring DBIL Flex $^ { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (k862359)

# Device Description:

Diazotized sulfanilic acid is formed by combining sodium nitrite and sulfanilic acid at low pH. The sample is diluted in 0.5M HCl. A blank reading is taken to eliminate interference from nonbilirubin pigments. Upon addition of the diazotized sulfanilic acid, the conjugated bilirubin is converted to diazo-bilirubin, a red chromophore which absorbs at 540 nm and is measured using a bichromatic (540, $7 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ endpoint technique.

Conjugated bilirubin $^ +$ Diazotized sulfanilic acid Red chromophore (absorbs at $5 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$

# Intended Use:

The DBIL method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of direct (conjugated) bilirubin in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista System. Measurements of direct bilirubin are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver, hemolytic, hematological and metabolic disorders, including hepatitis and gall bladder disease.

# Comparison to the predicate device:

The DBIL Flex® reagent cartridge is substantially equivalent in intended use, principle and performance to the predicate Dade Behring DBIL assay, k862359. The assay is an in vitro assay with intended use for the measurement of direct bilirubin in human serum and plasma.

modified for the test assay to align with CFR 862.1110, there are no different claims for the test assay.

# Conclusion:

The Dimension Vista™M DBIL Flex® reagent cartridge is substantially equivalent in principle and performance to the predicate product.

Dear Mr. Plummer

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must coly with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
