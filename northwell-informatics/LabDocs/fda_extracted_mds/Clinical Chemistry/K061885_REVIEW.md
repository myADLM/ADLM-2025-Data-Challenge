# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CEN 13640, Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents

ISO 14971:2000, Medical devices - Application of risk management to medical devices

FDA Guidance for Industry - Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators; Final

FDA Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Use of Symbols on Labels and in Labeling of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Intended for Professional Use

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

The assigned values of the calibrators are traceable to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) L-triiodothyronine (USP Catalog #36800).

Value Assignment

The master pool is manufactured by weighing USP T3 into stripped human serum at five levels. The master pool bottle values are assigned by calibration with a previous master pool using multiple replicates on multiple instruments.

The commercial calibrators are manufactured by weighing purified T3 into stripped human serum at two levels. Bottle values are assigned by calibration with the master pool using multiple replicates on multiple instruments.

Stability

Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not Applicable

N. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
