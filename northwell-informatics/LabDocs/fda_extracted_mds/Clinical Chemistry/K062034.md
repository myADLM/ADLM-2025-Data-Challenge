E. Proprietary and Established Names:

Dimension Vista™M System Drug 1 Calibrator (DRUG 1 CAL - KC410)

# F. Regulatory Information:

1. Regulation section: 21 CFR $\ S$ 862-1150 - Calibrator

2. Classification: Class II

3.Product Code: JIX  Calibrator, Multi-Analyte Mixture

4. Panel: Clinical Chemistry

G. Intended Use:

The DRUG 1 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of Digoxin (DIG), Lithium (LI), Phenobarbital EY $\left( \mathbf { P H N O } \right) ^ { \mathbf { 1 } }$ hetoin (TN) and Theophylline (THEO) methods on the Dimension VistaSystem.

# H. Device Description:

DRUG 1 CAL is a liquid, multi-analyte, human serum based product containing digoxin, lithium, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and theophylline. The kit consists of six vials, three vials of Calibrator A, and three vials of Calibrator B which are ready for use (no preparation is required). This same product, the Dimension VistaTM System Drug 1 Calibrator (KC410), was previously cleared (K051087) for the calibration of the Phenobarbital (PHNO) method on the Dimension VistaTM System. The calibrator

formulation has not changed. However, additional analytes are being assigned values and included in the intended use. The volume in the vials has also changed from $2 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ to $2 . 5 \mathrm { m L }$ and the claim for punctured vial shelf life is reduced to one day.

# K. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability:

Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™M Drug 1 Calibrator is 12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ with control stored at $\mathbf { - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ The method is calibrated from this stored material. The $4 \%$ material values are recovered versus the calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is determined where the allowable shelf life percent change should be less than or equal to:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Analyte</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Allowable Shelf lifepercent change</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Digoxin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤ 4%.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Phenytoin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Theophylline</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤ 8%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lithium</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤ 5%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Phenobarbital</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>≤ 8%</td></tr></table>

' The Dimension Vista™M System Drug 1 Calibrator was previously cleared for the calibration of Phenobarbital (PHNO) method in the Dimension VistaTM System under K051087.

Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade Behring, Inc.

A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board has a stability claim of one day.

An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator has a stability claim of 31 days.

For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. A quantity sufficient for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at $2 - 8 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 0, 8 hrs, 2, 8, 32 versus freshly opened vials.

3.Bottle Value Assignment:

A Master Pool is manufactured by weighing in Phenobarbital, Digoxin, Phenytoin, Lithium and Theophylline reference material into drug free normal human serum at five levels and stored frozen at ${ } - 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The verification of the Master Pool assigned values are compared against previously approved Master Pool values.

The stock solution is made by adding reference materials gravimetrically to stock solution at target concentrations. The stock solution values are verified versus previously approved Master Pool values.

The commercial lot is made by adding calculated quantities of stock solution to drug free normal human serum in appropriate concentrations for two calibrator levels. The concentration of each level is verified by using an instrument calibrated with Master Pools.

The final bottle values for each level of the commercial lot is assigned and verified using multiple instruments by testing $\Nu = 4 5$ replicates per level.

Dear Mr. Carrio:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
