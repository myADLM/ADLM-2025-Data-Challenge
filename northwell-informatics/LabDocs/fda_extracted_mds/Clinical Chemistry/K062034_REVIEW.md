# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See below indications(s) for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The DRUG 1 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of Digoxin (DIG), Lithium (LI), Phenobarbital (PHNO), Phenytoin (PTN) and Theophylline (THEO) methods on the Dimension Vista™ System.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use.

4. Special instrument requirements: Dade Behring Dimension Vista™ System

# I. Device Description:

DRUG 1 CAL is a liquid, multi-analyte, human serum based product containing digoxin, lithium, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and theophylline. The kit consists of six vials, three vials of Calibrator A, and three vials of Calibrator B which are ready for use (no preparation is required). This same product, the Dimension Vista™ System Drug 1 Calibrator (KC410), was previously cleared (k051087) for the calibration of the Phenobarbital (PHNO) method on the Dimension Vista™ System. The calibrator formulation has not changed. However, additional analytes are being assigned values and included in the intended use. The volume in the vials has also changed from 2.0 mL to $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ and the claim for punctured vial shelf life is reduced to one day. Each donor unit used in the preparation of this material was tested by FDA approved methods for the presence of antibodies to HIV-1, HIV-2, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and antibody to HCV and found to be negative.
