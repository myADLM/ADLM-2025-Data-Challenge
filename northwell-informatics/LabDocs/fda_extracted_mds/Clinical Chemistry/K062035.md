3. Identification of the Legally Marketed Device:

ROCHE Tina-Quant RF II assay - K032535   
N Rheumatology Standard SL - K964527   
N/T Rheumatology Control SL - K962373

4. Device Description:

Dimension Vista RF Flex® reagent cartridge

Polystyrene particles coated with an immunocomplex consisting of human immunoglobulin and anti-human IgG from sheep are aggregated when mixed with samples containing RF. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# Dimension Vista™ Protein 2 Calibrator

PROT2 CAL is a liquid, human serum based product containing C-reactive protein and Rheumatoid Factors.

# Dimension Vista ™ Protein 2 Control L and H

PROT2 CON L and H are liquid, multi-analyte, human serum based products containing C-reactive protein and Rheumatoid Factors.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

Dimension Vista™ RF Flex® reagent cartridge:

The RF method is an in vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative determination of rheumatoid factors (RF) in human serum and lithium heparin plasma on the Dimension Vista™ System. Measurements of RF are used as an aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.

Dimension Vista ™M Protein 2 Calibrator:

PROT2 CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the C-reactive protein (CRP), high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and Rheumatoid Factors (RF) methods on the Dimension Vista System.

Dimension Vista ™M Protein 2 Controls L and H:

PROT2 CON L and H are assayed intralaboratory quality controls for the assessment of precision and analytical bias in the determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Rheumatoid Factors (RF) on the Dimension Vista™M System.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

The Dimension Vista ™ RF Flex® reagent cartridge, Dimension Vista ™ Protein 2 Calibrator and Dimension Vista ™m Protein 2 Controls L and H are substantially equivalent to the ROCHE Tina-Quant RF Il assay (K032535), N Rheumatology Standard SL (K964527) and N/T Rheumatology Control SL (K962373), respectively. The Dimension Vista ™M RF assay, like the ROCHE Tina-Quant RF Il assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative determination of Rheumatoid Factors in human serum and heparinized plasma.

# 7. Device Performance Characteristics:

The Dimension Vista ™M RF assay was compared to the ROCHE Tina-Quant RF II on the Hitachi 917 Analyzer by evaluating serum samples with concentrations ranging from 10 to 520 IU/ML. Regression analysis of these results yielded the following equation:

Dear Ms. Dray-Lyons:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality

systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable. the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act): 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $5 \mathrm { { l } 0 ( \mathrm { { k } ) } }$ EY premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
