# Rationale for Considering the Device Substantially Equivalent to Devices Approved for Inter-state Commerce

Roche Creatinine plus test method (k003261) was selected for comparing serum and urine samples with to the results generated by Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay. Detailed performance characteristics and comparison analysis are given in this filing and demonstrate substantial equivalence to predicate device that is currently being legally marketed.

The Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay is similar to the approved predicate test. The minor differences in the performances of the tests should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay and offers users a rapid device to measure creatinine in human serum.

In summary, the dissimilar features between the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay and devices currently legally marketed do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. This is supported by the accuracy data comparing serum and urine sample values obtained using the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay with those obtained using the predicate device, Roche Creatinine plus test (k003261). Comparison analysis presented in this 510k submission together with the stability data also demonstrates that the Diazyme Creatinine control is substantially similar to the legally marketed device Dimension Vista Control (k063206).

# Description of the Device

This enzymatic assay for creatinine involves a series of coupled enzymatic reactions including creatininase enzymatic conversion of creatinine into the product creatine, which itself is converted to sarcosine by creatine amidinohydrolase (creatinase), followed by oxidation of sarcosine by sarcosine oxidase (SOD) producing hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase (POD) the hydrogen peroxide is quantified at $5 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ by the formation of a colored dye.

# Intended Use of the Device:

Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay, in conjunction with Diazyme Creatinine Calibrator, is intended for the quantitative determination of creatinine in serum and urine. Creatinine measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine analytes. For in viro diagnostic use only

Diazyme Creatinine Control is an assayed QC material for use in quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of creatinine in human serum and urine. It is intended as a reference sample for monitoring the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay for gross systematic errors. For in vitro diagnostic use only.

# Performance Characteristics

Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay is a two-reagent $( { \mathbb R } 1 / { \mathbb R } 2 )$ based kinetic assay system. The results are obtained in 10 minutes by measuring absorbance at ${ 5 5 0 } \mathrm { n m }$ On line pretreatment removes endogenous creatine. The assay has a wide measuring range of $0 . 1 4 \mathrm { - } 1 3 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (12- $1 2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ for Serum samples and $0 . 1 4 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 4 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 1 2 \mathrm { t o } 1 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { \mu m o l / L } )$ for Urine samples. The assay offers excellent precision as shown in the tables below:

Pre-market Notification Diazyme Creatinine Assay In method comparison studies, samples tested with Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay showed good correlation with Roche Creatinine plus $( \mathbf { k } 0 0 3 2 6 1 )$ with correlation coefficients of 0.99 for both serum samples and urine samples. The average analytical recoveries were $9 7 . 8 \%$ to $1 0 9 . 4 \%$ for 11 creatinine serum samples and $9 7 . 0 \%$ to $1 0 4 . 3 \%$ for 22 creatinine urine samples.

We have conducted interference studies by spiking the substances to be tested to pooled human serum and urine, and found little interference at the indicated concentrations.

Conclusion: Comparison analysis presented in this ${ \mathfrak { s l } } 0 \mathbf { k }$ submission filing in the comparison section, together with linearity, precision and interference and other detailed studies, demonstrates that the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay has excellent accuracy and is safe and effective. There is no significant deviation between the results obtained by Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay and the legally marketed predicate device (k003261) when testing clinical patient samples and is therefore substantially similar. Comparison analysis presented in this ${ \bf 5 1 0 k }$ submission together with the stability data demonstrates that the Diazyme Creatinine control is substantially similar to legally marketed device (k063206).

In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
