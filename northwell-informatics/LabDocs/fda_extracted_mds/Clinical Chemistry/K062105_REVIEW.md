# L. Test Principle:

Creatinine in serum or urine sample is hydrolyzed to creatine, which is then hydrolyzed to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine is oxidized to formaldehyde, glycine, and hydrogen peroxide. Finally, a peroxidise-catalyzed reaction produces a dye that can be measured by the instrument. The intensity of the dye, when read at $5 4 6 \mathrm { n m }$ , is proportional to the amount of creatinine in the patient sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

i.) Precision studies for serum samples were evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A guideline. For within-run precision and total precision studies, four serum specimens were tested on the Hitachi 917 twice daily, in duplicates, over 20 days. The results are presented in the tables below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

i.) Serum samples: Eleven levels of serum sample pools were prepared by mixing a low sample and a high sample and were then tested on the Hitachi 917 analyzer. Sample pools range from 0.12 to $1 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Results showed the measured value and expected value differed by $\leq 1 0 \%$ error. The studies supported the sponsor claimed linearity range of 0.14 to $1 3 . 5 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum samples.

ii.) Urine samples: The same procedure as for serum was performed to evaluate assay linearity with the urine sample matrix. Sample pools ranged from 0 to $1 4 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . In addition, a urine linearity study with samples that encompass the lower end of the linear range of the assay was performed (sample pools range from 0.14 to $1 5 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ . The studies support the sponsor’s claimed linearity range of 0.14 to $1 4 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for urine samples.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The Diazyme Creatinine Control is traceable to NIST SRM 914a Creatinine standard reference material. The value was assigned by performing multiple

determinations using the Hitachi 917 analyzer and the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay.

# Stability

The long term (shelf life) stability of the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay and Diazyme Creatinine Control were tested on a Hitachi 917 analyzer using a real time study extending at least one month beyond the selected expiration date. Testing was done at intervals of 0, 3, 6, 9 months and is still ongoing. The Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents and controls are stored at refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and the expiration is at least 12 months.

The opened vial (in use) stability of the Diazyme Creatinine Liquid Reagents Assay and Diazyme Creatinine Control were tested on a Hitachi 917 analyzer with different intervals using accelerated studies. The real time on-board stability studies were done at day 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35. The on-board stability of the reagents is at least 30 days. The control is stable for at least 1 month when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The lower limit of the assay range was determined by measuring a Limit of Blank (LOB). The LOB of the Diazyme Creatinine assay was determined by assaying the Diazyme Creatinine zero calibrator in 12 replicates on the Hitachi 917 instrument. The LOB was defined as mean $+ \ 3 \mathrm { S D }$ . The sponsor claimed that the lower limit of the assay is $0 . 1 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere with the method. The interfering substances were evaluated in serum and urine pools that had different creatinine concentrations. The sponsor defined interference as samples for which the analyte recovery varies from the base recovery by more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ . The summary of the results of the recovery studies is provided in the table below:
