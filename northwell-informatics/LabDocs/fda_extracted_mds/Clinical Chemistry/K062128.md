# Device Description:

Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Flex® reagent cartridges and the HA1C kit are prepackaged in-vitro diagnostic test methods (assays) that are specifically designed to be used on the Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Integrated system, a floor model, fully automated, microprocessorcontrolled, integrated instrument system. The Dimension VistaTM system was previously cleared with seven associated test methods (K051087). This Special $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ is submitted for a packaging modification to in-vitro diagnostic devices that have been cleared under the 510(k) process for use on Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems. The packaging change is to allow use on the Dimension Vista™M system.

The reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The calibrator included in the Dimension Vista™ HAIC kit is the same product (unchanged) as that used in the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ HA1C Kit. The packaging modification, does not affect the intended use of the devices, nor does it alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

# Intended Use:

Creatine Kinase MB Isoenzyme The CKMB method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of creatine kinase MB Isoenzyme in human serum and plasma on the Dimension Vista™ System.

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

The Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Flex® reagent cartridges and the Dimension® Flex® reagent cartridges are designed similarly for the same purpose. Both contain prepackaged reagents for in-vitro diagnostic tests that are processed on microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument systems to analyze a variety of analytes in human specimens.

The reagents contained in the Dimension Vista™M Flex® reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Flex® reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension® clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The calibrator included in the Dimension Vista™M HA1C kit is the same product (unchanged) as that used in the Dimension® HA1C Kit. The packaging modifications do not affect the intended use of the devices, nor do they alter the fundamental scientific technology of the devices.

Comparative testing described in the protocol included in this submission demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.

# Conclusion:

The Flex® reagent cartridges/kit, containing reagents for testing CKMB, HA1C, AMPH, BARB, BENZ, COC, EXTC, METH, OPI, PCP, THC on the Dimension@ Vista™M Integrated system are substantially equivalent in design, principle, and performance to the Dimension® system Flex® reagent cartridges/kit. They have the same intended use and indications for use. Comparative testing also demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.

Dear Ms. Piestrak:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

Page 2 - Ms. Lorraine Piestrak

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0450. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address

Device Name: Dimension VistaTM Urine Cannabinoids Screen (THC) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge

Indications For Use:

The THC Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge used on the Dimension VistaTM integrated system provides reagents for an in-vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of cannabinoids in human urine. Measurements obtained with the THC method are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cannabinoids use or overdose.

The THC method provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
