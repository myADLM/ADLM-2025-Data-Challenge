5. Intended Use

Betachek Blood Glucose Test is a test intended to be used by non-diabetic individuals at home to estimate their fasting blood glucose (blood sugar) level from a drop of blood obtained from a finger stick.

Any abnormal results should be verified by a medical professional, such as a physician, and confirmed with a quantitative, laboratory reference method. Only a trained medical professional can determine if an individual has diabetes. A test result within the normal range does not exclude the possibility that the individual has diabetes or pre-diabetes. Any individual who is concerned that he or she may have diabetes or pre-diabetes should seek the advice of a physician.

Betachek Blood Glucose Test is not intended to be used for children or by individuals who are diabetic or pregnant.

This test can not be used to screen or diagnose diabetes.   
It should not be used for children or by individuals who are diabetic or pregnant.   
This test is only intended for individual use at home.   
It is not for use as part of a screening program in a healthcare setting or any other setting.

Re: k062187 Trade Name: Betachek Blood Glucose (Sugar) test Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose Test System Regulatory Class: Class II Product Codes: NBW, CGA Dated: December 22, 2008 Received: December 24, 2008

Dear Mr. Bransgrove:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (301) 594-3084. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
