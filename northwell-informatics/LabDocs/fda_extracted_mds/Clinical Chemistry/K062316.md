# K062316 510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Information

This summary of 510(k) safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

Submitter's Name:

Lorraine H Piestrak Dade Behring Inc. P.O. Box 6101 Newark, DE 19714-6101

Date of Preparation: August 8, 2006

Name of Products: Dimension Vista™M Ammonia (AMON) Flex® reagent cartridge

# FDA Classification Name:

<table><tr><td>Classification Name:</td><td>Common/Usual Name:</td></tr><tr><td>862.1065 Enzymatic Method, Ammonia</td><td>Ammonia test system</td></tr></table>

Product code: JIF

# Predicate Device:

Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Ammonia (AMON) Flex $^ { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (K863840)

# Device Description:

Dade Behring Dimension Vista™ Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are prepackaged in-vitro diagnostic test methods (assays) that are specifically designed to be used on the Dade Behring Dimension Vista™M Integrated system, a floor model, fully automated, microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system. The Dimension Vista™M system was previously cleared with seven associated test methods (K051087). This . Special $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ is submitted for a packaging modification to the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Ammonia (AMON) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge (K863840), an in-vitro diagnostic device that has been cleared under the 510(k) process. The packaging change is to allow use on the Dimension Vista™ system.

The reagents contained in the Dimension Vista™M Ammonia (AMON) Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Ammonia (AMON) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $\mathfrak { P }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modification, does not affect the intended use of the device,nor does it alter thefundamental scientific technology of he device.

# Intended Use:

The AMON method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of ammonia in human plasma on the Dimension Vista™M System.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

Both the Dimension Vista™M AMON Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridges and the predicate Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ AMON Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges contain prepackaged reagents in flexible plastic cartridges. A comparison of the important similarities and differences between the two Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ cartridges is provided in the following table:

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

The Dade Behring Dimension VistaTM Flex $\textcircled{8}$ reagent cartridges and the Dimension® Flex® reagent cartridges are designed similarly for the same purpose. Both contain prepackaged reagents for in-vitro diagnostic tests that are processed on microprocessorcontrolled, integrated instrument systems to analyze a variety of analytes in human specimens.

The reagents contained in the Dimension VistaTM Ammonia (AMON) Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges are the same as those contained in the Ammonia (AMON) Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges manufactured for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ clinical chemistry systems, another family of Dade Behring analyzers. The packaging modifications do not affect the intended use of the device, nor do they alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device.

Comparative testing described in the protocol included in this submission demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.

# Conclusion:

The Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges, containing reagents for testing AMON on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vista™M Integrated system are substantially equivalent in design, principle, and performance to the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system AMON Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges. They have the same intended use and indications for use. Comparative testing also demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.
