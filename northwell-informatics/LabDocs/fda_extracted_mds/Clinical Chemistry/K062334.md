# K. Performance Characteristics:

1. Stability:

Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista™M System Chemistry 3 Calibrator is 12 months. Calibrator shelf life is determined by comparing results of the product stored at $4 \%$ with control stored at ${ \bf - } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The method is calibrated from this stored material. The $4 \%$ material values are recovered versus the calibration. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is   
determined. Percent change should be less than or equal to $5 \%$ . Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at   
commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Dade   
Behring, Inc.   
A vial punctured by the instrument and stored on board is stable for 24 hours.   
An open vial not on instrument, but recapped and stored in a refrigerator is stable for 30 days.

For testing, vials are opened /punctured on day zero. A quantity sufficient for multiple calibrations is removed and the vials are recapped and stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Opened/punctured vials are tested on days 1, 3, and 32 versus freshly opened vials.

2. Traceability:

The assigned values of the Chemistry 3 Calibrator are standardized to the enclosed table of assigned values:

3.Bottle Value Assignment:

Carbon dioxide reference material is weighed into purified water at three levels and stored at $- 7 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Ammonia and alcohol reference materials are weighed into purified water at three levels respectively and stored at $4 \%$ . The Master Pool values are verified by comparing against previously approved Master Pool values.

The stock solution is made by adding alcohol, ammonia and carbon dioxide reference materials gravimetrically to stock solution at target concentrations. The stock solution values are verified on an instrument calibrated with a previously approved Master Pool.

The commercial lot is made by adding calculated quantities of stock solution to purified water in appropriate concentrations for each of the calibrator levels. The concentration of each level is verified by using an instrument calibrated with Master Pools.

The final bottle values for each level of the commercial lot is assigned using multiple instruments by testing $\Nu = 4 5$ replicates per level.

Dear Mr. Carrio:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requitements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21EFR-Part-807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, Intermational and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Intemet address
