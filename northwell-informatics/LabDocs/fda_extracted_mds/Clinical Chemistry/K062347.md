Intended Use:

The Ascensia® BREEZE ${ \mathfrak { s } } _ { 2 }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System consisting of the Ascensia® BREEZE ${ \mathfrak { s } } _ { 2 }$ Blood Glucse Meter, Ascensia® BREEZE ${ \mathfrak { s } } _ { 2 }$ Reagent Strips and Ascensia® BREEZE $\mathfrak { B } _ { 2 }$ Control Solution is for the measurement of glucose in whole blood. The Ascensia BREEZE®2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System allows the user an option to use the palm and forearm in addition to the fingertip (testing) to collect capillary blood for self-monitoring of blood glucose within certain conditions as explained in the labeling. Ascensia® BREEZE ${ \mathfrak { s } } _ { 2 }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an over-the-counter (OTC) device used by persons with diabetes. Ascensia $\textcircled{8}$ Breeze $\ @ 2$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not for use with neonatal blood specimens. The frequent monitoring of blood glucose is an adjunct to the care of persons with diabetes.

Technological Characteristics:

The Ascensia® BREEZE® Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs an amperometric glucose oxidase method to measure glucose in blood. It is conceptually the same as other blood glucose monitoring products available for blood glucose testing. Blood glucose results are referenced to plasma glucose. The system has a linearity response to glucose from $2 0 { \cdot } 6 0 0 \ \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { d L }$ .

Assessment of Performance:

A validation of the Ascensia® BREEZE ${ \mathfrak { s } } _ { 2 }$ Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed in a clinical setting by persons with diabetes. The subject meter results for capillary blood samples were compared with BREEZE $\mathfrak { P } _ { 2 }$ EY results obtained by a healthcare professional and results of a laboratory glucose analyzer. The studies showed improved performance compared with past clinical studies of giAcensBREEZ Bloo Guc Mon System.

# Conclusion:

The results of the clinical evaluations of The Ascensia® BREEZE®2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrated that the device can produce blood glucose results that are substantially equivalent to results obtained on the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Sonnenburg:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is lassifed (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) r class  (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish furthcr announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
