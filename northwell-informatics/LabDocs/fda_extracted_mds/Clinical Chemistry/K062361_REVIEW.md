# K. Standard/Guidance Documents Referenced (if applicable):

Chorionic Gonadotropin, WHO $4 \mathrm { { t h } }$ International Standard 75/589

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, WHO 1st International Standard 90/672

# L. Test Principle:

The Innovacon hCG Ultra Test device employs a combination of gold-conjugated monoclonal antibody and polyclonal solid phase antibody to selectively identify hCG in serum and urine. Users are instructed to transfer 3 drops of urine or serum to the specimen well. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (specific for the beta subunit of hCG and labeled with colloidal gold particle) found in the conjugated pad dissolve and migrate with the urine. If hCG is present in the urine, it binds to the mouse

monoclonal antibody. This complex is captured by the goat anti-hCG alpha subunit polyclonal antibody embedded at the test line. When a sufficient number of complexes have been captured at the test line, a pink to red-colored line becomes visible.

Any mouse monoclonal antibody not bound to hCG will continue past the test line and will be captured by goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies found at the control region of the device. A colored line in the control region of the device indicates adequate sample volume and capillary action. Absence of a colored line in the control region is an indication of an invalid result. Users are instructed to read the device at 3 minutes (for urine) or 5 minutes (for serum).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: See “Detection limit” below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Male urine pools were spiked with hCG to concentrations ranging from $5 0 0 -$ $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ to determine if there was a decrease in signal with increasing analyte concentration. Urine results were read at 3 and 10 minutes; serum results were read at 5 and 10 minutes. All specimens obtained the expected result.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The Innovacon hCG Ultra Test device is standardized against the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ International Standard for chorionic gonadotropin 75/589.

# d. Detection limit:

To assess the reproducibility and detection limit of the assay, the sponsor spiked hCG into serum and urine samples from known non-pregnant participants. Trained technicians at four Physician’s Office and Laboratory (POL) sites performed the testing over three days with devices from three different lots. The results are as follows:

In addition to establishing the cut-off value for the device, analysis of the study results showed there is no significant difference in the results obtained at the four different sites.

e. Analytical specificity:

The device was tested and found to be non-reactive to negative serum and urine specimens spiked with Luteinizing Hormone (hLH at $3 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L } )$ ), Follicle Simulating Hormone (hFSH at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (hTSH at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ). Similarly, none of the hCG positive urine and serum samples spiked with LH, FSH and TSH at the concentrations above yielded a negative result at read times.

Commonly found substances (prescription, OTC, chemical and biological analytes) were spiked into a male serum pool (containing 0 and 10 mIU/mL hCG) and a male urine pool (containing 0 and $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG). Samples were tested in triplicate. Urine samples were read as positive or negative at 3 and 10 minutes. Serum samples were read at 5 and 10 minutes. The presence of these substances did not affect the test results.

In addition, the sponsor investigated the effect of urinary $\mathsf { p H }$ (ranging from $\mathsf { p H } 4 . 0 - 9 . 0 $ ) and urine specific gravity (ranging from 1.003 – 1.036) on the performance of this device. There was no variation from the expected results.

f. Assay cut-off:

The sponsor claims a cutoff of $1 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG for serum and $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG for urine.
