# Intended Use of Device:

AxSYM HoloTC assay is a Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) for the quantitative determination of holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) in human serum and plasma on the AxSYM System. HoloTC is used as an aid in thc diagnosis and treatment of vitamin $\mathrm { B } _ { 1 2 }$ deficiency.

The AxSYM HoloTC Standard Calibrators are for the standard calibration of the AxSYM System when used for the quantitative determination of holotranscobalmin (HoloTC) in human serum and plasma.

The AxSYM HoloTC Controls are for the use in quality control to monitor the accuracy and precision of the HoloTC assay when used for the quantitative determination of holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) in human serum and plasma on the AxSYM System.

# Description of Device:

AxSYM HoloTC is based on Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) technology. The AxSYM HoloTC reagents and sample are pipetted in the following sequcnce:

# SAMPLING CENTER

Sample and all AxSYM HoloTC reagents required for one test are pipetted by the Sampling Probc into various wells of a Reaction Vessel (RV). A reaction mixturc is formed by combining diluted sample and microparticles coated with Anti-HoloTC monoclonal antibody in the sample well of the RV. • When human HoloTC antigen is present in the sample, it binds to the coated microparticles, forming antigen-antibody complexes on the microparticles. The Anti-TC Antibody:Alkaline Phosphatasc Conjugate is pipetted into a second well of the RV. The HoloTC Wash Buffer is pipctted into a third well of the RV. The Matrix Cell Wash is pipetted into a fourth wcll of the RV.

The RV is immediately transferred into the Processing Center. Further pipetting is done in the Processing Center by the Processing Probe.

# PROCESSING CENTER

An aliquot of the reaction mixture, containing microparticles and bound antigenantibody complcx, is transferred to the Matrix Cell. The microparticles bind irreversibly to the glass fiber matrix. The Matrix Cell is washcd to remove materials not bound to the microparticles. The Anti-TC Antibody:Alkaline Phosphatase Conjugatc is dispensed onto the Matrix Cell and it binds with the antigen-antibody complexes. The Matrix Cellis washed to remove conjugate not bound to the microparticles. The substratc, 4-Methylumbelliferyl Phosphatc, is added to the Matrix Ccll. The alkaline phosphatase-labcled conjugate catalyzes the removal of a phosphate group from the substrate, yiclding the fluorcscent product, 4-Methylumbelliferone. This fluorescent product is measured by the MEIA optical assembly.

# Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The AxSYM HoloTC assay is a Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) for the quantitative determination of HoloTC in human serum and plasma. The Axis-Shield HoloTC RIA is a competitive binding radioassay which uses a specific transcobalamin antibody to capture transcobalamin from the patient sample. The vitamin B12 bound to the captured transcobalamin is then measured by procedures commonly used in vitamin B12 assays.

# Summary of Non-Clinical Performance:

The AxSYM HoloTC assay is substantially cquivalcnt to thc Axis-Shield HoloTC RIA radioassay in terms of precision, linearity, interferences and stability as demonstrated in non-clinical performance data in this $5 1 0 ( \mathbf k )$ submission.

# Summary of Clinical Performance:

The AxSYM HoloTC assay demonstrated substantially equivalent performance to the Axis-Shield HoloTC RIA radioassay indicated by a mcthod comparison with a corrclation coefficient of 0.90.

Dear Dr. Conway:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
