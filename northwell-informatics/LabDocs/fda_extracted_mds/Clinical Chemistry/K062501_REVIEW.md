# I. Device Description:

VALIDATE Thyroid Calibration Verification Test Set contains T3, T4, human TSH, and Cortisol in human serum matrix. Multiple levels are provided to establish the relationship between theoretical and actual performance of each of the included analytes. Each test set consists of one bottle each of six (6) levels including zero. Each bottle of Levels 0 through 5 contains 3.0 milliliters. This material is stable until the date printed on the label when stored as directed.

All human source material was tested and found to be negative for $\mathrm { H I V } \%$ , HBsAg, and RPR by FDA approved methods.
