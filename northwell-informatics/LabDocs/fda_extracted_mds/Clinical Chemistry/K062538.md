# Description of Device:

The EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System is designed to provide an easy, accurate method for determining capillary blood glucose values. This analysis is based on amperometric technology using glucose oxidase that is specific for the blood glucose measurement. When the blood sample is applied to the test strip, electrons are formed by the reaction between glucose oxidase and blood glucose. The electrical current is measured by the meter and correlates with the concentration of glucose in the blood sample.

The EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Meter, Test strips with instructions, Lancing device with instructions, Lancets, Code card, 3-Volt Lithium Coin Battery, Users Guide, Log Book, Carrying case and EASY CHECK Control Solutions (level 1 and level 2)

# Comparison of Device Technological Characteristics to Predicate Device:

EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System and ASCENSIA ELITE DIABETES CARE SYSTEM are similar in many respects. Among other similarities, they use the same detection method, enzyme, mediator and basic electrode material.

Differences include the Hematocrit range, temperature range, test time and sample volume. Tests included in this 510(k) submission have incorporated these changes and results show that they introduce no new questions on the safety and effectiveness of the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

# Intended Use:

The EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger and from the following alternative sites: the palm and the forearm. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes mellitus at home and healthcare facilities as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control program. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus, and is not intended for use on neonates.

# Non-Clinical Testing:

Sensitivity, precision, linearity and other tests were used to demonstrate the performance and reliability of EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Meter also passed appropriate EMC requirements.

# Clinical Testing:

Consumer (field) testing was done to prove that the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System is easy to use by lay people and also that test results are accurate and comparable to a laboratory reference method and to the predicate device.

# Conclusion:

Detailed testing has confirmed that the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device and that the differences do not bring up any new safety or effectiveness concerns.

Re: k062538 Trade/Device Name: Easy Check Blood Glucose Monitoring System and Easy Check Glucose Control Solution Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose test system. Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: NBW, CGA, JJX Dated: April 2, 2007 Received: April 3, 2007

Dear Mr. Mathur:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and Parts 800 to 895.
