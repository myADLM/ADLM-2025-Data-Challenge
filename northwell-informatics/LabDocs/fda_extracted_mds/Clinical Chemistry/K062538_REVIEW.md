# L. Test Principle:

The Test Principal of this device is based on amperometric technology using glucose oxidase. When the blood sample is applied to the test strip, electrons are formed by the reaction between glucose oxidase and blood glucose. The electrical current is measured by the meter and correlates with the concentration of glucose in the blood sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Two different lots of EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Test Strips were tested to assess the precision and repeatability of the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System using venous whole blood concentrations between 30 and $3 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (spiked samples). Blood samples were collected from healthy donors into tubes that contained heparin. Ten different meters were tested for 20 days with 2 runs per day. The coefficient of variation for one lot of the test strips is shown below:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was performed using oxygenated venous blood supplemented with $50 \%$ aqueous glucose solution to provide samples at eleven different blood glucose levels $2 5 { - } 3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $4 0 { \cdot } 6 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , 120-130 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $1 8 0 { - } 1 9 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $2 4 0 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $3 0 0 { - } 3 2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } , 3 7 0 { - } 3 9 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $4 5 0 { - } 4 7 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $5 2 0 { - } 5 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $6 0 0 { - } 6 2 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and $6 7 0 { - } 7 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ). Two glucose meters and two different lots of test strips were used and ran in duplicate. YSI glucose analyzer as a standard reference instrument was used for validation. The linear regression was as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 2 8 3 \mathbf { x } - 4 . 9 2 0 1 , \mathbf { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 2 .
$$

![](images/4de2584eacb4a50e33bead7b18b31e7c2871db81b55eb58532252e235e3375ab.jpg)

The sponsor claimed that the linearity range of the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 30 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

There is no calibration required to perform the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System test; however, a lot specific code card is provided with each box of the EASY CHECK glucose test strips. Calibrations were done inhouse and parameters were coded into the code card. The user must check and make sure that the code number printed on the code card matches the code number on the test strip vial and that it also matches the code number in the EASY CHECK glucose meter before testing.

The EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST SRM 917b reference material.

The value assignment of the EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solutions was determined by an in-house procedure. The range of the control solutions was determined by running multiple runs of the control solutions on the EASY CHECK glucose meters. For control solution level 1, range was set at mean $\pm$ $2 5 \%$ of the average value. For control solution level 2, range was set at mean $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the average value.

Accelerated stability and real time stability of the EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solutions were performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the EASY CHECK glucose control solutions, respectively. The sponsor claimed that the shelf-life of the EASY CHECK glucose control solutions is 12 months when stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ and the open-vial stability is 60 days after opening when stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ .

EASY CHECK glucose test strips shelf-life is 18 months and open-vial stability is 60 days after opening when stored at $2 { - } 3 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

See Precision at $3 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and linearity/reportable range studies above.

e. Analytical specificity:

i.) An interference study was conducted to determine the effect of select endogenous and exogenous substances. The following 7 exogenous and 3 endogenous substances were tested: acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, dopamine, ibuprofen, L-Dopa, tetracycline, tolutamide, cholesterol, creatinine and uric acid. Stock solutions of the above chemicals were prepared and spiked into the tested pool sample with different concentrations. The $\%$ bias was calculated based on the differences between the spiked sample and the control pool sample. The sponsor claimed a bias of $\leq 1 6 \%$ for all the interferents tested.

The sponsor claimed that the therapeutic levels of L-dopa or dopamine may result in inaccurate glucose readings with the system. Interference was also observed in samples with high ascorbic acid and uric acid. This information is also provided in the limitation section of the package insert.

ii.) A hematocrit study was performed to evaluate the hematocrit variation effect of the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Oxygenated venous blood sample with 9 different Hct levels (20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60, 65, $70 \%$ ) were prepared. Five different glucose concentrations of oxygenated venous blood concentrations (30, 70, 150, 260, $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were prepared. The data showed that hematocrit levels outside of $30 \% { - } 5 0 \%$ range may cause inaccurate test results.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device and reference method:

Two hundred sixty people with diabetes performed a fingerstick test using the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose System. A healthcare professional then performed the test on the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose System, the Bayer

System (predicate device) and the YSI analyzer (reference method). The range of glucose values for these samples was $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 5 0 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (YSI). The linear regressions were as follows:

Patient’s results on EASY CHECK (Y) vs YSI (X):

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 6 8 1 \mathrm { X } + 5 . 6 0 4 3 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 7 3 4
$$

Healthcare professional’s results on EASY CHECK (Y) vs YSI (X):

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 6 4 3 \mathrm { X } + 5 . 7 9 1 5 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 7 8 2
$$

Based on the ISO Standard 15197 document, how well the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System compared with the laboratory method was shown in the table below:

<table><tr><td>For glucose results lower than 75 mg/dL, the percent (and number) of meter results that match the laboratory method within 15 mg/dL:</td><td>(33/33) 100%</td></tr><tr><td>For glucose results at or higher than 75 mg/dL, the percent (and number) of meter results that match the laboratory method within 20%:</td><td>(215/227) 95%</td></tr></table>

Note: When meter results are compared to the laboratory results, results below $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ are compared in $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

Alternative testing sites : palm and forearm testing has been performed by the patients and the healthcare professionals to show comparable performance at times of steady state conditions with regard to accuracy at the finger site in comparison to the YSI (reference method). The range of glucose values for these samples was $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 5 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (by the finger). The linear regressions were as follows:

Patient’s palm (Y) vs patient’s finger (X):

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 9 2 1 \mathrm { X } + 5 . 3 7 1 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 7 8 4
$$

Patient’s forearm (Y) vs patient’s finger (X):

$$
\mathrm { Y } = 0 . 9 5 7 6 \mathrm { X } + 5 . 2 8 6 1 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 6 9 7
$$

Testing on palm and forearms- The following important notes are listed in the package insert:

Consult your healthcare professional before you begin using the palm or forearm for testing.   
Under certain conditions, blood glucose test results obtained using samples taken from your palm or forearm may differ significantly from fingertip samples. Do not use palm or forearm testing when your blood glucose is changing rapidly such as following a meal, an insulin dose, or associated with physical exercise.

5. Calibration:

Lot Specific adjusted calibration with pre-set test strip code number.

6. Quality Control:

Two levels of control solutions are provided by the sponsor.

To Run Glucose Control Solution Test:

The EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solutions are used as a quality control check to make sure that the EASY CHECK Blood Glucose Meter and the EASY CHECK Glucose Test Strips are working correctly. Each EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solution is intended for use only with the EASY CHECK Glucose Test Strips. A control solution test is performed the same way that a blood glucose test is performed except control solution is used in place of a blood drop. The control solution test confirms that the meter and test strips are working correctly. The control solution test results should fall within the range of results printed on the vial label of the control.

Each EASY CHECK Glucose Control Solution should produce results that fall within the range of results printed on the vial label of the control being used. If the control solution test result is outside the range (is either higher or lower), the EASY CHECK Glucose Meter and test strip may not be working as a system.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Humidity testing was performed and the sponsor claimed that the EASY CHECK BGMS is not affected by humidity between $20 \%$ to $80 \%$ .   
2. Glucose meter operating temperature was evaluated and the sponsor claimed that the EASY CHECK BGMS can get the same acceptable reading from $1 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ to $4 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ .   
3. Glucose meter storage temperature was evaluated and the sponsor claimed that the EASY CHECK glucose meter can be stored between $- \dot { 2 } 0 { } ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ to $5 0 ^ { 0 } \mathrm { C }$ .   
4. A sample volume sensitivity study was performed and the sponsor claimed that there is no significant bias for sample volumes between $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ to $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ .   
5. Altitude testing was not performed; therefore, the sponsor has a limitation that the system can only be used at sea-level in the package insert.
