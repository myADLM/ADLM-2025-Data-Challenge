4. Device description

The Olympus TSH assay is a two-step paramagnetic particle enzyme immunoassay. It is based on the sandwich principle and used to quantitate TSH in serum/plasma.

The Olympus TSH assay reagent and sample are added to the assay cuvette in the following sequence:

1. Samples are incubated first with a monoclonal anti-TSH antibody bound to paramagnetic particles.   
2. After a washing step, a second monoclonal anti-TSH antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase is added. The TSH reacts with the paramagnetic particles and the conjugated antibody to form a sandwich complex. Washing steps remove the unbound material.   
3. The chemiluminescent substrate is added to the assay cuvette and reacts with the bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Light generated by the reaction is measured by the luminometer. The light emission is proportional to the quantity of TSH in the sample.   
4. Results are calculated from a pre-defined calibration curve. The Olympus AU3000i system automatically calculates the TSH concentration of each sample in mIU/L or $\mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

5. Intended use

The Olympus thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of TSH levels in human serum and plasma using the Olympus $\mathsf { A U 3 0 0 0 i r m }$ Immunoassay System.

Measurements of TSH produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of thyroid or pituitary disorders.

The Olympus TSH Calibrator is used for calibrating the quantitative Olympus TSH Assay on the Olympus AU3000i Immunoassay System.

The Olympus TSH Control is used for quality control of the Olympus TSH test system on the Olympus AU3000i Immunoassay System.

The Olympus AU3000i Immunoassay System is a chemiluminescent discrete photometric chemistry analyzer for the quantitative determination of analytes in human serum and plasma.

The following tables compare the Olympus TSH Test System with the Roche Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ TSH Test System.

Dear Mr. Davis:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use statcd in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial cquivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, pernits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requircments to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under he Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-frec number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Intemet address
