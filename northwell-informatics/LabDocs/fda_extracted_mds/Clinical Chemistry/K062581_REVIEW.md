# L. Test Principle:

The Olympus TSH assay is a two-step paramagnetic particle enzyme immunoassay. It is based on the sandwich principle and used to quantitate TSH in serum/plasma.

The Olympus TSH assay reagent and sample are added to the assay cuvette in the following sequence:

1. Samples are incubated first with a monoclonal anti-TSH antibody bound to paramagnetic particles.   
2. After a washing step, a second monoclonal anti-TSH antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase is added. The TSH reacts with the paramagnetic particles and the conjugated antibody to form a sandwich complex. Washing steps remove the unbound material.   
3. The chemiluminescent substrate is added to the assay cuvette and reacts with the bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Light generated by the reaction is measured by the luminometer. The light emission is proportional to the quantity of TSH in the sample.   
4. Results are calculated from a pre-defined calibration curve. The Olympus AU3000i system automatically calculates the TSH concentration of each sample in mIU/L or $\mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision was determined using pooled human sera according to CLSI protocol EP5-A: 2 per day for 20 days $( \mathrm { n } { = } 8 0 )$ ).

Four human serum samples in the range of 0.459 to $1 3 4 . 8 3 5 \mathrm { \ m I U / L }$ of TSH were diluted and assayed. The recoveries ranged from $8 6 . 0 1 ~ \%$ to $1 0 4 . 5 7 \ \%$ with a mean of $9 3 . 6 8 ~ \%$ . Therefore, the Olympus TSH assay can recover diluted analyte in serum within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the total mean.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The TSH calibrator is traceable to the WHO $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ International Standard 81/565. The calibration material is prepared by creating a master calibrator from the reference material and bovine serum matrix in which the value assignment is verified with 1 instrument, 3 runs, 6 replicates per run. Lot specific master curve and calibrator value assignment are determined on 1 instrument, 3 runs, 15 replicates per run. Once open, the calibrator is stable at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 28 days, and unopened until the stated expiration date which is validated with ongoing real time stability studies.

The TSH Control target concentration range is set at the euthroid/hyperthyroid threshold. Value assignments are determined on 3 instruments, 3 runs, 3 days, 5 replicates per run. Once open, the control is stable at $2 { - } 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 28 days and unopened until the stated expiration date which is validated with ongoing real time stability studies.

# d. Detection limit:

Analytical Sensitivity The lowest detectable level on an Olympus AU3000i analyzer was calculated as $0 . 0 0 0 2 \mathrm { m I U / L }$ . The lower end of the measuring range for this device was

determined to be $0 . 0 0 1 \mathrm { m U / L } .$ .

The lowest detectable level represents the lowest measurable level of TSH that can be distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the absolute mean plus two standard deviations of 20 replicates of an analyte free sample.

Functional sensitivity   
The functional sensitivity on an Olympus AU3000i analyzer was calculated as $0 . 0 0 1 3 ~ \mathrm { m I U / L }$ .

The functional sensitivity is the lowest TSH concentration that can be measured reproducibly with an interassay CV of $20 \%$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical Specificity   
The following cross-reactivities have been determined for the assay by adding a pre-defined amount of potential cross-reactants to a human sample.   
The AU3000i TSH assay has no significant cross reactivity with the following substances, at the concentration levels listed.

• FSH - $\leq 1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ • LH - $\leq 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ • hCG - ≤ 500,000 mIU/mL

Interfering Substances

Results of studies conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the method to interference were as follows:

Icterus: Interference less than $10 \%$ up to $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (or $6 8 4 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ) bilirubin. Hemolysis: Interference less than $5 \%$ up to $5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L }$ hemoglobin Lipemia: Interference less than $3 \%$ up to $1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ Intralipid $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Rheumatoid factor: No significant interference up to $2 0 1 0 \mathrm { I U / m L }$ of rheumatoid factor. f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Patient serum/plasma samples were used to compare the Olympus TSH assay on the Olympus AU3000i analyzer against another commercially available TSH assay using CLSI protocol EP9-A. Results of regression by PassingBablok analysis were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Range of concentrations[mlU/L]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept[mlU/L]</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>127</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.005 - 136.630</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.0046</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.935</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9931</td></tr></table>

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

Serum verses plasma study was carried out by collecting blood from at least 10 donors into various blood collection tubes and measuring the TSH concentration in each. The blood collection tubes tested were serum, EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin plasma.

The mean results from each tube were compared by using a paired t-test $( 9 5 \%$ confidence interval) and $\%$ bias.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Collection Tubes</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>T-TestNullHypothesis</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean % Bias</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum vs. Li-H</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Accepted</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N/A</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum vs. EDTA</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Rejected</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-3.7%</td></tr></table>

The t-test showed no statistical difference between serum and lithium heparin plasma. In accordance with the procedures no further analysis was necessary and lithium heparin plasma was accepted as a suitable sample type.

The t-test showed a statistical difference between serum and EDTA plasma. The sponsor determined that the mean $\%$ bias between these matrices $( - 3 . 7 \% )$ was acceptable because it was lower that their predetermined total allowable error for the TSH assay $( 2 4 . 6 \% )$ .
