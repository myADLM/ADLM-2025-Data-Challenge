Proprietary Name: Cardiac Markers Control and Calibration Verification Set

Common Name: Cardiac Markers Control and Calibration Verifier Controls

Classification Name: Multi Analyte Controls, All Kinds (assayed and unassayed)75 JJy

Substantial Equivalence:

The Compass Bioscience Cardiac Markers Control and Calibration Verification Set are supplied liquid in three or 4 levels and consist of a human plasma matrix containing preservatives to which reagent grade chemicals and human source antigens and enzymes have been added at different concentrations to ahive he levels.Assayed values are determined fromin house and interaboratory data

The Compass Bioscience controls and calibration verifiers are substantially equivalent to other such controls and verifiers in general use, such as the Triage® Profiler S.O.B.™ (Shortness of Breath) Control and the Triage® Profiler S.O.B.™ (Shortness of Breath) Calibration Verification Controls which are supplied liquid in a two level control set and five level caliration verifiation et as a umn EDTA plasma matrix with human source constituents and pure chemicals added by the manufacturer.

# Description:

Compass Bioscience Cardiac Markers Controls are supplied in three levels, $2 \times 1 ~ m L$ each level per box and as a four Level Calibration Verification set, $2 \times 1$ ml each level per box. The controls are supplied as a ready-to-use frozen liquid, requiring no reconstitution or dilution.They are prepared in a human EDTA plasma matrix fortified to target levels with human source material and reagent grade chemicals added at different concentrations to achieve the levels. Sodium Azide ${ < } 0 . 1 \%$ has been added as preservative to inhibit microbial growth.

# Intended Use:

The Compass Bioscience Cardiac Markers Controls are intended for use as quality control materials to assess the accuracy and precision of assay procedures for the analytes included in the control.The Compass Bioscience Cardiac Marker Calibration Verification Set is used to verify the calibration of various test methods over the measurable range of the test.

# Technological Characteristics Compared to Predicate Devices:

The Compass Bioscience control products employ a similar matrix and constituent formulation to the euivalent predicate device listed above: human plasma matrix fortified with human source material,

The closed vial stability claim made for this product is 1 year when stored at $- 2 0 ^ { \circ } \subset$ ,based on acceleratedstabiliy studes.e Cardiac Markers control was st $2 . 8 \%$ to simulate 1 year storage $\mathfrak { - 2 0 \circ } \mathtt { C }$ An increase or decrease of $> 1 0 \%$ of analyte recovery compared to the initial test value $\pm$ the highest allowable instrument/reagent imprecision was used as the analyte failure criterion for determining shelf-life. Real time stability testing is ongoing on multiple lots of product.

The closed and opened vial stability claim for this product when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \complement$ is 30 days for CK-MB and Myoglobin and 14 days for Troponin I and BNP. Real time testing was used to determine the closed and open vial refrigerated shelf life. The Cardiac Markers Control was stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \textsf { C }$ and the vrysday was mesu  ntervals  daysThe proct pas sabiliy  reovy was within $\pm ( 1 0 \% + \% \mathrm { C V } _ { \mathrm { m e t h o d } } )$ after 44 days of storage at $2 - 8 \%$ .

# Assayed Values

Assay values for the package inserts were established from assays performed in the Compass Bicence laboratory using three Triage® MeterPlus readers with the Triage® Profiler S.O.B. Panel ,heTrige®Cardorofera an herige®Cardac nel n rom ntbtyat usig instrument manufacturers'reagents. Mean values or the listed lots of controls were calculated from multiple instruments and reagent lots available at the time of assay. Ranges were determined based on 2 SD - 3SD of the overall mean values from stability and interlaboratory data.

Dear Ms. Johnson:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The geneal contros provisions  the Ac include requiements oranual registration, listg o devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
