This product may be used for proficiency testing in interlaboratory surveys and to perform CLIA directed calibration verification for these same analytes with similar reagents on similar instrumentation in accordance with current CLIA-88 guidelines and regulations.

In addition, level A-E of this product may be used as unassayed quality control material for these analytes or as an assayed quality control material for the analyzer systems specified in the package insert. It is not intended to be used as an assayed quality control material for any other analyzer systems.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements:

This device may be used as an assayed quality control material only for the instrument system specified in the package insert.

# I. Device Description:

The Audit MicroCV Immunoassay Linearity Set is a human and bovine serum albumin based, lyophilized, five level set of QC material, with each level containing 17 analytes and a preservative. Level A is near the lower limit of instruments and Level E is near the upper limit of instruments. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not Applicable

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The Audit™ MicroCV™ Immunoassay Linearity Set is prepared such that the analyte concentrations are equidistant across levels $\mathbf A - \mathbf E$ , with Level A containing the lowest concentrations and Level E the highest concentrations. A linearity study was performed for each analyte by measuring all five levels and calculating an $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value and comparing the measured value of each control level to the target value assigned to each level during the value assignment process (see Value Assignment below). The $\mathtt { R } ^ { 2 }$ value and the measured vs. target values met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria for each analyte.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The base matrix consists of human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, and preservatives. The analytes are derived from both human and non-human sources and were obtained from commercial vendors. The low and high level analytes were adjusted to within the desired target range of each assay. The remaining 3 points are dilutions of the low and high levels.

# Shelf Life Stability

The sponsor’s unopened bottle shelf life stability claim is two years from the date of manufacture. All analytes were placed on heat stress stability in closed bottles at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and tested on day 0 and day 20. The sponsor supplied a Heat Stress Stability Prediction chart that allowed an analyte heat stressed for 17.5 days at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to predict two year stability at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After 20 days at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ all analytes met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for deviation from day 0. Real time stability studies are on going to support the accelerated studies.

# Reconstituted Stability

The sponsor claims the reconstituted control is stable for 5 days when stored tightly capped at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . All analytes were reconstituted on day 0 and stored in tightly capped bottles at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for five days. All analytes were tested on day 0 and day 5 and met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for deviation from day 0.

# Value Assignment

Each analyte was measured multiple times and the mean value of each analyte was used to establish target values at each level. The target ranges were calculated $a \mathbf { s } \pm 2 0 \%$ of the target value. These values are only applicable for the instrument specified for each analyte in the Instructions for Use.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable
