# 2.2. Safety and Effectiveness Information

Predicate Device:   
Cam   
Glucose Monitoring System (K011233)

Device Description: Based on an electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action, Gluco Track Blood Glucose Monitoring System only needs a small amount of blood. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and your blood glucose result is precisely and displayed in 6 seconds.

# Intended Use:

The Gluco Track Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the qantitativemeasurement glucosein resh capillary, fgerstick wholeblood Testing is done outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for both lay use by people with diabetes and in a clinical setting by health care professionals, as an aid to monitoring levels in Diabetes Mellitus.

# Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

Pre-clinical and clinical data are employed upon submission of this 510(K) premarket notification according to the Guidance Document for In Vitro Diagnostic Test System; Guidance for Industry and FDA document provided by CDRH/ FDA.

# Substantial Equivalence (SE)

A claim of substantial equivalence is made to GlucoSure Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K011233). Both of them have the same working principle and technologies. The differences are meter dimension, weight, power voltage, memory data number, date and time setting, auto recall the 7, 14 and 30 days average and some other user friendly designs on meter. As n  e  spo to the safety or effectiveness aspects. They are substantially equivalent.

Dear Dr. Jen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
