Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent Homocysteine Reagent Urinary Homocystine (Nonquantitative) Test System

# Device Description:

The Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent will consist of two (2) reagents plus calibrators. The first reagent (LS-R1) will include Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase (LDH), Serine, and B-Nicotinamide Adenine Di-Nucleotide reduced Di-Sodium Salt (NADH) with buffers and stabilizers. The fill volume will be 30 to $5 0 \mathrm { m L }$ , depending on the kit configuration.

The second reagent (LS-R2) will include Cystathionine B-Synthase (CBS) and Cystathionine B-Lyase (CBL) enzymes with buffers and stabilizers. The fill volume will be $7 \mathrm { m L }$ for all kit configurations.

The calibrators will include two (2) bottles; Calibrator "A" will be $0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l e s / L }$ and Calibrator "D" will be $2 5 { - } 3 0 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { m o l e s } / \mathrm { L }$ . The fill volume for the calibrators will be 3 mL.

Intended Use:

Intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of total homocysteine in serum and plasma.

Similarities include: Intended use, methodology, specimen type, calibration requirements, and performance. Differences include: Modification of formulation-to improve reagent stability of R1 as compared to when Reagent R1A is mixed with Reagent R1B to give R1 in the Homocysteine Enzymic Homocysteine Reagent.

Conclusion based on similarities and differences: Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent is substantially equivalent to the Homocysteine Enzymic Homocysteine Reagent.

Dear Mr. Kawasaki:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0484.
