# 3. NAME OF DEVICE:

Trade Name: Common Names/Descriptions: Classification Names:

DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System Blood Glucose Monitoring System Glucose test system, product code 75CGA and "System, test, blood glucose, over the counter", product code 75NBW, 21 CFR 862.1345

# 4 DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System designed by Tyson Bioresearch Inc., an amperometric biosensor, are adopted for its ease of use, its ability to process accurate results utilizing only a small volume of blood, and its quick response time. DIACHEX device provides a convenient and safe monitoring system for diabetes health care professionals, hospitals and most importantly, people with diabetes.

The DIACHEX Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the DIACHEX Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip. When the edge of the DIACHEX Test Strip is touched to a drop of blood, the test strip draws the blood into the sample chamber and the glucose reading is displayed on the meter after 10 seconds. The test measures glucose from 20 mg/dL (1.1mmol/L) to $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (33.3 mmol/L). The DIACHEX Test Strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow the comparison of results with laboratory methods.

# 5. INTENDED USE:

The DIACHEX Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the DIACHEX Blood Glucose Meter for quantitatively measuring glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip. The DIACHEX Test Strips are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the home and in professional settings to monitor blood glucose levels.

# TEST PRINCIPLE

The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase. Glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid and electrons are produced from the reaction. The electrons are then trapped by a chemical mediator, potassium ferricyanide. Once the enzymatic reaction is complete, a potential is provided by the meter for a further electrochemical reaction in order to generate a current from the release of trapped electrons. This current is then measured and correlated to the glucose concentration in the whole-blood sample. The DIACHEX Test Strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow easy comparison of results with laboratory methods.

# 7. PREDICATE DEVICE:

Predicate device name(s): EZ Smart - 168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Predicate $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ number(s): k052818

Comparison with predicate:

The Tyson Bioresearch Inc. DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System in this submission is equivalent to the Tyson Bioresearch Inc. EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System previously cleared under (k052818). DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an amendment to the EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K052818). This amendment addresses only small changes on the meter size, appearance, memory capacity, date, time and 14days average testing result. All main internal electronic components and meter functions remain as same as the EZ Smart-168

Blood Glucose Meter. DIACHEX Test Strip also identical to the EZ Smart-168 Test Strip, only the size changed for more convenient use. Fundamental scientific technology of the DIACHEX device has not changed.

# Substantial Equivalence Comparison:

The Tyson Bioresearch Inc. DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System in this submission is equivalent to the Tyson Bioresearch Inc. EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System previously cleared under (k052818). The table below lists the similarities and differences between the Predicate and Proposed device.

# 8. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTIC SUMMARY

Based on the above information, we know the subject device, DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System, and the predicate device have the same functioning principle and using the same technologies. The detection ranges for both devices are similar. HCT ranges are the same. The strip storage environments and the operating temperature are similar.

The differences between DIACHEX from EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System are meter dimension, weight, memory capacity, 14 days average result, date and time display, all internal electrical architectures and main electronic components as well as product functions and features remain unchanged. DIACHEX Test Strip is also identical to the EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, only the size changed for more convenient use. No physical changes of EZ Smart-168 Test Strips were made.

As we can see, the differences are due to the feature design aspects for more convenience use of the DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System, not relating to the safety or effectiveness aspects. Fundamental scientific technology of the DIACHEX device has not changed. DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the originally cleared EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K052818).

An evaluation of the DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System was conducted under various conditions including temperature effects, hematocrit levels, sensitivity and linearity. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that the DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System is equivalent in performance to the predicate device and suitable for its intended use.
