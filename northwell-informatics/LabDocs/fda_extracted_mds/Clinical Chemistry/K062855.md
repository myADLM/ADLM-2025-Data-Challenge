Date of Preparation of this Summary: September 18, 2006 Device Trade or Proprietary Name: Calcium Device Common/Usual Name or Classification Name: Calcium Classification Number/Class: Class II/ 862.1145 Product Code: CJY

This summary of 510(k) safety and effectiveness information is bcing submitted in accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

The assigned 510(k) number is: k 06 285.5

# Test Description:

Calcium is an in vitro diagnostic assay for thc quantitation of Calcium in human scrum, plasma, or urine. Arscnazo-II dye rcacts with calcium in an acid solution to form a blue-purple complex. The color developed is measured at 660 nm and is proportional to the calcium concentration in the sample.

# Substantial Equivalence:

The Calcium assay is substantially equivalent to the Abbott Calcium (K981578) on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System. Both assays yicld similar Performance Characteristics.

# Similarities:

Both assays are Arsenazo Dye Mcthodology. Both assays can bc used for the quantitation of Calcium. Both assays yicld similar results. Both assays use serum, plasma, and urine

# Differences:

# None

# Intended Use:

The Calcium assay is used for the quantitation of Calcium in human serum, plasma, or urine.

# Performance Characteristics:

Comparativc performancc studies wcre conducted using thc AEROSET and ARCHITECT c8000 Systcms. The Calcium assay, LN 3L79, method comparison yielded acceptable correlation with thc Abbott Calcium assay, LN 7D61, (K981578) on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ Systems (Predicate Device). The AEROSET System showcd a correlation cocfficient of 0.9993, slope of 0.96, and Y-intercept of $0 . 3 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum application and a correlation coefficient of 0.9994, slope of 0.95, and Y-interccpt of 0.17 mg/dL for the urine application when comparcd to the Predicate Device. The ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9989, slope of 0.96, and Y-intercept of 0.3 1 mg/dL for the serum application and a correlation coefficient of 0.9986, slope of 0.94, and Y-intercept of 0.17 mg/dL for the urine application when compared to the Predicate Device. The ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System showed a correlation cocfficient of 0.9979, slope of 1.00, and Y-intercept of $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the scrum application and a correlation coefficient of 0.9991, slope of 0.99, and Y-intercept of $0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the urine application when compared to the AEROSET System. The Calcium assay method comparison yielded acceptable correlation between the AEROSET System and the ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System.

Precision studies were conducted using the Calcium assay. On the AEROSET System, the total $\% C V$ for Level 1 is $1 . 0 1 \%$ , and Level 2 is $0 . 8 2 \%$ for the scrum application and the total %CV for Levcl 1 is 0.74%, and Level 2 is 0.65% for the urinc application. On the ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ System, the total $\% \mathrm { C V }$ for Level 1 is $1 . 2 3 \%$ , and Levcl 2 is $0 . 9 5 \%$ for the serum application and the total $\% C V$ for Level 1 is $0 . 7 2 \%$ , and Level 2 is $0 . 6 6 \%$ for the urinc application.

The Calcium assay is linear from 2 to $2 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the scrum and urinc applications. Thm qui viyalc is $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for the serum and urine applications.

These data demonstratc that the pcrformancc of the Calcium assay is substantially cquivalent to the performance of the Abbott Calcium assay, LN 7D61, (K981578) on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT Systems.

# Conclusion:

The Calcium assay on the AEROSET and the ARCHITECT c8000 Systems is substantially equivalent to the Abbott Calcium assay, LN 7D61, (K981578) on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT Systems as demonstrated by results obtained in the studies.

Dear Ms. Morris:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above)into either class II (Special Controls)or class II (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
