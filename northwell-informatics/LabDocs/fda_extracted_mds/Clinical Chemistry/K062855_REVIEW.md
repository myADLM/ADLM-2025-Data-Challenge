# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI Document EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline

CLSI Document EP9-A2: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Second Edition

# L. Test Principle:

Arsenazo-III dye reacts with calcium in an acid solution to form a blue-purple complex. The color developed is measured at $6 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and is proportional to the calcium concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Serum: the total precision as well as the precision for each component of variation (between-day, between-run, and within-run) was estimated in accordance with CLSI Document EP5-A. A minimum of two control levels at normal and abnormal analyte concentrations were tested. These controls were evaluated over 20 days, two runs per day, and two replicates per run. Precision was reported as the total percent CV.

Urine: five day precision studies were conducted on the AEROSET and ARCHITECT $c 8 0 0 0$ Systems in accordance with CLSI Document EP10-A. This study was intended to supplement data obtained from the twenty-day serum precision study and provides a limited assessment of the performance of the assay with the urine matrix. A minimum of two control levels at normal and abnormal analyte concentrations were tested. These controls were evaluated over five days, two runs per day, and five replicates per run. Precision was reported as the total $\% C V$ .

The precision of the Calcium assay is $\leq 3 \%$ total CV for serum and urine.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A minimum of nine samples at various concentrations spanning the desired linear range of the assay were run in a minimum of four replicates. At least one level was included which exceeded the desired linear range. The percent recovery for each sample was determined by dividing the mean observed result by the expected value. The sponsor’s acceptable difference between the observed result and expected value was within $\pm 5 \%$ $\mathrm { { o r } \pm 0 . 2 \mathrm { { m g } / \mathrm { { d L } } } }$ of the accepted values from 2 to $1 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 1 0 \%$ of expected values from 18 to $2 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum and urine.

Data generated indicate Calcium is linear from 2 to $2 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for both serum and urine matrices.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The reagent calibration stability was determined by the recovery method on multiple lots of Calcium reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh calibrators on Day 0. Control material and a prepared test sample near the linear high were analyzed on Day 0, 1, 7, 14, 15, 21, 29, 30, 31, and 33. The target for $\%$ recovery was 95 to $10 5 \%$ of the Day 0 results. All test points up to and including Day 33 met the target for $\%$ recovery. The resulting calibration stability claim is 30 days.

The reagent open onboard stability was determined by the recovery method on multiple lots of Calcium reagent. Fresh reagent was calibrated with fresh calibrators on Day 0. Control material and a prepared test sample near the linear high were analyzed on Day 0, 1, 7, 14, 15, 21, 29, 30, 31, and 33. All test points up to and including Day 33 met the target for $\%$ recovery. The open onboard stability claim is 30 days.

# d. Detection limit:

To determine the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ), test levels near the linear low for the Calcium assay were run in replicates of 10, on three instruments, two runs per instrument. The limit of quantitation is the concentration of analyte which has imprecision less than or equal to $20 \%$ CV. The Limit of Detection (LOD) testing for Calcium was performed using a study design based on CLSI protocol EP17-A. The LOQ and LOD for calcium were calculated to be 1.0 and $0 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , respectively. When marketed, the assay will report values down to $2 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as the default setting. However, the sponsor states that some customers may require the information on LOD and LOQ and therefore the sponsor has elected to leave this information in the labeling.

# e. Analytical specificity:

For serum samples, the sponsor evaluated the effects of bilirubin, hemoglobin, and Intralipid. For urine samples the sponsor evaluated the effects of acetic acid, ascorbate, boric acid, glucose, hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid, and protein. Human serum samples at the medical decision level of the analyte and urine samples were spiked with various levels of interferents. A minimum of four replicates of each interferent level and four replicates of reference sample were run. The percent recovery was determined by dividing the mean result of each interferent sample by the mean result of the reference sample. According to the sponsor, the level of interference was considered acceptable if there was no more than $\pm 5 \%$ difference between the interferent result and the reference result. Testing was performed using the AEROSET System.

The percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for serum samples containing $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin; $2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin; and $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Intralipid at Medical Decision Level 1 (7 to $8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and Medical Decision Level 2 (10 to $1 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The percent interference was within $\pm 5 \%$ difference for urine samples containing $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ascorbate, $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ boric acid, $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L } / \mathrm { d L }$ hydrochloric acid $( 6 \mathrm { N } )$ , and $5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ protein.

The percent interference was $> 1 0 \%$ difference for urine samples containing $6 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m L / d L }$ acetic acid (8.5 N) and $5 . 0 \mathrm { m L } / \mathrm { d L }$ nitric acid $( 6 \mathrm { N } )$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted in accordance with CLSI Document EP9-A2. As part of these studies, a total of 10 serum samples and 7 urine samples were spiked with calcium carbonate to generate high analytical levels. A linear regression analysis was performed comparing the results for each method with the following results:

Corr. Coeff. 0.9993

AEROSET vs. predicate device – urine

Forty-seven urine samples ranging from 2.2 to $2 5 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were run and compared using the new reagent vs. the predicate:

Slope 0.95   
Y-intercept 0.17   
Corr. Coeff. 0.9994

ARCHITECT vs. predicate device – serum

Slope 1.00   
Y-intercept 0.04   
Corr. Coeff. 0.9979

ARCHITECT vs. AEROSET – urine

Forty-seven urine samples ranging from 2.2 to $2 3 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were run and compared using the new reagent only:

Slope 0.99   
Y-intercept 0.00   
Corr. Coeff. 0.9991

# b. Matrix comparison:

To establish the compatibility of specimen collection tubes with the Calcium assay, fifteen samples were tested using each of the collection tubes to be evaluated. The serum tube used for the baseline was the glass tube; all other specimen tubes were plastic. The sponsor defined the acceptable differences as $\pm 5 \% 0 \mathrm { r } \pm 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ difference from the serum baseline tube, whichever is greater. Testing was performed using the AEROSET System. Using this criteria, comparability with the plain glass serum tube was observed for lithium heparin (Li Hep) (with or without gel barrier), sodium heparin (Na Hep), and Serum Separator Tubes (SST) for the Calcium assay.
