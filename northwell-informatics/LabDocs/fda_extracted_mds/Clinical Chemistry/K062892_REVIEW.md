# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See indication for use statement below.

2. Indication(s) for use:

The EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood. Testing is done outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by person with diabetes, or in clinical setting by health care professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.

The measurement of glucose in whole blood can be taken from the finger only, and this is not for neonatal use.

The EUKARE Blood Glucose Test Strips are intended to measure the glucose levels in whole blood with the EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System. It is suitable for persons with diabetes to monitor their blood glucose levels at home by themselves. The system can also be used at clinical sites by health care professionals to test the blood glucose levels of patients.

The EUKARE Blood Glucose Control Solution level I, level II, and level III are used as quality control material to verify the accuracy of the EUKARE/ EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System. If you are not sure about the strip quality or the previous storage condition, you are recommended to perform a quality control check. The control test results should always fall within the designed range listed on the box in use.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

T d he measurement of glucose in whole blood can be taken from the finger only, an th is is not for neonatal use.

T he EUKARE Blood Glucose Control Solution for use with EUKARE/EUSURE B lood Glucose Monitoring System only.

4. Special instrument requirements:

EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# I. Device Description:

The EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the EUKARE Blood Glucose Test Strips, control solutions, and the EUKARE blood

glucose meter. The sample is drawn into a small chamber on the strip based on capillary action. It will fill the chamber automatically and stop when it reaches the end of the chamber, so sample volume control is achieved.

# L. Test Principle:

The test principal is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase. The strip uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to produce a current that will stimulate a chemical reaction with ferricyanide. This reaction is measured by the meter and displayed as a blood glucose result.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed in the laboratory with EDTA venous whole blood. The blood glucose levels were adjusted to 5 different ranges by spiking the sample with glucose solution $( 2 0 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d l } )$ . Precision studies were conducted with ten EUKARE meters and 500 EUKARE/EUSURE strips for ten duplicates to obtain the following results $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 0 0$ per level). All of the tests were conducted within 30 minutes.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were conducted in accordance to CLSI guideline EP6-P. A venous whole blood sample was collected from a healthy person $\mathrm { ( H C T \sim }$ $42 \%$ ). Half of the collected sample was adjusted to about $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ with glucose stock solution. The other half of the collected sample was spiked to about $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ with glucose stock solution. Three intermediate concentrations were prepared by combining the two spiked initial samples. All five samples were measured by a YSI glucose analyzer for verification. The linear regression equation for the linear regression analysis of results from the EUKARE device and the YSI method was $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 6 \mathrm { x } { - } 0 . 2 5 7 1$ , $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 5$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Control materials are traceable to YSI standards which are traceable to NIST SRM #965a (Glucose in frozen human serum: 4 glucose levels). Real-time shelf life studies performed by the manufacturer indicate that control solutions and the unopened test strips have a shelf life of 18 months. Once the control solution or strip containers are opened, they have been shown to be stable for 3 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range is from 30 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (1.6 to $3 3 . 3 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L } \mathrm { \Omega }$ . If the blood glucose value is below $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ , “Lo” is displayed on the screen. If the blood glucose value is above $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ , “Hi” is displayed on the screen. See precision and linearity studies above for validation of the measuring range.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was conducted to determine the effect of endogenous and exogenous substances according to CLSI EP7-P. According to this study, the sponsor determined that acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, dopamine, bilirubin and uric acid may lead to inaccurate glucose readings with the EUKARE/EUSURE blood glucose monitoring system to the extent shown below. The sponsor also determined the sodium fluoride should not be used be used with the EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

Acetaminophen- will interfere with test results, each acetaminophen unit $\mathrm { ( m g / d l ) }$ will contribute about $3 . 8 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose for the EUKARE/EUSURE strip. The labeling contains a warning that patients taking acetaminophen should not use the meter.

Ascorbic Acid- levels lower than $1 . 5 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ will not affect the glucose reading of the device. However, levels higher than $2 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ will interfere with the EUKARE/EUSURE strip.

Dopamine-if a patient was treated with dopamine, the measurement results will be increased. The labeling contains a warning that patients taking dopamine should not use the meter.

Bilirubin- results up to $1 . 2 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ do not interfere.

Uric Acid- concentrations higher than $7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ will have an effect on measurements of EUKARE/EUSURE Blood Glucose Monitoring System for the normal uric acid users.

Sodium Fluoride will interfere with the EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring System. This system is for fresh capillary whole blood only.

Altitude Effect

Six glucose devices, controls (4 levels) and strips (3 lots) were tested at 5 altitudes (up to 3000 meters). No effect on performance was found when the 4 control solutions were tested up to 9842 feet (3000 meters). Higher elevations were not tested.

Hematocrit Effect

The effect of hematocrit variation on the EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring System was tested by comparing results of different whole blood samples with hematocrit values ranging from $60 \%$ to $20 \%$ (increments of $1 0 \%$ ). The samples were tested in replicates of four and the YSI 2300 Stat Plus served as the reference instrument. The sponsor used the ISO 15197 document system accuracy section to validate their high percent deviations from the average hematocrit $( 4 0 \% )$ values. The study supported a hematocrit range of 20 to $5 5 \%$ .

Temperature and Humidity Effect

The sponsor submitted data to support that the test system can be used between $5 6 . 3 ^ { \circ } - 9 8 . 6 ^ { \circ }$ degrees Fahrenheit ( $1 2 ^ { \circ }$ and $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and a relative humidity up to $93 \%$ .

$f .$ Assay cut-off:

Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A clinical investigation was conducted to evaluate the system accuracy of the EUKARE meter. 146 volunteer samples (6 were excluded due to high hematocrit levels) consisting of 126 real samples and 20 spiked samples to obtain higher values were tested with the EUKARE meter, EUSURE meter and compared to YSI values. The samples ranged from 71 to $4 9 8 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ and the hematocrit ranged from 34 to $5 5 \%$ . The agreement of the EUKARE capillary reading between the technician and lay user found that the lay user variability was less than $+ / - 2 0 \%$ of the technicians obtained values. The Error-Grid analysis to compare the capillary test result measured by EUKARE was plotted against the EUSURE reading obtained with the same volunteers’ samples. $9 8 \%$ of all the data fell within the Zone A acceptance area. The device was compared to YSI values and yielded the following regression equation:

$\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 4 1$ $\mathrm { N } { = } 1 4 6$

The sponsor also conducted a consumer questionnaire to investigate the consumers’ ability to understand the use of the EUKARE Blood Glucose Monitoring System and strips. The results revealed a consumer average usability score of $9 6 \%$ and a consumer’s ability to read and understand the insert had a score of $9 8 \%$ .
