Product name - Trade: Ahlstrom 226 specimen collection paper Common: Specimen collection paper

Classicationnamebes, vials, systes, seruseprators bloo co Class: II Product code: JKA Applicable CFR Section : 21 CFR 862.1675: Blood specimen collection device

Predicate device: Whatman Body Fluid Collection Paper: Whatman BFC 18. K932661

# Device description:

Ahlstrom 226 specimen collection paper is designed to provide a uniform surface for the collectn o blood sots.A drop oblod is appli to the filter paen allowed to soak through the paper.The sample is then air dried and sent to a laboratory for further analysis.

This specimen collection paper is made from 100 % pure cotton linters with no wetstrength additives added and conforms to the Recognized Consensus Standard NCCLS LA4-A3.

This device has 4 crucial performance characteristics that can be performed with lysed or intact red blood cells: blood absorption time, blood spot diameter, serum absorption volume, and homogeneity.

# Intended use:

The Ahlstrom 226 specimen collection paper is intended to be used as a medium to collect and transport blood specimen spots to a laboratory. The 226 paper will be in the format of a printed card that may be incorporated along with a tear-apart form for demographic information.

# Description of device design requirements:

Critical physical propertis during manufacturing are basis weight, $\mathsf { p H }$ and ash.

1) Manufactured from $100 \%$ pure cotton fiber with no wet strength additives.

Basis weight should be 110 lb $+ 1 - 5 \%$ per ream $( 1 7 9 \mathrm { g / m } ^ { 2 } + 1 . 5 \% )$ . A ream is defined as 500 sheets $2 4 ^ {  } \times 3 6 ^ { \circ }$ (ASTM D646-96).

The $\mathtt { p H }$ should be 5.7 to 7.5 (Test method ISO 6599:1981).

Ash $\%$ .. $0 . 1 \%$ maximum (Test method A of ASTM D586-97a).

Manufacturer's name and lot number are indicated on the filter paper portion of all specimen collection devices.

Printed devices contain at minimum the following information:

Infant's age (indicate if less than 24 hours; optional: include address and phone number)

Patient identification number (e.g., medical record number; optional: include address and phone number)

Birth weight

Submitter's identification and address (optional: include birth facility

Manufacturer and lot number of the filter paper indicated on the filter paper section, and manufacturer or printer listed on the patient information section of the form.

# Description of the test method used:

The test method used can be found in the Recognized Consensus Standard: NCCLS LA4-A3, Blood Collection on Filter Paper for Neonatal Screening Programs; Approved Standard  Third Edition (1997) from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The performance specifications in this document include:

Mean blood absorption time: Lysed red blood cells $= 5 - 3 0$ seconds Intact red blood cells $= 5 - 3 0$ seconds   
Mean blood-spot diameter: Lysed red blood cells $\asymp$ no range published Intact red blood cells $= 1 5 - 1 7 \mathrm { { m m } }$ E   
Mean serum-absorption volume: Lysed red blood cells $= 1 . 1 1 - 1 . 4 9 \mu \mathrm { L }$ Intact red blood cells $= 1 . 3 7 - 1 . 7 1 \mu \mathrm { L }$ EPY

# Lysed red blood cells $p > 0 . 0 5$ Intact red blood cells $\mathtt { p > 0 . 0 5 }$

Samples of three lots of Ahlstrom 226 specimen collection paper were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program (CDC) for evaluation using the NCCLS LA4-A3 standard applied to a solution of intact and/or lysed red blood cells. The CDC's report indicated that the parameters tested were within acceptable limits.

Additionally, samples from each of the lots of material tested by the CDC were sent to an independent testing laboratory for serum absorption volume and blood spot diameter testing following the same NCCLS standard. The purpose of this testing was to compare the results for absorption volume and blood spot diameter to the CDC results and to compare lots of material run at different times to ensure consistency over time. The results of this testing were also within acceptable limits.

# Labeling/Packaging:

Printed forms are to be packaged in a manner such that they will not become compressed. Chemicals or other types of specimens should not be packaged in the same container used for shipment of blood spot specimens.

# Conclusions:

The information provided in the pre-market notification demonstrates that Ahlstrom 226 Specimen Collection Paper is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. This equivalence was demonstrated through comparison of intended uses, physical properties, and specifications found in the Recognized Consensus Standard NCCLS LA4-A. The information supplied in the pre-market notification provides reasonable assurance that Ahlstrom 226 Specimen Collection Paper is safe and effective for the stated intended use.

Dear Ms. Mowers:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of October 19, 2007.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
