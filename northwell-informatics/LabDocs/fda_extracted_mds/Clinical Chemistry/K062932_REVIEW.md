4. Panel: 75 (Clinical Chemistry)

# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s):

Ahlstrom 226 specimen collection paper is intended to be used as a medium to collect and transport blood specimen spots to a laboratory. The 226 paper will be in the format of a printed card that may be incorporated along with a tear-apart form for demographic information.

2. Indication(s) for use: Refer to Intended Use above.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

Prescription use only.

4. Special instrument requirements: Not applicable.

# I. Device Description:

Ahlstrom 226 Specimen Collection Paper is made from $100 \%$ pure cotton linters and provides a uniform surface for the collection of blood spots. A drop of blood is applied to the filter paper and allowed to soak through the paper. The sample is then air dried and sent to a laboratory for analysis.

# J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name: Whatman Body Fluid Collection Paper

2. Predicate K number(s): k932661

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

NCCLS/CLSI LA4-A3: Blood Collection on Filter Paper for Newborn Screening Programs; Approved Standard—Third Edition

L. Test Principle: Not applicable (device may be used to collect whole blood).

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Analytical performance:   
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Not applicable   
d. Detection limit: Not applicable   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable   
$b$ . Matrix comparison: Not applicable. This device is intended for the collection of whole blood only.

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): The FDA recognized consensus standard for this device is NCCLS/CLSI LA4-A3: Blood Collection on Filter Paper for Newborn Screening Programs; Approved Standard—Third Edition. This standard describes four physical

properties of the filter paper and acceptance criteria for each:

1. Absorption capacity as measured by serum retention volume of a 1/8 inch paper punch taken from a dried blood spot. A range of 1.37 – $1 . 7 1 \mu \mathrm { L }$ is considered acceptable.

$$
{ \begin{array} { r l r l } { { \mathrm { A h l s t r o m ~ L o t ~ 1 ~ m e a n } } \quad } & { } & & { 1 . 4 7 7 \ \mu \mathrm { L } } \\ { { \mathrm { A h l s t r o m ~ L o t ~ 2 ~ m e a n } } \quad } & & { } & & { 1 . 4 4 3 \ \mu \mathrm { L } } \end{array} }
$$

2. Homogeneity of the filter paper lot (spot-to-spot and sheet-to-sheet variability). To perform this test, blood samples tagged with $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I }$ labeled T4 are applied to the filter paper. Samples (punches) of the filter paper are removed from pre-defined areas within the same lot and between lots. By measuring the amount of $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I }$ labeled T4, the homogeneity of the lot is calculated using a hierarchical, nested analysis-of-variance technique. An F-test is used to test equivalence of the mean values of the lots of paper. A p value of greater than 0.05 is considered acceptable.

$$
\begin{array} { r l r } { \mathrm { A h l s t r o m ~ L o t ~ 1 } } & { { } \quad } & { \mathfrak { p } = 0 . 9 3 7 } \\ { \mathrm { A h l s t r o m ~ L o t ~ 2 } } & { { } \quad } & { \mathfrak { p } = 0 . 6 0 7 } \end{array}
$$

3. Diameter of the circle for the dried blood aliquot. A range of 15 – 17 mm left to right and top to bottom is considered acceptable.

$$
\begin{array} { c c } { { \mathrm { A h l s t r o m \ L o t \ 1 \ m e a n } } } & { { \qquad 1 5 . 9 8 \ \mathrm { m m } } } \\ { { \mathrm { A h l s t r o m \ L o t \ 2 \ m e a n } } } & { { \qquad 1 6 . 7 5 \ \mathrm { m m } } } \end{array}
$$

4. Absorption time for a $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ blood aliquot. A range of 5 – 30 seconds is considered acceptable.

Ahlstrom Lot 1 mean 7.88 seconds Ahlstrom Lot 2 mean 12.74 seconds

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable   
5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable
