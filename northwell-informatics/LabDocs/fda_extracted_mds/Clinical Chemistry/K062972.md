# 510(k) Summary-Precinorm CK-MB & Precipath CK-MB

# Introduction

Roche Diagnostics Corporation hereby submits this Special 510(k): Device Modification to provide notification of modifications to our Precinorm CKMB Control. This control was originally cleared for use in K003158, along with a CK-MB reagent and calibrator system on Roche/Hitachi Analyzers.

Modifications to the control include:

Change of name for Precinorm CK-MB to Precipath CK-MB (no change of analyte concentration), and New, additional control level with reduced levels of CK and CK-MB to normal levels. This new level is now called Precinorm CK-MB.

# Device Name

Proprietary name: Precinorm CK-MB and Precipath CK-MB Controls

Common name: Single (Specified) Analyte Controls (assayed and unassayed)

Classification name: Quality control material (assayed and unassayed)

# Device Description

Precinorm CK-MB is for use in quality control by monitoring accuracy and precision for the quantitative methods as specified in the enclosed value sheet. Precipath CK-MB is for use in quality control by monitoring accuracy and precision for the quantitative methods as specified in the enclosed value sheet.

Precinorm CK-MB is a lyophilized controls based on bovine serum albumin. Adjusted activities of the control components are usually in the normal range or at the normal/pathological threshold. Precipath CK-MB is a lyophilized controls based on bovine serum albumin. Adjusted activities of the control components are usually in the pathological range. Biological additives for both control levels include CK-MM from human origin and CK-BB from porcine brain.

Re: k062972 Trade/Device Name: Precinorm CK-MB and Precipath CK-MB Controls Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1660 Regulation Name: Quality control material (assayed and unassayed) Regulatory Class: Class I, reserved Product Code: JJX Dated: September 28, 2006 Received: September 29, 2006

Dear Mr. Kaufman:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The alcnos provisi heccl eents  trai, st devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).
