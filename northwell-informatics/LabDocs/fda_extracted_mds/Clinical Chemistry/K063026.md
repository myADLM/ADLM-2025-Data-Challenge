# 2.2. Safety and Effectiveness Information

Predicate Device:   
Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to ROCHE DIAGNOSTICS   
CORP. Accu-Chek Active Test System (K012324)

√ Device Description: The OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System based on an electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary action. The OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System only needs a $0 . 7 \mu 1$ small amount of blood. Capillary action both side near the end of the test strip that draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is precisely and displayed in 6 seconds.

# Intended Use:

The OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger. Testing is done outside the body ( in vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for both lay uses by people with diabetes and in a clinical setting by health care professionals, as an aid to monitoring levels in Diabetes Mellitus.

# Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

Pre-clinical and clinical data are employed upon submission of this 510(K) premarket notification according to the Guidance Document for In Vitro Diagnostic Test System; Guidance for Industry and FDA document provided by CDRH/ FDA.

# Substantial Equivalence (SE)

A claim of substantial equivalence is made to ROCHE DIAGNOSTICS CORP. -Accu-Chek Active Test System (K012324). Both of them have the same working principle and technologies. The differences are electric voltage, dimensions of the unit and strip, weight. There are no safety and effectiveness aspects arising from the subject device. They are substantially equivalent.
