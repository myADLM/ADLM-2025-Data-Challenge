# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

CLSI EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices CLSI EP6-P: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The sponsor evaluated the within run precision of the device using 20 replicate measurements of 5 concentrations of glucose-adjusted venous whole blood on 5 meters each tested with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>300</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>YSI</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>34</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>211</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>356</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>512</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mean</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>33.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>212.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>357.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>515.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.89</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>%CV</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.9</td></tr></table>

The sponsor also evaluated the between run precision of the device using replicate measurements of glucose controls. Twenty replicates at 5 different concentrations (30-48, 104-148, 172-243, 293-386, 413-585) and 2 levels of controls (a low ${ \sim } 1 2 0$ and high ${ \sim } 2 7 0 $ ) were each tested with 3 strip lots over 10 days. Results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a standard deviation $\leq 4 . 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when the glucose concentration was $< 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and less than a $6 \%$ CV for glucose concentrations $\ge 7 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To establish the linearity of the OK Meter system through the range of 15 to 598 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose adjusted whole blood samples were compared to YSI 2300. Linear regression yields the following statistics:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.991</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.54</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$r2 }$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9993</td></tr></table>

The sponsor claims $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose standard (NIST SRM 965a). Stability characteristics of the two control solutions were determined using real-time stability studies to determine the storage stability at room temperature to be 18 months.

d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20 - 600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (above).

e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor tested the following substances for interference using two levels of glucose concentrations $( \sim 1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and ${ \sim } 3 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Interference was defined as ${ > } 1 5 \%$ bias compared to YSI. The following results were determined with regard to interfering substances:

<table><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Substance</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Therapeutic/NormalConcentration</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Highest Concentration with&lt;15% bias compared to YSI</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Acetaminophen</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1-2 mg/mL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dopamine</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&lt;87 pg/mL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">300 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">L-Dopa</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Not applicable</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">300 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Tolbutamide</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5.3-10 mg/dL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">220 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ascorbic acid</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.8-1.2 mg/dL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Bilirubin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.3 mg/dL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Galactose</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Not applicable</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Maltose</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Not applicable</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Triglyceride</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">36-165 mg/dL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">300 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Uric acid</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 mg/dL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

An altitude study was performed with 7 whole blood samples ranging from 15-600 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The spiked whole blood samples were measured by the OK Meter 6 times each. The samples were compared to YSI and found to have deviation less than 12 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ for samples $< 7 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and less than a $6 \%$ CV for samples $\ge 7 0$ . The sponsor claims that altitude up to 4691 feet has no effect on blood glucose measurements when using this test system.

To test the claimed hematocrit range, 20 replicates were tested at each hematocrit level and each glucose concentration. Samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of $20 \%$ , $30 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , and $65 \%$ and at glucose concentrations of 50, 80, 150, 300, 400, $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Acceptable results were defined as $9 5 \%$ of samples falling into zone A of an error grid analysis and less than $5 \%$ falling into zone B compared when compared to a $45 \%$ hematocrit level. The performance was acceptable across the claimed hematocrit range of $20 - 6 0 \%$ .

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor demonstrated that the OK Meter Blood Glucose Monitoring System for finger stick is equivalent to a standard method (YSI-2300) by having 150 patient samples with a hematocrit range of $3 5 . 5 5 \%$ test their own blood. A technician collected blood for YSI measurement and tested using the subject meter at the same time. Samples ranged from 71 to $4 1 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (according to YSI). The study results are summarized below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>YSI vs. Patient Finger</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9713</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.707</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$r2 }$</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.9623</td></tr></table>

The sponsor also evaluated the results obtained by patients versus those obtained by trained technicians. The sponsor found that differences between 150 samples obtained by both a patient and a technician were within $\pm 2 0 \%$ .

Meter versus YSI at each site met the ISO 15197 requirement of ninety-five percent $( 9 5 \% )$ of the individual glucose results falling within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of the results of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at glucose concentrations for samples ${ < } 7 5$ $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 2 0 \%$ at glucose concentrations $\geq 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . These results are summarized in the table below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Site</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Finger</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>N</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>150</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PercentageThatMet ISORequirement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>100%(150/150)</td></tr></table>
