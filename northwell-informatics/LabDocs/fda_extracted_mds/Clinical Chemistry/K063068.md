Ferrara Blood Glucose Monitoring System   
Glucose test system, 21 CFR 862.1345; Class II   
CGA, NBW

Advance Micro-draw BGM

Assure Pro BGM

Device Description:

The Ferrara Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a meter, test strips, and control solution. It is intended for overthe-counter, home use by diabetics to monitor their blood glucose levels, or for use in a clinical setting by health care professionals. The system tests fresh capillary whole blood. The meter is a portable, battery-operated instrument designed for use with Ferrara Blood Glucose Test Strips.

# Intended Use:

The Ferrara Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips or palm. Testing is done outside the body (In Vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [TC) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical settings by healthcare professionals, as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.

# Functional and Safety Testing:

# SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

The Ferrara Blood Glucose Monitoring System is technically unchanged by this expansion of indications (claiming palm as sample sites in addition to fingertip testing). The Ferrara system uses a meter substantially equivalent to the "Advance™m Micro-draw" meter with a test strip SE to the Assure Pro test strip.

# 1. NON-CLINICAL TESTING

Not Applicable

# CLINICAL TESTING

Accuracy/method comparison testing was done comparing fingertip results obtained by clinicians with alternate site results (palm) results obtained by participants with diabetes.

Testing included both men and women, with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, ages from 20 to 83 years. Tested blood glucose values encompassed the 45-328 mg/dL glucose range. Linear regression statistics, Clarke Error Grid Analysis, and Bias Analysis showed good correlation between fingertip and alternate site results.

# Conclusion:

Testing demonstrated that the performance of Ferrara at the palm alternate site was substantially equivalent to that at fingertip.

Dear Mr. Speikers,

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class ⅡI (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
