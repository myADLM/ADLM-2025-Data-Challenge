# L. Test Principle:

Polystyrene particles coated with specific antibodies to human cystatin C are aggregated when mixed with samples containing human cystatin C. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the relevant protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were done in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS Approved Guideline for Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Devices:

EP5A2. Precision of the system was demonstrated by assaying the low and high kit controls, low, medium and high serum pool specimens, and low and high plasma pool specimens for the Dimension Vista™ CYSC Assay. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days $( \mathtt { n } = 8 0 )$ ). The repeatability and within-lab standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ were calculated by the analysis of variance method. The data are summarized below:

Precision met the sponsor’s established Acceptable SD maximum presented in the above table:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range is 0.23 to $8 . 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a calibrator with a high concentration of cystatin C. This calibrator was serially diluted with System diluent (8.75 to $0 . 1 6 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ ). Each dilution was tested in replicates of three. Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a slope between 0.9 and 1.1 and a correlation coefficient $\ge 0 . 9 5$ were met. A summary of the linearity data is presented the table below.

# Hook Effect:

The possibility of hook effect occurring when using the Dimension Vista™ CYSC assay was evaluated by the sponsor with serum samples above the assay range. The samples were analyzed on both the predicate BN ProSpec $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System and the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System, indicating no hook affect up to $1 3 . 9 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The summary of the hook effect data are presented below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The traceability of the calibrators and controls are referenced to $\mathrm { E R M @ }$ - DA470 (CRM 470) and highly purified proteins with value assignment of the commercial lot versus master calibrator or control. Three reference curves, 4 runs, 3 vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two nephelometric instruments for a total of 144 values.

# Protein 3 Calibrator Stability:

The Protein 3 Calibrator stability was determined per pre-approved test protocol by Dade Behring. A 24 month study with 3 vials, 3 replicates per vial was performed. The calibrator was stored at $^ { + 2 }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ throughout the testing cycle and tested on day 0 and after 12, 18, and 24 months. Stress testing was performed after storage for 6 months at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; the calibrator was stored at $+ 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2 weeks and tested after 1 and 2 weeks storage. Open and punctured vial stability was tested after having reached $50 \%$ of shelf life stability, vials were stored on board the instrument and contents were tested in duplicates on day 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14. The sponsor’s established shelf life stability criteria are results obtained must be within a range of 85 to $1 1 5 \%$ of the control assigned value. The sponsor’s established open and punctured vial stability criteria are results obtained must not deviate more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ compared to day 0 results.

# Cystatin C Control L and H Stability:

The Cystatin C Control L and $\mathrm { H }$ stability was determined per pre-approved test protocol by Dade Behring. A 24 month study with 3 vials, 3 replicates per vial was performed. The controls were stored at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ throughout the testing cycle and tested on day 0 and after 12, 18, and 24 months. Stress testing was performed after storage for 6 months at $+ 2$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ; the controls were stored at $+ 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2 weeks and tested after 1 and 2 weeks storage. Open and punctured vial stability was tested after having reached $50 \%$ of shelf life stability, vials were stored on board the instrument and contents were tested in duplicates on day 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14. The sponsor’s established shelf life stability criteria are results obtained must be within a range of 85 to $1 1 5 \%$ of the control assigned value. The sponsor’s established open and punctured vial stability

criteria are results obtained must not deviate more than $\pm 1 0 \%$ compared to day 0 results.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor defined analytical sensitivity as the minimal detectable level of analyte, which can be distinguished from zero. In a representative study the value was calculated as the mean value of twenty replicates of System Diluent plus two standard deviations. In this study, the mean analytical sensitivity was calculated as $0 . 0 0 3 8 \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The claimed low end of assay range is $0 . 2 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor conducted interference studies to evaluate the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista™ CYSC assay. Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A. The sponsors established acceptance criteria are a bias exceeding $\pm 1 0 \%$ was considered a significant interference. For each spiked sample, the $\%$ recovery was determined $[ \%$ Recovery $=$ (Test result/ Baseline) $\textbf { X } 1 0 0 ]$ . The acceptance criterion $0 f \pm 1 0 \%$ relative deviation from the base pool was met for all interferents tested. The results are presented in the table below.

Method comparison studies were run on BN ProSpec $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ (BNPS) versus the Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ System, to determine total protein and rheumatoid factor interference. For these studies serum sample preparations $( \mathtt { n } \ge 2 5 )$ with 12 $\mathrm { g / d L }$ ( $\mathrm { 1 2 0 \ g / L ) }$ protein and $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ RF were used. The median for the normalized difference in $\%$ was required to be within $\pm 7 \%$ and the correlation coefficient $\ge 0 . 9 5$ . These studies demonstrated correlation and equivalent performance between the Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin C Kit and the Dimension Vista™ CYSC assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Expected Values: $0 . 5 3 - 0 . 9 5 \mathrm { m g / L }$

The reference interval was determined from a population of apparently subjects with no history of renal disease. A total of 413 samples obtained from 194 males and 219 females ranging in age from 1 to 78 years were tested. The reference interval was calculated nonparametrically and was determined to be 0.53 – 0.95 $\mathrm { m g / L }$ .
