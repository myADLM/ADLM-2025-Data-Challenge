K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable): Not Applicable

L. Test Principle: Not Applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): 3

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not Applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not Applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability

Protein 1 Calibrator, Protein 1 Control (L, M, and H), Protein 3 Calibrator, and Protein 3 Control are traceable to ERM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -DA470 (CRM470). Protein 2 Calibrator and Protein 2 Control (L and H) are traceable to $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ International Standard, ERM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -DA470 (C470) and $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ British Standard 64/0023.

# Value Assignment

The calibrator master lot value is assigned vs. ERM $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ -DA470 (CRM470) and $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ International Standard. The commercial calibrator lot value is assigned with three reference curves, 4 runs, 3 vials, 4 replicates per vial tested on two nephelometric instruments for a total of 144 values. The control values are assigned using the procedure outlined for the calibrators. Values assigned to controls are calibrated by reference to protein standard preparations and are lot-dependent.

# Stability

The calibrators and the controls are tested per the same stability protocol.

Products are stored at $^ { + 2 }$ to $+ 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and the stability studies are conducted for 24 months using 3 vials and 3 replicates per vial. Testing cycles are 0, 12, 18 and 24 months. Additional stress testing is done at 6 months after storing at $+ 3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \mathrm { { o } } } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ for two weeks. Once the products reach $50 \%$ shelf life stability, opened/punctured vial testing is performed on days 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14.

d. Detection limit: Not Applicable

e. Analytical specificity: Not Applicable   
f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not Applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not Applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable
