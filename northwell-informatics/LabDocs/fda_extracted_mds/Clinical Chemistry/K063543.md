# 510(k) Summary

# Introduction

Roche Diagnostics Corporation hereby submits this Bundled Special 510(k):   
Device Modification to provide notification of modifications to our Bilirubin   
(Total and Direct) test systems. The reagents were originally cleared for use   
as:   
COBAS INTEGRA Bilirubin Direct K951595   
COBAS INTEGRA Total Bilirubin Special K981632/A001   
Roche/Hitachi Total Bilirubin K981632/A001

Note that COBAS INTEGRA Total Bilirubin Special and Roche/Hitachi Total Bilirubin are different applications of the exact same reagent.

Modifications to the test systems include:

Device 1: COBAS INTEGRA Bilirubin Direct

Changes to the traceability   
In the Limitations section, quantification of lipemia and hemolysis interference, rather than a statement to avoid lipemia and hemolyzed specimens   
Clarification for reagent handling   
Change to pH value for R1 from 1.1 to 1.2   
Change in stated lower detection limit from $0 . 8 1 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ to 1.7 $\mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ . The change is due to Roche's decision to redefine the lower detection limit for clinical chemistry test systems to match the lower end of the measuring range even if data support a lower detection limit. This does not represent a change in actual performance; but rather only a change in the stated performance claim.   
Change in recommended calibrator to the Calibrator for Automated systems (C.f.a.s.) cleared by FDA under 510(k) K062319   
Other editorial labeling changes

Device 2: COBAS INTEGRA Total Bilirubin Special K981632/A001

Modifications to specimen collection   
Labeling changes — addition of two clarifying statements in the   
Specimen collection and preparation section: "Do not use cordblood   
samples" and "Underfilled lithium heparin sample tubes may cause   
elevated results"   
Other editorial labeling changes

Device 3: Roche/Hitachi Total Bilirubin K981632/A001

Modifications to specimen collection section to include   
clarification that underfilled lithium heparin sample tubes may cause elevated results

Additional information for modifications to values assignment process and traceability

# Direct Bilirubin:

Roche Diagnostics has revised the calibration of the COBAS INTEGRA Bilirubin Direct method due to ongoing quality assurance and customer feedback. Traceability was changed to the Doumas method, and the concurrent change in Quality Control limits for this method were intended to minimize or eliminate any discrepancies seen by the users. The impact of using new setpoints was shift to direct bilirubin values lower when compared to the values obtained using previous setpoints. The shift occurred in both controls and patient specimens.

The revised setpoints or revised values for controls and its clinical significance were communicated to the customers via Reagent Bulletins in April 2002, March 2004, November 2004.

Another communication regarding low recovery of Precinom U/Precinorm U Plus controls was communicated in May 2006.

# Total Bilirubin:

Roche Diagnostics has re-evaluated the assignments for the Total Bilirubin assays and has adjusted the C.f.a.s calibrator setpoints for both methods available on the COBAS INTEGRA and Roche/Hitachi analyzers. This change was triggered by internal investigation and customer feedback. The Roche Diagnostics US Standardization laboratory has reassigned the values based on a new procedure which maintained the same traceability to the Doumas method. The results were verified by using US reference laboratory.

The revised setpoints or revised values for controls were communicated to the customers via a Reagent Bulletins in August 2006.

# Proposed Labeling

Proposed labeling sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the directions for use can be found in Section V. We believe the proposed version of the device labeling presented contains all of the technical information required per 21 CFR 809.10.

# Validation and Design Control

Development activities were conducted under appropriate design control procedures and the overall product specifications were met. The Declaration of Conformity with Design Controls and Results of Risk Analysis are provided in Section 5.1. Analytical Performance.

# Confidentiality

Roche Diagnostics Corporation requests that the FDA not disclose the nature or existence of this submission until the substantial equivalence decision has been reached.

Modification of the Bilirubin Direct and Total reagents does not affect the intended use or indications for use of the device as described in the labeling, nor does it alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Therefore, we trust the information provided in this Special 510(k) will support a decision of substantial equivalence of the Bilirubin Direct and Total to their predicate.

If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact this office.

Dear Ms. Harper:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notifcation.The DA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a lally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
