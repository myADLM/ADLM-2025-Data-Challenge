3.Device name

Trade or Proprietary Name: VITROS Chemistry Products CREA Slides VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 1

Common Name: CREA test Classification Name: Creatinine test system (21 CFR 862.1225).

Common Name: Calibrator Kit 1 Classification Name: Calibrator (21 CFR 862.1150)

4Predicate device

The VITROS CREA assa odifi evice is substantally equivalent  the VITROS CREA assay (original). This assay was originally cleared under the VITROS Chemistry Products CREA Slides and VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 1 Premarket Notification K001310.

Device description

The VITROS CREA assay is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products CREA Slides, and the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 1 on VITROS Chemistry Systems.

The VITROS CREA Slide is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support.

A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading layer to the underlying layers. Creatinine diffuses to the reagent layer, where it is hydrolyzed to creatine in the rate-determining step. The creatine is converted to sarcosine and urea by creatine amidinohydrolase. The sarcosine, in the presence of sarcosine oxidase, is oxidized to glycine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide. The final reaction involves the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of a leuco dye to produce a colored product.

Following addition of the sample, the slide is incubated. During the initial reaction phase, endogenous creatine in the sample is oxidized. The resulting change in reflection density is measured at 2 time points.

Once a calibration has been performed for each slide lot, creatinine concentration in unknown samples can be determined using the softwareresident two-point rate math model and the change in reflectance calculated for each unknown test slide.

VITROS Calibrator Kit 1 contains three levels of lyophilized standards with corresponding diluents. The standards are prepared from processed bovine serum to which organic analytes, electrolytes, stabilizers, and preservatives have been added. The diluents are prepared from processed water to which inorganic salts have been added. Once reconstituted, the standards are used to calibrate VITROS Chemistry Systems for the quantitative measurement of creatinine in serum, plasma and urine.

Calibration of the VITROS CREA assay requires the use of all three of the calibrator levels (bottles 1, 2 and 3).

Device intended use

For in vitro diagnostic use only.

VITROS CREA Slides quantitatively measure creatinine (CREA) concentration in serum, plasma, and urine.

For in vitro diagnostic use only.   
VITROS Calibrator Kit 1 is used to calibrate VITROS Chemistry Systems for the quantitative measurement of BUN/UREA, Ca, CREA, GLU, LAC, Li, Mg, PHOS, SALI, THEO, and URIC.

# 8. Conclusions

The information presented in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the performance of the VITROS CREA assay (modified device) for use with human serum, plasma and urine is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate device.

Equivalence was demonstrated using manufactured reagents along with quality control fluids, proficiency samples and human serum, plasma, and urine samples with measured creatinine values spanning the assay range.

The information presented in the premarket notification provides a reasonable assurance that the VITROS CREA assay (modified device) for use with human serum, plasma, and urine is safe and effective for the stated intended use.

Dear Mr. Byrne:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.
