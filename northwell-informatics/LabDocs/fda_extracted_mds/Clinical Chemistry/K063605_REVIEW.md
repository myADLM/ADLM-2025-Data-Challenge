# L. Test Principle:

The ST AIA-PACK Intact PTH is a two-site immunoenzymatic assay which is performed entirely in the AIA-PACK. Intact PTH present in the test sample is bound with polyclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody in the AIA- PACK. The magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody and are then incubated with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to Intact PTH concentration in the test sample. A standard curve is constructed using known levels of calibrators, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated using this curve. The sponsor claims that calibration curve for the ST AIA-PACK Intact PTH is stable for up to 90 days. Calibration stability is monitored by quality control performance and is dependent on proper reagent handling and AIA System maintenance according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

# M. Performance Characteristics:

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor determined the within run precision using three controls each of serum and plasma samples in a total of 20 runs. Within each run, one set of duplicates per control was assayed. The mean of each duplicate was used to obtain the pooled standard deviation (SD), which was then used to calculate the coefficient of variation (CV). Total precision was determined by the duplicate assay of three controls each of serum and plasma samples in 20 separate runs. The means of each run were used to calculate the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV).

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity studies were performed on the TOSOH AIA-1800 System. The Intact PTH Calibrators diluted to 12 equally spaced concentration levels (7.9 – $2 3 7 0 \mathrm { p g / m l ) }$ were used for linearity analysis. Each test level was run in triplicate on the above analyzer. The sponsor established the acceptance criteria of measured values being within $90 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \%$ of the assigned value. Based on the summarized results below and the results obtained from Limit of Detection studies (see Limit of Detection below), the sponsor has claimed the assay reportable range of $1 . 2 - 2 2 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m l } .$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor’s protocols indicate that each calibrator/control lot is traceable to the manufacturer’s primary reference material. The primary reference material was prepared by diluting commercially available synthesized Intact PTH with Intact PTH Negative buffer solution. The value was originally assigned by comparing measured results with those obtained with another commercially available Intact PTH assay for patient samples.

To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor recommends assaying two quality controls having approximate values 50 and $8 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , once each day on which Intact PTH assays are scheduled.

The sponsor claims that all unopened materials are stable until the expiration date on the label when stored at the specified temperature. ST AIA-PACK Intact PTH test cups may be stored for up to 1 day at $1 8 { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . When stored unopened and refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , calibrators are stable until the expiration date on the label. After opening, the calibrators should be used within 24 hours. When stored unopened and refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , the AIA-PACK Intact PTH Control Set is stable until the expiration date on the label. Control materials should be used within 7 days of opening or reconstituting provided that the vials are kept sealed and refrigerated at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor determined the lower Limit of Detection (LOD) based on the algorithm in EP Evaluator software program version 4.0. This was defined as that concentration of Intact PTH, which corresponds to the rate of fluorescence that is two standard deviations from the mean rate of fluorescence of 5 replicate determinations of a zero calibrator.

Sensitivity $=$ (Assigned value of non-zero calibrator) X 2 SD (Mean rate of non-zero calibrator – mean rate of zero calibrator) Using different lots of Intact PTH calibrator 1 with zero concentration and a non-zero calibrator $( 5 2 . 0 \mathrm { p g / m l } )$ , the sponsor determined the value to be 0.96, hence the claimed LOD is $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of the interfering substances listed below for the recovery of PTH. Serum and plasma samples each with 3 levels of PTH (low, medium and high) were spiked with the interferents, and then compared with unspiked control. Based on the sponsor-defined interference limit of $\pm$ $10 \%$ from each sample containing no interferents, following interference limit claims were set by the sponsor.

The following PTH fragments were tested for cross-reactivity. The crossreactivity $( \% )$ is the percent of the PTH fragments which will be identified as Intact PTH.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Performance of the ST AIA-PACK Intact PTH assay on AIA-1800 instrument was compared with performance of the predicate device, Roche Elecsys PTH assay using 153 patient serum samples with PTH values ranging $8 - 1 5 3 7 . 0$ $\mathrm { p g / m l }$ . A linear regression analysis conducted to determine the correlation between the device and the predicate resulted in the equation, $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 3 \mathbf { x }$ - 10.457 and correlation value of 0.997.

b. Matrix comparison:

To demonstrate comparable performance between serum and EDTA-plasma, the sponsor compared 134 paired serum and plasma samples on AIA-1800 analyzer using ST AIA-PACK Intact PTH assay. The values for sera ranged $1 3 . 3 - 1 9 3 1 . 7 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , and the linear regression analysis resulted in the equation, $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 9 2 1 \mathrm { x } + 7 . 8 8 1 6$ and $\scriptstyle \mathrm { R = } 0 . 9 9 5 7$ .

The sponsor indicated in the labeling that heparinized or citrated plasma should not be used for specimen collection and handling.
