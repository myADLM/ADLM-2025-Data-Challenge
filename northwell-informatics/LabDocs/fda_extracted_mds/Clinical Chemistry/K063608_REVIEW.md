# I. Device Description:

The Dimension Vista APOAI Flex and APOB Flex reagent cartridges each consist of 12 reagent wells. Wells 1-4 contain either APOAI or APOB supplement reagent. Wells 11 and 12 contain rabbit antiserum specific to either apolipoprotein A-I or apolipoprotein B. The remaining wells 5-10 are used for patient sample dilution and mixing.

The Dimension Vista Apolipoprotein calibrator is a lyophilized, human serum based product containing apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B. It is packaged in 4 vials. Before use, the contents should be reconstituted with $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of distilled water. The analyzer automatically dilutes the calibrator with System Diluent to achieve concentrations spanning the assay range.

# L. Test Principle:

Apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B in the serum or plasma sample form immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction with protein specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light as it passes through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was performed over a period of 20 days following the protocol outlined in CLSI EP5-A2.

For the APOAI assay, sample material included the Dade Behring Vista Apolipoprotein control $\mathrm { 1 6 8 ~ m g / d L ) }$ , two serum pools (48 and $5 0 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and two lithium heparin plasma pools (103 and $2 2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Repeatability ranged from $2 . 0 { - } 4 . 4 \%$ CV and within lab imprecision ranged from $2 . 8 – 4 . 9 \%$ CV.

For the APOB assay, sample material included the Dade Behring Vista Apolipoprotein control $( 9 6 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , three serum pools (43, 52, and 370 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ ) and two lithium heparin plasma pools (98 and $1 4 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Repeatability ranged from $1 . 4 { - } 6 . 4 \%$ CV and within lab imprecision ranged from $2 . 6 { - } 7 . 2 \%$ CV.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: The reportable range of the APOAI assay is $1 9 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . The reportable range of the APOB assay is $2 6 { \cdot } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Linearity was evaluated by comparing the observed versus expected values obtained with the Dimension Vista APOAI and APO B methods. Natural serum samples with high concentration of APOAI and APOB were mixed with System Diluent in twelve (12) different proportions across the range of the assay. For the APOAI method, when observed results were compared to expected results, recovery ranged from $9 2 \mathrm { - } 1 1 1 \%$ . For the APOB method, recovery ranged from $9 5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 3 \%$ .

High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing sera with elevated APOAI or APOB. No hook effect was observed with samples up $8 2 9 { \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ and 967 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ respectively.

Samples above assay range are reported by the analyzer as ${ > } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (APOAI) or ${ \scriptstyle > 4 0 0 } \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (APOB). These samples are automatically diluted

1:100 with System Diluent on board the analyzer.

Samples below the assay range are reported as $< 1 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (APOAI) or $< 2 6$ mg/dL (APOB).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Calibrators and controls are required with this assay and are specifically identified in the labeling. They are both provided separately, and are obtaining clearance with this submission. See the device description section, above.

Traceability and Value Assignment:

Dimension Vista Apolipoprotein Calibrator (APO CAL) and Apolipoprotein Control (APO CON) are traceable to protein reference material BCR-393 (APOAI) and IRP SP3-07 (APOB).

The value assignment process is as follows. Master Calibrators are prepared internally and values are assigned from protein reference materials BCR-393 and IRP SP3-07. The Master Calibrators are tested with along with the new lot of APO CAL or APO CON on mulitple analyzers and multiple assay runs.

# Stability:

The real time and accelerated stability study protocols were reviewed for APO CAL and APO CON and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor’s labeling states the lower limit of the reportable range to be 19 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ (APOAI) and $2 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (APOB) which were previously established in $\mathrm { k } 8 6 0 8 9 4$ and validated for use on the Vista. In addition, limit of blank studies were performed and the results were well below the lower limit stated.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2, to determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the assay. Hemoglobin hemolysate (up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin (up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), and a panel of commonly ingested substances, over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs did not interfere with the assay. A list of these substances can be found in the package insert. The sponsor defined interference as a difference in recovery between the test sample and control sample greater than $10 \%$ .

The effect of rheumatoid factor (RF) was evaluated by testing mixtures of serum samples with known elevated RF and samples with low RF. The APOAI and APOB concentrations were determined for each sample in replicates of five on the Dimension Vista System. For each sample preparation, the percent recovery was calculated by comparing the measured result to the expected result. The sponsor defined interference as a difference in recovery between the actual and expected values of greater than $10 \%$ . Levels of RF up to $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { \ : I U / m L }$ did not interfere.

The effect of interference by elevated total protein was determined by testing the total protein and APOAI and APOB concentrations in a neat sample. The neat sample was then spiked with additional protein. For each sample preparation, the percent recovery was calculated by comparing the measured result to the initial result. The sponsor defined interference as a difference in recovery between the actual and initial values of greater than $10 \%$ . Levels of total protein up to $1 3 . 8 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ did not interfere.

The sponsor states in the labeling under “Limitations of Procedure” that the effect of elevated triglycerides and chylomicrons was not evaluated.
