Immunoassay: StatusFirst™" CHF NT-proBNP (K051596), which is currently marketed by Nanogen, Inc.

# 4. Description of the Device:

The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay is a quantitative immunochromatographic test indicated for use as an in vitro diagnostic product used with a RAMP reader to measure N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in EDTA whole blood. Mixed EDTA whole blood is added to the sample well of the Test Cartridge which houses the immunochromatographic test strip. The red blood cells are retained in the sample pad, and the separated plasma migrates along the strip. Fluorescent-dyed latex particles coated with anti-NT-proBNP antibodies bind to NT-proBNP, if present in the sample. As the sample migrates along the strip, NT-proBNP bound particles are captured at the detection zone, and additional particles are captured at the internal standard zone.

The RAMP reader then measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by the complexes captured at the detection zone and at the internal standard zone. Using a ratio between the two fluorescence values, a quantitative reading is calculated.

# 5. Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay, Elecsys proBNP Assay and StatusFirst CHF NT-proBNP Test are all used for the quantitative measurement of NT-proBNP in human whole blood (RAMP) or plasma (Elecsys and StatusFirst). All three immunoassays utilize the binding of NT-proBNP to specific antibodies. The RAMP assay measures light production from a fluorescence reaction using a fluorometer, which is directly proportional to the amount of NT-proBNP present in a patient sample. The Elecsys assay is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay utilizing the application of voltage to an electrode inducing an emission measured by a photomultiplier, which is directly proportional to the amount of NT-proBNP present in a patient sample. The StatusFirst test utilizes a biotin coupled antibody/streptavidin solid-phase chromatographic immunoassay in which the analyte concentration in the sample correlates with the intensity of the test band.

The RAMP and StatusFirst assays are both quantitative immunochromatographic tests, whereas the Elecsys proBNP Assay is a quantitative sandwich immunoassay.

The Elecsys proBNP Assay utilizes two sheep polyclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes located in the N-terminal part (1-76) of proBNP (1-108). The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay utilizes one sheep polyclonal and one mouse monoclonal antibody that recognize epitopes located in the N-terminal part (1-76) of proBNP (1-108). The StatusFirst test utilizes polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the N-terminal part (1-76) of proBNP (1- 108).

The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay is for use in the central laboratory, stat-lab and point-ofcare facilities, while the Elecsys proBNP Assay is for use in the central and stat laboratories. The intended location for use of the StatusFirst is not indicated in the device labeling.

All three assays are indicated for use in the diagnosis and assessment of severity in individuals suspected of having congestive heart failure. All three assays may also aid in risk stratification.

A comparison between the RAMP, the Roche Elecsys and Nanogen StatusFirst assays is presented in the table below.

# PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

# Precision

The intra-assay and inter-assay precision of the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay were determined by one operator assaying duplicates of three concentrations of control material (140, 449 and 1675 ng/L NT-proBNP) twice each day over a 10-day period. The mean, standard deviation and $\% C V$ were calculated for each reported concentration of NT-proBNP. The results of this precision analysis are shown below.

# Linearity

A high NT-proBNP antigen concentration was prepared in normal donor EDTA blood and determined to contain 21,921 ng/L NT-proBNP by assaying the sample in duplicate. The sample was serially diluted six times. Regression analysis using the method of Passing-Bablok of actual versus expected NT-proBNP concentration resulted with an R-value of 1.00, a slope of 1.06 and an offset of $- 1 . 4 \ n g / L$ : The recovery of NT-proBNP antigen at the six dilutions ranged from 101 to $120 \%$ with an average of $108 \%$

A low NT-proBNP antigen concentration was prepared in normal donor EDTA blood and determined to contain $2 6 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / L } }$ NT-proBNP by assaying the sample in duplicate. The sample was serially diluted four times. Regression analysis using the method of PassingBablok of actual versus expected NT-proBNP concentration resulted with an R-value of 1.00, a slope of 1.06 and an offset of $- 2 . 0 \ \mathfrak { n } \{ \mathbb { L } $ . The recovery of NT-proBNP antigen at the four dilutions ranged from 85 to $1 1 0 \%$ with an average of $100 \%$ EY

# Hook Effect

There is no high dose hook effect in the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay up to the highest level testec (350,000 ng/L NT-proBNP).

# Limits of Detection and Quantitation

Following CLSI EP-17A, limit of detection (LoD) was determined to be $3 4 \pi g / L$ , the limit of blank (LoB) was calculated as the $9 5 ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ percentile from forty replicates of a blank sample run using the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay and was determined to be $2 7 n g / L$ :

NT-proBNP levels in excess of $2 2 , 0 0 0 \ n g / L$ are reported as greater than $( > ) 2 2 , 0 0 0 \ n g / L$

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) is defined as the NT-proBNP level at which the test method displays a particular coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ . As shown below, the $20 \%$ LoQ for the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay was determined from whole blood analyses to be $5 7 \ r g / L$ .

# Analytical Specificity

Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and Rheumatoid Factor (RhF) appear to have minimal cross-reactivity with the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay. Possible cross-reactivity of other substances was evaluated by spiking different concentrations of the potential cross-reactants into EDTA blood which had NT-proBNP added. No cross reactivity was observed with the RAMP NTproBNP assay up to the maximum levels tested for the compounds listed in the following table.

# CLINICAL EVALUATIONS OF ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE

# Method Comparison

Six hundred and ninety-nine (699) patients were enrolled in the method comparison study. The presenting population included $46 \%$ (323) subjects with hypertension, $30 \%$ (208) with shortness of breath, $22 \%$ (152) with diabetes, $14 \%$ (99) with pulmonary disorders, $12 \%$ (84) with coronary disease, $8 \%$ (56) with atrial fibrillation, $4 \%$ (31) with renal failure, $19 \%$ (133) were healthy, and the remainder had diagnoses not believed to be cardiac related (hepatitis, HIV, cancer, etc.).

EDTA and heparin whole blood samples were obtained for each of these subjects. An aliquot of EDTA whole blood was used for the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay and heparinized plasma was prepared for the Roche Elecsys proBNP Assay. From these analyses it was determined that 580 samples contained between $3 4 n g / L$ (RAMP LoD) and $2 2 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n g / L }$ of NT-proBNP. Of these, 274 were diagnosed with heart failure (HF) based on individual hospital criteria (164 males and 110 females) and 306 were non-HF reference group patients (124 males and 182 females). Regression analysis data of RAMP NT-proBNP versus Elecsys proBNP using the method of Passing-Bablok is presented in the table below.

# Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity

Clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated using data collected from 858 subjects. Of these, 299 were diagnosed with HF using local hospital criteria, 189 individuals without HF but with potentially confounding co-morbidity (diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and 370 reference individuals. This reference group includes an additional 159 subjects added from an additional clinical site without concomitant testing in the Elecsys system. Of these, $5 5 \%$ (87) were male and $8 \%$ (12) were more than 75 years old. None of these patients had reported co-morbidities. These subjects were healthy individuals with no clinical indications for natriuretic peptide testing.

# Non-HF and HF Group Descriptive Statistics

The overall incidence of disease in the presenting population $( n = 8 5 8 )$ included $38 \%$ (323) subjects with hypertension, $24 \%$ (208) who presented with shortness of breath, $1 8 \%$ 152)with diabetes, $12 \%$ (99) with pulmonary disorders, $10 \%$ (84) with coronary disease, $7 \%$ (56) with atrial fibrillation, $4 \%$ (31) with renal failure, $34 \%$ (292) were healthy, and the remainder had diagnoses not believed to be cardiac related (hepatitis, HIV, cancer, etc.).

The circulating NT-proBNP concentration was determined in 858 individuals with and without HF. The HF patients included those with prior established heart failure that were not acutely destabilized at the time of enrollment (and thus similar to those who might be tested in the outpatient setting). Patients $( N = 1 7 )$ for whom the measured NT-proBNP level was greater than 22,000 ng/L have been excluded. The descriptive statistics for the Non-HF and HF groups are presented in the following table:

# 7. Conclusion:

The RAMP NT-proBNP device demonstrates performance equivalent to that stated in the Nanogen StatusFirst CHF labeling and strong correlation to the predicate Roche Diagnostics Elecsys® proBNP method.

These data show that:

The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay has excellent sensitivity for less acute populations as might be seen in an outpatient setting when the 125/ 450 age dependent cut-offs presented in cleared NT-proBNP assay labeling is applied.   
The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay shows equivalent clinical sensitivity and specificity to that stated in the predicate Nanogen StatusFirst CHF NT-proBNP labeling using these cutoffs.   
The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay has excellent correlation to the predicate Roche Diagnostics Elecsys proBNP.   
The RAMP system provides NT-proBNP results that correlate with severity of heart failure, with significantly higher values of NT-proBNP as patients from NYHA Class I through IV are examined.

# BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION

Hear failure HF) is a chronic, progressive disease in which the heart muscle weakens and its function becomes impaired, thus impeding the heart's ability to pump enough blood to support the body's metabolic demands. When cardiac muscle is stretched, such as with elevated ventricular filing presure, the inactive prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) is released and rapidly cleaved into physiologically active BNP and the N-terminal fragment NT-proBNP.Natriuretic peptides can be used for the diagnosis of clinical problems associated with left ventricular dysfunction. The advent of testing for BNPs has improved the ability of physicians to make a qualified diagnosis of heart failure an to monitor the success of treatment.Beig able to test the levels of NT-proBNP in patient blood samples is very useful as these levels are indicative of the degree of HF, and when combined with l n iull It has also been shown to aid in the assessment of increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality

Point-of-care (PoC) or "near-patient" testing allows for diagnostic assays to be performed at the site of patient care delivery such as the emergency room (ER), chest pain evaluation center, or intensive care unit (ICU). Compared with centralized laboratory testing, POC testing provides for rapid clinical decision making by reducing the time spent ordering tests and transporting samples, as well as retrieving data.

# PRINCIPLES OF THE TEST

The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay is a quantitative immunochromatographic test for the determination of NT-proBNP in EDTA whole blood. EDTA whole blood is mixed with buffer and antibody-coated, labeled particles, and applied into the sample well of the Test Cartridge. The red blood cells are retained in the sample pad, and the separated plasma migrates along the strip. Fluorescent-dyed partices coated with anti-NT-proBNP antibodies bind to NT-proBNP, if present in the sample.As the sample migrates along the strip, NT-proBNP bound particles are captured at the detection zone, and excessive fluorescent-dyed particies are captured at the internal standard zone.

The RAMP reader then measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by the complexes bound at the detection zone and at the internal standard zone.Using a ratio between the two fluorescence values, aquantitative reading is calculated. For further information on the use of he RAMP reader refer t the Operator's Manual.

# LIMITATIONS OF PROCEDURE

Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies. In addition, other heterophilic antibodies may be present in patient samples. Such specimens may show either falsely elevated or depressed values when tested with immunoassays. The RAMP NT-proBNP Assay has been formulated to reduce the effects of heterophilic antibodies: however results from patients known to have such antibodies should be interpreted with caution.   
Blood specimens using anti-coagulants other than EDTA (e.g. heparin) and serum have not been evaluated, and should not be used.   
A test result that is inconsistent with the clinical signs'and symptoms should be interpreted with caution.   
Functions such as technical or procedural errors, or the addition of substances not evaluated for may interfere with the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay.

The results obtained from the use of this product should be used only as an adjunct to other diagnostic procedures and information available to the physician.

# STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS

The Test Cartridges and Sample Buffer Vials should be stored at $2 \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } C$ , Prior to sample preparation, components should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to aquilibrate to room temperature for at least 15 minutes. Once removed from refrigeration the components are stable for up to 14 days when stored at room temperature $( 1 5 - 2 5 ^ { \circ } C )$ , but not beyond the expiration date printed on the pouch. If the test is not used on the same day it is removed from refrigeration, use a permanent marker to write the date of removal from the refrigerator and the discard date on the foil pouch and samplebuffer vial and/or the kit box.

NOTE: Do Not Freeze.

# SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION

Testig should be completed within  hours of phlebotomy.However, if this is not possible, the EDTA whole blood can be stored for up to 2 days at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } C .$ .

NOTES: The sample should be well-mixed before use. Use only EDTA whole blood. Do not use heparinized whole blood, or plasma, or serum. Do not use samples that have been frozen

# CALIBRATION PROCEDURES

Each RAMP NT-proBNP kit includes a Lot Card that is individually packaged in an anti-static pouch. The Lot Card provides all calibration information specific to the kit Test Cartridge lot, including lot number, expiration date, and standard curve information. For further details on loading lot-specific information, see the reader Operator's Manual. No additional calibration, beyond insertion of the Lot Card, is necessary. This operation is required only once per Assay kit lot.

# SET-UP

Ifot previsy done emove the Lot Card r hisit lot rom ts pouh and insr t into he Lot Card slot on the RAMP instrument. Once the Lot Card information has been uploaded, return the Lot Card to its pouch.

WARNiNG: Avoid touching the contacts at the end of the Lot Card

For additional information on the operation of the RAMP reader, please refer to the Operator's Manual.

# SAMPLE ANALYSIS PROCEDURE

NOTE:Prior to sample preparation, remove all necessary components from refrigeration and allow to equilibrate to room temperature for at least 15 minutes.

You will need the Transfer Device and for each sample being tested, one Sample Buffer Vial and a pouch containing one Test Cartridge and one Assay Tip.

1. Place the Sample Buffer Vial upright on a clean, dry, level surface or in a sample vial holder.   
2. Open a pouch containing one NT-proBNP Test Cartridge and one NT-proBNP Assay Tip. Place the Test Cartridge on a clean, dry, level surface.   
3. Firmly attach the Assay Tip to the supplied Transfer Device.   
4. Ensure that the EDTA whole blood sample is well mixed (by inversion). Remove the cap from the Sample Buffer Vial.   
5. Fully depress the Transfer Device plunger and insert the Assay Tip into the blood sample. Do not prime or rinse the Assay Tip in the blood sample.   
6. Gently release the plunger to fll the Assay Tip and immediately transfer the Assay Tip into the Sample Buffer Vial close to, but not touching the bottom of the Vial. Do not press against the bottom of the Vial as this may block the Tip.   
7. Mix the sample slowly by pressing and releasing the plunger 10 times (2 seconds per cycle), taking care each time to eject entire sample into the Vial and to draw only liquid and no air into the Assay Tip. This will prevent foaming.   
8. Position the flled Assay Tip directly over the sample well of the Test Carridge and fully depress the plunger to dispense the mixed blood sample into the sample well. (Disregard any remaining droplet in the Assay Tip.)Dispose of used Assay Tip and Sample Buffer Vial according to local biohazard procedures.   
9. Immediately (within 30 seconds) insert the Test Cartridge into the reader, and then press until firm resistance is felt. Delay will lead to an error message.   
10. Do not insert a Test Cartridge that is externally wet with blood or other liquid into the RAMP reader, as this may cause contamination or damage to the reader.   
11. Test result is complete approximately 15 minutes from Test Cartridge insertion.   
12. Record the result.   
Δ For additional information on printing and/or uploading results, please refer to the Operator's Manual.   
13. Remove the used Test Cartridge when prompted to do so by the instrument display. Dispose of the used Test Cartridge according to local biohazard procedures.

# Limits of Detection and Quantitation

Following CLSI EP-17A, limit of detection (LoD) was determined to be $3 4  / \ L$ , the limit of blank (LoB) was calculated as the $9 5 ^ { m }$ percentile from forty replicates of a blank sample run using the RAMP NTproBNP Assay and was determined to be $2 7 \ n g / L .$ .

NT-proBNP levels in excess of $2 2 , 0 0 0 \ r g / L$ are reported as greater than $( > ) 2 2 , 0 0 0 \ \cap { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathsf { L }$ .

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) is defined as the NT-proBNP level at which the test method displays a particular coefficient of variation $( \% C V )$ . As shown below, the $20 \%$ LoQ for the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay was determined from whole blood analyses to be ${ 5 7 } \mathsf { n g } \mathsf { A }$ .

# Hook Effect

There is no high dose hook effect in the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay up to the highest level tested (350,000 ng/L NT-proBNP).

# Linearity

A high NT-proBNP antigen concentration was prepared in normal donor EDTA blood and determined to contain 21,921 ng/L NT-proBNP by assaying the sample in duplicate. The sample was serially diluted six times.Regression analysis using the method of Passing-Bablok of actual versus expected NT-proBNP concentration resulted with an R-value of 1.00, a slope of 1.06 and an offset of $- 1 . 4 \ n g / L$ . The recovery of NT-proBNP antigen at the six dilutions ranged from 101 to $120 \%$ with an average of $10 8 \%$ .

A low NT-pro8NP antigen concentration was prepared in normal donor EDTA blood and determined to contain 264 ng/L NT-proBNP by assaying the sample in duplicate. The sample was serially diluted four times. Regression analysis using the method of Passing-Bablok of actual versus expected NTproBNP concentration resulted with an R-value of 1.00, a slope of 1.06 and an offset of $- 2 . 0 \ n g / L$ . The recovery of NT-proBNP antigen at the four dilutions ranged from 85 to $110 \%$ with an average of $100 \%$ .

# Analytical Specificity

Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and Rheumatoid Factor (RhF) appear to have minimal crossreactivity with the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay. Possible cross-reactivity of other substances was evaluated by spiking different concentrations of the potential cross-reactants into EDTA blood which had NT-proBNP added. No cross reactivity was observed with the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay up to the maximum levels tested for the compounds listed in the following table.

# CLINICAL EVALUATIONS OF ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE

# Method Comparison

Six hundred and ninety-nine (699) patients were enrolled in the clinical evaluation.The presenting population included $4 6 \%$ (323) with hypertension, $30 \%$ (208) who presented with shortness of breath, $2 2 \%$ (152) with diabetes, $14 \%$ (99) with pulmonary disorders, $12 \%$ (84) with coronary disease, $8 \%$ (56) with atrial fibrillation, $4 \%$ (31) with renal failure, $1 9 \%$ (133) were healthy, and the remainder had diagnoses not believed to be cardiac related (hepatitis, HIV, cancer, etc.). EDTA and heparin whole blood samples were obtained for each of these subjects.

EDTA and heparin whole blood samples were obtained for each of these subjects. An aliquot of EDTA whole blood was used for the RAMP NT-proBNP Assay and heparinized plasma was prepared for the Roche Elecsys proBNP Assay. From these analyses it was determined that 580 samples contained between 34 ng/L (RAMP LoD) and $2 2 , 0 0 0 \ r { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathsf { L } }$ NT-proBNP. Of these, 274 were diagnosed with heart failure (HF) based on individual hospital criteria (164 males and 110 females) and 306 were non-HF reference group patients (124 males and 182 females). Regression analysis data of RAMP NT-proBNP versus Elecsys proBNP using the method of Passing-Bablok is presented in the table below.

# Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity

Clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated using data collected from 858 subjects. Of these, 299 were diagnosed with $\mathsf { H F }$ "using local hospital criteria, 189 individuals without HF but with potentially confounding co-morbidity (diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension or chronicobstructive pulmonary disease) and 370 reference individuals.This reference group includes an additional 159 subjects added from an additional clinical site without concomitant testing in the Elecsys system. O these, $5 5 \%$ (87) were male and $8 \%$ (12) were more than 75 years old. "None of these patients had reported co-morbidities. These subjects were healthy individuals with no clinical indications for natriuretic peptide testing.

The use of the cut-offs of $1 2 5 \ n g / L$ for $\le 7 5$ years of age and $4 5 0 \ r g / L$ for $\mathtt { > } 7 5$ years of age was evaluated across all patients stratifying by the presence or absence of co-morbidities (diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

# Non-HF and HF Group Descriptive Statistics

The overall incidence of disease in the presenting population $( n = 8 5 8 )$ included $3 8 \%$ (323) subjects with hypertension, $24 \%$ (208) who presented with shortness of breath, $18 \%$ (152) with diabetes, $12 \%$ (99) with pulmonary disorders, $10 \%$ (84) with coronary disease, $7 \%$ (56) with atrial fibrillation, $4 \%$ (31) with renal failure, $34 \%$ (292) were healthy, and the remainder had diagnoses not believed to be cardiac related (hepatitis, HIV, cancer, etc.).

The circulating NT-proBNP concentration was determined in 858 individuals with and without HF. The HF patients included those with prior established heart failure that were not acutely destabilized at the time of enrollment (and thus similar to those who might be tested in the outpatient setting).Patients $( N = 1 7 )$ for whom the measured NT-proBNP level was greater than $2 2 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n g / L }$ have been excluded.

Re: K063662 Trade/Device Name: Response Biomedical Corporation RAMP $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ NT-proBNP Assay Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1117 Regulation Name: B-type Natriuretic peptide test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: NBC Dated: April 22, 2008 Received: April 23, 2007

Dear Dr. Pilgrim:

We have reviewed your Section $\bar { 5 } 1 0 ( { \bf k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA) You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
