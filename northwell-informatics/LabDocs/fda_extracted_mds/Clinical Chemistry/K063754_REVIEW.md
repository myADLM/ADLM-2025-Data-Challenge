# K. Standard/Guidance Documents Referenced (if applicable):

# Standard:

WHO Standard for HCG, $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ IS, 75/589

# Guidance:

CLSI Documents:

# L. Test Principle:

The Dimension Vista BHCG Flex assay is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on LOCI technology. The LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-βhCG monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti- $\mathrm { \cdot \beta \ h C G }$ monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with chemibeads and biotinylated antibody to form a bead$\beta \mathrm { h C G }$ -biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which diffuses to the Chemibeads and triggers a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is directly proportional to the free and intact $\beta$ human chorionic gonadotropin concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: To evaluate precision, the within-lab and repeatability of the Dimension Vista BHCG Flex assay was calculated using the CLSI EP5-A2 method. Two serum pools and one control were tested in duplicate during two runs per day over 20 days. The results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The reportable range for this assay is $\mathrm { 1 - 1 0 0 0 \ m I U / m L }$ . Linearity across this range was established by pooling four serum samples with high $\beta$ -hCG concentrations and diluting with water. The eleven samples/dilutions all recovered within $10 \%$ of the expected value.

Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Stability: Shelf life for this calibrator is 12 months. Product is stored at 2-8 $^ \circ C$ throughout the testing cycle and tested at the following time intervals: months 0, ¼, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13. The control/reference material is the same lot stored at ${ - 2 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ and tested at the same frequency. The test calibrator material values are recovered versus the calibrations with the control material. Recovery versus time is monitored and percent change over time is determined. Acceptance criteria are changes in value $\leq 2$ SD for Level 1 and less than $5 \%$ for Levels 2-6.

Open well stability and on board stability testing protocols for the flex cartridges and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.

Traceability and Value Assignment: The calibrator master pools are made by adding quantities of purified hCG into bovine calf serum with preservatives. The master lot (5 levels) is stored at ${ } _ { - 2 0 } \mathrm { { \circ C } }$ and values are assigned by using the Dimension Vista clinical chemistry instrument and referenced to the WHO standard for HCG, $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ IS, 75/589. Commercial lots of the calibrator are produced by addition of analyte to bovine calf serum. The concentration of each level of the commercial calibrator lots is verified by using an instrument calibrated with the master pools. The final bottle values for each level of the commercial lot are assigned using three instruments by testing $\mathrm { N } > 4 0$ replicates.

d. Detection limit:

Analytical sensitivity (or limit of the blank) was determined by assaying twenty consecutive replicates of the analyte free (0 level) calibrator on the Dimension Vista BHCG Flex assay. The sensitivity was then calculated by multiplying the standard deviation by two and adding it to the absolute value of the mean. The limit of the blank was calculated to be $0 . 0 4 2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , but the analyzer does not report a reading less than $1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Cross reactivity: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, and human growth hormone (hGH) were spiked into serum to evaluate cross-reactivity. No detectable cross-reactivity was observed for $2 5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ TSH, 1000

mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ prolactin, and $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ hGH.

Interference: The Dimension Vista BHCG Flex assay was evaluated for interference using CLSI Document EP7-A2 as a guideline. Hemoglobin ( $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 m g / d L } )$ , Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated at $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and Lipids $( 3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ did not affect the performance of the assay when 25 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ bhCG was tested. The sponsor defines interference as results exceeding $+ / - 1 0 \%$ of the expected value. Other substances, including various prescription and over-the-counter drugs, were tested and shown not to interfere with this assay.

Hook effect: Hook effect was evaluated using samples containing $\beta$ -hCG concentrations ranging from $0 - 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . Samples consisted of Scripps hCG antigen spiked into bovine calf serum material. The results demonstrated that samples with hCG concentrations up to $3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ do not give results within the assay measuring range.
