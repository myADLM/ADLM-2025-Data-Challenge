# Intended Use / Indications for Use

The NMR LipoProfile® -2 test, used with the NMR Profiler, an automated NMR spectrometer, measures lipoprotein particles to quantify LDL particle number (LDL-P), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in serum and plasma using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. LDL-P and these NMR-derived concentrations of triglycerides and HDL-C are used in conjunction with other lipid measurements and clinical evaluation to aid in the management of lipoprotein disorders associated with cardiovascular disease. This test is performed and provided as a service by LipoScience Laboratory.

# Device Description

# Principle of Operation

The NMR LipoProfile Test involves measurement of the $4 0 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ proton NMR spectrum of a plasma or serum sample, deconvolution of the composite signal at $\mathord { \sim } 0 . 8$ ppm to produce the signal amplitudes of the lipoprotein subclasses that contribute to the composite plasma signal, and conversion of these subclass signal amplitudes to lipoprotein subclass concentrations. The O.8 ppm plasma NMR signal arises from the methyl group protons of the lipids carried in the VLDL, LDL, and HDL subclasses of varying diameter. The NMR signals from the various lipoprotein subclasses have unique and distinctive frequencies and lineshapes, each of which are accounted for in the deconvolution analysis model. Each subclass signal amplitude is proportional to the number of subclass particles emitting the signal, which enables subclass particle

concentrations to be calculated from the subclass signal amplitudes derived from the spectral deconvolution analysis. LDL subclass particle concentrations, in units of nanomoles of particles per liter (nmol/L), are summed to give the reported total LDL particle concentration (LDL-P). By employing conversion factors that assume that the various lipoprotein subclass particles have cholesterol and triglyceride contents characteristic of normolipidemic individuals, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations are also derived.

# Types of Specimen

Freshly drawn serum collected in an NMR LipoTube is the preferred specimen. Freshly drawn serum collected in plain red-top blood collection tubes and EDTA or heparin plasma are also acceptable specimens. The optimum specimen volume is $2 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ . Patient fasting is not necessary prior to the blood draw, except for determination of fasting triglyceride concentrations.

# Testing Procedure

Each patient specimen is diluted 2-fold using the NMR Diluent, mixed thoroughly, and placed in separate specimen vials in predefined locations of the bar-coded measurement racks. Automated testing is then initiated according to the operating instructions.

# Result Calculation

The NMR Profiler test system performs all calculations necessary to produce the final reported results. These calculations include the linear least squares spectral deconvolution analysis which gives the NMR signal amplitudes of each lipoprotein subclass, the conversion of these signal amplitudes to subclass particle concentrations and calculated subclass cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and summation of the appropriate subclass concentrations to give the reported values of LDL-P, HDL-C, and triglycerides.

# Software and Hardware

The NMR Profiler test system contains a Rack Reader, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) system, and a LipoProfile Analysis Server. These three core systems manage information through databases and file systems. The algorithm resident on the LipoProfile Analysis Server is the foundation of the LipoProfile assay. The NMR system and Rack reader are configured off-the-shelf components. The remaining software serves to transmit data, store data, and report the results of the LipoProfile analysis. The LipoProfiler System may be configured as a stand alone system or integrated into a Laboratory Information System (LIS).

# Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence

The NMR LipoProfile test, when used with the NMR Profiler, is as safe and effective as the Dade Dimension Automated LDL Cholesterol Flex Reagent, Carolina Liquid Chemistries Triglycerides Reagent, and Genzyme Liquid N-geneous HDL Cholesterol test. The NMR LipoProfile test has the same intended uses and similar indications and principles of operation as its predicate devices. The minor technological differences between the NMR LipoProfile test and its predicate devices raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Performance data further demonstrate that the NMR LipoProfile test is as safe and effective as its predicate devices. Thus, the NMR LipoProfile test is substantially equivalent.

# Similarity to Predicates

As with the predicate assays, the NMR LipoProfile test is intended for the separation and quantitation of LDL, HDL, and triglycerides in serum and plasma, measurements of which are used in conjunction with other lipid measurements and clinical evaluation to aid in the management of lipoprotein disorders associated with cardiovascular disease.

Therefore, substantial equivalence of the NMR LipoProfile Test to the claimed predicate devices is based upon the following:

• substantially similar intended use and indications for use,   
• use of the same clinical specimen (serum and plasma) substantial similar safety and effectiveness; i.e.; no new questions of safety and effectiveness are raised when the tests are used as intended

# Differences from Predicate

The NMR LipoProfile Test differs from its predicates in three ways, related to the primary technological characteristic difference of the NMR LipoProfile Test, which uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as compared to chemistry-based spectrophotometric detection.

• NMR uses a different energy source  magnetic resonance versus photometric,   
• NMR directly measures lipoprotein particles  direct measure of particle number concentration versus chemistry-based lipid assay, and NMR does not require chemical or enzymatic reactions to measure lipoprotein concentrations.

Therefore, fundamentally the NMR LipoProfile Test and predicates are intended to measure substantially similar information by way of different methods, by evaluating the quality and quantity of lipoproteins in biological specimens using proprietary algorithms, physical measurements, and calculations. Although the NMR LipoProfile Test differs in technological characteristics, the performance of this assays has been shown to be equivalent through the testing of clinical specimens. For LDL-P, substantial equivalence and clinical utility was demonstrated in the target population utilizing appropriate clinical outcome measures and for the measurement of triglycerides and HDL-C, comparing the NMR test results to standard chemical methods for TRIG and HDL-C determination.

# Performance Data - Non-Clinical

Analytical Sensitivity

The analytical sensitivity of the NMR LipoProfile test measurements of LDL-P, HDL-C, and triglycerides was determined as the lowest concentration measurable with acceptable precision and accuracy. Serum specimens with low initial concentrations LDL-P, HDLC, and triglycerides were serially diluted and 20 replicates of each were analyzed. CVs and $\%$ bias between observed and target values were determined and acceptance criteria are based on total error $S20 \%$ . Limits of quantification (LOQ) are 300 nmol/L for LDLP $\mathrm { , 1 0 ~ m g / d L }$ for HDL-C, and $2 5 m g / \mathrm { d L }$ for triglycerides.

# Assay Precision

Intra-assay and inter-assay variability were determined by testing 20 replicates of two patient serum pools in the same run (intra-assay) and in 20 different runs over 4 days (inter-assay). The results of this testing are summarized below:

# Linearity

Two serum pools were prepared from patient specimens with high or low values of LDL-P, HDL-C, and triglycerides as determined by NMR LipoProfile analysis. Each were mixed and diluted in different proportions to produce 12 different samples with widely varying target concentrations. Mean values from analysis of 6 replicates were compared to the expected target values to determine the percent bias for each sample. Linear ranges were determined as follows:

# Interfering Substances

Endogenous substances normally found in blood and exogenous substances (common and prescription drugs) were evaluated for potential interference with the NMR LipoProfile test. Six plasma pools with LDL-P, HDL-C, and triglyceride values spanning the clinically-relevant range were spiked with potential interferents. No appreciable interference was produced by the substances at the spiked levels tested, which were representative of the highest blood concentrations expected for the highest therapeutic doses of these compounds.

Three external clinical outcome studies were conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the NMR Lipoprofile measurement of LDL-P. The studies estimated the prediction of future (incident) cardiovascular disease (CVD) events by previously measured values of LDL-P. Results of all three studies indicated that LDL-P was statistically significantly related to CVD risk

# Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT)

A prospective, nested case-control study was conducted using 1061 plasma samples collected from male patients enrolled in the randomized placebocontrolled Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT), a secondary prevention trial examining the efficacy of gemfibrozil for prevention of new CHD events among men with known CHD and low levels of both HDL and LDL cholesterol. Fasting EDTA plasma samples were collected at baseline and after 7 months from 2,531 men. Case subjects $\mathrm { ( n { = } 3 6 4 ) }$ were men who experienced a CHD event (cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) during the mean 5.1 year follow-up period. Control subjects $( \mathrm { n } { = } 6 9 7 )$ were men matched for age who remained free of CHD events during follow-up.

Table 1 shows the odds ratios (OR) for a new CHD event associated with a 1- SD increment of LDL-P in the subjects treated with placebo $\scriptstyle \left( n = 5 4 6 \right)$ Baseline levels of LDL-P were statistically significantly associated with incident CHD events (odds ratio 1.31 ( $9 5 \%$ CI, 1.09-1.57, $\scriptstyle \mathbf { p = 0 . 0 0 4 } )$ , while on-trial LDL-P values had a somewhat weaker association .

A nested case-control study was performed in the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition)-Norfolk study, which was carried out between 1993 and 1997 to investigate dietary and other determinants of cancer. Additional data were obtained to enable the assessment of determinants of other diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD). The study population comprised 25,663 men and women inhabitants of Norfolk, United Kingdom, aged 45 to 79 years, who completed a baseline questionnaire survey and attended a clinic visit. At this baseline visit, non-fasting serum samples were obtained from participants and stored at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } C$ before NMR LipoProfile testing. Participants were followed for six years for the development of CAD, defined as CAD death, myocardial infarction, and angina. Samples

tested $( n { = } 2 , 8 8 8$ $36 \%$ women; average age 65 years) were from cases $( \mathfrak { n } { = } 1 , 0 0 3 )$ EMPY who developed CAD during the 6-year follow-up period and controls $( n { = } 1 , 8 8 5 )$ EPY who did not develop CAD, matched for age, gender, and enrollment time. None of the cases or controls were taking any lipid altering medications.

LDL-P values measured in this study spanned the range of 485-4156 nmol/L. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for future (incident) CAD, adjusted for smoking and blood pressure plus matching for age, gender, and enrollment time. Table 2 shows the odds ratios for development of CAD by increasing quartiles of LDL-P. LDL-P was statistically significantly associated with an incident CAD events in both univariable analyses and multivariable analyses adjusted for HDL-C and triglycerides.

# Women's Health Study

A study was conducted using 27,673 baseline nonfasting EDTA plasma samples from participants enrolled in the Women's Health Study, a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer in women. Participants were apparently healthy female health care professionals, ages 45 years and older, who were free of self-reported CVD and cancer at study entry and were followed for incident CVD over a mean of 11 years. The CVD endpoint was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, nonfatal ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death. 1,015 CVD events occurred during the follow-up period $( \mathbf { M e a n } \pm \mathbf { S D } = \mathrm { { 1 1 } }$ $\pm 1 . 6$ years; range 0.003 to 12.8 years).

LDL-P values measured in this study spanned the range of 276-4590 nmol/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association of LDL-P by quintile with incident CVD events. The Cox models were adjusted for age, randomized treatment assignment (to aspirin, vitamin E or placebo), smoking status, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index. The results, shown in Table 3, indicate that baseline concentrations of LDL-P were statistically significantly associated with incident CVD events $_ { ( \mathrm { p < 0 . 0 0 1 } ) }$ .
