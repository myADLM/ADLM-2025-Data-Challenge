# 9 Modified Device Information

# NOTE:

We refer to the modified device as the "Assure 4" or the "Modified Assure 4".   
We refer to the unmodified device as "Assure 3" or the "Unmodified Assure 3".

# 9.1 Description of Modified Device

Appendix 1 shows engineering diagrams of the Modified Assure 4 meter, code chip and test strip.

The Assure 4 measures electrical current generated by the interaction of glucose with glucose oxidase in its biosensor test strip.It uses a code chip for strip lot caliration.

Among the changes that have been made (described in Section 9.2), the code chip and test strip have been modified in shape and size to prevent Assure 4 and Assure 3 code chips and test strips from being used interchangeably.

# 9.2 Comparison to Unmodified Device

Table 1 (page 22) summarizes the similarities and differences between the Modified Assure 4 and the Unmodified Assure 3.

# 9.2.1 Similarities

The Modified Assure 4 device has the following similarities to the Unmodified Assure 3:

Identical intended use statements • Identical operating principle • Identical fundamental chemistry • Identical control solutions • Identical base software and algorithm 0 Identical meter LCD

# 9.2.2 Modifications

Modifications of Code Chip

a. The Assure 4 code chip and meter code chip port were changed to prevent interchangeability with the Unmodified Assure 3 meter. The Assure 4 code chip physically cannot fit into the Assure 3 meter code chip port. The Assure 3 ce chs too short omake electrical contac,  inerte into the sue 4 meter code chip port. (See Table 1, page 22, item 14).

Modifications of Test Strip

aThe drop volume of the active chemistry was reduced from 5 µL to $2 \mu L$ b. The concentration of glucose oxidase was increased to compensate for the decrease in absolute volume of active chemistry. This ensures that a sufficient electrical signal is generated and that glucose oxidase is not a ratelimiting step for high glucose levels. The resultant electrical signal can be accommodated with the existing algorithm and calibration procedures. Minor changes were also made in the concentration of the enzyme protector and non-reactive ingredients. (See Table 1, page 2, item 15 and Table 2, page 24).

c. A mesh was eliminated from the Unmodified Assure 3 test strip. Elimination of the mesh allows the reduction in drop volume of the active chemistry, as the mesh absorbs and disperses the active chemistry; thereby increasing the size of the drop of active chemistry needed.

d. A PET (polyethylene terephthalate) laminate film was added above the active chemistry "wel" to create a capillary fill channel that directs the blood to the active chemistry site. Because the channel takes a small amount of blood to fill and because of the increased concentration of glucose oxidase, the test strip is now accurate to a minimum sample volume of $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ , instead of 3.0 μL. The design requires filling the Modified Assure 4 test strip from the side. (See Table 1, page 22, items 16 and 17).

The Unmodified Assure 3 test strip also had the active chemistry site oriented so that it faced the side of the test strip (rather than being on the end of the test strip). The Unmodified Assure 3 test strip can be filled from the top or the side; whereas, the Modified Assure 4 test strip can be filled only from the side by touching the opening of the capillary channel.

e.Strip length was reduced from $4 8 m m$ to $3 8 \mathsf { m m }$ , reducing raw material costs. (See Table 1, page 22, item 18).

f. To eliminate interchangeability of Assure 4 and Assure 3 test strips and meters, the Assure 4 meter has a "post" in the test strip holder which prevents insertion of the Assure 3 test strip. The Assure 4 test strip has a slot that allows insertion into the Assure 4 meter, bypassing the test strip holder "post". The Assure 4 test strip does not work in the Assure 3 meter because the slot in the Assure 4 test strip prevents the strip from pressing the switch wire in the Assure 3 test strip holder. Therefore, insertion of the Assure 4 strip into the Assure 3 meter does not turn on the Assure 3 meter. The switch wire in the Assure 4 meter strip holder is off to one side, such that the slotted Assure 4 strip is able to turn on the Assure 4 meter. (See Table 1, page 22, item 19).

# Modifications of Meter

a. The code chip port for the Modified Assure 4 was changed to match the altered shape of the Assure 4 code chip. The Assure 4 code chip physically cannot fit into the Assure 3 meter. The Assure 3 code chip is too short to make electrical contact, if inserted into the Assure 4 meter code chip port. (See Table 1, page 22, item 14).

b.The Modified Assure 4 meter test strip holder has a "post" to prevent usage of Unmodified Assure 3 test strips in the Modified Assure 4 meter. (See Table 1, page 22, item 19).

cThe outer case of the Assure 4 meter was changed to:

i. Improve aesthetics (curved shape on sides as opposed to straight sides of Unmodified Assure 3). (See Table 1, page 22, item 20).   
ii. Differentiate Assure 4 from Assure 3 for commercial reasons.   
iii. Accommodate the two AAA batteries used in the Modified Assure 4. The Assure 4 has a larger battery compartment and a new battery compartment door design. The Unmodified Assure 3 uses the smaller CR-2032 wafer battery. (See Table 1, page 22, item 29).

d. The single meter button used to operate the meter has been made oval (instead of circular) for improved aesthetics. (See Table 1, page 22, item 21).

e. Assure 4 units of measurement are mg/dL only and cannot be changed to mmol/L. (See Table 1, page 22, item 22).

f. Assure 4 meter display shows numbers (9, 8, 7, etc.) for count down after blood application, instead of dashes $( \cdots , - \cdot , - )$ used by the Assure 3. This change was made for aesthetic and commercial reasons. (See Table 1, page 22, item 23).

g. Increased memory capacity to 50 results (up from 10) and added sequential number to all memory results. (See Table 1, page 22, item 24).

New system or conducing control solution testing and resistivecheckng.

i.In the Assure 3 meter, the user must sequentially insert both ends of a Check Strip into the test strip holder. This checks the meter function by applying a known resistive value to the meter. It also activates the Control Solution Mode for the meter. In the control solution mode, the Assure 3 meter uses the control solution calibration curves and does not store the control solution result in memory. (See Table 1, page 22, item 25).

iIn the Modified Assure 4 meter:

an internal resistance has been added to the circuitry and this is checked upon start up of the meter, eliminating the need for the Check Strip. (See Table 1, page 22, item 25).   
2. The user enters the control mode by inserting a test strip and pressing the single meter button once for Level 1 Control Solution, twice for Level 2 Control Solution.See Table 1, page   
22, item 26).   
3.Control solution results are stored in memory and are marked with "c". (See Table 1, page 22, item 27).

i. Meter allows operation in a wider operating temperature range of $5 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { F } \mathrm { ~ - ~ }$ EY $10 4 ^ { \circ } F$ . The Unmodified Assure 3 operating range is $6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { F } - 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { F }$ .For commercial reasons, we tested the Modified Assure 4 further and found that the system supports the wider $5 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { F } - 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { F }$ Operating Temperature range - there is sufficient temperature compensation in the algorithm to support this wider range. Both the Assure 4 and Assure 3 give out an error message (flashing temperature icon) when the meter is used outside its thermal operating range. (See Table 1, page 22, item 28).

j. Changed power supply from one CR-2032 battery to two AAA batteries, increasing the number of tests that can be run from 1000 to 3000 test per each set of batteries. (See Table 1, page 22, items 29 and 30).

k. Assure 4 dimensions and weight are slightly different from that of the Assure 3 meter. (See Table 1, page 22, item 31).

Table 1 (page 22) summarizes the similarities and differences between the Modified Assure 4 and the Unmodified Assure 3.
