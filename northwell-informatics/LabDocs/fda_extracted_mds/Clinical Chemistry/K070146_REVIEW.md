# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity determination was based upon CLSI EP6-A. Urea concentrations were prepared by diluting a high concentration sample with urine containing a low concentration of urea. Samples were serially measured from 55 to 2154 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ (19.7 to $7 6 6 . 9 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ ). Linear regression statistics were $y = 0 . 9 8 7 8 x + 0 . 1 5 8 3$ ; $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 8$ . The linear range tested was 55 to $2 1 5 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (19.7 to $7 6 6 . 9 \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ . The sponsor claims a measuring range for ABX Urea CP of $3 5 - 2 1 0 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (12.6 to $7 5 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ).

A post dilution study was performed to test samples above the linear range. This study was performed by testing 2 samples above the linear limit of the assay $2 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $8 0 0 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ). These tests showed that the automatic dilution gave a bias of less than $8 \%$ up to $1 0 5 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

A complementary study was performed to provide additional samples $( \mathrm { n } { = } 6 )$ to more thoroughly cover the post-dilution assay range. Spiked samples were

used for this study at concentrations of 2274, 3156, 5060, 6910, 8876, and $9 7 7 2 { \mathrm { ~ m g / d L } }$ . Assays were performed on split samples using both manual dilution and auto-post dilution. A bias of $\leq 1 0 \%$ was considered observed.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The ABX PENTRA Controls are traceable to a Master Lot of Horiba calibrator that was cleared under k060205.

Real time stability of the control was determined when stored after lyophilization at $4 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ . Results have determined a real time stability of24 months. Pentra Control closed stability was determined to be 18 months

Stability after reconstitution was determined on three different lots of controls.   
Recovery of each parameter has been analyzed at different storage conditions.

Open stability of the parameters:

12 hours at $1 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$   
5 days at $2 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$   
1 month at $- 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank was calculated from the mean of 30 measurements of saline $+ 4 . 6 5 \mathrm { S D }$ . The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined to be $3 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $1 2 . 6 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interfering substances in solution were added to the base urine at two different urea concentrations (normal and high). Each sample was then serially diluted with the same neat base urine to adjust urea concentration.

Conclusions:

- Hemoglobin $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } - 5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L }$ does not interfere with urea determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP.   
- Conjugated Bilirubin up to $3 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ does not interfere with urea   
determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP.   
- Ascorbic Acid up to $3 5 0 \mathrm { u m o l / L }$ does not interfere with urea   
determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP   
- Specific Gravity within the range of 1.005 – 1.035 does not interfere with urea determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP   
- pH within normal urine $\mathrm { p H } \left( 5 - 8 \right)$ does not interfere with urea   
determination by the Horiba ABX Pentra Urea CP
