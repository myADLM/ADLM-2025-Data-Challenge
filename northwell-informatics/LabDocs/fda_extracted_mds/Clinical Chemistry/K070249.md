# Description:

All the reagents, controls and calibrators included in this submission are for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 (K052007), which is a discrete photometric benchtop clinical chemistry analyzer.

The ABX PENTRA Calcium CP is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of calcium in human serum, plasma and urine based on a photometric test using orthocresolphtalein complexone. It is composed of a bi-reagent cassette, with $6 6 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ and $1 6 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ compartments. Reagents are chemical solutions with additives.

The ABX PENTRA Creatinine CP is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of creatinine in human serum, plasma and urine based on a kinetic method using alkaline picrate (Jaffé method). It is composed of a bi-reagent cassette, with two 28 ml compartments. Reagents are chemical solutions with additives.

The ABX PENTRA Phosphorus CP is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of phosphorus in human serum, plasma and urine based on a UV method using phosphomolybdate. It is composed of a mono-reagent cassette, with $2 9 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ compartment. The reagent is a chemical solution with additives.

The ABX PENTRA Amylase CP is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of alpha-amylase in human serum, plasma and urine based on an enzymatic photometric test. The assay is composed of a bi-reagent cassette, with $2 6 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ and $6 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ E compartments. Reagents are chemical solutions with additives.

The ABX PENTRA Urine Control L/H is a two-level (Low and High) quality control consisting of liquid solutions prepared from human urine with chemical additives and materials of biological origin added as required to obtain given component levels. The assigned values of the control components are given in the enclosed annexe, ensuring control of the appropriate HORIBA ABX methods on the ABX PENTRA 400 analyzer. Each control level is provided in one vial of $\boldsymbol { \mathbf { \ell } } _ { \mathrm { l 0 ~ m l } }$ .

# Intended Use :

All reagents in this submission are intended for use on the ABX PENTRA 400 for the quantitative in-vitro determination of their respective analytes (Calcium, Creatinine, Phosphorus, Amylase) using human serum, plasma and urine.

The controls, calibrators and additional reagents are intended for use in association with the above reagents.

# Discussion of Performance Data:

ABX Pentra Calcium CP (K060205), ABX Pentra Creatinine CP (K060205), ABX Pentra Phosphorus CP (K060205) and ABX Amylase CP (K062180) have already been cleared by the FDA for use on serum and plasma samples. No modification has been made to these devices. The performances on serum and plasma samples have not been modified. Therefore, for these 4 devices, only added performances, on urine samples, are discussed below.

Dear Pascal Macziola:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to dvic that v beecassifrdanc wi he oviions  the Fedeal FooDrg and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application o labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
