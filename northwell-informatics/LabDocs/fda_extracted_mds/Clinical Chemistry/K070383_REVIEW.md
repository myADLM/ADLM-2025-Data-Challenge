# L. Test Principle:

The enzyme creatinine amidohydrolase is used to convert creatinine to creatine. The enzymatic approach to the quantitation of creatine is to use the enzyme creatine amidinohydrolase, which yields sarcosine and urea, the former being measured with further enzyme-linked steps using sarcosine oxidase and peroxidase to produce a colored product.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Serum linearity was evaluated by measuring 7 serum samples ranging in concentration from 0.00 to $4 5 . 3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . All samples were run $\mathrm { n } { = } 4$ . Linear regression analysis was performed resulting in a slope of 1.051 and a yintercept of -0.192. The mean recovery of each sample was within $\pm 8 \%$ of its assigned value. The reportable range for serum/plasma samples is from 0.04 to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Urine linearity was evaluated by measuring 9 urine samples ranging in concentration from 0.01 to $2 0 6 . 7 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . All samples were run $\mathrm { n } { = } 4$ . Linear regression analysis was performed resulting in a slope of 0.982 and a yintercept of 2.274. The mean recovery of each sample was within $\pm 5 \%$ of its assigned value. The reportable range for urine sample is from 0.03 to 175 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Performance testing was performed with an aqueous based commercially available calibrator traceable to NIST SRM 914A.

# d. Detection limit:

The lower limit of quantitation for both serum and urine was determined by assaying 40 replicates of multiple sample concentrations. This value was defined as the mean of the lowest sample concentration with a CV of $20 \%$ or lower. The lower limit of detection for serum was $0 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and for urine was $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interferences from icterus, lipemia, hemolysis and ascorbic acid were evaluated for this creatinine method on a Bayer ADVIA 1650 analyzer using a significance criterion of $> 1 0 \%$ variance from control. Interference data for serum and urine was provided. Plasma was expected to be similar to that of serum.

No significant lipemic interference was found at Intralipid levels from 0-1000 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ( $\mathrm { 0 { - } 3 0 0 0 m g / d L }$ triglycerides) in a $0 . 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ serum sample and a 31.7 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ urine sample.

No significant hemoglobin intereference was found at hemoglobin levels from $\mathrm { 0 { - } 1 0 0 0 m g / d L }$ in $0 . 7 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ serum sample and a $7 1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urine sample.

No significant ascorbic acid interference was found at ascorbic acid levels from $0 { - } 3 0 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / d L } }$ in a $0 . 7 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ serum sample and a $1 3 7 . 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urine sample.

No significant icteric interference was found at conjugated bilirubin levels from $\mathrm { 0 { - } 4 0 \ m g / d L }$ in a $9 5 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ urine sample.

No significant icteric interference was found at conjugated bilirubin levels from $\mathrm { 0 { - } 4 0 \ m g / d L }$ in a $1 . 0 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ serum sample.

No significant icteric interference was found at unconjugated bilirubin levels from $\mathrm { 0 { - } 1 6 \ m g / d L }$ in a $0 . 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ serum sample.
