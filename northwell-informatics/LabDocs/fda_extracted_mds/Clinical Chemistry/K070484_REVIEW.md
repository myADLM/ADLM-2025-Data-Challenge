# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The cut-off of the test is $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . Seven control solutions (pooled urine samples from males and females) were created with target FSH concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ using a WHO 78/549 determined reference solution. Each solution was then run one time on the QuantRx Female Fertility Test for ten consecutive days. The results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The test is calibrated against the WHO $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ IRP 78/549 of FSH.

# d. Detection limit:

Seven control solutions (pooled urine from males and females) were created with target FSH concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and $2 5 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ using a WHO 78/549 determined reference solution. The QuantRx Female Fertility Test was assayed one time on ten consecutive days using each solution. The strips were removed and digitally photographed, then quantitated using Adobe Photoshop. A dose response curve was calculated from the means of each concentration. The lower limit of detection (LLD) was calculated from the SD around the $2 . 5 \mathrm { \ m I U / m L }$ calibrator. The $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (2SD from the zero value) was used to determine the LLD from the standard fit to the curve. That value was calculated to be 0.6 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To determine potential cross-reactivity, the QuantRx Female Fertility Test was analyzed using solutions with FSH $50 \%$ above or $50 \%$ below the assay threshold of $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and spiked with high physiological concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The results showed no cross-reactivity from TSH at $2 0 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L }$ or LH at $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . High levels of hCG (up to 100,000 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ ) were not cross reactive (e.g., did not produce a test line signal). However, negative interference of a positive FSH signal was observed at high hCG levels. This was addressed with a limitation in the labeling about inaccurate results being obtained during pregnancy.

In addition to the hormones listed above, the QuantRx Female Fertility Test was tested for interference using solutions with FSH $50 \%$ above or $50 \%$ below the assay threshold of $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ and spiked with the following compounds at a level $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ : ascorbic acid, acetaminophen, albumin, bilirubin, caffeine, glucose, hemoglobin, and serum protein. No interference was observed.

f. Assay cut-off: See Precision/Reproducibility.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A comparison study was conducted to demonstrate concordance between results from the proposed device and an legally marketed serum FSH device. A total of 40 peri-menopausal age women (35 to 50 years old) were recruited. Each of the test subjects collected their own urine and conducted testing on the proposed device, using the dip method as described in the labeling. The urine specimens were subsequently tested by professionals. Upon completion of the urine testing, each subject provided a matching blood sample which was analyzed on the serum FSH device. The results of the consumer and professional analyses of the proposed device and corresponding serum results, which ranged from 1.9 to $9 6 . 1 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , are shown in the following tables:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Professional</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elevated≥10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveAgreement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal&lt;10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeAgreement</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>QuantRxTM</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>91%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>27</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>93%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum FSH</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Consumer</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elevated≥10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveAgreement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal&lt;10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeAgreement</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>QuantRxTM</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>9</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>81%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>27</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>93%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum FSH</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>11</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29</td></tr></table>

Supplemental testing was performed using eight spiked solutions around the cutoff. The solutions were created from a WHO FSH standard, targeted to 8.0 $\mathrm { m U / m L }$ and $1 2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ , and blind labeled. The solutions were then analyzed on the proposed device by eight consumers and subsequently tested by a professional. All twelve specimens (four clinical and eight contrived) that fell within the $\pm 2 0 \%$ of the cutoff were correctly interpreted by the consumers and professional. The results of the consumer and professional analyses of the proposed device and corresponding serum results or spiked

urine, with the original and supplemental data, are shown in the tables below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Professional</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elevated≥10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveAgreement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal&lt;10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeAgreement</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>QuantRxTM</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>16</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>94%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>29</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>94%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum FSHSpiked Urine</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>17</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>31</td></tr></table>

The overall professional agreement was $94 \%$ . The overall consumer agreement was $92 \%$ . The concordance of the professional vs. consumer was $9 8 \%$ .

Another comparison study was conducted to demonstrate concordance between the results from the proposed device performed by professionals and a quantitative FSH laboratory device. A total of 69 fresh urine specimens and 140 blinded, coded specimens were used in the study. The fresh urine specimens represented various stages of each subject’s cycle including day 3 of menses and were found to range from $< 0 . 3$ to $1 2 2 . 8 \ : \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . The coded specimens were banked urine specimens of known FSH concentration ranging from 1.4 to $1 7 . 3 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . The results were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elevated≥10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveAgreement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal&lt;10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeAgreement</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Professional</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>55</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>71%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>131</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>99%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ComparatorFSH LabMethod</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>132</td></tr></table>

The overall agreement between the new device (when performed by professionals) and the comparative device is $89 \%$ .

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

A study was conducted to demonstrate the ability of lay persons to correctly interpret the test results compared with the results from a quantitative, laboratory FSH method. A total of 209 female subjects representing various demographics participated. Sixty-nine (69) of the subjects conducted testing using their own specimens via the midstream procedure and provided a urine sample for quantitation. The remaining 140 subjects were provided blinded urine specimens of previously determined FSH concentrations and conducted the testing using the dip procedure.

Fifteen (15) of the proposed devices used in this study were modified to mimic invalid test results. This was accomplished by removing the conjugate pad located between the sample wick and the nitrocellulose membrane. All 15 subjects given the modified devices correctly interpreted the results as invalid and were given another device to repeat testing. The replacement devices were unmodified and produced valid results. The results from the consumer study, including those from the consumer questionnaire, are below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elevated≥10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveAgreement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal&lt;10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeAgreement</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Consumers</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>54</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>70%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>130</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>98%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ComparatorFSH LabMethod</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>132</td></tr></table>

The overall agreement between the new device (when tested by consumers) and the comparative lab FSH device is $8 8 \%$ .

The consumer questionnaire results showed that out of 191 consumers, $100 \%$ thought the written instructions were clear and easy to follow. Also, $100 \%$ felt the new test was easy to perform.

The results of a comparison of the consumer performing the test versus the professional performing the test are shown below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Elevated≥10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>PositiveAgreement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Normal&lt;10 mIU/mL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>NegativeAgreement</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Consumer</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>54</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>98%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>130</td><td rowspan=2 colspan=1>99%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Professional</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>131</td></tr></table>

The results demonstrate that the performance of the QuantRx Female Fertility Test in the hands of the lay user is comparable to the performance in the hands of a trained professional.
