# Device Description:

The Dimension VistaTM FERR Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge assay is a homogenous, sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay based on $\mathrm { L O C I ^ { r m } }$ technology. The $\mathbf { L O C I ^ { T M } }$ reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-ferritin monoclonal antibody fragment. The first bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. The second bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with a second anti-ferritin monoclonal antibody and contains chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form a particle/ferritin/biotinylated antibody sandwich. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at $6 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at $6 1 2 \mathrm { n m }$ and is a direct function of the ferritin concentration in the sample.

The Dimension Vista™ LOCI 4 Calibrator is a five level, liquid calibrator. It is packaged as a kit of 10 vials, two vials each of five levels. The product matrix is $6 \%$ bovine serum albumin with buffer, stabilizer and preservatives. Level A is zero. Levels B through E contain Ferritin at the following target concentrations :

# Intended Use:

The FERR method is an in-vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of ferritin in human serum and plasma (lithium or sodium heparin and EDTA) on the Dimension VistaTM system. Measurements of ferritin aid in the diagnosis of diseases affecting iron metabolism, such as hemochromatosis (iron overload) and iron deficiency anemia.

The LOCI 4 Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the Ferritin (FERR) method on the Dimension VistaTM system.

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

Both the Dimension Vista™M Ferritin Flex $\mathfrak { B }$ reagent cartridge (FERR) assay (catalogue number K6440) and the predicate Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Ferritin Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge assay (catalogue number RF440) employ prepackaged reagents for use on automated clinical chemistry test systems.
