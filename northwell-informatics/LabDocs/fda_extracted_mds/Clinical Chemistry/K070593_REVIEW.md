4. Special instrument requirements:

Home Diagnostics brand Smart System blood glucose meters such as the TrueTrack and Prestige IQ Smart System meters.

TrackRecord DMS is compatible with Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), Windows 2000 and Windows XP Home and Professional. The software operates per 600 MHz Intel $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Pentium $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ III or equivalent, with a minimum $1 2 8 \mathrm { M B }$ of RAM, and uses $1 0 0 - 2 0 0 \mathrm { M B }$ during installation and $1 0 0 \mathrm { M B }$ after installation. A 9-pin / 25-pin COM or USB port is required with a serial or USB data cable. A CD-ROM is required.

# I. Device Description:

Software application features include data management for single at-home patient use and multiple-patient use for the healthcare professional in the clinical setting. Users can input patient healthcare and ID information, and select date range, glucose units, target glucose ranges, and meal time blocks.

Five reports are available:

1) Summary Report that combines the reports listed below.   
2) Electronic Log Book that displays glucose results in a similar manner to a paper log book   
3) Conformance Report to graphically represent the percentages of glucose results outside the target range and below the hypoglycemic threshold previously set up by the user.   
4) Trend Report to show a graphical representation of daily blood glucose results.   
5) Extended Log Book Report is a more comprehensive report than the Log Book Report displaying patient information, glucose target and hypoglycemic ranges, reference method, date of the report, and date range of 2 glucose results. The report calculates the average result for the time slot, the number of results above the target range for that time slot, the number of results below the target range for that time slot, the number of hypoglycemic results for that time slot, and the percentages for above target, below target, within target, and hypoglycemic.

$b$ . Clinical specificity: see above associated devices   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): A Human Factors Study using 101 subjects was conducted to evaluate the TrackRecord DMS with the following objectives:

1. To evaluate design and ease-of-use   
2. To document participant feedback on the features / functions   
3. To document Observer feedback on participant performance   
4. To validate the user instructions are accurate and easy to follow   
5. To evaluate participant ratings with respect to features / functions   
6. To report any discrepancies (bugs/error messages) found during the   
evaluation

These objectives address ease-of-use, instructions for use and product labeling information. This study was comprehensive and included application tests (feature/function tests) and questionnaire items. The subjects (Users) had

never used TrackRecord DMS and had no prior exposure to TrackRecord DMS or its corresponding Instructions for Use.

Subjects were required to have a minimum of basic computer skills and feel comfortable using a Windows-based Operating System. The study subjects consisted of a mixture of healthcare professionals (multiple patient usage) and persons representing home users (single patient usage).

Conclusions were based on the subjects’ ability to demonstrate by usage and evaluation (rating) of features/functions (recorded as responses to 21 feature/function tests), their understanding of the applications of the DMS software, their understanding of how to use the software (install, upload/enter data and patient information, and generate/print reports), their comprehension of the contents of the instructions for use, as well as user assessment of easeof-use based on a separate questionnaire. The 21 feature/function tests per user were divided into 5 main categories:

1) 2) Installation   
User Interface / Owner’s Manual   
3) Set up   
4) Downloading Results   
5) Patient Management / Reports

Performance of each User was recorded and evaluated by HDI study administrators (Observers), who are familiar with proper use of TrackRecord DMS. Observers rated each subject’s performance using four general questions as follows:

1) Subject was successful in installing the DMS program?   
2) Report printouts were accurate and complete?   
3) Subject performed required functions satisfactorily?   
4) Subject accessed “Help” and Technical Support contact information?

Data forms completed by both Users (study subjects) and Observers were provided. Evaluation of the data was performed by an Expert Review Panel, comprised of professionals with expertise in the areas of medical device design, customer and technical support, product quality and quality assurance, and clinical application of the product class.
