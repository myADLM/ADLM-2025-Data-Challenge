# Device Name

Proprietary name:

Elecsys PTH Immunoassay Elecsys PTH STAT Immunoassay

Common name: Parathyroid Hormone Assay

Classification name: Radioimmunoassay, Parathyroid Hormone

# Device Description

The Elecsys PTH and Elecsys PTH STAT Assays are two step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code.

# Intended use/Indications for Use

The Elecsys PTH Immunoassay is for the in vitro quantitative determination of intact parathyroid hormone in human serum and plasma as an aid in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia and can be used intraoperatively.

The Elecsys PTH STAT Immunoassay is for the in vitro quantitative determination of intact parathyroid hormone in human serum and plasma for the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia and can be used intraoperatively.

The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay "ECLIA" is intended for use on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

# Substantial equivalence

The Elecsys PTH and Elecsys PTH STAT Test Systems are substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in the United States. The Elecsys PTH and Elecsys PTH STAT Immunoassays (expanded intended use) are equivalent to the Elecsys Parathyroid Hormone Test System (K992680).

# Device Comparison Table

The following table compares the Elecsys PTH and Elecsys PTH STAT Test Systems and the predicate device. The predicate labeling used as the source document for the comparison is that provided to FDA in K961481/A003.

Dear Ms. Taylor:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) u i marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
