# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys PTH Assay is a two step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code. The assay time is 18 minutes.

Published literature was provided to support the intraoperative claim 1,2, 3. Studies were conducted on patients undergoing parathyroidectomy to evaluate the Elecsys PTH STAT assay (on Elecysy 1010 analyzer) and the Elecsys PTH assay (on Elecsys 2010 analyzer). The assay results were compared to clinical data and reported in the following peer reviewed journals:

# Study#1:

The study evaluated the Elecsys PTH assay for its intraoperative applicability in 109 patients with either a diagnosis of Primary Hyperparathyroidism $( \mathrm { n } { = } 3 3 )$ , or Secondary Hyperparathyroidism due to renal disease $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 7 6 )$ . Of the latter cohort, 52 patients were on dialysis and 24 had a renal transplant. This study was conducted using the currently marketed Elecsys PTH STAT assay on the Elecsys 1010 instrurment.

Blood samples were drawn after administration of anesthesia for baseline measurements and at 10 minutes and 20 minutes post resection of the parathyroid glands. The study used the generally accepted guidelines that a $5 5 0 \%$ decrease in PTH value from baseline suggests complete tumor removal. Of the 109 patients in the study group, 107 showed sufficient decrease by the second draw with an average decay of PTH of $7 9 . 2 \%$ of basal level within 10 minutes for the primary hyperparathyroid group, and $8 3 . 8 \%$ of basal level by 20 minutes. Among the renal patients the decay averaged $8 5 . 8 \% \%$ of basal level by 10 minutes and $8 7 . 2 \%$ by 20 minutes. Among the renal transplant patients the average decay from baseline was $8 7 . 6 \%$ in 10 minutes and $8 9 . 8 \%$ from baseline in 20 minutes.

Two patients did not show the sufficient $50 \%$ drop by the second draw at 20 minutes and therefore were classified correctly as unsuccessful surgeries. However, in both cases a second surgery was required and both surgeries were successful based on the required decay of $50 \%$ of the PTH value.

The assay met the generally accepted criterion of $a > 5 0 \%$ decrease from baseline (before incision) with complete tumor removal for 107 out of 109 patients initially and 2 out of 2 patients in follow-up surgeries.

# Study #2:

The study was conducted using the currently marketed Elecsys PTH assay on the Elecsys 2010 instrument. In total, 34 patients underwent parathyroidectomy surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism, 31 of which underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy and 3 total parathyroidectomy. The study was divided into two parts. The first part used the first 12 patients to compare the Elecsys PTH assay with the DPC Immulite assay and the Nichols Quick PTH assay. The second part of the study tested the ability of the Elecsys PTH assay to be used intraoperatively using the criterion of a decrease of $50 \%$ from baseline as the guideline for designation of a successful surgery, and combined the remaining 22 patients tested with only the Elecsys PTH assay giving a total of 34 patients evaluated.

The results of the comparisons are as follows: The Elecsys PTH assay was compared to the DPC Immulite assay and showed a correlation coefficient of 0.997 with no significant differences. The Elecsys PTH assay was then compared to the Nichols Quick assay using the same samples and showed a correlation coefficient of 0.987 with no significant differences.

For the 34 patients evaluated for successful parathyroidectomies based on PTH values, 33 patients showed $5 5 0 \%$ decrease from baseline levels at 5 minutes. The average level of decrease was $74 \%$ of the baseline level at 5 minutes post resection. At 15 minutes post resection, all patients showed $5 5 0 \%$ with an average level decrease of $82 \%$ of baseline level.

The assay met the generally accepted criterion of $a > 5 0 \%$ decrease from baseline (before incision) with complete tumor removal in 34 out of 34 patients in this study.

# Study #3:

In this study, the investigators used two successive criteria of PTH decrease at the 15 minute time point. The first criterion was a PTH level at 15 minutes $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ or less. If this was not achieved, the second criterion of a relative PTH decrease of $30 \%$ or less was used.

153 patients underwent parathyroid surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism and had blood drawn both pre- (before preparation of the parathyroid glands) and post (15 minutes after completion of the parathyroid resection) resections of the parathyroid glands to determine the applicability of the Elecsys PTH assay to predict a successful resection. 123 patients underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy and 13 patients underwent total parathyroidectomy during initial surgeries. Of the 153 patients, 24 had normal kidney function after transplant and 129 suffered from terminal renal failure. The samples were assayed on the Elecsys 2010 instrument and the per cent decrease was calculated from the baseline measurements.

The mean PTH decay from baseline for all patients was $8 1 \%$ at 15 minutes (862 $\mathrm { p g / m l }$ to $1 6 7 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L ) }$ ). All 24 patients with compensated renal failure had PTH levels decrease $5 5 0 \%$ predicting successful operations. Of the 129 patients with terminal renal failure, the Elecsys PTH test showed 114 patients met both criteria. Of these, 108 had a true decline in PTH with no postoperative hyperparathyroidism, and 6 had a false decline in PTH with no persistent hyperparathyroidism. On the other hand, 15 patients did not meet both criteria and in whom only 3 parathyroid glands were found during surgery. Of these, 13 were classified as true failure to decline and 2 were classified as false failure to decline.

The assay met the generally accepted criterion of a $5 5 0 \%$ decrease from baseline with complete tumor removal.
