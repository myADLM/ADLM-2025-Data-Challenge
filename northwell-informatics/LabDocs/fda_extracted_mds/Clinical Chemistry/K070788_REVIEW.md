# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Between-run precision of the Elecsys Cortisol Test System was evaluated on Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 analyzer using a modified CLSI replication experiment. The protocol consisted of testing one replicate of each control (PC $\varprojlim .$ PreciControl) or sample (HS=human saliva, SHS $\equiv$ spiked human saliva) per day for 10 days. Between-run precision was calculated according to EP5- A2.

\*sample concentration is above the Limit of Blank, but below the Limit of Detection of this assay. (see Detection Limit section below). Values below 8.5 nmol/L are not reliable as the coefficient of variation is $> 2 0 \%$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The measuring range is $1 . 0 0 { - } 1 7 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ or $0 . 0 3 6 \mathrm { - } 6 3 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / d L }$ (defined by the limit of detection and the maximum of the master curve). Performance of the device across the measuring range was established in k000270, k021218, and k043175. Performance information at the low end of the assay range is summarized in the Detection Limit section below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Established in k000270, k021218, and k043175.

d. Detection limit:

The limit of blank and limit of detection were determined in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A requirements.

The limit of blank $( \leq 0 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ or $\leq 0 . 0 1 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / d L } )$ ) is the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile value from $\mathrm { n } \geq 6 0$ measurements of an analyte-free sample over several independent series. The limit of blank corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free samples are found with a probability of $9 5 \%$ .

The limit of detection $\left( \leq 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L } \mathrm { o r } \leq 0 . 0 3 6 \mu \mathrm { g / d L } \right)$ is determined based on the limit of blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The limit of detection corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be detected (value above the limit of blank with a probability of $9 5 \%$ ).

The limit of quantitation $8 . 5 0 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ or $0 . 0 7 \mu \mathrm { g / d L } )$ ) is the lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly measured with a between-run coefficient of variation of $\leq 2 0 \%$ . It has been determined using low concentration saliva samples.

Because the $\% \mathrm { C V }$ of low concentration samples is high, values below the LoQ should be reported with caution. The package insert has been revised to read: “When reporting values below $\mathbf { 8 . 5 \ n m o l / L }$ , the client report should be annotated with the following information. “Values below $\mathbf { 8 . 5 \ n m o l / L }$ are not reliable as the coefficient of variation is $\geq 2 0 \%$ .”
