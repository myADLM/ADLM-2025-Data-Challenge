# L. Test Principle

Creatinine is determined by enzymatic colorimetric assay. Creatinine is converted to sarcosine with the aid of creatininase and creatinase. Sarcosine is then converted to glycine, formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of oxygen by sarcosine oxidase. The liberated hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminophenazone and HTIB to form a quinone imine chromogen in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase. The color intensity is directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine present and can be measured photometrically at $5 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .

b. Linearity/ Assay reportable range.

Serum/plasma

The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. Linearity was tested on serum samples medium and high for examination of various ranges of creatinine concentration. The samples were diluted in 11 steps (from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$ ) with saline as diluent. Four replicate measurements were performed using one reagent lot. The linearity of CREATININE (Enzymatic) was analyzed on T60 over a measured range of 0.07 to $0 . 7 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ with the linearity summary as Slope: 0.985; intercept: 0.000; Obs. Err: $4 . 4 \%$ ; N: 11.

The Linearity of CREATININE (Enzymatic) was analyzed on T60 over a measured range of 0.798 to $3 4 . 9 4 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ with the linearity summary as Slope: 0.969; intercept: 0.786; Obs. Err: $1 . 5 \%$ ; N: 11. The claimed measuring range is $0 . 1 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to 28.0 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# Urine:

The linearity study was performed using CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. Four parallel measurements were made in random order using one reagent lot. The samples were diluted in 11 steps. Urine was spiked with commercially available creatinine solution to a value of $5 3 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The dilutions were made to urine and further diluted with saline. The Linearity of CREATININE (Enzymatic) was analyzed on T60 over a measured range of 2.3 to $4 5 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ with the linearity summary as Slope: 1.001; intercept: 0.082; Obs. Err: $2 . 2 \%$ ; N: 11. The claimed measuring range is $2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $4 5 2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators or methods)

The stability claim was verified using an accelerated stability protocol. The assay was calibrated using a valid calibrator and accelerated calibrator material was measured as sample in triplicates. The verification of the real time stability is on going. The acceptance criteria for the calibrator were $\pm ~ 5 \%$ of the target value. The open vial stability of the sCal, Nortrol and Abtrol were established. The opened vials were stored tightly capped at $2 ^ { \circ } C \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } C$ for nine days. Three vials of calibrator/control material were measured as samples in triplicates at time points of 4, 7 and 9 days. The acceptance criteria for the calibrator were $\pm 5 \%$ of the initials value. The acceptance criteria for the controls were $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the initial value.

Reagents in unopened vials are stable at $2 ^ { \circ } C \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } C$ until the expiry date printed on the label. Refer to the Application Notes of T60 instrument for the on board stability of reagents.

# Calibration material

The sCal, kit code 981831, when used according to the instructions provided for T60 instrument may remain on the instrument for a maximum of one hour.

# Traceability:

The calibrator values were obtained by multi determinations performed by Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy. The assigned value is the median of all values obtained. The assigned value of the calibrator is traceable to NIST reference material (SRM 967).

# Quality Control materials

The values on control materials are traceable to the reference material, NIST SRM 967. Users are instructed in the labeling to use quality control samples at least once a day and after each calibration and every time a new bottle of reagent is used. It is recommended to use at least two levels (low and high) of controls. Available controls are Nortrol, kit code: 981043 and Abtrol, kit code: 981044.

d. Detection Limit:

The study was performed using CLSI EP17-A as a guideline. In the limit of blank study thirty replicates of a blank sample $( 0 . 9 \% \mathrm { N a C l } )$ were assayed using two T60 instruments and two reagent lots with the total number of measurements being 60.

Limit Of Blank (LOB): The Limit Of Blank (LOB) represents the highest measurement result that is likely to be observed for a blank sample ( $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl, $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ ). Based upon the studies conducted for LOB, the following results were obtained:

Serum/plasma: $0 . 0 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; Urine: $0 . 1 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

In the Limit of Detection study five low level samples were assayed in ten replicates with two $\mathrm { T } 6 0$ instruments and two reagent lots during two days with the total number of measurements being 100. Based upon the studies conducted for LOD, the following results were obtained:

Limit of Detection (LOD): Limit of Detection (LOD) represents the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected $\mathrm { ( n { = } l 0 0 }$ ).

Serum/plasma: $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; Urine: $0 . 2 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$
