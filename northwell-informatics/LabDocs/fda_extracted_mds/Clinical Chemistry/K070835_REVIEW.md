# L. Test Principle:

The Olympus Creatine Kinase-MB assay uses 2 steps to determine the presence of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme in human serum or plasma. The R1 reagent contains an antibody which binds the M subunit of CK in the serum sample thereby inhibiting the activity of the M subunit. The B subunit of the enzyme remains free to act on the substrate present in the R2 reagent. CK reversibly catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from creatine phosphate to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to give creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as products. The ATP formed is used to produce glucose-6-phosphate and ADP from glucose. The glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to give NADPH and 6-phosphogluconate. The rate of increase of absorbance at $3 4 0 / 6 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ due to the formation of NADPH is directly proportional to the activity of CK/MB in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor conducted precision studies according to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. The sponsor tested 2 runs in duplicate for 20 days $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n } = 8 0 )$ ) on low, medium and high analyte human plasma pools samples. The within-run and total CVs for each three instrument classes and are shown in the table below. The results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of within run $C V < 5 \%$ or $\mathrm { S D } { \le } 1 ~ \mathrm { U / L }$ and the total precision of $< 6 . 5 \%$ or $\mathrm { S D } \le 2 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The sponsor conducted a linearity study based on CLSI EP6-P2. A high pool sample was serially diluted to cover the sponsor’s claimed linear range of 10 to $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ . Each dilution was assayed in quadruplicate and the mean analytical results were plotted versus the relative analyte concentrations $( \%$ dilution). The results met the sponsors’ acceptance recovery criteria of 10- $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L } \leq 1 0 \%$ or $5 \mathrm { { U / L } }$ . The results for the diluted samples ranged from $2 1 . 9 1 \%$ to $4 . 4 8 \%$ . When the percent recovery was greater than $10 \%$ , it was with samples that were less than $5 \mathrm { { U / L } }$ . The values met the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor conducted on board stability studies on the Olympus Analyzers by allowing the reagent to degrade based on constant usage. The linearity was checked for all three instruments (AU400, AU640 and AU2700) and the results support the sponsors’ on-board stability claim of 30 days.

The sponsor also conducted a closed stability for the AU2700 via a stress model. The results shown below support the sponsors’ closed-stability claims of up to 18 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor conducted a limit of quantitation study with the Olympus CKMB reagent on the Olympus Clinical Chemistry Analyzers. Three patient samples or pools were assayed 40 times at an analyte concentration below the bottom of the measuring range. The level of CK-MB at which a CV is less than $20 \%$ for the 40-fold sample is the lowest CK-MB concentration that the assay can measure accurately. The limit of detection of the Olympus CK-MB reagent was determined for the instruments below and supports the sponsor’s limit of detection claim of $1 0 \mathrm { { U / L } }$ .

The sponsor conducted a limit of blank study with the Olympus CK-MB reagent on the Olympus Clinical Chemistry Analyzers. Analyte-free sample (water) was assayed 20 times on three analyzers. Analytical sensitivity was measured by calculating the absolute mean plus 3 standard deviations. The analytical sensitivity of the Olympus CK-MB reagent was determined for the instruments below and supports the sponsor’s limit of blank claim of $5 \mathrm { { U / L } }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor evaluated common interfering substances on the Olympus Clinical Chemistry Analyzers according to CLSI Guideline EP7-A. One lot (with three reagents) was tested on three instruments to determine the interferences of bilirubin and lipemia. The mean analytical result of the sample containing the interferent is compared with that for the non-spiked sample. The results from bilirubin and lipemia are shown in the tables below. The sponsor has notified users in their package insert to use serum and heparinized plasma samples free from hemolysis because adenylate kinase from red blood cells may react with the reagent to produce spurious results and such specimens should not be used.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

One hundred and three serum samples were tested with both the Olympus CKMB OSR6X155 (current) with the sponsors predicate device Olympus CKMB OSR6X53 on the AU640 instrument using the CLSI Guideline EP9-A. The slope, intercept and correlation coefficient were calculated by linear regression. The samples ranged from 12 to $1 8 6 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ . The resulting equation was $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 6 1 \mathrm { x } + 2 . 2 0 7$ with a correlation coefficient of 1.000.

Additionally the sponsor conducted comparison studies using the other two instruments (AU400 and the AU2700) against the reference instrument AU640. The AU400 equation was $\mathrm { y } { = } 1 . 0 0 4 \mathrm { x } - 3 . 2 5 3$ with a correlation coefficient of 1.000. The AU2700 equation was $\mathrm { y } { = } 0 . 9 9 4 \mathrm { x } - 2 . 3 8 6$ with a correlation coefficient of 1.000.

# b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study between serum and heparin plasma samples was conducted using serum as reference. The study was performed on 40 matched patient samples taken from volunteers. The slope, intercept and correlation coefficient were calculated by linear regression. The samples ranged from 12.83 to $1 9 2 3 . 5 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ . The resulting equation was $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 2 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 5 2 4$ with a correlation coefficient of 1.000.
