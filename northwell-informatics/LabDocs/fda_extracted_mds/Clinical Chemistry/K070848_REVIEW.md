# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

Not applicable. This submission is for clearance of control material.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Bio–Rad Liquichek Urinalysis Control is prepared from human urine with added human electrolytes, simulated leukocytes, constituents of animal origin, pure chemicals, preservatives and stabilizers. The manufacturer develops the target values and independent laboratories using the same protocol assay the material for each analyte/methodology for 20 times over a period of at least 10 days. The data are analyzed for each lot and ranges for each analyte/methodology are assigned by the manufacturer.

Stability studies have been performed to determine the open vial stability and shelf life for the Liquichek Urinalysis Control. Product claims are as follows:

Open vial: Once control is opened and stored tightly capped, all analytes will be stable for 30 days at room temperature $1 8 \mathrm { - } 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

Shelf life: 30 months when stored at $( 2 \small { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Not applicable b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable   
b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Specific ranges for each analyte/methodology are listed in the package insert. The manufacturer recommends in the labeling that each laboratory establish its own parameters of precision.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
