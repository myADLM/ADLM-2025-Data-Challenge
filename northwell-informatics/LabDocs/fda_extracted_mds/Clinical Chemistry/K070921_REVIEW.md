4. Special instrument requirements:

Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single-use device.

# I. Device Description:

The Bionexia™ hCG Pregnancy Tests are rapid chromatographic immunoassays for the visual, qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. Each reagent strip contains mouse monoclonal anti- $\mathfrak { a }$ -hCG antibody coated membrane and a dried chemical pad containing mouse monoclonal anti- $\beta$ -hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate. The control antibodies are goat anti-mouse IgG. Both devices are single-use and visually read. One is a dipstick device and the other is a cassette device.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced

# L. Test Principle:

The Bionexia™ hCG Pregnancy Cassette and Dipstick Tests are a competitive binding immunoassay in which human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a urine sample competes with immobilized conjugate for limited labeled antibody binding sites. When sufficient amount of sample is applied to the sample pad of the test device, the sample migrates through the test device by capillary action. If the hCG concentration in the sample is above the cutoff level, the antibody-hCG-antibodycolloidal gold particles complex will form a colored line in the test band region, a positive result. If the concentration of hCG in the sample is below the cutoff level it will bind with antibodies conjugates with colloidal gold particles so that no line will develop in the test region, a negative result. The colloidal gold antibody conjugate should bind to the control region and form a colored band regardless of the presence of hCG in the urine specimen.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Male urine samples were spiked with different concentrations of hCG (0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m U U / m L }$ ). 25 devices were tested on each level using three different lots of the Bionexis hCG Pregnancy Cassette and on one lot of Dipstick Tests. All the 0 and $1 0 \ \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ test samples were negative while all of the 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ were all positive. The results of the weak negative testing are in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Not applicable this is a qualitative test.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The assay was standardized to the WHO Fourth International Standard.

d. Detection limit:

A $2 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ cutoff is claimed for urine.   
See Precision/Reproducibility section M.1.a above.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Luteinizing hormone $( 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m I U / m L } )$ , follicle stimulating hormone (1000 mIU/ml) and thyroid stimulating hormone ( $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { I U / m L } )$ were added to hCG negative and hCG positive $2 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ hCG added) pooled negative urine split into six aliquots. None of the substances at the concentrations tested interfered with the assay.

Commonly found substances (Prescription, OTC, chemical and biological analytes – listed in the package insert) were added to hCG negative and hCG positive $( 2 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ). No interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

The “hook” effect was tested by spiking hCG control specimens at the following hCG concentrations 0, 10, 20, 100, 62,500, 125,000, 250,000, 500,000, 1,000,000 and $2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ . All samples tested up to $2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ showed $100 \%$ expected results, indicating the absence of a hook affect up to $2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ .

Negative and positive $( 2 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ ) urine samples were tested with specific gravity ranging from 1.00 to 1.03 and pH ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 and shown not to affect the results at these levels.

f. Assay cut-off:

This device has a $2 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ cutoff.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

95 clinical urine samples were collected from women during a routine prescreening at two POLs (Physicians Office Laboratories). Site 1 tested 19 positive and 27 negative samples and Site 2 tested 29 positive and 20 negative samples. The samples were run on the Bionexia hCG Pregnancy test and compared to the predicate, ACON One Step Pregnancy Urine Test. The results are present in the table below:
