# I. Device Description:

The Sentinel Clin Chem Cal is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for use in pancreatic amylase, cholinesterase, creatinine, lithium, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and “cholinesterase dibucaine-inhibited” assays to establish points of reference that are used in the determination of values in the measurement of pancreatic amylase, cholinesterase, creatinine, lithium, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and “cholinesterase dibucaine-inhibited” in human specimens. The device consists of lyophilized material in human based serum. The human serum used has been tested and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg, anti-HIV 1/2 and anti-HCV.

Values are assigned in-house on commercially marketed clinical chemistry analyzers. Each testing run evaluates triplicates of the following: two levels of control materials (low and high), an aliquot of internal master lot and two aliquots of two pools of calibrator materials. Four runs on at least two different days are performed. The mean and the standard deviation of the two calibrator pools were calculated. The assigned value was determined to be the mean of the two calibrator pools barring any outlier and imprecision of less that $4 . 5 \%$ .

The sponsors’ results support the shelf-life stability claim of up to 24 month and a reconstituted stability material claim of 2 days at 2 to $8 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ or 14 days at - $2 0 \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C }$ when stored in small volumes and frozen once.
