# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

2000 Guidance for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) 510(k)s

# L. Test Principle:

The Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and dipstick test is a chromatographic immunoassay for the rapid qualitative determination of human chorionic gonadotropin in urine and serum specimens. The anti-Alpha hCG precoated membrane captures antibodies on the test band region and goat anti-mouse on the control band region. The specimen is allowed to react with anti-beta hCG monoclonal antibody. The mixture moves upward via capillary action. For a positive result, a colored band with a specific antibody- hCG-antibody-colloidal gold particle complex will form on the membrane in the test band region. The absence of a colored band in the test band region indicates a negative result.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The sponsor used five levels of male pooled urine and serum specimens spiked with hCG (WHO Fourth International Standard). Twenty-five devices from three cassette lots and one dipstick lot were tested for each hCG level tested (0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ ) of serum and urine controls.

The sponsor has chosen a cutoff of $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ based on the above study.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The test is traceable to a test that has been standardized to the WHO Fourth International Standard.

The sponsor established the shelf life and expiration date (closed unopened product) when stored refrigerated $( 2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or at room temperature (up to $3 0 ^ { \circ }$ C) in the sealed pouch for the duration of the shelf life. The sponsors claimed shelf life is 30 months.

# d. Detection limit:

The detection limit for the ADT’s Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and Dipstick Test was evaluated in both the reproducibility study and a hook effect study. The sponsor determined that the cutoff is $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Pooled negative serum and urine specimens were collected, divided into six aliquots each and were supplemented with either $3 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ luteinizing hormone (hLH), $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ follicle stimulating (hFSH) or $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m I U / m L }$ thyroid stimulating hormone (hTSH) at 0 and $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ hCG levels.

Duplicates of each sample were tested using the ADT’s Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and the results were read. The results demonstrated no unexpected results with the above-listed hormones in the urine or serum samples.

Prescription, OTC drugs, chemical and biological analytes were added to negative $\mathrm { 0 . m I U / m L }$ ) and positive $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ spiked urine and serum pools. None of the substances tested at the concentrations listed in the package insert interfered in the assay.

Six urine specimens with varying hCG levels were altered to the following pH: normal, 3, 5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 for two hCG levels (0 and $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ ) and were tested with six devices. The samples were read and gave all negative results at $0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ and all positive results at $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ of hCG.

A urine specific gravity study was conducted on negative urine samples with specicific gravity ranging from 1.00 to 1.03 spiked to the following levels: 0 and $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$ . Each sample level was tested 6 times with the ADT’s Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and Dipstick Test. The sponsor’s results support the sponsor’s claim that the negative and cutoff levels are not affected by differences in specific gravity.

A hook effect study was conducted with spiked hCG serum control specimens that were tested with two cassettes for each of the following concentrations: 0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 20, 25, 30, 35, 200, 62500, 125000, 250000, 500000, 1 million and 2 million mIU/mL. The results showed that each level indicated $100 \%$ agreement in both negative and positive results and that there was no observed hook effect up to 2 million mIU/mL hCG.

# f. Assay cut-off:

The cutoff for this device is $2 0 \mathrm { m U / m L }$

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The ADT’s Bionexia hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and Dipstick Test device was evaluated at 3 clinical/professional sites by users with training typical for physician’s office labs to ascertain the products accuracy and reproducibility as compared to the predicate. Site one tested 19 positive and 27 negative serum samples. Site two tested 29 positive and 20 negative serum samples. Site one tested 18 positive and 27 negative urine samples and site two tested 29 positive and 20 negative urine samples.

Samples were random, collected at various times throughout the day.

The combined urine and serum results from sites one and two sites are shown in the charts below.
