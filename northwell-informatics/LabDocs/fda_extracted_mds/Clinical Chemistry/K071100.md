5.1.2.1. Name of the device: AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit

5.1.2.2. Classification name: Urinary pH (nonquantitative) test system

# 5.1.3. Identification of the legally marketed predicate device:

AMNIOTEST(TM), 510(k) no: K914419

5.1.4. A description of the device: The AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit contains a Testing Panty-Liner (TPL) and a Drying Tray (DT). The TPL comprises a regular panty-liner and an indicator strip assembled into the panty-liner, covered with two layers of one-way perforated film. The indicator strip is removed after use and placed in the DT for 30 minutes before reading the test results. When the indicator strip has been in contact with amniotic fluid, the user will observe a blue-green stain on the yellow background of the strip. An elevated pH level of the fluid causes the stain. The stains on the strip are caused by the sensitivity of a proprietary polymer, which coats the strip and contains the traditional indicator  Nitrazine Yellow, to pH levels above 5.2 units. The proprietary polymer is also sensitive to certain concentrations of ammonium in the tested fluid, and when the color changes are created by fluids with a certain concentration level of ammonium, and pH levels up to 7.0 units, these color changes are reversible and during a drying period of 30 minutes the blue-green stains fade back to yellow.

5.1.5. The intended use of the device: The AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit is intended to detect possible leakage of amniotic fluid when vaginal wetness is experienced during pregnancy by indicating pH level. pH levels greater than or equal to 5.2 produce a blue-green color. Patients are instructed to report or show test results to their healthcare provider for interpretation and medical care.

# 510(k) Summary Performance data:

5.1.7. Non-clinical tests: Lab tests to prove efficacy and pH cutoff were performed in the developer's labs and are performed on every batch as part of the manufacturing QC. Reference safety tests were performed by laboratories holding certificates to test for cyto-toxicity, irritation and sensitization (see section 15). Biological bio-burden tests were performed in the developer's labs and are performed as part of the manufacturing QC. Shelf life, storage, temperature limits and transportation tests were performed in the developer's labs.

5.1.8. Clinical tests: 339 pregnant participants, arriving at hospitals at three different test sites sensing unexplained wetness, were enrolled in a clinical study to test AmniScreen™M. Two of the participants reported of being very uncomfortable when performing the test. The users or the trained staff encountered no safety issues. Two of the participants reported they had a problem using the AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit or reading the results. The correlation between the result readings by the participants and traincd staff exceeded $9 7 . 4 \%$ , and there was no significant effect of the result-reading source on the performance of the AmniScreenTM (i.e., sensitivity and specificity achieved by both are almost identical). The sensitivity and specificity of the AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit in the study were substantially equivalent to predicate device performance, which was demonstrated by a Nitrazine Paper test performed by clinicians.

5.1.9. The conclusions drawn from the non-clinical and clinical tests: From the biocompatibility tests it can be concluded that the AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit complies with the required safety standards regarding cyto-toxicity, irritation and sensitization. The AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit may be mechanically safer to the user than AMNIOTEST™M as it is not inserted into the vagina. From the pivotal clinical study it can be concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of the AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit are substantially equivalent to the predicate device. From the comparison of staff result reading to patient readings, it can be concluded that the AmniScreenTM Home Detection Liner Kit is acceptable to be used as a home test.

Dear Ms. Leskovsek:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls.Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
