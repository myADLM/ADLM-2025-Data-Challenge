# Introduction and purpose of submission

Roche Diagnostics Corporation hereby submits this Special $5 1 0 ( \mathbf k )$ : Device Modification to provide notification of modifications to our Total Protein Urine /CSF (TPUC) test system. The reagent was originally cleared for use as: Roche Hitachi Urinary/CSF Protein via K913615.

The modification that triggered the need for this filing was the development of a new application of the TPUC reagent to the COBAS INTEGRA family of analyzers, which featured a new calibrator (C.f.a.s. TPUC 200). This application did not meet all of its predetermined acceptance criteria and therefore did not qualify for Internal Documentation under the Reagent Replacement Policy.

Since the original clearance of the test system under K913615, other modifications have occurred, which have not themselves resulted in the need for a new submission. These modifications include:

Application of reagent to new members of the Roche/Hitachi family   
as those family members have been introduced   
Development of a new application for the Roche/Hitachi family   
member cobas c501 platform and that included the 'new' calibrator   
C.f.a.s TPUC 200, which is simply a single level of the originally   
cleared Preciset U/CSF Calibrator   
Other editorial labeling changes

The COBAS INTEGRA Total Protein Urine/SCG Gen. 3 reagent is intended for use on the COBAS INTEGRA systems for the quantitative determination of protein in urine and cerebrospinal fluid.

# 510(k) Summary - Total Protein Urine/CSF Gen. 3, Continued

# Intended use and Summary

# TOTAL PROTEIN URINE / CSF Gen 3.

# Intended Use:

In vitro diagnostic test intended for the quantitative determination of the total protein concentration in urine and cerebrospinal fluid on COBAS INTEGRA systems.

# Summary:

Protein measurements in urine are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions such as renal or heart diseases, or thyroid disorders, which are characterized by preteinuria or albuminuria.

CSF protein measurements are used in diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions such as meningitis, brain tumors and infections of the central nervous systems.

# C.f.a.s. TPUC 200

C.f.a.s. (Calibrator for automated systems) TPUC 200 is for use in the calibration of quantitative determination of protein in urine (U) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on COBAS INTEGRA analyzers and Roche/Hitachi cobas e systems.

# Predicate Device

We claim substantal equivalence  the Urinary/CSF Protein st sstm cleared as K913615.

# Closing

Modification of the Total Protein Urine/CSF reagent does not affect the intended use or indications for use of the device as described in the labeling, nor does it alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Therefore, we trust the information provided in this $5 1 0 ( \mathbf { k } )$ will support a decision of substantial equivalence of the Total Protein Urine/CSF Gen. 3 to its predicate.

Re: k071239 Trade Name: Total Protein Urine/CSF Gen. Test System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1635 Regulation Name: Total Protein test system Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: JGQ, JIX Dated: August 16, 2007 Received: August 17, 2007

Dear Ms. Tribbet:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification.The Afinding o substantial equivalence of your device to a lally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
