# 5. $\pmb { 5 1 0 ( | \kappa ) }$ Summary Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Information Supporting a Substantially Equivalent Determination

Device description

The Gentian cystatin C immunoassay is a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA). The immunoparticles are made from activated polystyrene microspheres to which avian anti-human cystatin C antibodies are covalently attached. The immunoparticles and cystatin C form aggregations that change the absorbance signal, depending on the amount of cystatin C present. Measurements obtained by this device are used for the determination of Cystatin C in human serum and plasma. The Gentian cystatin C assay is calibrated with human Cystatin C calibrators. Cystatin C controls are assayed for the verification of the accuracy and precision of the Gentian cystatin C immunoassay.

# Substantial Equivalence

The Gentian Cystatin C immunoassay is substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring, Inc., N Latex Cystatin C Test Kit (K003503) with respect to indications for use, device design and material. The basic difference between the new device and the Dade Behring predicate device is in assay technology and the instruments used for testing. The Gentian assay is a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA), while the Dade Behring assay is a particle enhanced immunonephlometric assay (PENIA). The Gentian device can be used on all commercially available automated clinical chemistry analyzers using a light absorption detection system, while the Dade Behring test is applicable only on the Dade Behring, Inc. Nephlometer Systems. In the Gentian device avian antibodies are used and it is known by one skilled in the art that there is no interaction between Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and avian antibodies. The Dade Behring predicate device use antibodies with the inherent possibility for a false reactions with Rheumatoid Factor (RF).

# Comparison to predicate device

The substantial equivalence, safety and efficacy of the Gentian cystatin C immunoassay to Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin C assay (k003503) was evaluated in two studies and on two different automated clinical chemistry analyzers. In total 4 study sites were involved. The issues addressed in these studies were the comparison between Gentian cystatin C immunoassay and the predicate device Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin C assay (K003503) (Table1). In addition external validation performance of the new device was evaluated at two study sites (Table 2).

# Performance characteristics

The measuring range is $0 . 3 { - } 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . The reference range is $0 . 5 2 \mathrm { - } 0 . 9 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ Total analysis time is 10 minutes. Linearity is demonstrated over the whole assay range, the Gentian Cystatin C immunoassay is linear in the range $0 . 3 4 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 8 . 4 \mathrm { ~ } \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ on Modular $\mathsf { P }$ and in the range $0 . 2 7 - 8 . 8 \mathrm { \ m g / L }$ on Architect. Total imprecision $\mathtt { C V }$ , measured over 20 days with two lots, is $4 . 2 \%$ . Interference studies with drugs and anticoagulants show no significant interference, also there is no significant interference from hemoglobin $( 8 ~ 9 / \mathsf { L } ) .$ , intralipid (11 g/L), triclycerides $( 1 4 ~ 9 / \mathsf { L } )$ and bilirubin $( 4 2 0 \ m g / L )$ . Due to the use of avian antibodies, no interference with rheumatoid factor is detected. No carry-over is detected. The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification (LoQ) (within CV $6 \%$ ) are both within given acceptance criteria and below the lowest calibrator concentration. Sample stability is up to one month at $2 \cdot 8 ^ { \circ } C$ Stability of the reagents at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } C$ is calculated to be at least 18 months. Stability of the reagents in use is minimum 4 weeks. Recovery is $9 9 \mathrm { - } 1 1 0 \ \%$ . Antigen hook effect was observed in samples with spiked cystatin C concentrations above $1 6 \ m g / L$ , this will have no significant impact on patient serum and plasma samples, since sample concentrations above $9 \ m g / |$ never have been reported. Serum and plasma evaluations give identical cystatin C results. Between instrument comparison regression analysis shows excellent agreement between Gentian Cystatin C when measured on Architect ci8200 and Modular $\mathsf { P }$ instruments.

# Conclusion

When considering the comparison studies between Gentian cystatin C immunoassay and the Dade Behring, Inc., N Latex Cystatin C Test Kit (K003503) and the additional documentation supporting the Gentian cystatin C immunoassay, it can be concluded that the Gentian cystatin C immunoassay when measured on Architect ci8200 and Modular P analyzers is as safe and effective as, and substantially equivalent to the Dade Behring, Inc., N Latex Cystatin C assay.
