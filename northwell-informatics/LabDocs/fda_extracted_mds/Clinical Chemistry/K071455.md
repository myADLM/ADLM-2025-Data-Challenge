# 3.Identification of the Predicate Devices

Abbott TDx®/TDxFLx® Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood assay, P890025

# Device Description

The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology. Cyclosporine in the patient sample competes with acridinium ester-labeled cyclosporine in the Lite Reagent for a limited amount of biotin-labeled monoclonal mouse anti-cyclosporine antibody. Biotinlabeled anti-cyclosporine binds to streptavidin that is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the

Solid Phase. In the ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine assay the sample is manually pretreated toyse the cell and solubilize the cyclosporine.

Ap and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.

# 5Device Intended Use

The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine assay is an in vitro diagnostic immunoassay for the quantitative determination of cyclosporine in human whole blood using the ADVIA Centaur systems. This assay is intended for use as an aid in the management of cyclosporine therapy in kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients.

# 6 Comparison to Predicate Devices

The ADVIA Centaur Cyclosporine assay is substantially equivalent to Abbott TDx®/TDxFLx® Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood assay in that:

Both are immunoassays intended for use in the quantitative measurement of cyclosporine in human whole blood.   
Both assays use mouse monoclonal antibody   
Both assays require pretreatment of patient samples.

The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine assay and Abbott TDx®/TDxFLx® Cyclosporine Monoclonal Whole Blood assay differ in that:

•The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine assay does not require whole blood precipitation reagent before testing. • The ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine assay does not require pretreatment of calibrators.

# Comparison Information

Method comparison studies were conducted at three external sites comparing the ADVIA Centaur® Cyclosporine assay against two predicates:

Dear Dr. Seeger:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ⅱ (Special Controls) or classIII (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
