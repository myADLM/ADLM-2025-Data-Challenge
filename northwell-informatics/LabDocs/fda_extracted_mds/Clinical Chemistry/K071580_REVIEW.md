# L. Test Principle:

AST catalyses the transfer of amino group from aspartate to oxoglutarate during the formation of glutamate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate dehydrogenase (MDH). During this conversion, an equivalent amount of NADH is oxidized to NAD. The resulting decrease in absorbance at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ is directly proportional to the activity of AST in serum.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Following CLSI EP5-A, the sponsor evaluated the precision using two lots of reagents and three levels of commercially available serum controls on T60 analyzer. Studies were carried out in duplicates of two runs per day over 20 days (total of 80 data points). The results are tabulated below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Following instructions in CLSI Document EP6-A, the sponsor conducted separate studies on T60 instrument for 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods using different samples to determine the linearity. For 1-reagent method, the sample panel with eight analyte levels, Document Enzyme Linearity Test Set E100 (0 $- 3 8 4 \mathrm { U / L }$ ), was used and four parallel measurements were made at each level. Based on the acceptance criteria $\pm 1 0 \%$ and one of four measurements out of specification acceptable, the sponsor claimed assay range of $4 - 3 5 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ for 1-reagent method. For the 3-reagent method, the sponsor used normal human sera spiked with commercially available AST preparation and made 11 analyte levels $( 5 - 3 8 0 \mathrm { U / L } )$ for testing. Each analyte was measured four times. Based on the same acceptance criterion in 1-reagent method and based on the limit of blank (LOB) described below as $2 \mathrm { U / L }$ , the sponsor claimed measuring range of $4 - 3 0 0 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ for 3-reagent method.

To demonstrate the extended measurement range, the sponsor used normal human sera spiked with AST enzyme preparation and made ten dilution steps from the highest concentration down to normal human sera. With maximum allowable bias of $\pm 1 0 \%$ from the estimated straight line, the sponsor claimed extended range of $4 - 2 1 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ for 1-reagent and $4 - 1 8 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ for 3-reagent methods.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The sponsor’s protocols indicate that calibrator (eCal) is traceable to the reference procedure given in the value sheet, which is IFCC reference procedure for 3-reagent method and molar absorbance coefficient of NADH for 1-reagent method. The controls (Nortrol and Abtrol) are traceable to the IFCC procedure. The values are lot-specific and are assigned based on multi determinations performed using several T60 instruments. The assigned value is the median of all the values generated for each calibrator and control.

Additionally, control range is calculated as the target value $\pm 2$ standard deviations. Please refer to the value assignment sheet in the labeling for lotspecific values.

To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor recommends calibrating the test at least every three days and every time a new reagent bottle is used. The sponsor also recommends using quality control samples at least once a day, after each calibration and when a new bottle is used. However, the sponsor also suggests the control intervals must be adapted to the individual laboratory requirement.

The sponsor claims that all open on-board stability for reagents is 14 days. Reagent in unopened vial is stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until expiration date on vial label when protected from light.

# d. Limit of Detection:

To demonstrate the lower limit of the assay range, the sponsor used a $0 . 9 \%$ Sodium Chloride solution (blank sample) and tested in 20 replicates. The sponsor defined the limit of zero-concentration (Limit Of Blank) sample as $+ 3 \mathrm { S D }$ , which was demonstrated to be $1 . 4 2 5 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ for 1-reagent method and $1 . 7 3 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ for 3-reagent method. Based on this information, the sponsor claimed $2 \mathrm { U / L }$ as the lower limit of the detection.

# e. Analytical specificity:

Following instructions in CLSI document EP7-A, the sponsor evaluated the effect of known endogenous interferents. The interferents and the test range included hemoglobin $\mathrm { ( 0 - 2 5 0 m g / d L ) }$ , Lipemia $\mathrm { ( 0 - 2 0 0 m g / d L ) }$ , and bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated). Three levels of analyte concentrations were used: low level sample using normal human sera (1- reagent method) or normal human sera diluted with $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl (3-reagent method); medium level sample from normal human sera spiked with AST enzyme preparation; high level sample from normal human sera spiked with AST enzyme preparation. Interference studies were conducted for both 1- reagent and 3-reagent assay formats. Based on the acceptance criteria of $\pm$ $10 \%$ or $\pm 2 . 5 \mathrm { U / L }$ of control (non-interfered) value, the sponsor claimed for both 1-reagent and 3-reagent method, no interference for Lipemia up to 150 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), no interference were demonstrated for 1-reagent method up to $3 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and 3-reagent method up to $5 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The results of hemolysate studies demonstrated interference for hemolysate concentrations as low as $4 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for 1-reagent and $3 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for 3-reagent methods, depending on the analyte (AST) concentration. Thus, the sponsor recommends not using hemolyzed samples.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Performance of the AST (IFCC) 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods on T60 analyzer was compared with the results generated for the predicate device, Bayer ADVIA IMS Aspartate Aminotransferase on ADVIA 1650 instrument using 85 serum samples. The samples were split and run on both devices in duplicates. Comparison of data based on predicate and the device produced correlation coefficients (r) of 0.992 and 0.994 for 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods, respectively. Deming regression analysis for 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods resulted in the equations, $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 5 \mathrm { x } { - 2 . 0 }$ and $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 4 \mathrm { x } + 1 . 3$ , respectively. Sample measurement range for 1-reagent method was 12 – 307 U/L and 3-reagent method was $1 5 - 4 0 8 { \mathrm { U / L } }$ . Based on the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $\Gamma \geq 0 . 9$ , the method comparison demonstrated substantial equivalence of the new device to the predicate.

# b. Matrix comparison:

The sponsor conducted matrix comparison studies using 45 matched serum and plasma samples for both 1-reagent (sample range: $5 . 6 - 3 5 6 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L } )$ and 3- reagent (sample range: $1 2 . 7 - 3 2 4 \ : \mathrm { U / L } )$ methods. The samples were run in duplicates. The results generated correlation coefficients (r) of 0.99 and 0.98 for 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods, respectively. Deming regression analysis for 1-reagent and 3-reagent methods resulted in equations, $y = 0 . 9 9 x + 1 . 5 4$ and $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 8 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 7 3$ , respectively. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for serum and plasma was $\Gamma \geq 0 . 9$ .

The sponsor recommends in the labeling that each laboratory determine its own reference range for the population that it serves.
