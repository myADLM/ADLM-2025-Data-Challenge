# L. Test Principle:

The Neonatal Total Galactose assay measures total galactose, i.e. both galactose and galactose-1-phosphate, using a fluorescent galactose oxidase method. The fluorescence is measured using excitation central wavelength of $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ (or $3 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ) and emission central wavelength of $4 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ .

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Two studies were performed to evaluate precision of the Neonatal Total Galactose test. Samples were prepared from adult human whole blood spiked with different concentrations of galactose. The samples were then dispensed onto filter paper and dried at room temperature overnight. Since the testing was performed using dried blood spots, the extraction procedure was captured

in the evaluation process.

In study 1, three levels of spiked dried blood samples were assayed in replicates of four in 18 runs over 6 days. The testing was conducted using three kit lots, two fluorometers, and three operators. The total number of replicates was $\mathrm { n } { = } 1 4 4$ . The results are summarized in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The study was performed following the CLSI protocol EP6-A. Whole blood heparinized sample pools were spiked with analyte to create samples with high concentrations of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate. The high samples were mixed in varying proportions with the sample pools containing very low galactose to create a dilution series. Each test sample was spotted on filter paper in quadruplicate $( \mathrm { n } { = } 4 )$ , dried overnight, and tested.

The data was analyzed using linear regression as well as second and third order non-linear fitted polynomial regression. The second order model fit the data better than the linear model. However, for all dilution points the relative differences between the two models were within the sponsor’s defined acceptance criterion of +/- $2 5 \%$ . The results are summarized below.

Fitted regression models are:

Linear: $y = I . 6 + 5 2 x$ Second order: $y = I . 3 + 5 8 x - 7 . 4 x ^ { 2 }$ Third order: $y = I . 2 + 6 0 x - I 6 x ^ { 2 } + 7 . 5 x ^ { 3 }$

Where $\mathbf { y } =$ Total galactose concentration $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ and $\mathbf { X } =$ Dilution point.

The maximum observed percent difference $( - 1 7 \% )$ between the models was seen with the undiluted low level sample which is near the limit of detection of the test. The relative differences $( \% )$ of all other dilutions points were within $\pm 5 \%$ . Therefore, the Neonatal Total Galactose kit is linear in the range $1 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to approximately $5 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The values of the highest kit calibrator may vary slightly but does not exceed $5 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The package insert states that samples with values above the highest calibrator are not accurate and should be reported as presumptive positives.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The kit calibrators are traceable to a validated HPLC-MS/MS method. Six dried blood spot calibrators and two dried blood spot controls, normal and abnormal, are provided with the kit. Real-time stability including shelf-life, transport, and in-use stability studies for the entire kit are performed, including the controls and calibrators. Additionally, accelerated stability studies are also performed separately for the kit calibrators and controls. The study protocols and statistically calculated acceptance limits were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

The sponsor states that the limit of blank (LoB) study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of CLSI EP-17. The LoB was calculated from data using two kit lots over five testing days and a total of 100 measurements of the zero calibrator. Calibrators and controls were tested in duplicate for each assay. Since the assay does not report values less than zero, the LoB was estimated non-parametrically, as CLSI EP-17 advises, as the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the measurements. The limit of blank was observed to be 0.7 $\mathrm { m g / m L }$ .

To estimate the limit of detection (LoD), five samples with low levels of galactose were also assayed in the same study for a total of 100 measurements at each level. These samples were prepared from heparinized whole blood with added galactose and galactose-1-phosphate, spotted onto filter paper, and dried. Statistical analysis yielded a limit of detection of $1 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The package insert states that values below $1 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ should be reported as $^ { \mathrm { \infty } } { < } 1 . 3 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .”

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference from elevated lipid, bilirubin, and hemoglobin was evaluated at a galactose concentration of approximately $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sponsor used a two sample t-test at the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval to evaluate the significance of any difference seen between test and control samples.

Bilirubin at concentrations ranging from $\scriptstyle 1 0 - 4 0 \log / \mathrm { d L }$ , hemoglobin at 20 and $2 5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ , and Intralipid at concentrations ranging from $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ were separately was added to whole blood specimens containing galactose, spotted onto filter paper, dried, and tested. Specimens without added interferant were also tested. Specimens containing the highest levels of bilirubin and hemoglobin did not interfere with the galactose test using the sponsor’s acceptance criteria. Conversely, specimens containing lipid interfered with the accurate measurement of galactose across all levels tested and resulted in an over-recovery of galactose up to $30 \%$ . This observation is likely due to the physical nature of lipid in that it interferes with the transmission of light. The results are summarized in the package insert.

The following substances were tested and found not to interfere at the levels stated: glucose $[ 1 2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ), mannose $\left( 1 { - } 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } \right)$ , fructose $( 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , ascorbate $( 0 . 1 { - } 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , protein BSA $( 1 2 \ : \mathrm { g / d L } )$ , and acetaminophen (0.1–1 $\mathrm { m g / d L ) }$ . Glutathione at concentrations up to $6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ did not interfere, however a concentration of $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , which far exceeds the expected concentration in newborns, caused under-recovery of approximately $40 \%$ . This is likely due to glutathione’s chemical properties and interference in the assay’s enzymatic reaction. The results are summarized in the package insert.

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: A total of 2109 specimens from newborns were obtained prospectively from a state public health laboratory’s routine newborn screening program. Additionally, seven (7) specimens were also tested that were retrospective high galactose samples of which three (3) were from newborns with diagnosed galactosemia. Dried blood spots were assayed using the Perkin Elmer total galactose kit and a commercially available comparator method. The presumptive positive cut-off was determined from the results using each kit’s ${ \ni } 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $9 9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentiles. For the Perkin Elmer kit these values were 5.1 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $8 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ respectively, while the values for the comparator method were $4 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $9 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , respectively. The results are summarized in the tables below.
