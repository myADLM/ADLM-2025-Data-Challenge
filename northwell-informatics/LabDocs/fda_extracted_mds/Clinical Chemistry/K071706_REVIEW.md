# L. Test Principle:

This assay determines high density lipoprotein cholesterol through the accelerator selective detergent methodology. This procedure measures HDL-cholesterol in a two step reaction sequence. In the first step, non-HDL cholesterol is rendered non-reactive. In the second step, HDL cholesterol is solubilized using a selective detergent and reacts to produce a red chromogen. This method is based on accelerating the reaction of cholesterol oxidase (CO) with non-HDL unesterified cholesterol and dissolving HDL cholesterol selectively using a specific detergent. In the first reagent, non-HDL

unesterified cholesterol is subject to an enzyme reaction and the peroxide generated is consumed by a peroxidase reaction with DSBmT yielding a colorless product. The second reagent consists of a detergent (capable of solubilizing HDL cholesterol), cholesterol esterase (CE), and chromagenic coupler to develop color for the quantitative determination of HDL cholesterol.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Estimates of imprecision were determined through the replicate analysis of two serum controls. The controls were assayed in triplicates in two independently calibrated runs separated by at least three hours. The daily protocol was repeated for a total of eight days using five Envoy 500 HDL Cholesterol Reagent boats on a single Envoy 500 Analyzer. Average results for the two controls were reported for every run. Estimates of within run and total imprecision were calculated and are shown below. The level 1 results from one of the runs were removed from the calculations.

<table><tr><td colspan="5">Within Run</td><td colspan="2">Total</td></tr><tr><td>Sample</td><td>n</td><td>mean</td><td>1SD</td><td>%CV</td><td>1SD</td><td>%CV</td></tr><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>45</td><td>36.8</td><td>0.52</td><td>1.4%</td><td>0.72</td><td>2.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>48</td><td>71.1</td><td>0.68</td><td>1.0%</td><td>1.25</td><td>1.8%</td></tr></table>

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was evaluated by testing 12 samples with equally spaced HDL concentrations ranging from 0 to over $1 7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The samples were prepared by diluting a $3 3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ human HDL Cholesterol concentrate with analyte stripped serum. The standards were then analyzed on the ENVOY 500 analyzer across 4 independently calibrated runs and compared to their dilution factors by least squares linear regression. The assay is linear across the reportable range of $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ HDL cholesterol as shown by mean regression residuals that are less than $1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for all pools that describe this range and a correlation coefficient of 0.9998.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Stability testing was performed by the manufacturer. The calibrators and reagents are stable until the expiration date on the label when stored as instructed.

On board stability was performed on the Envoy 500 analyzer demonstrated that the calibrators and reagents are stable for 14 days when stored on board the Envoy 500 analyzer.

Calibrator set points are assigned by the calibrator manufacturer and are traceable to the CDC described reference method for the determination of HDL cholesterol. These calibrators are not traceable to the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network for HDL cholesterol results produced using the Envoy 500 instrument application.

# d. Detection limit:

A limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted based on procedures described in CLSI EP17-A. The limit of the blank (LoB) of $0 . 2 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and limit of detection (LoD) of $0 . 4 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were calculated as described in the CLSI document. The LoQ of $0 . 4 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was determined to be equal to the LoD and was calculated assuming a zero method bias and an acceptable error of $2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The LoQ is lower than the lower limit of usable range which is set at $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The effects of potential interfering substances were tested by assaying spiked serum pools. A serum pool with an HDL concentration of approximately 55 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ was prepared from individual patient specimens and divided into aliquots. All but one of the aliquots were spiked with interferants at the concentrations shown below. The unspiked and spiked pools were tested multiple times in a single analytical run on the Envoy 500. Substances that affect results by more than $3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ compared to the interferant free sample were reported as interfering substances in the package insert.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Interfering Substance</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Levels Tested</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ascorbic Acid</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0, 0.75, 1.5, 2.25, 3.0 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ditaurobilirubin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>RBC hemolysate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intralipid, 20% solution</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0, 80, 160, 240, 320, 400 mg/dL0, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 mg/dL</td></tr></table>

The ascorbic acid, ditaurobilirubin, and RBC hemolysate spiked samples all had a bias of less than $3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ compared to the unspiked sample. The results of triglyceride interference (performed with intralipid) resulted in the bias shown below.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

One hundred sixty serum and 152 plasma specimens were collected from individual adult patients. Sample concentrations ranged from $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to 158 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ as measured by the predicate device. These specimens were randomized and assayed using both the Envoy ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { H D L }$ cholesterol application and the predicate device. The results, which spanned the full reportable range of the device, were compared by least squares regression. Regression statistics for the combined serum and plasma specimens are shown below.
