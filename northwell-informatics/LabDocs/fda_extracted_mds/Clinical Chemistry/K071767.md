# 4. Device Description(s):

The PBNP method is a one-step enzyme immunoassay based on the "sandwich" principle. Sample is incubated with chromium dioxide particles coated with monoclonal antibodies, which recognize an epitope located in the N-terminal part of proBNP, and a conjugate reagent [alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] labeled monoclonal antibody specific for a second independent epitope on NT-proBNP, to form a particle/NT-proBNP/conjugate sandwich. Unbound conjugate is removed by magnetic separation and washing. After separation and washing, the particle/NT-proBNP/conjugate sandwich is transferred to the cuvette where the sandwich-bound ALP triggers an amplification cascade.\* ALP dephosphorylates synthetic flavin adenine dinucleotide phosphate (FADP) to produce FAD. FAD binds to apo D-amino acid oxidase and converts it to active holo D-amino acid oxidase. Each molecule of holo D-amino acid oxidase produces multiple molecules of hydrogen peroxide $\left( \mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } _ { 2 } \right)$ . $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), converts 3,5-dichloro-2- hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (DCHBS) and 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) to a colored product that absorbs at $5 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ . The color change measured is directly proportional to the concentration of NTproBNP present in the patient sample.

# 5. Device Intended Use:

The PBNP assay used on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system with the heterogeneous immunoassay module is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative determination of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in human serum or plasma. In individuals suspected of having congestive heart failure (CHF), measurements of NT-proBNP are used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity. The test is further indicated for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome and heart failure.

# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed:

Substantial Equivalence:

This product is substantially equivalent to other B-type natriuretic peptide test systems, such as the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PBNP Flex $\mathfrak { Q }$ reagent cartridge immunoassay (K041417/K042347).

# Comparison to Predicate Device:

The modified Dade Behring Dimension $^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ PBNP method and the current Dade Behring Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PBNP method are both in vitro diagnostic immunoassays intended for the quantitative measurement of Nterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide.A summary of the features of the two methods is included in the following table.

# Comments on Substantial Equivalence:

Both the modified Dade Behring Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PBNP and the current Dade Behring Dimension® PBNP immunoassays are intended for the quantitative determination of NT-proBNP. Comparative data for human samples demonstrate good analytical and clinical agreement between the methods.

# Conclusion:

The modified Dade Behring Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ PBNP method and the predicate Dade Behring Dimension® PBNP method (K041417/K042347) are substantially equivalent based on their intended use and performance characteristics as described above.
