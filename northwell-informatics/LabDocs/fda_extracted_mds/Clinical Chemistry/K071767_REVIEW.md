# L. Test Principle:

The PBNP method is a one-step enzyme immunoassay based on the “sandwich” principle. Sample is incubated with chromium dioxide particles coated with monoclonal antibodies which recognize an epitope located in the N-terminal part of proBNP, and a conjugate reagent [alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] labeled monoclonal antibody specific for a second independent epitope on NT-proBNP, to form a particle/NT-proBNP/ conjugate sandwich. Unbound conjugate is removed by magnetic separation and washing. After separation and washing, the conjugate sandwich is transferred to the cuvette where the sandwich-bound ALP triggers an amplification cascade. ALP dephosphorylates synthetic flavin adenine dinucleotide phosphate (FADP) to produce FAD. FAD binds to apo D-amino acid oxidase and converts it to active holo D-amino acid oxidase. Each molecule of holo D-amino acid oxidase produces multiple molecules of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), converts 3,5-dichloro-2-

hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (DCHBS) and 4-aminoantipyrine(4-AAP) to a colored product that absorbs at $5 1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The color change measured is directly proportional to the concentration of NT-proBNP present in the patient sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The reportable range of the assay is from $1 0 { - } 3 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . A high PBNP plasma pool $( \mathrm { P B N P } = 3 1 , 8 8 3 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ was diluted with a low PBNP pool $\mathrm { ( P B N P = } 1 2 \mathrm { p g / m L } \mathrm { ) }$ ) to produce 6 levels of PBNP. High range linearity was evaluated by comparing observed vs. expected values obtained with the PBNP method. A linear regression analysis was then performed on the data to yield the following: slope $= 1 . 0 0 1 7$ , $\mathrm { r } { = } 0 . 9 9 8 9$ , intercept $= 6 8 . 0 2 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Percent recoveries for the 6 levels ranged from 97 to $102 \%$ . An additional study was performed to assess low level linearity. A sample with a value of $1 1 7 7 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ was diluted with a sample with a value of $2 1 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ to produce 5 levels of PBNP. A linear regression was performed on the data to yield the following: slope $= 1 . 0 1 4$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9$ , intercept $\it { \Delta } = - 1 4 \ p g / m L$ . The Y-intercept is not statistically significant at a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) $( \mathtt { p } = 0 . 3 9$ , $9 5 \%$ CI – 60 to 31). The Passing-Bablock linear regression equation was 1.01, $\mathbf { r } =$ 0.9988, intercept $= - 1 2 . 9 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ with $9 5 \ \%$ CI -104 to $+ 2 8$ ). Percent recovery ranged from $9 2 - 1 0 2 \%$ . An additional low level linearity study was performed using a serum sample with N $\mathrm { \Gamma \Gamma \mathrm { [ - p r o B N P = 1 , 0 8 1 \ p g / m L } }$ diluted with a level one calibrator with a value of $0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ to produce 7 levels of PBNP. PassingBablock linear regression provided a slope of 1.04 and an intercept of 0.60 $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { p g / m L } }$ with $9 5 \%$ CI-9 to $^ { + 8 }$ . Percent recovery ranged from 94 to $106 \%$ .

Hook effect was evaluated using samples containing NT-proBNP concentrations ranging from 0 to $7 5 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The studies indicated that there was no hook-effect up to $7 5 0 , 0 0 0 { \mathrm { p g / m L } }$ . A claim of $3 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ is used. The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system will report an error code to the user when the signal generated by a high sample exceeds a pre-defined limit.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The assay is referenced to Roche purified synthetic NT-proBNP. The assigned values for the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PBNP Calibrator are referenced to a master pool containing synthetic human N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in a human serum matrix.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of the blank for the PBNP assay was determined to be $6 . 6 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . A claim of $\dot { \mathbf { \rho } } \leq 1 0 ~ \mathbf { p g / m L }$ is made. This was determined by assaying 20 consecutive replicates of the analyte free (0 level) calibrator. The value was then calculated by determining the standard deviation (SD) of the 20 replicates, multiplying by 2, and adding it to the absolute value of the mean. Functional sensitivity is defined as the analyte concentration corresponding to a $20 \%$ inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV). This was determined by performing a 20 day precision experiment using samples prepared from normal human serum at appropriate concentrations. Two replicates of each sample were analyzed twice per day for 20 days. Within lab CV was computed by ANOVA and plotted versus the mean concentration. The functional sensitivity was determined to be $1 7 . 5 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . A claim of $\leq 3 0$ $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { p g / m L } }$ is made.

# e. Analytical specificity:

No significant interference was found for bilirubin (conjugated) up to 60 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , bilirubin (unconjugated) up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin up to 1000 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , triglycerides up to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and rheumatoid factor up to 500 $\mathrm { I U / m L }$ . The pharmaceutical Natrecor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ shows no significant cross reactivity at 0 and $1 2 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ NT-proBNP. An extensive list of other compounds was evaluated for interference and was found to have no significant interference or cross reactivity. A list of these compounds is presented in the labeling.

$f .$ Assay cut-off: See expected values below.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted using split patient samples between the Dimension NT-proBNP assay (modified) and the Dimension NT-proBNP assay (predicate) with sample values ranging from 22 – 28,982 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ using the Dimension RxL chemistry system. 122 heparinized plasma samples were used and yielded the following correlation regression:

Concordance testing was completed at a university setting. Concordance was determined by comparing the results of the modified Dimension NT-proBNP method with patient samples from both a reference study population and a disease study population. The reference study examined 29 samples from a $<$ 75years of age population and 18 samples from $\mathtt { a } \ge 7 5$ years of age population. The disease study group examined 25 samples from each of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes $( \mathrm { I } - \mathrm { I V } )$ . The cut-offs of 125 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ for patients $< 7 5$ years of age, and $4 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients $\geq$ years of age were used in the concordance determination. Concordance for the reference group $< 7 5$ years old and $\ge 7 5$ years old were both $100 \%$ . Concordance for the disease group was $9 6 \%$ for Class I, $100 \%$ for Class.II, $9 6 \%$ for Class III, and $100 \%$ for Class IV. Average for the reference and disease groups combined was $9 8 . 6 \%$ .

b. Matrix comparison:

A comparison of 63 matched serum and lithium heparin plasma samples ranging from 36 to $2 6 { , } 3 2 7 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ on the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ system produced a slope of 1.02, an intercept of $1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and a correlation coefficient of 0.991 using Passing-Bablock linear regression statistics. Comparison of 59 matched serum and sodium heparin plasma samples ranging from 11 to 25,734 $\mathrm { p g / m L o n }$ the Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ RxL chemistry system produced a slope of 0.97, an intercept of – $\cdot 2 . 2 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and a correlation coefficient $\operatorname { 0 f } 0 . 9 9 3$ using PassingBablock linear regression statistics.
