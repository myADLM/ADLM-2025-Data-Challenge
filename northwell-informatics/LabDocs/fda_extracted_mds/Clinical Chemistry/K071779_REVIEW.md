# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

FDA/CDRH Guidance for Industry: Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The calibrator is traceable to NIST SRM 927c

Shelf life stability was tested over a total period of 19 months. The recovery in protein content of the calibrator was assayed for 3 lots periodically over that period. The calibrator was stored within the defined temperature limits of $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Results met the defined acceptance criteria and supported the claim for 12 month shelf life stability between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open vial stability was tested on 3 lots over a total period of 4 weeks. During this period, the open calibrator was stored at $4 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ . Results met the defined acceptance criteria and supported the claim for 4 week open stability between $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

The value assignment process consists of assaying new lots of calibrator on 6 ABX PENTRA 400 analyzers over 5 days. If the percent deviation between lowest and highest mean is less than $10 \%$ , then the target value is determined by the median of all results yielded from all analyzers.

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity:

Not applicable f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range: Not applicable

N. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
