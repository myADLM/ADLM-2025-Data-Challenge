# 5. Device Description

The VITROS Chemistry Products CI Slide assay is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products Cl Slide and the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2 on the VITROS Chemistry Systems. The VITROS Cl Slide is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support that uses direct potentiometry' for measurement of chloride ions. All reactions necessary for a single quantitative measurement of chloride take place within the multi-layered analytical element of a VITROS Chemistry Products Cl slide. The slide consists of two ion-selective electrodes, each containing a protective layer, a silver layer and a silver chloride layer coated on a polyester support. The protective layer inhibits interference from normal levels of bromide and uric acid

VITROS Chemistry Products Cl' Slides use ion-selective electrodes for potentiometric measurements of ionic chloride. Ionic chloride determinations are made by simultaneously depositing $1 0 ~ \mathrm { u L }$ each of a reference fluid and a sample fluid on separate halves of the VITROS Chemistry Products Cl slide. The electrode receiving the reference fluid is identified as the reference electrode. A paper bridge connects the reference electrode and the indicator electrode, which receives the sample fluid. A stable liquid junction between the two fluids is formed in the paper bridge in approximately 20 seconds. The chloride ions in the tested reference and sample fluids migrate to the silver/ silver chloride layers and establish equilibrium.

After a 2 or 3-minute (depends on the VITROS Chemistry System used) incubation period, the electrometer in the VITROS Chemistry System measures the potential difference between the reference and indicator electrodes. Each electrode responds to the activity of chloride ions in the respective fluids to produce a potential for the concentration cell. The VITROS Chemistry System's microcomputer uses this measurement and the stored calibration parameters to determine the concentration value of the chloride ion in the sample fluid. The test result is reported in millimoles per liter (mmol/ L).

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2 contains four levels of lyophilized standards with corresponding diluents. The standards are prepared from processed bovine serum to which bovine cholesterol, chicken egg yolk, inorganic salts, electrolytes, buffers, stabilizers, and preservatives have been added. The companion diluents are prepared from processed water to which inorganic salts have been added. In addition, Calibrator 4 Diluent contains $\mathbf { 0 . 5 \ : M }$ diethylaminoethanol and 0.01 M (ethylenedinitrilo) tetraacetic acid.

The VITROS System and reagents are designed specifically for use with the VITROS Chemistry Products range of products.

# . Conclusions

The information presented in the premarket notification demonstrates that the performance of the VITROS Chemistry Products Cl Slides (modified) for use with human serum and plasma is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate device.

Equivalence was demonstrated using manufactured slides along with patient and quality control samples with measured chloride values spanning the assay range.

The information presented in the premarket notification provides a reasonable assurance that the VITROS Chemistry Products Cl Slides (modified) for use with human serum and plasma is safe and effective for the stated intended use.

Dear Ms. Hanna:

This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of July 20, 2007.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
