# L. Test Principle:

The Stratus $\mathrm { C S } @$ Acute Care™ NT-proBNP method is a two-site sandwich assay based upon solid phase Radial Partition Immonoassay (RPIA) technology. Dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a square piece of glass fiber paper in the proBNP TestPak. This antibody recognizes a distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a second distinct antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper. During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound NT-proBNP, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound labeled antibody is later eluted form the field of view of the Stratus $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ CS analyzer by applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction increases directly with the concentration of NT-proBNP in the sample. The reaction rate can then be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within the analyzer.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

A linearity study was conducted to compare observed versus expected values obtained with the Stratus CS Acute Care pBNP method using a high concentration NT-proBNP plasma sample diluted across the expected range with a low sample. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was $\leq 1 0 \%$ deviations from the expected recovery. Samples range tested was 122 – $1 9 { , } 4 8 5 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and recovery ranged from $9 0 . 9 \%$ to $100 \%$ . A linear regression analysis was performed on the data to yield the following: slope $= 0 . 9 8$ , intercept $= 2 2 9 . 3$ , and ${ \mathrm { r } } = 0 . 9 9 8$

In addition, a low end linearity range was also conducted with the same procedure. Samples range tested was $1 7 - 1 2 0 1 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and recovery ranged from $100 \%$ to $1 0 8 . 9 \%$ . A linear regression analysis was performed on the data to yield the following: slope $= 0 . 9 9$ , intercept $= 1 8 . 7 7 6$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 8 7$ .

The data provided in the linearity study and the detection limit study below supports the sponsor’s claim that this test has a reportable range of $\mathrm { 1 5 - 2 0 , 0 0 0 p g / m L }$ .

Hook effect was evaluated using 6 samples containing NT-pro-BNP concentrations ranging from $0 \mathrm { - } 8 3 3 , 5 8 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The sponsor claimed that there is no hook effect up to 833,585 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ .

c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):

There are no changes to the calibrators or traceability of the assay. See performance characteristics established in k043476.

# $d$ . Detection limit:

A detection limit study was performed to assess the analytical sensitivity (limit of blank) and functional sensitivity (limit of quantitation) for the Stratus $\mathrm { C S } @$ Acute Care™ NT-proBNP assay. LoB is defined as the lowest detectable level of NT-proBNP that can be distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the absolute mean plus two standard deviations of 20 replicates of an analyte free sample in a single run. The calculated limit of blank is $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration corresponding to a total CV of $20 \%$ . It is determined by performing a 20-day, two replicates per day precision study, using samples prepared from normal human plasma at appropriate NT-proBNP concentrations. The calculated limit of quantitation is $1 5 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

An interference study was conducted based on the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. A plasma pool at a proBNP concentration of $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ was spiked with the appropriate concentration of the test substance or the solvent for the test substance (control). No significant interference is defined as $< 1 0 \%$ difference in recovery between the test and the control sample. No significant interference was found for bilirubin up to $6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , hemoglobin up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , triglycerides up to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and rheumatoid factor up to $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ .

Specificity:

The pharmaceutical Natrecor $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ shows no significant cross reactivity (less than $1 \%$ ) at a concentration of $3 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ when added to samples containing 0 and $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ NTproBNP. An extensive list of other compounds was evaluated for interference and was found to have no significant interference or cross reactivity. A list of these compounds is

present in the labeling.

f. Assay cut-off: See expected values below.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was conducted using split patient samples between the Stratus CS Acute Care NT-proBNP assay (modified) and the Stratus CS Acute Care NT-proBNP assay (predicate) with sample values ranging from $2 1 . 7 - 1 8 6 8 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . 148 heparinized plasma were used and yielded the following Passing Bablok regression:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Comparative Method</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Intercept(pg/mL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CorrelationCoefficient</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Stratus CS Acute Care NT-proBNP assay(predicate)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.02</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>8.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.99</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>148</td></tr></table>

A concordance study was completed internally and at an external site. Concordance was determined by comparing the results of the modified device and the predicate device with patient samples from both a reference study population and a disease study population. The reference study examined 29 samples ranging from 15 to $3 5 6 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ from $< 7 5$ years of age population and 20 samples ranging from 57.9 to $4 8 8 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ from $\ge 7 5$ years of age population. The disease study group examined 25 samples from each of the New York Heart Association classes (I-IV), ranging from 20.9 to 29662 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ . The cut-offs of $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients $< 7 5$ years and $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients $\geq$ 75 years of age were used in the concordance determination. Concordance for 149 samples from both the reference and disease population ranged from $9 6 - 1 0 0 \%$ .

# b. Matrix comparison:

A matrix comparison study between the lithium heparin and sodium heparin was conducted using 51 paired plasma samples. The lithium heparin samples ranging from 31.2 to $1 6 { , } 4 4 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Percent difference ranged from - $. 1 4 . 2 \%$ to $9 . 5 \%$ . A linear regression between these two matrices gave a slope of 1.06, an intercept of - $- 7 5 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and a correlation coefficient of 0.997.

The sponsor claimed that both lithium heparin and sodium heparin may be used for the pro-BNP assay. Serum samples should not be used with the pro-BNP assay.
