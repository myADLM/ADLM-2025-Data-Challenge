Our Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a Meter, Blood Glucose Test Strips, Code Key, Check key, Two Control Solutions, Lancing Device and lancets.

The Rightest Meter, Blood Glucose Test Strips, Code Key and Check key are manufactured by BlONiME Corporation. The Rightest Meter, when used with the Rightest Test Strips Blood Glucose Test Strips, quantitatively measures glucose in fresh capillary whole blood. The performance of the Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strips is verified by the Control Solution. The Check key verifies the status of Rightest meter.

# 5. Intended Use:

The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for in vitro diagnostic use (outside of body). It is indicated to be used by professional healthcare personnel or people with diabetes at home to measure the glucose concentration for aiding diabetes management. The glucose concentration is measured with quantitative capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm and forearm by using

Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System. This test device is not intended for testing neonate blood samples.

Special condition for use statement(s): Rightest system provides plasma equivalent results.

8. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence are as follows:

Verification and validation of test results were evaluated to establish the performance, functionality and reliability of The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

The evaluation included precision, linearity, interference, hematocrit and control solution.

# 9. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:

The clinical test was designed in Alternative site testing study as below

Test capillary blood by patient Study:   
It shows similarly slope and intercept for difference position of capillary blood test by patient.

The "Alternative Site Test" clinical evaluation shows substantial equivalence to Rightest used in finger, palm and arm position. They all have similar slope and intercept of Rightest value versus Olympus AU640. So the result tells us Rightest blood glucose monitoring system (Sample volume/Reaction Time) is suitable to be used in finger, palm and arm.

# 10. Conclusions:

Results of clinical testing demonstrate that the performance of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Sample volume/Reaction Time) testing capillary whole blood is substantial equivalence of Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System (AST). The precision and accuracy of Rightest is suitable for its in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes management at home and in clinical settings.
