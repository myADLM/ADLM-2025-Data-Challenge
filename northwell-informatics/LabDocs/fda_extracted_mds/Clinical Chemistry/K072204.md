# Device Description:

The $A D V \mid A ^ { \circledast }$ Chemistry Microalbumin Calibrators and $A D V / A ^ { \circledast }$ Chemistry Microalbumin_2 Calibrators are each 5 level liquid aqueous buffered solutions containing varying concentrations of purified human serum albumin. The Microalbumin Calibrators have expected values (lot specific) of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and $2 0 m g / \mathrm { d L }$ , and the Microalbumin_2 Calibrators have expected values (lot specific) of 1, 4, 10, 20, and 40 mg/dL.

The calibrators (2 mL/vial) are liquid and ready to use.Storage is at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$

CAUTION! POTENTIAL BIOHAZARD: Contains human source material. While each human serum or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDAapproved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products manufactured using human source material should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.

# Statement of Intended Use:

The ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA Chemistry systems for the ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin method (for quantitation of albumin in human urine).

The ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin_2 Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the caliation  ADVIA Chemistry ystems or the ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin_ method (for quantitation of albumin in human urine).

# Performance:

T rablity, al assen stablity eADVICheisty Mi and ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin Calibrators have been validated following procedures of Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics. These calibrators are substantially equivalent to currently marketed devices with similar intended uses.

Dear Mr. Liu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements or annual registration, isting of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
