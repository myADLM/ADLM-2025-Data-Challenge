# H. Intended Use:

1. Intended use(s): See Indications for use below.

2. Indication(s) for use: The ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA Chemistry systems for the ADVIA Chemistry Microalbumin method (this method is used for in vitro quantitation of albumin in

urine).

The ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin_2 Calibrators are for in vitro diagnostic use in the calibration of ADVIA Chemistry systems for the ADVIA Chemistry Microalbumin_2 method (this method is used for in vitro quantitation of albumin in urine).

3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use

4. Special instrument requirements: For use with ADVIA Chemistry systems

# I. Device Description:

The ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin Calibrators and ADVIA® Chemistry Microalbumin_2 Calibrators are aqueous, buffered solutions containing varying concentrations of human serum albumin. Five (5) vials of each calibrator level are provided $2 \mathrm { m L }$ each). The Microalbumin Calibrators have expected values (lot specific) of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and the Microalbumin_2 Calibrators have expected values (lot specific) of 1, 4, 10, 20, and $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The calibrators are liquid and ready to use.

The human blood used in the manufacture of these calibrators has been tested using FDA approved methods and found to be nonreactive for HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

FDA/CDRH Guidance for Industry: Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic Calibrators (issued February 22, 1999)

L. Test Principle: Not applicable

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Traceability: The Microalbumin and Microalbumin_2 calibrators are traceable to Master lots of the Microalbumin and Microalbumin_2 calibrators which are assayed against an internally prepared, highly purified human serum albumin standard.

The value assignment process consists of assaying and comparing new lots of calibrators and Master lots in a nested test protocol using the appropriate ADVIA Chemistry Microalbumin reagent on the ADVIA1650 analyzer. The final value assigned to each analyte is lot specific and is found on the Assigned Calibrator Value sheet that is provided with the product.

Stability: The shelf-life and open-vial stability of Microalbumin and Microalbumin_2 calibrators when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ have been demonstrated using real time and accelerated stability data and predetermined acceptance criteria. The protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

For both the Microalbumin and Microalbumin_2 calibrators, the sponsor claims a shelf life of 2 years when unopened and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Once opened the Microalbumin and Microalbumin_2 calibrators are stable for 28 days and for 60 days respectively when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable

f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable
