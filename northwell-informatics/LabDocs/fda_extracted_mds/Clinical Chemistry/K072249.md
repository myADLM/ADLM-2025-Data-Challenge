# Intended Use

EasyRA Calcium Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of total calcium concentration in serum using the Medica EasyRA Chemistry Analyzer.

For in-vitro diagnostic use only. For Professional use only.

# Cholesterol

The EasyRA Cholesterol Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of cholesterol in human serum on the Medica EasyRA Chemistry analyzer in clinical laboratories to screen for elevated cholesterol as a risk factor in coronary artery disease. For in-vitro diagnostic use only. For Professional Use Only.

# Methodology

The EasyRA Calcium reagent utilizes Arsenazo III, which is very stable and has a high affinity for calcium at neutral pH. Interference from magnesium is eliminated by the addition of 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. Arsenazo III reacts with calcium to form a 1:1 blue complex with an absorption maximum at $6 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ The concentration of calcium is proportional to the intensity of the blue color

# Cholesterol

The EasyRA Cholesterol reagent uses the enzymatic Trinder endpoint reaction, which is based on the work of Allain et al. In this method, cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to cholesterol and fatty acids. Cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to delta 4- cholestenone with the simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide oxidizes phenol and 4- aminoantipyrine to give a quinoneimine dye colored red. The absorbance of the resulting quinoneimine dye is measured at $5 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ with $6 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ as a blanking wavelength. The intensity of the color produced is proportional to the concentration of cholesterol in the sample.

# Performance Data

# Linearity

Linearity studies, based on CLSI EP-6A, were performed using NIST-traceable commercial linearity standards on EasyRA Chemistry analyzers. The EasyRA Calcium Reagent is linear from 1mg/dL to 15mg/dL. The EasyRA Cholesterol reagent is linear from $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# Method Comparison

Method comparison was based on EP7-A. At least 40 samples for each analyte were tested in duplicate on the EasyRA Chemistry Analyzer and the Roche COBAS MIRA analyzer.

Both reagents correlated excellently with the predicate device.

# Sample Carryover

Sample carryover, within-run drift, was tested based on CLSI EP10-A2. 11 samples that are L (low) M (mid-range) and H (high) in a predefined sequence twice in a single day. There was no evidence of sample carryover

# Interference Testing

Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. The following substances were tested: Hemoglobin to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; Bilirubin to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; and Lipemia (using Intralipid).

EasyRA Calcium Reagent Hemoglobin no interference up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ EY Bilirubin no interference up to 20 mg/dL Triglycerides no interference up to 2250 mg/dL   
EasyRA Cholesterol Reagent Hemoglobin no interference up to 500 mg/dL Bilirubin no interference up to 5 mg/dL Lipemia no interference up to 2250 mg/dL Glucose no interference up to 600 mg/dL Ascorbic Acid no interference up to 9 mg/dL
