# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None referenced.

# L. Test Principle:

# Calcium

This reagent utilizes Arsenazo III, which has a high affinity for calcium at neutral pH. Interference from magnesium is eliminated by the addition of 8-hydroxyquinoline-5- sulfonic acid. Arsenazo III reacts with calcium to form a 1:1 blue complex with an absorption maximum at $6 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The concentration of calcium is proportional to the intensity of the blue color.

# Cholesterol

Cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to cholesterol and fatty acids. Cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase with the simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide oxidizes phenol and 4-aminoantipyrine to give a quinoneimine dye colored red. The intensity of the color produced is proportional to the concentration of cholesterol in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Calcium

Linearity studies were performed using commercially available linearity standards. The concentrations tested ranged from $1 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the observed values demonstrated acceptable recovery compared to the expected values. A linear regression was performed resulting in a slope of 0.97, an intercept of -0.09, and a correlation coefficient of $\mathrm { R } ^ { \tilde { 2 } } = 0 . 9 9 9$ . These results demonstrate linearity across the reportable range of $1 - 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

In order to validate the extended range, several samples were spiked to concentrations between $1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and re-tested using the automated procedure with a lower sample volume. These samples were also manually diluted off line and re-tested. The results from the automated re-test were all within $\pm 5 \%$ of the results from the manual off line dilution. The extended range allows the user to measure samples with calcium concentrations up to $3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# Cholesterol

Linearity studies were performed using commercially available linearity standards. The concentrations tested ranged from $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $6 6 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the observed values demonstrated acceptable recovery compared to the

expected values. A linear regression was performed resulting in a slope of 1.02, an intercept of 1.10, and a correlation coefficient of $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$ . These results demonstrate linearity across the reportable range of $1 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The reagents are stable up to the expiration dates shown on the label when they are stored as recommended.

The assay is certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network.

# d. Detection limit:

The limit of the blank (LOB) was determined by evaluating a blank sample run $\mathrm { n } { = } 2 0$ on multiple instruments. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated by evaluating low level analyte samples $\mathrm { n } { = } 2 0$ on multiple instruments. For calcium the LOB was determined to be $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the LOD was $0 . 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . For cholesterol the LOB was determined to be 1.26 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and the LOD was $1 . 9 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. Calcium and cholesterol samples with increasing amounts of interferent were tested and compared to an interferent free sample. The following substances were tested with calcium and cholesterol: Hemoglobin to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; Bilirubin to 20 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ ; and Intralipid to $2 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Glucose to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Ascorbic Acid to $2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested with cholesterol, but not for calcium. The sponsor defined interference as the highest level tested that does not cause $>$ $10 \%$ change in analytical result. The calcium samples showed no interference up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin, $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin, and $2 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of intralipid. The cholesterol samples showed no interference up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ hemoglobin, $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ bilirubin, $2 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ intralipid, $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose, and $1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ascorbic acid.
