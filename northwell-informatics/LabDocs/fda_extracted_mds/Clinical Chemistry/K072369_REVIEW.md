# L. Test Principle:

The Evolution blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood sample is drawn into the end of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose oxidase and hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride, generating a current that is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The result is shown on the meter display.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Within-run Precision was measured by using EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood to prepare samples at five different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested 50 times. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Heparinized venous whole blood was spiked or glycolyzed to 11 concentrations between $2 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 5 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (confirmed by YSI) then tested with the Evolution and YSI. Each dilution was tested five times by the Evolution method and in duplicate by YSI. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the Evolution and the YSI method: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 5 \mathrm { x } - 1 . 8 5 2$ , $\mathrm { R } = 0 . 9 9 9$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The sponsor provided the traceability and value assignment procedure for control solutions used in this device. They are prepared at three target concentrations by gravimetric addition of glucose to an aqueous matrix. The glucose concentration of the control solutions are verified with the YSI reference method and expected values are verified for each new manufactured lot of strips.

Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a 26 month life-span and 3 months shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. Unopened controls have a 26 month shelf life and are stable for 3 months after first use.

d. Detection limit:

The sponsor’s studies support their claimed detection limit of $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit on whole blood samples spiked with five hematocrit levels (between $20 - 6 0 \%$ at eight glucose concentrations between 44 - $\cdot 5 6 7 \mathrm { m g }$ . These values were compared to values from an YSI-2300 analyzer. The results indicated that bias introduced at hematocrit levels between $20 \%$ and $60 \%$ was within $\pm 1 2 \%$ .

Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the device can be used from $5 0 - 1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ (10 to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ) and from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ relative humidity. An altitude study was performed and demonstrated that meter performance was unaffected by altitudes $\leq 1 0 { , } 0 0 0$ feet.

Common interferences were evaluated by spiking venous blood with glucose to two concentrations. Each of these glucose concentrations was then spiked with the interfering compound at two concentrations to make the interference samples. Control samples were each spiked with the solvents used to make the interfering samples. For the common interfering compounds shown below, no interference effects were observed up to the concentration listed. No compound showed interference of $\geq \pm$ $1 1 \%$ :

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

System accuracy was evaluated by comparing the results 613 fingertip samples spanning the claimed assay range to the results obtained by a Hitachi 747. Samples ranged from $3 2 - 5 7 6 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and followed the sample distribution recommended in ISO 15197 Section 7.3.1.2. For some of the samples that were less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ or greater than $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , pooled anti-coagulated capillary whole blood specimen was allowed to hydrolyze or was spiked to the desired glucose levels. Regression analysis of the samples yielded the following results: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { x } + 0 . 3 0 3 \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = { \bar { 0 } } . 9 8 7 5$ .

$9 8 . 7 \%$ of the individual samples were within the ISO 15197 criteria specifying $9 5 \%$ of samples are within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when glucose concentration less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and within $\pm 2 0 \%$ when glucose concentration $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ :

# LAY-USER STUDIES:

The sponsor conducted a series of studies to compare the accuracy of glucose measurement between the lay-user and the healthcare professionals. Studies were performed at three point-of-care (POC) sites and three physician’s office laboratories (POL). At each POC site the lay-user performed a fingerstick, tested their blood with the Evolution meter and recorded the result. A healthcare worker then obtained a capillary blood sample and a venous sample for testing by a reference method (Hitachi 747). At the three POL sites the lay-user performed a fingerstick, tested their blood with the Evolution meter. At Site 1 and 3 they also tested their blood with a One Touch Ultra and an Accu-Chek Active, respectively. At Site 2 a healthcare worker obtained a sample to be tested on an YSI 3000.

All sites met the ISO 15197 acceptability criteria of individual differences within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ deviation for glucose concentrations of $< 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\pm 2 0 \%$ deviation for glucose concentrations of $\geq 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

\* by predicate

The sponsor assessed readability of the labeling by recruiting 100 lay users who were provided with the test kit containing labeling for the US market. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and were about evenly divided between men and women. Regression analysis of the participant’s fingerstick value against a laboratory method (Hitachi 747) yielded the following results: $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 1 \mathrm { x } - 2 . 8 4$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 8 9 7$ . Results of this study met the ISO 15197 acceptability criteria of individual differences within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ deviation for glucose concentrations of $< 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $\pm 2 0 \%$ deviation for glucose concentrations of $\geq 7 5 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# AST STUDIES:

The sponsor conducted alternative site testing (AST) using the ventral palm, the dorsal hand, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and the thigh and compared the results to concurrent fingerstick readings. Lay-users vigorously rubbed the alternative site for 5 - 10 seconds (until they felt warming) before obtaining the sample. Regression results are shown below and the percentage of results meeting ISO-15197 acceptance criteria for accuracy.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The normal fasting adult glucose range for a non-diabetic is $7 0 - 1 0 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . One to two hours after a meal, normal blood glucose levels should be less than $1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# N. Instrument Name:

HMD Evolution Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation: Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for   
this line of product types:   
Yes __ _X_ _ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, ventral palm, dorsal hand, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

A color tag on the back of the test strips provides lot specific calibration information. No calibration by the user is required.

6. Quality Control:

Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be run with this device. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, the control mode can be activated. This prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

The sponsor demonstrated acceptable performance across the claimed glucose range for blood volumes $\ge 0 . 3$ ul.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
