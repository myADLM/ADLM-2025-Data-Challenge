# Rationale for Considering the Device Substantially Equivalent to Devices Approved for Interstate Commerce

Genzyme Ultra N-geneous HDL Cholesterol Reagent (k021316) was selected for comparing serum samples with to the results generated by Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent. Detailed performance characteristics and comparison analysis are given in this filing and demonstrate substantial equivalence to predicate device that is currently being legally marketed.

The Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent is similar to the approved predicate test. The minor differences in the performances of the tests should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent and offers users a rapid device to measure HDL Cholesterol in human serum or plasma.

In summary, the dissimilar features between the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent and device currently legally marketed do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. This is supported by the accuracy data comparing serum sample values obtained using the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent with those obtained using the predicate device, Genzyme Ultra N-geneous HDL Cholesterol Reagent (k021316).

# Description of the Device

The assay is based on a modified polyvinyl sulfonic acid (PVS) and polyethylene-glycol-methyl ether (PEGME) coupled classic precipitation method with the improvements in using optimized quantities of PVS/PEGME and selected detergents. LDL, VLDL, and chylomicron (CM) react with PVS and PEGME and the reaction results in inaccessibility of LDL, VLDL and CM by cholesterol oxidase (CHOD) and cholesterol esterase (CHER). The enzymes selectively react with HDL to produce $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ E which is detected through a Trinder reaction.

# Intended Use of the Device:

The Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol reagent is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in human serum or plasma. The reagents can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients at risk for developing coronary heart disease. Low HDL cholesterol is related to the high risk of coronary heart disease.

# Performance Characteristics

Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent is a homogeneous two-reagent enzymatic assay. The results are obtained in 10 minutes by measuring absorbance at $6 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .The linearity of the assay is from 1.06- $1 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for Serum samples. The assay offers excellent precision as shown in the tables below:

<table><tr><td>Serum Testing</td><td>Level 1 30mg/dL HDL</td><td>Level 2 55mg/dL HDL</td><td>Level 3 90mg/dL HDL</td></tr><tr><td>Within-Run Precision</td><td>Cy%=1.0%</td><td>Cv%=0.8%</td><td>Cv%=0.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Precision</td><td>Cv% = 2.3%</td><td>Cv%=2.6%</td><td>Cv% = 2.2%</td></tr></table>

In method comparison studies, samples tested with Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent showed good correlation with Genzyme Ultra N-geneous HDL Cholesterol Reagent (k021316) with correlation coefficients of 0.985 for serum samples.

We have conducted interference studies by spiking normal pooled human serum samples with substances normally present in serum or plasma and found no interference at the indicated concentrations.

Conclusion: Comparison analysis presented in this $5 1 0 \mathrm { k }$ submission filing in the comparison section, together with linearity, precision and interference and other detailed studies, demonstrates that the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent has excellent accuracy and is safe and effective. There is no significant deviation between the results obtained by Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent and the legally marketed predicate device (k021316) when testing clinical patient samples and is therefore substantially similar. Comparison analysis presented in this 510k submission together with the stability data demonstrates that the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Reagent is substantially similar to legally marketed device (k021316).

Dear Mr. Yu:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to evis that havebee ecassioance wi e roisions  edeal FoD and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
