# I. Device Description:

The Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol kit contains two reagents: Reagent 1 4X70ml bottles and Reagent $2 \ : 2 \mathrm { X } 5 0 \mathrm { m l }$ bottles and 2X1ml calibrator materials. The control materials consist of three lyophilized human serum based materials which are sold separately. All donor pools for the serum pool used to make the control and calibrator materials have been tested by FDA licensed methods and found non reactive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C and HIV I and II. The assay is based upon a modified polyvinyl sulfonic acid and polyethylene-glycol-methyl ether coupled precipitation to

LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons making them inaccessible to Cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol esterase. These enzymes react with HDL via a Trinder reaction.

This device has not been certified or tested by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity determination was based upon NCCLS (CLSI) EP6-A and was performed on the Roche Diagnostics Hitachi 917. Each level was measured in triplicate. Samples were serially diluted from a level of 184.18 to $0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The linearity for this method is $1 . 0 6 - 1 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , $\mathrm { Y } { = } 0 . 9 9 8 \mathrm { x } { + } 0 . 7 2 7 5$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 9 9$ . The sponsor determined an acceptable $\%$ error was $\leq 1 0 \%$ .Results of the study support the claimed linearity range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

This device has not been certified or tested by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network. The NIST SRM 1915b material was tested with the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol reagent and found to have a deviation from the NIST target value of $1 . 9 \%$ for level I ( $4 8 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and $- 3 . 4 \%$ for level II $( 5 1 . 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .

Values are assigned to the control materials by repeat testing on the Hitachi 917 using the Diazyme HDL-cholesterol reagent and calibrator. The assigned ranges which are lot specific are as follows: Level $\mathrm { I } 2 3 { - } 3 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ ; Level II 44- $6 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Level III $7 4 { \mathrm { - } } 1 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Reagent Stability: Reagents from two lots were stored in incubators at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 \mathrm { ^ { o } C }$ . Reagents were tested at 0 day, 2 days, 6 days, 9 days and 12 days. Accelerated study results show that the reagent is stable for up to 12 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time studies are being conducted and

adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed. Stability on board the Hitachi 917 was studied by storing the two reagents (R1 and R2) in the $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ storage chamber of the Hitachi 917. Results indicate the reagents are suitable for on board storage for up to 30 days.

Calibrator Stability: Calibrators from two lots were stored in incubators at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ . The calibrators were removed from storage a predetermined times and tested with the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol reagent. The accuracy of the Calibrators was determined by testing HDL-C samples of know concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the calibrators was determined to be 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time studies are being conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.

Control Stability: Controls from two lots were stored in incubators at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 \mathrm { ^ { o } C }$ . The controls were removed from storage at predetermined times and tested in duplicate with the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol reagent. The accuracy of the controls was determined by testing HDL-C samples of know concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the control materials was determined to be 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial stability for controls was determined to be one month. Real time studies are being conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.

# d. Detection limit:

To demonstrate the limit of blank of Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol, HDL zero calibrator was tested in 12 replicates on the Hitachi 917. The Limit of blank is defined as the mean $+ \ 3 \mathrm { S D }$ . $\Nu = 1 2$ , Mean $= 0 . 3 7$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 2 7 \mathrm { L O D } = 1 . 0 6$ . To determine the limit of quantitation (LOQ), a serum sample was diluted into 5 other concentrations and assayed over 3 days with 2 runs per day for a total of 150 replicates on the Hitachi 917. The five concentrations were 0.30, 0.75, 1.50, 3.00 and ${ 5 . 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } }$ . In the study, the estimated LOQ where the interassay CV is $20 \%$ was $1 . 3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To determine the level of interference from substance normally present in human serum, the Diazyme HDL-Cholesterol Assay was tested with normal serum samples containing about $3 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ HDL-C spiked with various concentrations of interference substances following CLSI guideline EP7-A and was performed on the Roche Diagnostics Hitachi 917. The following substance normally present in serum produced less than $10 \%$ deviation when tested at levels equal to the following concentrations:
