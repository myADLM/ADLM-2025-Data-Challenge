# Substantial Equivalence:

Aon™ACR is sustantial equivalent  the DCA $2 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ Microalbumin/Creatinine assay (k963142). These assays yield similar Performance Characteristics.

# Intended use

The AnonACR y an nv dost es or quantitative deteriation ln, creatinine and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in human urine using the AfinionTM AS100 Analyzer. The measure of urine albumin aids in the early diagnosis of nephropathy.

The AfinionTM ACR Control kit contains liquid preparations of albumin and creatinine in citrate buffer. The controls should be used to confirm that the Afinion™M AS100 Analyzer System is working properly and provides reliable results.

# Test Description

Albumin is a small protein present in high concentrations in plasma. Normally only small amounts of albumin are excreted in urine. Sustained elevations of urinary albumin concentrations are known as microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is also defined as a urinary excretion rate (AER) between $2 0 { - } 2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m i n }$ in at least two of three urine samples within a six month period.

Creatinine is a degradation product of the muscle tissue protein creatine. All creatinine crosses the glomerular basement membrane and is excreted with the urine. As muscle degradation is a continuous process, creatinine is filtered at a constant rate. Measurements of creatinine in urine will thus correct for varying diuresis and calculating the albumin/creatinine ratio will give a more accurate result of the albumin excretion rate.

Microalbuminuria is connected to several late complications of diabetes such as retinopathy and neuropathy, as well as essential hypertension, preeclampsia, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory conditions and mortality. Today ACR is a predictive marker of great importance in the early detection of kidney disease and identification of patients at risk for complications of diabetes or hypertension.

# Principle of the device

AfinionT™M ACR is a fully automated assay for determination of albumin, creatinine and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in human urine.

The AfinionTM ACR Test Cartridge contains all the reagents necessary for determining albumin, creatinine and ACR in a human urine sample. The sample material is sampled using the sampling device integrated into the Test Cartridge.

Albumin is quantified using a solid phase immunochemical assay. In the Afinion™M ACR Test Cartridge the sample is automatically diluted and aspirated through a membrane coated with antialbumin antibodies, which concentrates and immobilizes the albumin from the sample. A goldantibody conjugate then binds to the immobilized albumin resulting in a red-brown stained membrane. Excess gold-antibody conjugate is removed in a washing step. The AfinionTM AS100 Analyzer measures the color intensity of the membrane, which is proportional to the amount of albumin in the sample.

Creatinine is quantified using an enzymatic colorimetric test that involves four enzymatic steps. The test requires incubation with two distinct enzyme solutions. A colored end product is measured in one of the cartridge wells.

The concentration of albumin, the concentration of creatinine, and the calculated albumin/creatinine ratio are displayed on the Afinion™M AS100 Analyzer.

# Comparison of technological characteristics

Afinion™M ACR has different technological characteristics compared to the DCA $2 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { G } }$ Microalbumin/Creatinine assay.

In the Afinion™M ACR assay, albumin is quantified based on an immunometric membrane flowthrough principle, where the color intensity of the membrane is measured by reflection. In the DCA 2000 Microalbumin/Creatinine assay, a specific antibody binds with albumin in the presence of polyethylene glycol. The albumin-antibody complexes that are formed cause increased turbidity which is measured as absorbance.

In the Afinion™M ACR assay, creatinine is quantified in an enzymatic colorimetric test where the c tsio $2 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Microalbumin/Creatinine assay, the creatinine assay is based on the Benedict/Behre chemistry (non enzymatic) and the creatinine concentration is quantified by absorbance.

# Standardization

Albumin is calibrated against the ERM®-DA470 reference preparation.   
Creatinine is calibrated against SRM 914a.

# Summary of Non-Clinical Performance

The AfinionTM ACR assay is substantially equivalent to the DCA $2 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { P } }$ Microalbumin/Creatinine assay as demonstrated by non-clinical performance data in this $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ submission.

# Summary of Clinical Performance

The Afinion™M ACR assay demonstrated substantially equivalent performance to the DCA $2 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Microalbumin/Creatinine assay as indicated by method comparison and precision tests.

# Method Comparison:

At four external study sites 169 urine samples were analyzed with the Afinion™M ACR assay and the DCA 2000® Microalbumin/Creatinine assay. The correlation data (Passing-Bablok analysis) are summarized in Table 1.

In an internal method comparison study, 91 - 95 urine samples were analyzed with the AfinionTM ACR assay and the DCA $\boldsymbol { \dot { 2 0 0 0 } } ^ { \mathfrak { B } }$ Bablok analysis) are summarized in Table 2.

# Precision:

An external precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A protocol using two levels of urine samples (Sample1: albumin: $< 2 0 \mathrm { m g / L }$ and creatinine: $1 1 0 { - } 1 7 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , Sample 2: albumin: > 100 mg/L and creatinine > 170 mg/dL). The within-run CV was ≤ 8 % and the total CV was $\leq 9 \%$ for all three analytes with both samples.

# AfinionTM ACR Control:

An external precision study for AfinionTM ACR Control C I and C II was performed at 3 study sites. The AfinionTM ACR Controls were run in 6 replicates each day over 5 operating days. The

within-day CV was $\leq 7 \%$ , the within-site CV was $\leq 7 \%$ and the between-site CV was $\leq 4 \%$ for all three analytes with both control levels.

# Conclusion

The Afinion™M ACR assay is substantially equivalent to the DCA $2 0 0 0 ^ { \textregistered }$ Microalbumin/Creatinine assay (k963142) as demonstrated.
