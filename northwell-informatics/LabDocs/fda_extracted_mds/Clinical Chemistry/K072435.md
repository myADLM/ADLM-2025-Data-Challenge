# 6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information:

Dimension Vista® Protein 3 Calibrator and Dimension Vista $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ Protein 3 Control modified to include specialty Albumin (sALB), are substantially equivalent in intended use to the current Dimension Vista® Protein 3 Calibrator and Dimension Vista® Protein 3 Control (K063508). The modified Protein 3 Calibrator and Protein 3 Control, like the current products, are intended to be used for the calibration of human protein assays and for use as assayed intralaboratory quality controls respectively, on the Dimension® Vista System.

Dimension Vista® Protein 1 Control L, Dimension Vista ® Protein 1 Control M and Dimension Vista® Protein 1 Control H modified to include specialty Albumin (sALB), are substantially equivalent in intended use to the current Dimension Vista® Proten  Control L Dmeon Vista® rotin  Conol Man Dimension Vista® Protein 1 Control H (K063663). Modified Protein 1 Control L, M, and H, like the current products, are intended to be used as assayed intralaboratory quality controls on the Dimension® Vista System.

# 7. Conclusion

The modified Dimension Vista® Protein 3 Calibrator, Dimension Vista® Protein 3 Control and Dimension Vista® Protein  Control L, Dimension Vista® Protein Control M and Dimension Vista® Protein 1 Control H, are substantially equivalent to the legally marketed devices based on the information described above.

Dear Ms. Ennis:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarkt notification.The A finding o substantial equivalence  your device  a legal marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
