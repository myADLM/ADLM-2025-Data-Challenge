# Device Name

Proprietary name: 1. Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ proBNP II Immunoassay 2.) Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ PreciControl Cardiac II 3.) Elecsys $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ proBNP II CalSet

Common name: proBNP Assay PreciControl Cardiac proBNP CalSet

Classification name: 1.) Test, Natriurctic Peptide .Multi-Analyte Controls, All Kinds (Assayed and Unassayed) Calibrator, Secondary

# Description

1.) The Elecsys proBNP II Assay is a two step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve providcd with the reagent bar code.   
2.) The Elccsys PreciControl Cardiac II is a lyophilized product consisting of human serum with added CK-MB, Digitoxin (not for use in U.S), Digoxin, Myoglobin, and NT-proBNP 1-76 in two concentration ranges. During manufacture, the analytes are spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.   
3.) The Elecsys proBNP II CalSet is a lyophilized product consisting of equine serum with added NT-proBNP 1-76 in two concentration ranges. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

Note: The reagent, calibrator, and quality control material arc all packaged separately.

# Intended Use / Indications for Use

Elecsys proBNP II: Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of N-terminal pro-Brain natriuretic peptide in human serum and plasma. Elecsys proBNP II assay is used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals suspected of having congestive heart failure. The test is further indicated for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome and congestive heart failure. The test may also serve as an aid in the assessment of increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at risk for heart failure who have stable coronary artery diseasc.   
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay "ECLIA" is intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

The Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac II is used for quality control of specified immunoassays on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

The Elecsys proBNP II CalSet is used for calibrating the quantitative Elecsys proBNP II assay on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers.

The Elecsys proBNP II Test System is substantially equivalent to other devices legally marketed in the United States.

1.) Elecsys proBNP II Immunoassay is equivalent to the Elecsys proBNP Immunoassay (K051382).   
Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac II is equivalent to Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac (K032089).   
.Elecsys proBNP II CalSet is equivalent to Elecsys proBNP CalSet (K022516).

Dear Ms. Taylor:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
