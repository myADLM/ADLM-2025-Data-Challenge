# L. Test Principle:

The Elecsys $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ proBNP II Test System is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). The test uses the sandwich principle. In the first incubation, antigen in the sample, a biotinylated monoclonal NT-proBNP-specific antibody and a monoclonal NT-proBNP-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex form a sandwich complex. In the second incubation, after addition of streptavidin labeled microparticles, the complex produced is bound to the solid phase via biotin-streptavidin interaction. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the

microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve. This curve is instrument-specifically generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

An additional precision study was performed on the Elecsys 2010 on two samples with mean concentrations of 341.7 and $7 5 4 . 4 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ which bracket the cutoff of $4 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients 75 years and older. Within run precision was determined for 21 replicates of each sample with CV $1 . 2 \%$ and $1 . 0 \%$ respectively. Total precision for the two samples was $2 . 3 \%$ CV and $3 . 4 \%$ respectively.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The assay reportable range is from $5 { \cdot } 3 5 , 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . In the first study, the linearity was evaluated by diluting four patient samples with varying amounts of pro-BNP-free serum (10 concentrations per sample) and measured in triplicate on the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer. The sponsor provided the data for 4 samples. Each sample was diluted with varying amounts of proBNP-free serum (11 concentrations per sample). Analysis of the linearity data was performed according to CLSI EP6-A. Because the precision data is proportional to concentration, the calculations were done on percentage difference scale rather than absolute difference scale. If the device is without measurement error and linear, then the percent recovery should be 1.00 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ . For 44 measurements of recoveries, the assumption about constant standard deviation through entire range is acceptable. According to EP6-A, the linearity data should be analyzed with regard to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials. The best fitted linear model for the percent recoveries was $0 . 9 6 0 4 - 9 \mathrm { E } { - } 0 7 \mathrm { x }$ . The data demonstrated that the E170 analyzer was linear from $5 - 3 5 { , } 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ with deviation from linearity not more than $1 5 \%$ .

In the second study, six patient samples were diluted with varying amounts of diluent (10 concentrations per sample) and measured in triplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The samples ranged from $2 . 3 - 5 3 , 8 4 9 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The data was analyzed according to CLSI EP6-A. Because the precision data is proportional to concentration, the calculations were done on percentage difference scale rather than absolute difference scale. If the device is without measurement error and linear, then the percent recovery should be 1.00 $( 1 0 0 \% )$ . For 60 measurements of recoveries, the assumption about constant standard deviation through entire range is acceptable. According to EP6-A, the linearity data should be analyzed with regard to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials. The best fitted linear model for the percent recoveries was 0.933 $- 1 \mathrm { E } { - } 0 7 \mathrm { x }$ . The data demonstrated that the Elecsys 2010 analyzer was linear from $5 - 3 5 { , } 0 0 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ with deviation from linearity not more than $10 \%$ .

Hook effect studies demonstrated no effect up to $3 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The shelf-life of Elecsys PreciControl Cardiac II is claimed to be 18 month with the kit unopened and stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The percent recovery was within $\pm 1 0 \%$ .

Summary of value assignment: PreciControl Cardiac II values are assigned using a minimum of 3 Elecsys 1010 analyzers, 3 Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 and 3 Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 / cobas e 601. A minimum of 6 runs are performed on each analyzer platform. Two-fold determinations are made for each sample. The target value is then calculated as the median of the determined values. Target ranges for PreciControl Cardiac II are established at $\pm 1 2 \%$ of the target value. Lot specific target values are established.

The limit of blank (LoB) was evaluated on the Elecsys 2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers according to CLSI EP17-A guidelines. Five human serum samples with low analyte concentration were measured on 2 analyzers in 3 runs per instrument. The samples were measured in duplicate in each run $( \mathtt { n } = 3 0 )$ ). The LoD was determined to be $1 . 7 2 5 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for the Elecsys 2010 and $3 . 6 2 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for the E170. The labeling includes values for the limit of detection and limit of quantitation.

The limit of detection (LoD) was evaluated on the Elecsys 2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer according to CLSI EP 17-A guidelines. Five human serum samples with low analyte concentration were measured on analyzers in 3 runs per instrument. The samples were measured in duplicate in each run $\mathrm { ( n = } 3 0$ ). The limit of detection is determined based on the limit of blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The LoD was determined to be $2 . 8 3 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for the Elecsys 2010 and 4.66 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ for the E170. The sponsor claims a LoD of $5 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined on the Elecsys 2010 and E170 by measuring the concentration which corresponds to an interassay CV of 20 $\%$ . To determine the LoQ for the Elecsys 2010, 8 samples (6 human serum pools and 2 controls) with concentrations ranging from 2.39 to 2367.2 were tested once per day for 10 days. The mean standard deviation and CV for each sample was calculated. The concentration which would generate a $20 \%$ CV was determined to be $< 1 4 . 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . For the E170, 10 samples (8 human serum pools and 2 controls) with concentrations ranging from 7.62 to 2168.8 were tested once per day for 10 days. The mean, standard deviation and CV for each sample were calculated. The concentration which would generate a $20 \%$ CV was determined to be $< 7 . 6 2 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The sponsor claims the LoQ of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The assay is unaffected by icterus (bilirubin $< 4 2 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / L }$ or $< 2 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), hemolysis $\mathrm { ( H b < 0 . 6 2 1 \ m m o l / L }$ or $< 1 . 0 \mathrm { g / d L }$ ), lipemia (intralipids $< 1 7 . 1$ $\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ or $< 1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ), and biotin $< 8 2 \mathrm { n m o l / L }$ or $< 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ . In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. $> 5 \mathrm { m g / d a y ) }$ , no sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin administration. No interference was observed from rheumatoid factors up to a concentration of $1 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U / m L }$ . In vitro tests were performed on 51 commonly used pharmaceuticals. No interference with the assay was found. In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to streptavidin and ruthenium can occur.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Accuracy was evaluated in a study comparing the values obtained with the Elecsys proBNP II assay to the values obtained with the Elecsys proBNP assay on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. A total of 1551 samples were tested from three subgroups: Subgroup A (USA, 207 samples), Subgroup B (Europe, 328 samples) and Subgroup C (Europe, 1016 samples).

A comparison of the Elecsys proBNP II assay (y) with the Elecsys proBNP assay (x) using 1551 clinical samples with values ranging from 5 to 32,627 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ gave the following correlations $\mathrm { ( p g / m L ) }$ :

Passing/Bablok $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 7 9 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 3 1 4$ $\tau = 0 . 9 3 2$

Linear regression $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { x } - 2 1 . 9$ $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 6$

The sponsor provided concordance testing on reference and diseased group samples determined by comparing the results from the modified Elecsys proBNP II assay and the Elecsys proBNP assay. The concordance testing was performed on a subset of samples from the USA subgroup (Subgroup A), a subset of samples from Subgroup B and a subset of blood donor samples blood samples from Subgroup C. The reference group study examined samples from diabetic and hypertensive patients and from blood donors. The disease study group consisted of samples from each of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes $( \mathrm { I } - \mathrm { I V } )$ . The cut-offs of $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients $< 7 5$ years of age, and $4 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients $\geq$ years of age were used in the concordance determination. Concordance for the reference groups were 97.6 $\%$ for diabetics and hypertensives (94/96) and $9 9 . 0 \%$ for blood donors (607/613). Concordance for the disease group was $9 9 \%$ for Class I (142/143), $100 \%$ for Class II (159/159), $100 \%$ for Class III (66/66), and $100 \%$ for Class IV (11/11).

In addition, concordance was evaluated in a study comparing the values obtained with the Elecsys proBNP II assay to the values obtained with the Elecsys proBNP assay using the samples from the USA Subgroup (Subgroup A). These samples were repository samples from the clinical studies performed in support of k022516, Elecsys proBNP assay. A comparison of the Elecsys proBNP II assay (y) with the Elecsys proBNP assay (x) using the 207 clinical samples with values ranging from 5 to $1 1 { , } 2 5 8 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ gave the following correlations $\mathrm { ( p g / m L ) }$ :

Passing/Bablok $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 8 3 \mathrm { x } \ + 1 . 9 1 4$ $\tau = 0 . 9 7 0 8$

Linear regression $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 2 6 \mathrm { x } + 2 3 . 8$ $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9$
