# 5. Device Description

The VITROS Chemistry Products Ca Slide assay is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products Ca Slide and the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 1 on the VITROS Chemistry Systems. The VITROS Ca Slide is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support. All reactions necessary for a single quantitative measurement o calcium take place within the multi-ayered analytical element of a VITROS Chemistry Products Ca slide.

A drop of patient sample is deposited on the VITROS Ca Slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading layer to the underlying layers. The bound calcium is dissociated from binding proteins, allowing the calcium to penetrate through the spreading layer into the underlying reagent layer. In the reagent layer, the calcium forms a complex with Arsenazo II dye, causing a shift in the absorption maximum.

After incubation, the reflection density of the colored complex is measured spectrophotometrically by a VITROS Chemistry System. The amount of colored complex formed is proportional to the calcium concentration in the sample fluid. The test result is reported in milligrams per deciliter $\mathrm { ( m g / d L ) }$ or millimoles per liter (mmol/L).

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 1 contains three levels of lyophilized standards with corresponding diluents. The standards are prepared from processed bovine serum to which organic analytes, electrolytes, stabilizers, and preservatives have been added. The companion diluents are prepared from processed water to which inorganic salts have been added.

The VITROS Chemistry System and reagents are designed specifically for use with the VITROS Chemistry Products range of products.

# 510(k) Summary, Continued

# Conclusions

The information presented in the premarket notification demonstrates that the performance of the VITROS Chemistry Products Ca Slides (modified) for use with human serum, plasma and urine is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate device.

Equivalence was demonstrated using manufactured slides along with patient and quality control samples with measured calcium values spanning the assay range.

The information presented in the premarket notification provides a reasonable assurance that the VITROS Chemistry Products Ca Slides (modified) for use with human serum, plasma, and urine is safe and effective for the stated intended use.

Dear Ms. Hanna:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in acordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
