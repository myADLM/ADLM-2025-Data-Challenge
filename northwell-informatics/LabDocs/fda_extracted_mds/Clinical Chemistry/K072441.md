# NAME OF DEVICE:

Trade Name: Common Names/Descriptions: Classification Names:

EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System Blood Glucose Monitoring System Glucose test system, product code 75CGA and "System, test, blood glucose, over the counter", product code 75NBW, 21 CFR 862.1345

# 4DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System designed by Tyson Bioresearch Inc., an amperometric biosensor, are adopted for its ease of use, its ability to process accurate results utilizing only a small volume of blood, and its quick response time. EZ Scan Plus device provides a convenient and safe monitoring system for diabetes health care professionals, hospitals and most importantly, people with diabetes.

The EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip and the alternate sites: palm and forearm. When the edge of the EZ Scan Plus Test Strip is touched to a drop of blood, the test strip draws the blood into the sample chamber and the glucose reading is displayed on the meter after 10 seconds. The test measures glucose from $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } \left( 1 . 1 \mathrm { m m o l / L } \right)$ to $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (33.3 mmol/L). The EZ Scan Plus Test Strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow the comparison of results with laboratory methods.

# 5. INTENDED USE:

The EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Test Strips are used with the EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Meter for quantitatively measuring glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from the fingertip and the alternate sites: palm and forearm. The EZ Scan Plus Test Strips are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical setting by healthcare professionals as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control.

# TEST PRINCIPLE

The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase. Glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid and electrons are produced from the reaction. The electrons are then trapped by a chemical mediator, potassium ferricyanide. Once the enzymatic reaction is complete, a potential is provided by the meter for a further electrochemical reaction in order to generate a current from the release of trapped electrons. This current is then measured and correlated to the glucose concentration in the whole-blood sample. The EZ Scan Plus Test Strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow easy comparison of results with laboratory methods.

# 7. PREDICATE DEVICE:

Predicate device name(s): EZ Smart - 168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# 8. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTIC SUMMARY

Based on the above information, we know the subject device, EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System, and the predicate device have the same functioning principle and using the same technologies. The detection ranges for both devices are similar. HCT ranges are the same. The strip storage environments and the operating temperature are similar.

The differences between EZ Scan Plus from EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System are the meter coding method, meter dimension, weight, PCB size and new intended use - for alternate site testing. All internal electrical architectures and main electronic components as well as product functions and features remain unchanged. EZ Scan Plus Test Strip is also identical to the EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, only the size changed for more convenient use. No physical changes of EZ Smart-168 Test Strips were made.

As we can see, the differences are due to the feature design aspects for more easy use of the EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System, not relating to the safety or effectiveness aspects. Fundamental scientific technology of the EZ Scan Plus device has not changed. An evaluation of the EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System was conducted under various conditions including temperature effects, humidity effects, hematocrit levels, sensitivity and linearity. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that EZ Scan Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the originally cleared EZ Smart-168 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K052818).

The results of clinical alternate site testing demonstrate that the results obtained from the alternate site sampling using EZ Scan Plus system, are similar to those obtained from finger stick whole blood with no effect on clinical action. EZ Scan Plus system provides the users an option to use the palm and forearm in addition to the fingertip to collect capillary blood for self monitoring of blood glucose within certain conditions as explained in product user' s manual. EZ Scan Plus is suitable for its intended use.
