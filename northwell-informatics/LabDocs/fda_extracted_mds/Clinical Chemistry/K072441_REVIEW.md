# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus. EP7-P NCCLS: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline.

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The sponsor evaluated the within run and between run precision of the device using 50 replicate measurements of 5 concentrations of glucose-adjusted venous whole blood with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized below.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=6>Within-Run Precision</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average glucose concentration(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>45.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>81.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>215</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>346</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=6>Between RunPrecision</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Average glucose concentration(mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>46.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>130.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>223.9</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>349.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>SD (mg/dL)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.7</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>CV (%)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>7.3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.8</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4.2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3.0</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.9</td></tr></table>

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To establish the linearity of the system through the range of 20 to $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , glucose adjusted whole blood samples (actual range tested was 25 to $5 7 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) were compared to YSI 2300 using 50 replicate measurements of 5 concentrations of glucose-adjusted venous whole blood with 3 strip lots Linear regression yields the following statistics:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Slope</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>y-intercept</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>$r2 }$</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot 1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.998</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.458</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot 2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.120</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strip Lot 3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.007</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>-0.500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.999</td></tr></table>

The sponsor claims $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as the lowest detectable limit in the labeling.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The controls were evaluated in the predicate device (k052818). The evaluation of the controls in that submission is described below:

Traceability has been referenced by the manufacturer to ISO 17511.

The three control solutions consist of buffered aqueous solutions of D $( + )$ -glucose containing stabilizers, preservatives, and other non-reactive ingredients. Lot-specific ranges are printed on the EZ Smart-168 Test Strip bottle label. The control values are assigned by repeat testing. Mean values are obtained and ranges are assigned based upon the mean value $\pm \textbf { a }$ pre-determined value for each control concentration.

Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: The sponsor assessed control solution stability using accelerated and real time aging studies. Five EZ Smart-168 meters and the YSI 2300 Stat Plus analyzer were used during the testing procedure. The shelf life stability claim is 24 months.

Opened Vial Stability of Control Solution: The sponsor conducted open vial stability studies of control solutions (Level 1, 2, and 3) that were stored at room temperature $( 1 5 ^ { \circ } { - } 2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . Samples were tested every week for 4 consecutive weeks, then every other week for the second month, and every month for the 3 rd to 6th months. Five EZ Smart-168 glucose meters and the YSI 2300 STAT PLUS were used during the testing procedure. The open vial stability claim of the control solutions is 3 months after opening.

The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose standard (NIST SRM 965a).

Stability characteristics of the control solutions were determined using real time aging studies. The open vial storage stability at room temperature was determined to be 18 months and unopened vial stability was determined to be 24 months.

The expected ranges of the glucose control solutions were established by repeat testing (10 times) on two meters using one lot of strips for both glucose levels.

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the system is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as established in k052818.   
This range was verified by the linearity study (above section M.1.b.).

# e. Analytical specificity:

The sponsor tested the following substances for interference according to NCCLS EP7-P. Blood samples were drawn from healthy volunteers, mixed, and the interfering chemicals or control samples (saline) were added. Parallel testing was used to compare glucose measurements in the presence and absence of drugs using heparinized venous blood from healthy volunteers. The low and high venous blood glucose concentrations in this study were 61 and $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ respectively. For each drug level, one control sample (no interferant) and four test samples with serial dilution concentration were prepared. Control samples were measured by each device to serve as the reference measurement for each glucose test. Each sample was measured in duplicate (glucose concentration $6 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Results were averaged for the control samples $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ and for the four parallel test samples $( \mathrm { n } { = } 5 )$ . Results are summarized below:

An altitude study was performed with venous blood spiked with 5 different concentrations of glucose spanning 70 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and capillary whole blood from volunteers whose blood glucose ranged from 74 to $9 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The altitude study was performed at 164, 7545, and 9875 feet and demonstrated that both the venous and capillary blood tests met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $\pm 1 5 \%$ at altitudes of 7545 feet and below..

To test the effect of hematocrit on the device accuracy, blood adjusted to hematocrit levels of $30 \%$ , $3 5 \%$ , $40 \%$ , $45 \%$ , $50 \%$ , $5 5 \%$ , and $60 \%$ at glucose concentrations of 48.6, 86.5, 148, 236, $3 8 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested a total of 6 times, averaged and compared to the YSI result. The study demonstrated a bias of $\leq 1 0 \%$ when samples within the claimed hematocrit range of $3 5 \%$ to $5 5 \%$ were compared to YSI.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A consumer study on samples ranging from 56.7 to $4 7 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ was performed with 121 lay-users and a technician. An additional 17 samples were contrived to produce low and high sample values, ranging from 24.2 to $5 4 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and 487 to $5 8 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The labeling provided to the users was in English only. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood using only the instructions in the user’s manual, then a technician performed a second fingerstick using the same meter. An alternate site study on samples from 2 palm sites, the forearm and the finger were also conducted by the same lay users and technician. This study used uncontrived samples only. Not enough blood was obtained for 2 palm samples (leaving 119 samples tested) and 5 forearm samples (leaving 116 samples tested). Results are summarized below:
