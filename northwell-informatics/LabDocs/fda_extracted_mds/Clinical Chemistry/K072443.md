# 5. Device Description

The VITROS Chemistry Products Ca DT Slide assay is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products Ca DT Slide and the VITROS Chemistry Products DT Calibrator Kit on the VITROS DT60/ DT60 II Chemistry Systems. The VITROS Ca DT Slide is amultilayered, analytical element cated on  polyestersupport. All reactions necessary for a single quantitative measurement of calcium take place within the multi-layered analytical element of a VITROS Chemistry Products Ca DT slide.

A drop of patient sample is deposited on the VITROS Ca DT Slide and is evenly distributed by the spreading layer to the underlying layers. The bound calcium is dissociated from binding proteins, allowing the calcium to penetrate through the spreading layer into the underlying reagent layer. In the reagent layer, the calcium forms a complex with Arsenazo II dye, causing a shift in the absorption maximum.

After incubation, the reflection density of the colored complex is measured spectrophotometrically. The amount of colored complex formed is proportional to the calcium concentration in the sample fluid. The test result is reported in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/ L).

VITROS Chemistry Products DT Calibrator Kit contains four levels of lyophilized standards with corresponding diluents. The standards are prepared from bovine serum albumin and processed bovine serum to which enzymes, electrolytes, stabilizers, preservatives and other organic analytes have been added. The companion diluents are prepared from processed water to which inorganic salts have been added.

The VITROS System and reagents are designed specifically for use with the VITROS Chemistry Products range of products.

Dear Ms. Hanna:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
