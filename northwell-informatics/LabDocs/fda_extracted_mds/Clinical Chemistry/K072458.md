Summary and Explanation of the Test

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is one of the most common metabolic disorders resulting in permanent mental retaratintecteat snr bir.Nwbons hat avbeeeni nrea CH within two weeks of birth can be expected to have normal cognitive development.

Screening programs for the disorder were developed early in 1974 and have now been established in Western Europe, North America, Japan and parts of Eastern Europe, Asia, South and Central America. The American Academy of Pediatrics first published recommendations for screening for CH in 1993. Advances in scrcening methods and expanded knowledge of the physiology of thyroid hormones has lead to new recommendations by the Academy in 2006. In North America more than five million newborns are screened annually with over 1400 hypothyroid cases detected each year. The incidence of hypothyroidism varies among different populations and ranges from 1 in 3000 to 1 in 4000. The incidence of CH is higher in Hispanics and lowerin black individuals. Females have a 2:1 greater incidence of CH than males. A higher frequency of the CH disorder has been observed in individuals with Downs Syndrome.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a pituitary-derived glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 28 kDa. TSH is produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland under the control of thyrotropin releasighormone (TRH) which is secreted by the hypothalamus.TH acts on the thyroid gnd to y  Tnhr nl yrcn v o te thyroid hormones T and Ts inversely related to the concenrations of TSH and TRH inthe blootrem v a negativ eback meanim.As a resul  thi negativeeebck mehanim betwen the tyron a epy is        It i for this reason that the measurement of TSH concentration is a valuable diagnostic tool for the detection of hypothyroidism.

Thyroid hormone (TH) levels of the fetus are low during the first half of pregnancy. Maternal status of TH horoes is entirely responsible or the regulation of fetal TH, transmitted through the placenta.The feal hypothalamic—pituitary—thyroid axis develops during the second half of gestation and is mature at tme of brth.A sure o TSH cncntatoccurs at birh and then dces rapiy within the rst ew daysie, and continues to decrease more slowly to adult levels. It is recommended to perform screening for CH ideally within the 2nd to 4th days after birth or at time of discharge.

Blood samples collected before4 hours of age, from low birth weight or ill infants can lead to elevated TSH and thus false positive results. Hypothyroid infants may be partially protected by mateal TH levels and so m ifnts wil pralt irh.Thee have lo been rtcas t ypoyroiism materal ypothyroidism nd othermatealanomalites.Hypothyroidism can develop ater birth, andin such cases will yield a normal newborn screening result.

Since the incidence of hypothyroidism and the concentrations of TSH have been shown to vary according to a bit iprtnt that ch newbo cree laboratoexam t st populati ndetermi t normal range and cut-off values with these factors taken into consideration.

Screening algorithms vary among centers from initial TSH with confirmation via T4 measurements, to T4al screen with confirmation via TSH measurements, to both tests (T4 and TSH) being performed simultaneously. Regardless of method, repeated positive results on a neonate should be cause for referral for additional confirmation testing.

Principle of the Assay

The GBI TSH Neonatal Screening Kit is an enzyme immunoassay. A highly specific polyclonal goat antihTSH (human) antibody has been immobilized onto each well of the 96-well microplates provided. To begin the assay, sample discs punched from dried whole blood spot standards, controls and neonate specimens are theca e lubu s lThe platato eluTH fome dis and t allowcapture  the eluted TH by the antibyobilized nto he micoplate wes.Follw incubation the plates are washed to remove the sample discs as well as the eluate.

A second antibody, a B-specific anti-hTSH monoclonal that has been conjugated to the enzyme horseradishperidase (HRP), is then added to the wel and incubated. The eluted TSH of the sample already capture y the microplate-bound antibody is now also bound by the enzyme-conjugated monoclonal antibody added. An antbody-TSH-antibody bridge, or "sandwich", fors that is bound t the surface of the microplate wells. Any unbound complexes are removed with subsequent plate washings.

The final stage of the assay is the detection of the microwell-bound complexes by the addition of a color developing reagent. The enzyme (HRP) portion of the bound "sandwich" reacts with the color developer, $3 , 3 ^ { \prime }$ , 5, 5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The TMB/ HO liquid is converted from colorless to blue.The degree of color change is directly proportional to the amount of TSH an tha is boun theweThe ordevement ermia with hediin co so a converts the blue to yellow.

The results are measured with a microplate reader at a wavelcngth of $4 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . The absorbance measured is drectly proortional to the conenration  TH in the sampl.A tandar curve s enerat by plot the light absorbance of each standard versus its known TSH concentration. The concentrations of TSH in the unknown samples are determined by interpolation from this standard curve.

Predicate data and descriptive text were obtained from the Accuwell TSH ELISA Directions For Use (DFU) unless otherwise indicated.

2 The predicate DFU declares the use of "Schleicher & Schuell (S&S) 903T" filter paper as the sample substrate. S&S has since been purchased by Whatman and the name of the 903 filter paper has been changed to "Whatman $9 0 3 ^ { \mathfrak { w } _ { \mathfrak { s } } , }$ . For this reason, table references throughout use the Whatman $9 0 3 ^ { \mathfrak { D } }$ designation only, even though the predicate DFU actually refers to the paper as S&S $9 0 3 ^ { \mathbf { r m } }$ .

3 Precision data were not generated in the same way nor reported in precisely the same terms for the predicate vs the new device. The new (GBI TSH) device precision was established and reported according to NCCLS EP5-A2, "Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods"; Approved Guideline-Second Edition.

Predicate values were obtained from the CDC's Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program (NSQAP) 2006 Annual Summary Report; Volume 24, January 2007.

GBI values were obtained from the same data sct that was used to establish assay precision values.

# Analytical Sensitivity

The Analytical Limit at Low Levels (limit of sensitivity) for the GBl TSH EIA Kit was determined by testing the zero standard multiple times $( \mathsf { N } ^ { = } 2 0 )$ within a single assay. The resulting data were used to calculate the analytical limit at low levels. Refer to the table below.

The analytical sensitivity is defined as the calculated concentration that corresponds to the mean of the absorbance values of the zero standard $( N = 2 0 )$ plus two times the standard deviation derived from those same $( N { = } 2 0 )$ absorbance values.

These data are provided for example ony. Each laboratory should establish appropriate working lmits based upon their own patient population and/or data.

# Linearity, Recovery and Assay Measurable (Reportable) Range

The GBI TSH EIA Kit linear range was assessed according to the NCCLS Guideline EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods, 2003.

A series of dried whole blood spot samples was prepared to provide the desired range of TSH concentrations for the study $( \mathbf { N } { = } 1 9$ ; see table column "Expected Value", below).

# Interfering Substances

Assay interference due to the presence of hemoglobin, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, and lipids was studied using methods described in NCCLS EP7A: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry as guidance.

Testing was performed to evaluate the effects of interfering substances at the medical decision(s) concentrations using fresh whole blood.The interferents (i.e., hemoglobin, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, and lipids) were present in the whole blood specimens at the desired ("worst case") concentrations before specimens were spotted onto filter paper and dried. As such, the sample elution procedure was captured in the subsequent testing process. These prepared dried blood spot specimens were then assayed using the GBI TSH Kit as prescribed herein. (Results are presented bclow.)

An additional study was conducted that challenged the assay at a much higher hemoglobin concentration. During the initial sample elution step of the assay procedure, three different concentrations (physiologc low, mid, high) of hemoglobin were added separately to microplate wells that also separately contained the three different concentrations (physiologic low, mid, high) of a CDC TSH control sample series. The remainder of the GBI TSH assay was performed as prescribed herein. (Results are presented below.)

Interference was defined as a test value obtained that was greater than $+ / - 1$ S.D. (within-run) of the mating contol valuetaied in the same assay; AND, the difference o the est valuebtaied from the matching control value is clinically significant at that level.

No interference with expected values of any clinical significance was observed from any substance tested, at any concentration tested.
