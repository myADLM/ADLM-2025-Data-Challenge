Name of the device: Trade or proprietary name: Common or usual name:

One Step HCG Urine/Serum Test One Step HCG Urine/Serum Test HCG Urine/Serum Test

Classification: All are Class Il medical devices with the following product code and Code of Federal Regulation references:

Product Code DHA

CFR# 862.1155

The legally marketed device to which we are claiming equivalence [807.92(a)(3)]: Acon Laboratories, Inc. HCG One Step Urine/Serum Pregnancy Test, K980736.

Description of the device:

Assay Principle: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) is one of the glycoproteins secreted by the placenta. It contains a-and β-subunits. The a-subunit of HCG shows cross-reactions with LH, TSH and FSH, because of similarities in the amino acid sequences. However, the β- subunit of HCG is specific, and shows the lowest cross reactions in assays. The antibodies, which were used before in HCG detection, were directed against the whole HCG molecule, and therefore regularly presented cross reactions with LH and TSH. Wondfo One Step HCG Urine/Serum Test is aimed to be a HCG specific test by using a monoclonal antibody against highly purified β-HCG. Immunochromatograph assay for hCG using a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of hCG in human urine/serum. Each assay uses a monoclonal antibody-dye congugate from mouse against β-HCG with gold chloride and fixed a-HCG antibody conjugate and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membrane.

Intended use of the device:

The One Step HCG Urine/Serum Test is used for the qualitative determination of HCG which appears in urine or serum for early detection of pregnancy. They are intended for professional use

Summary of the technological characteristics of our device compared to the predicate device:

The Wondfo Biotech Co., Ltd. One Step HCG Urine/Serum Test have similar technological characteristics and performance to the predicate and are equivalent.
