# Rationale for Considering the Device Substantially Equivalent to Devices Approved for Interstate Commerce

Genzyme N-geneous LDL Cholesterol Reagent (k971573) was selected for comparing serum samples with to the results generated by Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent. Detailed performance characteristics and comparison analysis are given in this filing and demonstrate substantial equivalence to predicate device that is currently being legally marketed.

The Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent is similar to the approved predicate test. The minor differences in the performances of the tests should not affect the safety and effectiveness of the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent and offers users an in-vitro diagnostic device to measure LDL Cholesterol in human serum or plasma.

In summary, the dissimilar features between the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent and devices currently legally marketed do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. This is supported by the accuracy data comparing serum sample values obtained using the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent with those obtained using the predicate device, Genzyme N-geneous LDL Cholesterol Reagent (k971573).

# Description of the Device

The assay is based on a modified polyvinyl sulfonic acid (PVS) and polyethylene-glycol methyl ether (PEGME) coupled classic precipitation method with the improvements in using optimized quantities of PVS/PEGME and selected detergents. LDL, VLDL, and chylomicron (CM) react with PVS and PEGME and the reaction results in inaccessibility of LDL, VLDL and CM by cholesterol oxidase (CHOD) and cholesterol esterase (CHER), whereas HDL reacts with the enzymes. Addition of R2 containing a specific detergent releases LDL from the PVS/PEGME complex. The released LDL reacts with the enzymes to produce $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ which is quantified by the Trinder reaction.

# Intended Use of the Device:

The Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in human serum or plasma. The reagents can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients at risk of developing coronary heart disease. Elevated LDL cholesterol is the primary target of cholesterol-lowering therapy.

# Performance Characteristics

Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent is a homogeneous two-reagent enzymatic assay. The results are obtained in 10 minutes by measuring absorbance at $6 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ . The linearity of the assay is from 1.64 - $8 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ for serum samples. The assay offers excellent precision as shown in the tables below:

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Serum Testing</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 195mg/dL LDL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 2146mg/dL LDL</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Level 3210mg/dL LDL</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Within-Run Precision</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cv%=1.0%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cy%=0.8%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cv%= 0.7%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total Precision</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cy%=1.6%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cv%=1.5%</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cy%=1.4%</td></tr></table>

In method comparison studies, samples tested with Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent showed good correlation with Genzyme $\mathsf { N }$ -geneous LDL Cholesterol Reagent (k971573) with correlation coefficients of 0.996 for serum samples.

We have conducted interference studies by spiking normal pooled human serum samples with substances normally present in serum or plasma and found less than $10 \%$ interference at the indicated concentrations.

Conclusion: Comparison analysis presented in this $5 1 0 \mathrm { k }$ submission filing in the comparison section, together with linearity, precision and interference and other detailed studies, demonstrates that the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent has excellent accuracy and is safe and effective. There is no significant deviation between the results obtained by Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent and the legally marketed predicate device (k971573) when testing clinical patient samples and is therefore substantially similar.
