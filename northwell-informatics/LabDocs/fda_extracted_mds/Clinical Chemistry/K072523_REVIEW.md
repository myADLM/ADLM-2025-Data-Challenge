# I. Device Description:

The Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol kit contains two reagents Reagent 1 4X70ml bottles and Reagent $2 \ : 2 \mathrm { X } 5 0 \mathrm { m l }$ bottles and 2X1ml calibrator materials. In addition, control materials consisting of three lyophilized human serum based materials are sold separately. All donor pools for the serum pool used to make the control and calibrator materials have been tested by FDA licensed methods and found non reactive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C and HIV I and II. The assay is based upon a modified polyvinyl sulfonic acid and polyethylene-glycol-methyl ether coupled precipitation to LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons making them inaccessible to cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol esterase. HDL then reacts with cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol esterase. Addition of special detergents in the R2 reagent release LDL which reacts with $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ which is then quantified by the Trinder Reaction.

Precision of the Diazyme HDL- Cholesterol Reagent was evaluated using the CLSI EP5-A guideline. In the study three levels of serum samples were tested with 2 runs per day in duplicate over 20 days using the Roche Diagnostics Hitachi 917. An additional precision study was performed on the Hitachi 917 using one level of serum containing about $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of LDL-C tested in two runs per day in duplicate for 5 working days. The results are presented in the table below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity determination was based upon NCCLS (CLSI) EP6-A. 16 samples were prepared by diluting a serum sample containing $2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of LDL-C. Each level was measured in triplicate on the Hitachi 917. The resulting regression equation was: $\mathrm { Y = 0 } . 9 8 4 8 \mathrm { X - 1 } . 8 9$ , $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 9 8 9$ . The sponsor determined an acceptable $\%$ error was $\leq 1 0 \%$ . The reportable range for the assay is $2 - 2 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

This device has not been certified or tested by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRLMN). A statement reflecting this is included in the labeling.

The NIST SRM 1915b material was tested with the Diazyme LDLCholesterol reagent and found to have a deviation from the NIST target value of $2 . 8 \%$ for level I ( $1 1 6 . 3 9 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ ) and $0 . 9 5 \%$ for level II ( $1 5 4 . 0 5 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ .

Values are assigned to the control materials by repeat testing on the Hitachi 917 using the Diazyme LDL-cholesterol reagent and calibrator. The assigned ranges are lot specific. The following ranges were obtained for a tested lot: Level I 142-214 mg/dL; Level I $\mathrm { I } 9 4 \mathrm { - } 1 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and Level III $2 6 { - } 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

Reagent Stability: Reagents from two lots were stored in incubators at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and $4 \mathrm { ^ { o } C }$ . Reagents were tested at 0 day, 2 days, 6 days, 7 days and 10 days. Accelerated study results show that the reagent is stable for up to 12 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time studies are being conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed. Stability on board the Hitachi 917 was studied by storing the two reagents (R1 and R2) in the $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ storage chamber of the Hitachi 917. Results indicate the reagents are suitable for on board storage for up to 60 days.

Calibrator Stability: Calibrators from two lots were stored in incubators at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C }$ . The calibrators were removed from storage a predetermined times and tested with the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol reagent. The accuracy of the Calibrators was determined by testing LDL-C samples of know concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the calibrators was determined to be 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { C }$ . Real time studies are being conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.

Control Stability: Controls from two lots were stored in incubators at $3 7 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ ,

$2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The controls were removed from storage at predetermined times and tested in duplicate with the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol reagent. The accuracy of the controls was determined by testing LDL-C samples of know concentrations determined by the predicate kit. The shelf life of the calibrators was determined to be 12 months at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } } \mathrm { C }$ . Open vial stability for controls was determined to be one month. Real time studies are being conducted and adjustments to shelf life will be made as needed.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LOB) and Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) for the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol assay were determined based upon the CLSI EP17-A Protocol. The LOB was determined by testing zero calibrator 12 times on the Hitachi 917. The LOB obtained was $1 . 6 4 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (the mean $+ 3 \mathrm { S D } )$ . The Limit of Quantitation of the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Reagent was determined by diluting a serum sample into 4 other samples. The 5 samples were tested 5 times over 3 days for a total of 125 replicates. The value estimated for LOQ where a $20 \%$ CV was obtained was $2 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

To determine the level of interference from substance normally present in human serum, the Diazyme LDL-Cholesterol Assay was tested with normal serum samples containing about $7 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ LDL-C spiked with various concentrations of interfering substances following CLSI guideline EP7-A. The following substance normally present in serum produced less than $10 \%$ deviation when tested at levels equal to the following concentrations:
