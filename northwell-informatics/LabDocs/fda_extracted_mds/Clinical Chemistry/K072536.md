Vitamin D Test System 21CFR 862.1825 Product Code: MRG

Predicate Device:

LIASON® 25 OH Vitamin D Assay 510(k) 032844

Statement of Intended Use:

The ESA Biosciences Inc. Vitamin D HPLC test is for the quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in human serum or EDTA-plasma to be used in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency. Assay results should be used in conjunction with other clinical or laboratory data to assist the clinician in making individual patient management decisions in an adult population.

# Device Description

The ESA method is a complete kit for measurement of Total 25(OH)D by HPLC with electrochemical (EC) detection. Specific reagents and solid phase extraction columns are included for sample preparation and are employed with user-supplied standard laboratory equipment (centrifuge, test tubes, pipettes, etc.).  A $2 0 0 \mu \ L$ volume of sample (serum or plasma) is mixed with a precipitation reagent, which contains internal standard (IS).

The internal standard is a stable vitamin D analogue that is used to correct for variability in extraction recovery and analytical sample volume. After centrifugation, supernatant is poured onto a pre-conditioned SPE column for rapid extraction of $2 5 ( \mathsf { O H } ) \mathsf { D }$ and IS. SPE columns are washed with 2 different reagents and analytes are eluted with a third reagent. The resulting eluent is diluted before analysis. The prepared sample is analyzed with an isocratic HPLC system using an ESA EC detector (Coulochem® I1 or CoulArray) equipped with a dual coulometric EC cell. Calibration is accomplished by direct HPLC analysis of authentic standard solutions (i.e. not taken through the extraction step). Analysis requires a specific guard and analytical column, mobile phase and calibration reagents to allow rapid quantitative analysis.

A dual EC cell is used with the first, upstream, cell maintained at a specific potential to oxidatively screen possible interfering sample components. The second, downstream cellis maintained at a potential that is optimized for selective 25(OH)D detection. The dual coulometric EC cell is a rugged detector that provides much higher selectivity and sensitivity than commonly used absorbance detectors. This allows the use of lower sample volumes than are typically required with HPLC-UV methods and is less susceptible to interferences. Analytical run time is less than 12 minutes and Total $2 5 ( 0 H ) D$ sample concentration is automatically determined by single-point internal standard quantitation.

# Summary of Performance

# Precision

Four 'neat' (i.e., not spiked or pooled) samples consisting of 2 sera and 2 EDTA plasma were used for this study, which followed CLsi EP5-A. Four replicates of each sample, were individually prepared (taken through all pre-analytical and analytical steps of the procedure) and analyzed in a single run each day, repeated over 20 days. Samples were run on a single instrument, by two operators and using two lots of reagents and extraction columns. Analysis of variance calculations were used to estimate within-run and within-device imprecision.

Precision performance was also evaluated using plasma pools supplemented with 25(OH)D at 2 concentration levels. The protocol followed CLSl EP5-A. Five replicates of each level were individually prepared (i.e., taken through all pre-analytical and analytical steps) and analyzed in a single run each day. Data from a total of 20 runs, performed at two sites were included in the precision evaluation (300 total observations). Three different HPLC-EC systems, four operators, two reagent lots, five analytical columns (3 lots), three lots of SPE columns and four analytical cells were used in these studies. Analysis of variance calculations were used to estimate withinrun and total imprecision.

# Limit of Detection (LoD)

The LoD was determined consistent with the guidelines in CLSI EP17A. Blank matrix was bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline. Patient samples with low $2 5 ( 0 H ) 0$ concentrations, as determined by the LCUV reference method, were used to prepare low level pools The results were analyzed using the nonparametric method. The LoQ (limit of quantitation) was set to the concentration at which the $\%$ CV from low level samples was $\leq 2 0 \%$ .

Provided below are estimates of LoD, limit of blank (LoB) and LoQ based on 133 determinations in 11 runs, with 67 blank and 66 low-level samples with less than $5 \%$ false negative and less than $5 \%$ false positives:

# Linearity

Linearity was studied according to CLSI EP6 on two HPLC systems. Low and high level plasma were mixed proportionally to obtain a total of 13 equally -spaced concentrations spanning the intended assay range $( 7 . 0 - 2 0 0 n g / m L )$ for 25(OH)D. Three aliquots of each sample concentration were taken through all pre-analytical steps of the assay and analyzed in random order in a single run. Performance was assessed using the polynomial evaluation as described in CLSI EP-6A.

For total $2 5 ( 0 H ) D$ by the ESA Vitamin D HPLC Test, the method has been demonstrated to be linear from the LoQ (7.0 ng/mL) to 200 ng/mL based on goals of $\leq$ 3ng/mL bias due to nonlinearity for concentrations of $\leq 2 0 \ n g / m L$ and $\leq 7 . 5 \%$ bias due to non-linearity at concentrations of $2 1 - 2 0 0 n g / m L$ .

# Recovery

Sample pools: EDTA plasma (5 subjects) and serum (6 subjects) were each spiked with 25HOD concentrate to increase the individual concentrations of 25(0H)D by 0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ng/mL. Concentration levels of total 25(OH)D in unspiked pools were less than 10 ng/mL. Three replicates of each sample were taken through all pre-analytical and analytical steps of the assay. Each pool and corresponding spiked samples were analyzed in random order in a single run. Samples were analyzed on two different HPLC systems.

Percent recovery was determined by: [(Measured concentration - Endogenous (unspiked) concentration)/Spiked Concentration] $\yen 100$ .

For each sample matrix, mean recovery $n = 6$ , each level $= 3$ replicates on 2 systems) are summarized below:

# Method Comparison and Bias Estimation

Method comparison studies followed CLSI EP9-A2. The studies were performed at two external sites. Serum samples from 85 individual patients were collected at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics (UWHC). These were chosen from samples submitted routinely to UWHC for $2 5 ( \mathsf { O H } ) \mathsf { D }$ analysis and represent a wide population with respect to medical, dietary and therapeutic conditions. Fifteen additional samples were prepared by augmenting aliquots of a single serum pool (prepared from approximately 50 individual patient samples) with varying amounts of 25(OH)D.

All 100 samples were run in duplicate by a LCUV reference method' at UWHC. Fifty of these patient samples were run in duplicate by the ESA LCEC test method at one external site and the other fifty patient samples were run in duplicate by the LCEC test method at UWHC. Samples were run on 12 separate days, by 3 different technologists over a 7 week period with no more than 10 patient samples run per day. Calibration and control materials used for the LCUV reference method were independent of the LCEC test method.

For this analysis, data from both sites were pooled and the first replicate of the Y (ESA LCEC) results were analyzed against the average of the X (LCUV) results. No outliers were removed. Five samples with values outside the measuring range, LOQ $( 7 . 0 \ n g / m L )$ to 200 ng/mL, of the ESA assay were excluded from this analysis.

The following table and figure provide a summary of data analysis for total 25(OH)D. All data analyses were performed as described in EPg-A2 and include the following:

# Interference Studies

This assay is susceptible to interference from 25(OH)epiD2 and 25(OH)epiD3, which are endogenous metabolites present in neonates². This assay should therefore not be used for measurement in samples from patients < 1 year of age. A 10% positive bias was observed for samples with a cholesterol level of 500mg/dL. Estimated bias for lower concentrations of cholesterol was acceptable $( < 1 0 \% )$ . The following provides additional detail of interference susceptibility testing.

Interference susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A. Substances chosen for study were based on consideration of chemical structure determinants for electrochemical response and chromatographic retention, common medications in the intended population, therapeutic vitamin D analogs and matrix effects / conditions. The following table lists substances that were initially screened by direct HPLC-EC analysis along with the observed retention times.

From Table 9-1, 19-nor- $1 \mathtt { a } , 2 5 ( \mathsf { O H } ) _ { 2 } \mathsf { D } 2$ (paricalcitol) and 25(OH)epiD3 were the only compounds that were identified as possible interfering substances. These substances and several endogenous compounds were characterized to determine the degree of interference as a function of interferent concentration (i.e., dose-response). Serum was prepared with high and low (normal) concentrations of each possible interferent (see below). High and low samples were mixed proportionally to produce a total of 5 equally-spaced levels of each possible interfering substance. Three replicates of each sample were individually prepared and analyzed in random order a single run.

The results of these studies are described below:

The following endogenous substances, when tested according to CLSI EP7-A, in a serum sample containing $2 5 ( \mathsf { O H } ) \mathsf { D } 2$ at $6 7 n g / m L$ and $2 5 ( \mathsf { O H } ) \mathsf { D 3 }$ at $5 3 n g / m L$ , did not interfere at, or below, the interferent test concentration indicated. Bias, calculated from regression analysis of the doseresponse data, exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference.

No C3 epimers were detected in age groups greater than O-1 year. Based on this report, this assay should not be susceptible to interference from C3 epimers for the intended adult patient population.

# Reference Range

The following results were obtained specifically with the ESA Vitamin D HPLC Test from a reference sample group that is reflective of a typical sample population within the contiguous 48 US States. Note: These data are provided as an example. It is important for each laboratory to establish a reference range representative of its typical population.

Samples from 150 apparently healthy adult human subjects were collected from 3 locations to achieve even North-South geographical distribution within the latitudes of the contiguous 48 US States. Samples were collected in late winter. Individuals taking prescription or over-the-counter vitamin D supplements were excluded. The reference range was determined according to the non-parametric method in CLSI C28-A2.

# Conclusion

Through the use of plasma and serum samples, augmented plasma and serum samples, standards and controls the performance and reliability of this assay has been validated over the measuring range of 7.0 ng/mL (LoQ) to $2 0 0 \ n g / \mathrm { m L }$ . In so doing adequate sensitivity, precision, linearity, recovery, detection limits and immunity from interferences has been demonstrated.
