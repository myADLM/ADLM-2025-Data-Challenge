# L. Test Principle:

The ESA method is a kit for measurement of total 25(OH) Vitamin D by HPLC with electrochemical (EC) detection. Specific reagents and solid phase extraction columns are included for sample preparation. A $2 0 0 { \mathrm { u L } }$ volume of sample (serum or plasma) is mixed with a precipitation reagent, which contains internal standard. The internal standard is a stable vitamin D analog that is used to correct for variability in extraction recovery and analytical sample volume. After centrifugation, supernatant is poured onto a pre-conditioned SPE column for rapid extraction of 25(OH)D and the IS. SPE columns are washed with 2 different reagents and analytes are eluted with a third reagent. The resulting eluent is diluted before analysis. The prepared sample is analyzed with an ESA HPLC system using an ESA EC detector (Coulochem III or CoulArray) equipped with a dual coulometric EC cell. Calibration is accomplished by direct HPLC analysis of authentic standard solutions (i.e. not taken through the extraction step). 25(OH)D and IS are separated chromatographically followed by EC detection. A dual EC cell is used with the first, upstream, cell maintained at a specific potential to oxidatively screen possible interfering sample components. The second, downstream cell is maintained at a potential that is optimized for selective 25(OH)D detection. Total 24(OH)D sample concentrations are determined by single-point internal standard quantitation.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Precision studies were performed using CLSI Document EP5-A as a guideline. Five replicates of three concentration levels of analyte in EDTA plasma pools that were individually prepared and analyzed in a single run each day, repeated over 20 days. Five days were performed at an external site. Three different HPLC-EC systems, four operators, two reagent lots, five analytical columns (3 lots), three lots of SPE columns and four analytical cells were used in these studies. Three samples were prepared by spiking EDTA plasma, pooled from 5 individual blood bank donors, with assayed, commercially procured 25(OH)D.

Two serum and two EDTA plasma samples were acquired from adult human subjects. Four replicates of each sample were individually prepared (taken through all pre-analytical and analytical steps of the procedure) and analyzed in a single run each day, repeated over 20 days. Samples were run on a single instrument, by two operators and using two lots of reagents and extraction columns. Three replicates were lost during pre-analytical sample processing.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

To establish the linearity of the assay, a study design was used based on CLSI protocol EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: a Statistical Approach: Approved Guideline. The claimed measuring range of this device is $7 - 2 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m L }$ .

A volume of low level EDTA plasma was spiked with assayed 25(OH)D concentrate. The low and high level samples were mixed to obtain 13 samples with concentrations spanning the measuring range. Three aliquots of each sample concentration were taken through the pre-analytical step for the assay. Upon completion of this step, extracts were divided into 2 aliquots and one aliquot was analyzed by an HPLC-Coulochem III system and the other was analyzed by an HPLC-CoulArray system.

Linear regression statistics: HPLC-Coulochem III system $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 8 \mathrm { x } - 4 . 4 6$   
$\dot { \mathrm { r } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 4$

HPLC-CoulArray system $\mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 5 \mathrm { x } - 2 . 4 6$ $\mathrm { \dot { r } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 5$

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Calibrator:

Value assignment: An Internal Standard Stock and Master Product Calibrator Stock are created in-house (there is no primary calibrator, recognized reference material or reference measurement procedure for this Measurand at this time). Value assignment of both Stocks is made by UV absorbance spectrometry calibrated with NIST SRM 935a, based on NIST recommended molar extinction coefficients. A working Internal Standard is created by tenfold volumetric dilution of the Internal Standard Stock. The working Calibrator is a mixture of equivalent volumes of the Master Product Calibration Stock and Internal Standard Stock, followed by dilution to 100 $\mathrm { n g / m L }$ of 25(OH)D. Each lot of product calibrator and internal standard are assayed by HPLC to confirm purity and between-lot consistency.

# Stability:

Kit components: The shelf-life, on-board and open stability testing protocols for kit components and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. Current shelf life studies support a six-month shelf life, with realtime studies on-going to support twelve months.

Samples: To evaluate the stability of samples stored at different conditions, two sample levels were prepared by spiking freshly drawn EDTA plasma with 25(OH)D. Three aliquots of each sample were processed immediately and analyzed within one hour of processing. Results from these aliquots were used as the basis for comparison to samples that were stored for various time periods and storage conditions before processing. On board stability of processed samples was also assessed.

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the ESA Vitamin D HPLC test was determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. One low level sample was prepared by spiking blank matrix (bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline) with 25(OH)D. Two additional low samples were prepared by pooling patient samples. Six replicates of the blank matrix and three replicates each of the low level samples were analyzed in each run. Each replicate was taken through all pre-analytical and analytical steps of the assay. Twelve runs were performed with two analytical systems, 3 EC cells, 3

analytical columns, 2 lots of SPE columns, 2 reagent lots and two operators. The non-parametric method (CLSI EP17-A) was used to calculate the LoB. The LoB was calculated to be $2 . 5 1 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ and the LoD was calculated to be $5 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ . The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was calculated to be $7 . 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ and was defined as the concentration of the analyte demonstrated imprecision less than or equal to $20 \%$ CV.

# e. Analytical specificity:

The ESA Vitamin D HPLC test was evaluated for interference consistent with CLSI Guideline EP7-A2.

The following substances were added to two EDTA plasma samples (with 25(OH)D levels of $4 3 ~ \mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $1 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m L } }$ ) and were found not to interfere with the Vitamin D HPLC test (a bias exceeding $10 \%$ is considered interference):

Cholesterol, tested at a level of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , was found to produce a bias of more than $10 \%$ . (The actual bias seen was $1 0 . 1 \%$ .) In addition, $2 5 ( \mathrm { O H } ) \mathrm { E p i D } 3$ , a vitamin metabolite, was found to interfere with the Vitamin D HPLC test. This compound is found only in infants $0 - 1$ year of age. As noted in the limitations section of the package insert, this assay should therefore not be used for measurement in samples from patients less than 1 year of age. (The sponsor did not test 25(OH)EpiD2, also found only in infants 0-1 year of age, which is known to interfere with $2 5 \mathrm { ( O H ) D }$ assays, but referred the user to literature in the product insert for further information.)

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The ESA Vitamin D HPLC Test was compared to a reference method using CLSI Document EP9-A2 as a guideline for the method comparison study.

The Vitamin D HPLC Test was compared to a reference HPLC method using serum samples from 85 individual patients and fifteen additional samples prepared by augmenting aliquots of a single serum pool (prepared from approximately 50 individual patient samples) with varying amounts of 25(OH)D. Results from 95 specimens with analyte values that spanned the measuring range of the device (tested over 6 non-consecutive days) were reported. The correlation was found to be:

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The reference range was determined according to the non-parametric method in CLSI C28-A2.

Samples from 150 apparently healthy adult human subjects were collected from 3 locations to achieve even North-South geographical distribution within the latitudes of the contiguous 48 US States. (Specifically, samples were obtained from 75 individuals living in Massachusetts, 37 in Tennessee and 38 in Texas.) Inclusion and exclusion of individuals was based on a questionnaire. The designation of “apparently healthy adult human subjects” was based on the initial Normal Blood Donor intake questionnaire and by preliminary viral testing. Individuals taking prescription or over-the-counter vitamin D supplements were excluded.

Sample analysis was performed over a 2-day time frame using one analytical system, one lot of reagents and by one operator. Samples were collected in late winter (i.e., March). The population consisted of 71 $( 4 7 \% )$ females and 79 $( 5 3 \% )$ males ranging in age from 20 to 64 years $[ \mathrm { m e a n } = 4 0$ years, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 0$ years] and comprised 109 $( 7 3 \% )$ Caucasian, 36 $( 2 4 \% )$ African-American and 5 $( 3 \% )$ Hispanic individuals.
