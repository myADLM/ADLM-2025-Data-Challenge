The Saf-T Closed Blood Collection System® is a venous blood drawing device that consists of three distinct configurations with distinct uses as follows.

1. REF Code 99200: Syringe line draw and transfer

This device consists of IV tubing with a male and female Luer, clamps to control blood flow, and a Saf-T Holder® Device.

•The male Luer is attached to a peripheral IV catheter hub at the time of IV catheter insertion.   
• A sample syringe is attached to the female Luer to collect the blood sample. Transfer from the sample syringe is accomplished by inserting vacuum tubes into the Saf-T Holder $\mathfrak { Q }$ device.

# 2. REF Code 992XX\*: Syringe draw and transfer via Saf-T Wing® access

$\ast \mathrm { x x }$ corresponds to the needle gauge, example: REF 99223 is the 23G needle This device consists of IV tubing with a female Luer , clamps to control blood flow, a Saf-T Wing® needle and a Saf-T Holder® Device. The Saf-T Wing® needle is offered in three sizes: 21G, 23G, 25G all $\%$ long.

The vein is accessed via the Saf-T Wing® needle   
Blood is drawn into a syringe which is attached to the female Luer   
The blood sample is then transferred from the syringe by inserting vacuum tubes into the Saf-T Holder $\otimes$ device.

# 3. REF Code 99300: Syringe line draw, transfer and flush

This device consists of IV tubing with a male Luer, two female Luers , clamps to control blood flow, and a Saf-T Holder $\circledast$ Device.

The male Luer is attached to a peripheral IV catheter hub at the time of IV catheter insertion.   
A sample syringe is attached to the female Luer to collect the blood sample.   
A pre-filled flush syringe is attached to the second female Luer.   
The blood sample is then transferred from the syringe by inserting vacuum tubes into the Saf-T Holder $\otimes$ device.   
The catheter is flushed using the attached pre-filled syringe

REF Code 99200 and 99300

# Device Name: Saf-T Closed Blood Collection System® with Saf-T Holder® Device and Male Luer Connector

# Non-Clinical Data:

Bench testing confirms that the proposed device and the predicate device have similar performance specifications.

# Clinical Data:

Not Required

# Conclusion:

The bench testing conducted demonstrates that the proposed device is safe and effective and is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Farias:

We have reviewed your Section $5 1 0 ( \mathrm { k } )$ premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcernents concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115.
