# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

None were referenced in the submission.

L. Test Principle: Not applicable.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Not applicable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable.

Stability studies assayed for both microalbumin and creatinine. Accelerated stability studies were performed to support shelf life of the product. Real time studies are on-going for the life of the product. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is defined as $\mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { f i n a l } }$ being $\pm 1 0 \%$ Tzero.

Shelf life stability: 2 years at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

Open vial stability: 30 days at 2 to $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit: Not applicable.   
e. Analytical specificity: Not applicable.   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies: a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable. b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable.

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Not applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The expected mean and assay range for specific analyzers are provided in the labeling. The sponsor recommends in the labeling that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use those provided only as guides.

# N. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10 including warning statements for biological source material and to be treated as infectious material with the added caution that it is for professional user.

# O. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
