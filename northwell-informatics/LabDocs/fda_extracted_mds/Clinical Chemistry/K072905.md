# Device

• Proprietary Name: 3test® Supreme Glucose Monitoring System Classification Name: SYSTEM, TEST, BLOOD GLUCOSE, OVER THE COUNTER, Class II Product Code: NBW

# 2.2. Safety and Effectiveness Information

Predicate Device:   
Claim of Substantial Equivalence (SE) is made to NEUERO ENGINEERING INC. - 3test" Blood Glucose Monitoring System ( K050224 ).

Device Description: Based on an electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action, 3test" Supreme Glucose Monitoring System only needs a small amount of blood ( $2 \mu \ell$ same as predicate device ). Capillary action at the

end of the test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and your blood glucose result is precisely and displayed in 5 seconds, and 200 blood glucose result memory.

# Intended Use:

The 3test\* Supreme Glucose Test Strip is intended to measure the glucose in whole blood with the 3lest" Supreme Glucose Monitoring System. It is suitable for a person with diabetes to monitor their blood glucosc at home by themselves. The 3test Supreme Glucose Monitoring System can also be used at clinical sites by nurses or professional people to test patient's glucose level in whole blood.

# Synopsis of Test Methods and Results

Pre-clinical and clinical data are employed upon submission of this 510(K) premarket notification according to the Guidance Document for In Vitro Diagnostic Test System: Guidance for Industry and FDA document provided by CDRH/ FDA.

# Substantial Equivalence (SE)

A claim of substantial equivalence is made to the predicate device NEUERO ENGINEERING INC. - 3lest" Blood Glucose Monitoring System ( K050224 ). Both of them used with the same test strips, have the same working principle and technologies. The differences are the levels range of the control solution, battery number, the memory results, and test Strip lot calibration. There are no safety and effectiveness aspects arising from the subject device. They are substantially equivalent.

Dear Dr. Jen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895.
