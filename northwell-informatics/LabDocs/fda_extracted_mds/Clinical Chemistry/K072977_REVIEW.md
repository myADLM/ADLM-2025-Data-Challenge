# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

Not applicable

# L. Test Principle:

This method is based on the reaction of a sample containing human Apo A-I and

specific antiserum to form an insoluble complex which can be measured turbidimetrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . By constructing a standard curve from the absorbance of standards the concentration of Apo A-I can be determined.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the Diazyme Apolipoprotein A-I assay was evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP5-A guideline. In the study, three levels of serum specimens containing approximately 80, 157, and $2 1 3 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Apo A-I respectively were tested with 2 runs per day in duplicates over 10 working days. The results are shown below

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Eleven levels of linearity samples were prepared by diluting a serum control containing $2 2 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Apo A-I with saline according to CLSI EP6-A guidelines. The linearity set was tested with the Diazyme Apo A-I Assay in triplicates. The results are shown below.

<table><tr><td>Dilution</td><td>Observed</td><td>Expected</td></tr><tr><td>Level 10</td><td>228.77</td><td>228.77</td></tr><tr><td>Level 9</td><td>210.13</td><td>205.893</td></tr><tr><td>Level 8</td><td>187.57</td><td>183.016</td></tr><tr><td>Level 7</td><td>160.43</td><td>160.139</td></tr><tr><td>Level 6</td><td>140.30</td><td>137.262</td></tr><tr><td>Level 5</td><td>116.23</td><td>114.385</td></tr><tr><td>Level 4</td><td>93.13</td><td>91.508</td></tr><tr><td>Level 3</td><td>68.83</td><td>68.631</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>43.53</td><td>45.754</td></tr><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>19.93</td><td>22.877</td></tr><tr><td>Level 0</td><td>0.50</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

Linear regression was performed with the following results: $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 1 9 \mathbf { x }$ - 1.176, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$ . The claimed reportable range is from $2 0 - 2 2 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Diazyme Apolipoprotein A-1 calibrator is traceable to the WHO/IFCC International Reference Materials for Apo A-1, SP-101. Value assignment was performed using reference calibrators provided by Northwest Lipid Metabolism & Diabetes Research Labs (NLMDRL). The values were also verified by NLMDRL.

The sponsor did not provide any traceability information for the values assigned to the controls. Control values were assigned by performing multiple runs, each with multiple replicates with a single lot of reagents and calibrators. Mean values and acceptable ranges were calculated for each control from this data.

Stability testing was performed and demonstrated that the calibrators, controls, and reagents are stable until the expiration date on the label when stored as instructed. The reagents have a shelf life of one year and are stable on board the Hitachi 917 for 60 days. Calibrators and controls have a shelf life of one year. Once reconstituted the calibrators and controls are stable for 7 days when stored at $2 - 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

To demonstrate the limit of the blank (LOB) of the Diazyme Apo A-I immunoturbidimetric assay, Apo A-I zero calibrator was tested in 12 replicates on Hitachi 917 and LOB was defined as the mean $+ 3 \mathrm { S D }$ . The LOB was calculated as $1 . 4 4 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . To determine the limit of detection (LOD) serum samples containing low concentrations of ApoA-1 were tested with ApoA-1 reagent on Hitachi 917 with 12 replicates each. The LOD was defined as $\mathrm { L O D } = \mathrm { L O B } + ( 1 . 6 4 5 ^ { * } \mathrm { S D }$ Low Samples). The LOD was calculated as $1 . 5 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The sponsor claims $2 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ as the low end of the reportable range.

# e. Analytical specificity:

To determine the level of interference from the substances normally present in human serum, Diazyme Apo A-I immunoturbidimetric assay was tested with normal Apo A-I serum samples spiked with various concentrations of substances following CLSI EP7-A "Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry". No interference was defined as a deviation of less than $10 \%$ from the interferant free sample. The following substances normally present in the serum showed no interference when tested at levels equal to the concentrations listed below.

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

A method comparison study was performed by testing individual serum samples with the Diazyme Apolipoprotein A-I Assay and the predicate device. To ensure the concentrations of Apo A-I were distributed across the reportable dynamic range claimed, additional Apo A-I samples were spiked with Apo AI to achieve higher concentrations, or diluted with saline to reach lower concentrations. A total of 56 un-altered and 9 altered serum samples with concentrations that span the full reportable range were used for the comparison experiment. Linear regression was performed with the following results: $\mathrm { y } = 0 . 9 0 8 \mathrm { x } + 2 . 8 1 3$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 7 9$ . Due to the approximately $9 \%$ bias in the slope compared to the predicate device, each lab should establish its own reference range.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): Not applicable

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The normal range of Apo A I is $1 2 0 - 1 7 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

The package insert also instructs each lab to establish their own reference ranges as the normal range is dependent on geographical location.
