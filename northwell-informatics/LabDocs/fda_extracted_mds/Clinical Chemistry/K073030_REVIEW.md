# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.

# L. Test Principle:

Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip's electrodes. The glucose in the sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Testing was done using whole blood samples spiked with five different glucose concentrations, three different reagent lots, and 10 different AG-605 blood glucose meters. Each combination of multivariate factors was evaluated using 10 measurements. Day-to-day precision was evaluated using three glucose control solutions with concentration levels, low, normal, and high. The day-to-day precision was evaluated over a ten-day period using three different reagent lots. The summary of test results is presented below.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Testing was done with 11 spiked whole blood samples over the range of 22-596 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ (as measured by the reference method), compared with the values generated from YSI-2300 analyzer. A regression analysis showed linearity of AG-605 blood glucose monitoring systems with a linear regression of $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 3 8 8 \mathbf { x } - 3 . 4 4 0 7$ and an $\mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } =$ 0.9971.

# c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Open vial stability was tested using three levels of control solution every day over a 3 month period. The sponsor's acceptance criteria for the control solution $( { \mathrm { < \pm 1 5 m g / d L } }$ for less than $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose and $< \pm 1 5 \%$ bias for samples greater than or equal to 100 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ glucose) was met which supported an open vial stability claim of 3 months.

The controls are traceable to a laboratory reference method.

# d. Detection limit:

The measuring range of the system is $2 0 - 6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . This range was verified by the linearity study (above section M.l.b.).

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interfering substances were dissolved in venous blood samples at several concentrations each, and divided into three aliquots and spiked to nominal glucose concentrations of 70,120, and $2 3 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . These samples were tested against control samples which had a blank solvent added at the same volume as the interferent. Samples were tested 10 times and the percent difference of the interfering samples was calculated and compared to the control samples. The following substances were tested.

Acetaminophen, salicylates, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and other reducing substances (when occurring in normal therapeutic concentrations) do not significantly affect results. The sponsor notes in the labeling that abnormally high concentrations in blood may cause inaccurately high results. Triglyceride of up to $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ (4.5 mmol/L) do not affect the result. When triglyceride was tested at $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ in a sample with a glucose concentration of $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , it showed a bias of $1 6 \%$ , however all other glucose concentrations tested showed bias of $\leq \pm 1 1 \%$ . The labeling will indicate that triglyceride concentrations of $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and below do not affect results. All other compounds tested above showed biases within the sponsors acceptance criteria of a bias $< \pm 1 5 \%$ .

The effect of hematocrit levels of $20 - 7 0 \%$ was tested on whole blood samples spiked with six hematocrit levels at glucose values (7 levels) distributed within the measuring range $2 5 - 4 9 2 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ of the device. The values generated were compared with the glucose values from YSI-2300 analyzer. The regression analysis for each hematocrit level is summarized in the table below. The results generated by the device are comparable to the values of YSI-2300 instrument at hematocrit levels between $20 \%$ . The sponsor will claim a hematocrit range of 30 to $5 5 \%$ .

An altitude study was performed with whole blood samples from 20 volunteers (glucose range: $6 8 { - } 1 5 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and 3 control solutions at low $( 4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ , medium ( $1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ and high $( 3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ concentrations tested 20 times each. All the controls met the acceptability criterion of $C V { < } 5 \%$ for the control solutions measured at sea level and at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The data submitted support use of the device up to 10,000 feet.

Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be used at temperature form $5 0 \mathrm { { ^ \circ F } }$ to $1 0 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and at relative humidity ranging from $2 5 \%$ to $8 5 \%$ .

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Samples from 300 volunteers with glucose concentrations distributed over the range of 20 - $5 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were evaluated at three different hospitals. Each blood sample from the volunteers was divided in two, one was tested by YSI-2300 and the other was tested by AG-605 blood glucose meter. Percent distribution of the samples corresponding to the glucose concentration ranged as follows: $2 0 { \cdot } 5 0 \ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $- 5 . 7 \%$ ; $5 1 - 1 1 0 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L } - 3 2 . 7 \%$ ; 111- $1 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L } - 1 9 . 3 \%$ ; $1 5 1 { - } 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } - 1 9 . 6 \%$ ; $2 5 1 - 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L } - 1 8 . 3 \%$ ; and 401-600 $\mathrm { m g / d L } - 4 . 3 \% .$ . To obtain the blood glucose concentrations less than 40 and more than 400 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , a pooled capillary whole blood specimen was spiked with the desired glucose levels. Based on data analysis, the device met the minimum system accuracy requirement established according to the ISO 15197 guidelines, which is $9 5 \%$ of the individual differences are within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when glucose concentrations are less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , and are within $\pm 2 0 \%$ when glucose concentrations are ${ > } 7 5 \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { d L }$ . In comparison with YSI2300, all three sites showed regression correlation $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { r } } ^ { 2 } )$ values ranging between 0.981-0.992. Results for all three sites combined and for each AG-605 meter using strip AGS-600 are given below.

A usability test was performed by 50 volunteers and healthcare professionals respectively with glucose levels ranging from 58 to $3 6 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when measured by the healthcare professional. Each volunteer was offered one AG-605 blood glucose meter; three test strips (three different lots), one vial of control solution, one user manual, one lancing device and three lancets. After reviewing the materials, the user performed their own finger sticks and tested themselves using the blood glucose monitoring system. Immediately after the user's self-test, a second blood sample was collected and the healthcare professional tested it with the same blood glucose monitoring system. Comparing the two test results, it was determined that users can test by themselves correctly according to the instruction for use. Test results are summarized below.
