# L. Test Principle:

The VIDAS $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ NT-proBNP Assay is one-step, sandwich enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) performed with an automated VIDAS or a miniVIDAS instrument. A pipette tip-like disposable device, the Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR), serves as the solid phase as well as a pipettor for the assay. Reagents for the assay are pre-dispensed in the sealed PBNP Reagent Strips.

All assay steps and assay temperatures are controlled by the instrument. The sample is transferred into the wells containing the conjugate (alkaline phosphatase-labeled sheep polyclonal NT-proBNP antibody). The sample and conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the SPR several times. Unbound sample is removed from the SPR during the wash step. During the detection step, the fluorescent substrate (4-Methylumberlliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme remaining in the SPR catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent product 4-methylumbellferone. Fluorescence is measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ wavelength by the optical scanner in the instrument. The intensity of the fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

# a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision study was performed over 10 days using five samples covering the measurement range (116.58, 508.55, 1407.06, 7,126.53, 14,528.62) assayed in duplicate in 40 different runs (2 runs per day) with two reagent lots using the same VIDAS instrument at three different sites—2 European and 1 US. Each site performed modified randomized precision studies following CLSI EP5-A2 Guidelines. 80 values per sample were generated per site $( \mathrm { n } { = } 2 4 0$ values for each sample). The results presented below were evaluated for the following: repeatability, between-run within-day precision, betweenday within-site precision, between-site within-lot precision, and lot-to-lot precision.

# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

The reportable range is $2 0 { - } 2 5 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . 2 samples were tested for linearity. One sample was a high pool $( 2 8 , 4 5 9 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ ) and the other was a lower pool ( $1 5 8 3 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ . Each pool was diluted 13 times using the reagent kit diluent, and a pool of human samples mixed with other samples in variable proportions to cover the measurement range down to $3 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Samples were assayed in duplicate. $3 0 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ was the lowest concentration obtainable because the diluent is composed of human serum pool with preservatives so there is always some NT-proBNP present. The percent deviation from linearity was $10 \%$ .

Recovery studies were performed on samples with NT-proBNP concentrations of $7 0 { - } 2 4 { , } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . Recoveries ranged from $8 6 . 9 . 0 \%$ to $1 1 2 . 9 \%$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability

The assay is metrologically traceable to Roche purified synthetic NT-proBNP

using a modification of ISO 17511.

![](images/34c147da4ef9cdcd0d9d08c894c875014df5000519f37a3f8b06c8d50c5d5498.jpg)

# Stability

The calibrators and controls are lyophilized and are stable for 12 months when stored at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . After reconstitution, they are stable for up to 8 hours at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or up to the expiration date of the kit when stored at $- 2 5 { \pm } 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Calibrators and controls may be frozen and thawed up to 6 times.

The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

# d. Detection limit:

Four samples were analyzed over a period of 4 days on one instrument using one lot of reagents. They consisted of 2 standards, a blank containing no NTproBNP, and a high standard with a concentration of $5 1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ of NTproBNP. Two low level samples with values of $1 3 . 6 4 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ and 14.16 $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ were also analyzed.

Limit of Blank (LoB) was defined as corresponding to the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of blank signal values. 6 replicates were assayed 10 times for $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ . Based on the sponsor’s analysis and acceptance criteria, the $\mathrm { L o B } = 3 . 4 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

Limit of Detection (LoD) was defined as the concentration corresponding to the signals from the two low level samples along a curve drawn between the blank and the high standard, rounded to the upper value. 2 replicates of each sample were assayed 15 times for a total of 30 measurements per sample $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 6 0 }$ ). The LoD signal for the two samples was calculated using the formula $\mathrm { L o D = L o B }$ signal $+ \sigma _ { \beta }$ SDs where the SDs are the estimated pooled standard deviation of the low level sample signals and $\mathrm { c _ { \beta } }$ is derived from the $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution and corrected for degrees of freedom of the estimated standard deviations. Based on the sponsor’s analysis and acceptance criteria, the $\mathrm { L o D } = 6 . 7 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ . The sponsor claims a limit of detection of $< 2 0 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the lowest concentration that can be measured with an inter-assay CVof $20 \%$ . Twelve samples ranging from 10 to $3 9 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ were tested in duplicate on one instrument for 9 days over a period of 15 days. The value obtained for LoQ was $2 1 . 9 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was evaluated by spiking each crossreactant into serums containing target concentrations of 0, 255, $1 4 8 3 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ NT-proBNP. A control for each cross-reactant was prepared by spiking the samples with the same volume of the solvent used for reconstituting the crossreactant. The cross-reactant test samples and the control samples were measured on the VIDAS and the cross-reactivity was calculated. Acceptance criteria was the percent of cross-reactivity must be $< 0 . 1 \%$ for all samples, interference ratios are within $9 9 . 8 \%$ confidence interval (CI) for the within lot precision profile. The following compounds do not cross-react.

Interference from endogenous substances were evaluated for hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin, human serum albumin (HSA), human IgG, IgM, rheumatoid factors (RF), anti-alkaline phosphatase (anti-ALP) and dialysis patients.

Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, Triglycerides

Samples containing approximately 24, 325, 3600 and $1 4 { , } 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ NT proBNP were spiked with the appropriate concentration of the test substance. NT-proBNP recovery of the sample was compared to that of a control sample. Hemoglobin up to $3 0 0 \mathrm { m i c M }$ ${ 4 8 5 } \ \mathrm { g / d L } )$ , bilirubin up to 510 micM (29 mg/dL), and triglycerides up to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ did not interfere with the test. As a further precaution, the device labeling recommends that samples appearing hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic not be used and that, if possible, a new sample be collected.

HSA, IgG, IgM, rheumatoid factors, anti-ALP and dialysis samples Recovery studies were performed to determine interference from HSA, IgG, IgM, RF, anti-ALP and dialysis. A NT-proBNP positive sample (1278.6- $1 5 8 5 . 8 ~ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ ) and a NT-proBNP negative sample $( < 2 0 { - } 3 9 . 8 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ ) were used for the studies. There was no IgG, or IgM interference at $1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ and $0 . 6 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ respectively.

HSA was evaluated at three doses, $1 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ , $1 4 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ and $1 9 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { d L }$ in the negative and positive NT-proBNP samples. The negative NT-proBNP sample showed interference at the $1 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g / d L }$ dose of HSA. There was no interference in the positive NT-proBNP sample.

Recovery studies were performed for rheumatoid factor-positive samples, dialysis samples and anti-alkaline phosphatase samples using positive and negative NT-proBNP samples. Dialysis and the anti-alkaline phosphatase (ant-ALP) samples were evaluated by spiking them with known concentrations of the positive and negative NT-proBNP samples from above. These were compared to a “reference sample” composed of a mixture of the positive and negative NT-proBNP samples.

Drug Interference

The effect of 39 frequently administered drugs was tested in vitro. No interference was observed.

# f. Assay cut-off:

Assay cutoffs were established based on the Roche Elecsys proBNP assay which the VIDAS assay claims traceable to.

$1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for $< 7 5$ years old

$4 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for $> 7 5$ years old

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

713 clinical samples from 3 sites were analyzed on the VIDAS and the predicate device, Roche Elecsys across the measurement range of 20-25,000 $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { p g / m L } }$ . For method comparison against the predicate, 104 samples were included although they had values $< 2 0 \ \mathrm { p g / m L }$ or were beyond the measurement range and had to be diluted. 224 samples were from a biochemical laboratory in Europe (Site 1), 203 samples from a European hospital (Site 2) and 182 samples from a medical center in the USA (Site 3). Slope $= 0 . 9 0 5$ and intercept $= - 1 4 . 5 9 9$ for the combined sites met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (slope 0.896-0.915, intercept $- 1 9 . 0 3 1 - \ - 1 2 . 1 2 0 )$ . $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 8 9$ .

Total concordance between the VIDAS and the predicate using the 713 clinical samples at the cutoffs of $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for subjects $< 7 5$ years old and $4 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for subjects $> 7 5$ years old are shown in the table below.

Concordance met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of $9 5 \%$ confidence interval.

Negative Percent Agreement $= 9 7 . 1 2 \%$ $( 9 5 . 2 9 \% 9 8 . 3 8 \% )$

Positive Percent Agreement $= 9 9 . 4 8 \%$ (97.15%-99.99)

Overall Agreement $= 9 7 . 7 6 \%$ $( 9 6 . 3 8 \% - 9 8 . 7 1 \% )$

# $b$ . Matrix comparison:

In order to demonstrate equivalence between serum and plasma, three different tube types, gel separator, EDTA, and lithium heparin, were compared to a plain tube (no anticoagulants or gel). Two manufacturers’ products were used. 63 patient samples were collected. Samples were native and spiked to cover the entire measurement range $( < 2 0 { - } 2 4 , 4 9 9 . 2 \mathrm { p g / m L } )$ .

Results were compared to those of the plain tube. Passing and Bablock regression data of lithium heparin plasma and gel separator tubes to the plain tubes had slopes of 0.98 and1.00, intercepts of -2.2 and 7.2 respectively. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were: slope 0.9-1.1, intercept $< 2 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ , $\mathrm { C V } >$ 0.95. Based on these studies it was determined that the gel separator (serum) or lithium heparin were appropriate preservatives. EDTA showed nonconformity and is not recommended for use in the labeling.

# 3. Clinical studies:

Clinical studies were performed at 3 sites, 2 European and 1 US, which represented 407 samples with confirmed congestive heart failure (CHF). 147 samples were from European Site 1, 139 samples were from European Site 2, and 119 were from the US Site. The reference group consisted of 411 samples from prospective subjects that presented to the Emergency Department or Clinical Investigation Center at a European site with neither a history of CHF nor cardiac nor circulatory diseases. Sensitivities, specificities and positive and negative predictive values are shown with the $9 5 \%$ CI and are broken down by site, age and gender.

b. Clinical specificity:

See Clinical Sensitivity above.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off:

Assay cutoffs were established based on the Roche Elecsys proBNP assay which the VIDAS assay is traceable to. Recommended clinical thresholds are $1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients younger than 75 years and $4 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for patients 75 years and older. Since the incidence of CHF increases with age, age matched Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) were calculated for each stratification: ${ < } 4 5$ , 45-54, 55-64, 65-75 and $\ge 7 5$ years old. The optimum cut-off maximizes the area under the curve (AUC) and represents the highest sensitivity and specificity for the assay. The overall area under the curve (AUC) for the VIDAS NT-proBNP assay was 0.965.

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Assay cutoffs were established based on the Roche Elecsys proBNP assay which the VIDAS assay is traceable to.

$1 2 5 \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for $< 7 5$ years old

$4 5 0 \ : \mathrm { p g / m L }$ for $> 7 5$ years old

Results were stratified by age groups and genders. Patients with results $< 2 0$ $\mathsf { p g / m L }$ were not included in the mean and standard deviation calculations.
