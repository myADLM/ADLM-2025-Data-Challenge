# I. Device Description:

The Prodigy Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of blood glucose meter, blood glucose test strips, control solutions, the lancing device, and lancets. The meter also comes with a speaker function to help visually impaired individuals perform a test. The meter was previously cleared under k060467 with the measurement function the same, but has a different appearance. The Prodigy Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System allows more alternate sites (forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh) for blood glucose testing than cleared under k063212 (palm) and its use is by visually impaired individuals.

# L. Test Principle:

The test is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip. The meter measures the current and displays the

corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The applicant states that the guidelines, ISO 15197 and CLSI - EP9-A were followed in this study to assess visual impaired use.

One hundred and thirteen subjects who are visually impaired patients as defined in ICD-9 of Word Health Organization were involved in this study. They were given Prodigy Voice meters that contain speaking function which guide glucose testing step-by-step in English. The lay-users ranged in age, education and were equally divided between males and females. $74 \%$ of the participants were defined as having low vision while $2 6 \%$ were defined as having blindness.

Test results were compared to those obtained from trained health professionals performing glucose test on above subjects. The following regression plot was used to assess the clinical significance of error in the blood glucose monitoring results.

$9 7 \%$ (110/113) of the individual difference were within $\pm 1 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ when glucose concentrations are less than $7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and were within $\pm 2 0 \%$ when glucose concentrations are $\cdot 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ , meeting ISO 15197 criteria.

b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not Applicable

$b$ . Clinical specificity: Not Applicable   
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

A study using ISO 15197 and CLSI - EP9-A as guidance was conducted to evaluate user error, comfort and ease of use of Prodigy Voice BGM System test strip for blood glucose monitoring using the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf and the thigh as an alternative sampling sites. Participants, who are able to read manual in English, were instructed to read the user manual and perform testing on the finger and AST sites. Testing using samples from alternative sites was immediately followed by finger-stick blood testing by the participants.

The following regression analysis was used to assess the clinical significance of error in the blood glucose monitoring results.

# N. Instrument Name:

Diagnostic Devices, Prodigy Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X____ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. Samples are stored in memory and identified by date and time.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

Rather than the user inputting a new calibration code for each lot of strips, the calibration is factory set by the manufacturer.

6. Quality Control:

The sponsor provides one level of the Prodigy Control Solution. The other two levels of control may be purchased separately. To perform a control test the user is instructed to press the M button after the blood drop has appeared on the display. This prevents control results from being stored in the internal memory. The acceptable range for each level is printed on the test strip vial label. If control results fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a list of troubleshooting steps and the customer care line

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Q. Proposed Labeling: The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.

# R. Conclusion:

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
