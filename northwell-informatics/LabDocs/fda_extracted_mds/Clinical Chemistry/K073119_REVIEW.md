# K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

# L. Test Principle:

To perform a test, the test strip is inserted into the monitor. A drop of blood is applied to the end of the strip and automatically drawn into the sample chamber. Glucose measurement is based on electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose in the sample with the reagents contained on the strip. The current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: Established in predicate submission (k063212)   
b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Established in predicate submission (k063212)   
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

The Clever Chek TD-4232 does not require the use of a code strip to code the meter for different strip lots. The sponsor has established acceptance criteria which include accuracy and imprecision to ensure that the test strip performance can support use of a single calibration code at the time of manufacturing. A risk analysis that addresses issues related to the single calibration code was provided by the sponsor. The user verifies that the correct code appears on the meter screen and is printed on the test strip vial label before measurement.

d. Detection limit: Established in predicate submission (k063212)   
e. Analytical specificity: Established in predicate submission (k063212)   
f. Assay cut-off: Not applicable

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor conducted a study to demonstrate equivalence between the proposed device and the predicate. A total of 118 capillary whole blood samples, ranging from 22 to $5 8 9 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested on the subject and predicate devices, as well as the YSI. Samples less than $4 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and greater than $4 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were prepared from a pooled capillary whole blood specimen and spiked to the desired levels. The linear regressions were as follows:

subject device (TD-4232) vs. YSI $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 7 8 \mathbf { x } + 3 . 5 7 9 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 3$ predicate device (TD-4223) vs. YSI $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 9 6 \mathbf { x } + 2 . 1 3 9 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 4$ b. Matrix comparison: Alternative sampling site performance from the palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh established in predicate submission (k063212).

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

To verify that the new button configuration did not affect performance in visuallyimpaired users, the sponsor conducted a user study to demonstrate device performance in the hands of visually impaired users. A total of 113 subjects performed fingersticks and tested themselves, using only the audible and written instructions provided by and with the device. Immediately following this testing, a second fingerstick was performed on the same subjects by trained healthcare professionals. The linear regression comparing lay user to professional results from this analysis is as follows:

$$
\mathbf { Y } = 0 . 9 8 8 1 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 6 2 3 1 , \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 8 4 , { \mathrm { s a m p l e ~ r a n g e } } = 4 1 - 4 6 1 \mathbf { \ m g } / \mathrm { d L }
$$

Two categories for visual impairment are defined in The World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases, $9 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Revision, as low vision, with visual acuity of $< 0 . 3$ and ${ \ge } 0 . 0 5$ , and blindness, with visual acuity $< 0 . 0 5$ including no light perception. The sample distribution for the user study was a total distribution of $7 6 \%$ (or 86 out of 113) with low vision and $24 \%$ (or 27 out of 113) with blindness.

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

Expected blood glucose levels for people without diabetes (referenced from ADA Clinical Practice Recommendations, 2003):

Fasting and before meals $< 1 1 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

2 hours after meals $< 1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# N. Instrument Name:

Clever Chek TD-4232 Blood Glucose Meter

# O. System Descriptions:

1. Modes of Operation:

Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional reading

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_ _ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage issues.

5. Calibration:

One calibration code is used for all lots of test strips. The user verifies that the correct code appears on the meter screen and is printed on the test strip vial label before measurement.

# 6. Quality Control:

Glucose control solutions at two concentrations are provided by the sponsor and should be run with this device. An acceptable range for each control is printed on the test strip vial. The user is instructed to contact the Customer Help line if control results fall outside these ranges.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

Not applicable.

# Q. Proposed Labeling:

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
