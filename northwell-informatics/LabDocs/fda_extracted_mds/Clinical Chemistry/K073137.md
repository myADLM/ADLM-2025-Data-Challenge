Apex BioTechnology Corp. GlucoSure Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System

<table><tr><td>Functional and Safety Testing:</td><td>Clinical testing was done with persons with diabetes to verify proper performance for fingerstick and Alternate Site Testing (AST) using palm and forearm blood sampling. Professional fingertip meter results were compared with AST results collected both by professionals and by persons with diabetes. Data were analyzed by linear regression analysis, Clarke Error Grid analysis and bias analysis. Results met pass/fail performance criteria. The clinical evaluation included testing of the voice functionality with visually impaired persons with diabetes. Non-clinical testing of precision, linearity, and temperature and humidity effects was also conducted.</td></tr><tr><td>Conclusion:</td><td>The modification to the original device (adding voice functionality) and to the Intended Use (adding AST sampling) does not adversely affect performance and the modified device is substantially equivalent to the unmodified predicate device.</td></tr></table>

Re: k073137 Trade Name: GlucoSure Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System Regulation Number: 21 CFR 862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose Monitoring System Regulatory Class: Class II Product Codes: NBW, CGA, JJX Dated: February 04, 2008 Received: February 15, 2008

Dear Mr. Shen:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally imarketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at

# Indications for Use Statement

510(k) Number: k073137

Device Name: Contrex Plus Glucose Control Solution (Part of the GlucoSure Voice Blood Glucose Monitoring System)

Indications For Use:

The purpose of the control solution test is to validate the performance of the Blood Glucose Monitoring system using a testing solution with a known range of glucose. A control test that falls within the acceptable range indicates the user's technique is appropriate and the test strip and meter are functioning properly.
