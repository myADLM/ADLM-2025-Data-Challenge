The VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ Slides (modified) and VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2 are substantially equivalent to the VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ Slides (current slide) and VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2. The FDA cleared the VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ Slides on May 7, 1996 (K961 1 15) under the product name EKTACHEM Clinical Chemistry Slide Potassium $( \mathbb { K } ^ { + } )$ . With the purchase of KODAK Clinical Products Division by Johnson and Johnson, the product branding was later revised to VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ Slides. The most recent FDA clearance for the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2 was July 20, 2007 (K071801).

# 5. Device Description

The VITROS $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ assay is performed using the VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ Slide and the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2 on the VITROS Chemistry Systems. The VITROS ${ \bf K } ^ { + }$ Slide is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support that uses direct potentiometry for measurement of ionic potassium. All reactions necessary for a single quantitative measurement of potassium take place within the multi-layered analytical element of a VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ slide. The slide consists of two ion-selective electrodes, each containing valinomycin (an ionophore for potassium), a reference layer, and a silver layer and a silver chloride layer coated on a polyester support.

VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ Slides use ion-selective electrodes for potentiometric measurements of ionic potassium. Ionic potassium determinations are made by simultaneously depositing $1 0 ~ \mathrm { u L }$ each of a reference fluid and a sample fluid on separate halves of the VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathbf { K } ^ { + }$ slide. The electrode receiving the reference fluid is identified as the reference electrode. A paper bridge connects the reference electrode and the indicator electrode, which receives the sample fluid. A stable liquid junction between the two fluids is formed in the paper bridge in approximately 20 seconds. The potassium ions in the tested reference and sample fluids migrate to the silver/ silver chloride layers and establish equilibrium.

After a two minute incubation period, the electrometer in the VITROS Chemistry System measures the potential difference between the reference and indicator electrodes. Each electrode responds to the activity of potassium ions in the respective fluids to produce a potential for the concentration cell. The VITROS Chemistry System's microcomputer uses this measurement and the stored calibration parameters to determine the concentration value of the potassium ion in the sample fluid. The test result is reported in millimoles per liter (mmol/L).

VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 2 contains four levels of lyophilized standards with corresponding diluents. The standards are prepared from processed bovine serum to which bovine cholesterol, chicken egg yolk, inorganic salts, electrolytes, buffers, stabilizers, and preservatives have been added. The companion diluents are prepared from processed water to which inorganic salts have been added. In addition, Calibrator 4 Diluent contains $0 . 5 { } \mathbf { M }$ diethylaminoethanol and $0 . 0 1 { \bf M }$ (ethylenedinitrilo) tetraacetic acid.

The VITROS System and reagents are designed specifically for use with the VITROS Chemistry Products range of products.

# . Conclusions

The information presented in the premarket notification demonstrates that the performance of the VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ Slides (modified) for use with human serum, plasma, and urine is substantially equivalent to the cleared predicate device.

Equivalence was demonstrated using manufactured slides along with patient and quality control samples with measured potassium values spanning the assay range.

The information presented in the premarket notification provides a reasonable assurance that the VITROS Chemistry Products $\mathbb { K } ^ { + }$ Slides (modified) for use with human serum, plasma, and urine is safe and effective for the stated intended use.
