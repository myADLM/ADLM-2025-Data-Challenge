# $b$ . Linearity/assay reportable range:

Linearity was tested on serum samples. The samples were diluted in 11 steps by mixing samples with each other 1:1. For example, the $50 \%$ sample resulted from a 1:1 mixture of the $100 \%$ and $0 \%$ samples. Four parallel measurements were made in random order for each step using one reagent lot. Eleven samples tested ranging in concentration from $9 . 4 \mathrm { U } / 1$ to $1 2 1 5 \mathrm { U / L }$ .

For the extended range linearity study another set of samples were prepared and measured as above with the exception that the samples S5 – S11 were run using an additional secondary dilution. Eleven samples were tested ranging in concentration from $4 8 . 8 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { l }$ to $1 1 3 2 9 . 7 \mathrm { U } / \mathrm { L }$ .

# Samples:

Low level: serum pool diluted with $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl while for high level: serum pool was spiked with commercially available alkaline phosphatase of placental origin.

Results Obtained:

For Linearity $( \mathrm { n } { = } 1 1 )$ ): Slope $= 0 . 9 8 8$ , Intercept $= 0 . 3 7 0 2$ Obs. $E \mathrm { r r } = 2 . 7 \%$   
For Ext. Linearity $\scriptstyle ( \ n = 1 1$ ) Slope $= 0 . 9 7 5$ , Intercept $= - 1 . 2 6$ , Obs. $E \mathrm { r r } = 5 . 1 \%$

The data supported the claimed measuring range of $2 0 - 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / L }$ , and extended measuring range $2 0 - 1 0 0 0 0 \mathrm { U } / 1$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The Alkaline Phosphatase (IFCC) Plus method is traceable to the molar absorbance coefficient of p-nitrophenol.

The sponsor’s protocols indicate that calibrator (eCal) is traceable to the reference procedure given in the value sheet, which is the IFCC reference procedure for 3-reagent method and molar absorbance coefficient of NADH for 1-reagent method. The controls (Nortrol and Abtrol) are traceable to the IFCC procedure. The values are lot-specific and are assigned based on multiple determinations performed using several T60 instruments. The assigned value is the median of all the values generated for each calibrator and control. Additionally, control range is calculated as the target value $\pm 2$ standard deviations. Please refer to the value assignment sheet in the labeling for lot specific values.

To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor recommends calibrating the test at least every three days and every time a new reagent bottle is used. The sponsor also recommends using quality control samples at least once a day, after each calibration and when a new bottle is used. The sponsor further recommends that all local, state and federal guidelines be followed.

The sponsor claims that all open on-board stability for reagents is 14 days.

Reagent in unopened vial is stable at $2 { - } 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until expiration date on vial label when protected from light.

# d. Detection limit:

In the Limit of Blank (LOB) study thirty replicates of a blank sample $( 0 . 9 \%$ NaCl) were run using two T60 instruments and two reagent lots with the total number of measurements being 60. The results support a claimed LOB of 1 U/L.

In the Limit of Detection (LOD) study five low level samples were run in ten replicates with two T60 instruments and two reagent lots during two days with the total number of measurements being 100. The results support a claimed LOD of $5 \mathrm { { U / L } }$ .

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference Studies: For each interfering substance (except for Lipemia, Intralipid $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ ) three parallel measurements of five interfering concentrations (including non-interfered sample) were run in ascending – descending – ascending order. To test the interference by lipemia (Intralipid $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ ), both control and test pools were analyzed, with four replicates from each pool, within one analytical run. There was deemed to be no interference if the observed values were $\pm 1 0 \%$ $_ { 0 \Gamma \pm 7 . 5 \mathrm { U / L } }$ of initial value.

Lipemia: No interference found up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $( 1 0 \ \mathrm { g / l } )$ of Intralipid.

Hemolysate: No interference found up to $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $( 3 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { l } )$ of hemoglobin Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to $5 8 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / 1 )$ of conjugated bilirubin

Bilirubin unconjugated: No interference found up to $2 1 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $( 3 6 0 \mathrm { \ : \mu m o l / l } )$ of unconjugated bilirubin.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

The samples were split in two and then run either on the predicate or Thermo device. Each individual measurement from the device was compared to one individual measurement result of the predicate.
