Summary Date: November 14, 2007

Trade Name: OneTouch® UltraLink" Blood Glucosc Monitoring System Common Name: Blood Glucose Monitor

Device Classification: Class II, Glucose Test System (21 CFR $\ S 8 6 2 . 1 3 4 5$ , Product Code NBW)

# Substantial Equivalence

The OneTouch® UltraLink™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the OneTouch® Ultra®2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System as cleared under K053529. Both devices have a similar intended use, measure the same sample type and have similar performance characteristics. The OneTouch® UltraLink™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is substantially equivalent to the BD Paradigm Link\* Blood Glucose Monitor as cleared under K040603 for the ability to transmit blood glucose results using Radio-Frequency telemetry.

# Device Description

The OneTouch® UltraLink" Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a modification to the OneTouch® Ultra® 2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, retaining the features, functions, and user interface of the OneTouch® Ultra 2 meter while introducing a feature allowing RadioFrequency transmission of blood glucose results to compatible Medtronic MiniMed, Inc. devices. The OneTouch® UltraLink™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is composed of the OneTouch®

UltraLink™ Blood Glucose meter, OneTouch® Ultra® Test Strips, OneTouch® Ultra® Control Solution, OneTouch Lancing device, OneTouch® UltraSof® Lancets, and meter carrying case. System modifications were made only to the blood glucose meter, carrying case, and instructions for use.

# Intended Use

The OneTouch® UltraLink™" Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used for selftesting outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the finger, forearm or palm. The OneTouch® UltraLink™" System is intended for use by people with diabetes in a home setting and by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.

Re: k073231 Trade/Device Name: One Touch Ultralink Blood Glucose Monitoring System Regulation Number: 21 CFR§862.1345 Regulation Name: Glucose Test System Regulatory Class: Class II Product Code: NBW, CGA Dated: April 01, 2008 Received: April 02, 2008

Dear Ms. Fonda:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market thc device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with al the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

Page 2 -

This letter willallow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally imarketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490.
