# L. Test Principle:

To perform a test, the test strip is inserted into the monitor. A drop of blood is applied to the end of the strip and automatically drawn into the sample chamber. Glucose measurement is based on electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose in the sample with the reagents contained on the strip. The current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

Repeatability was assessed by assaying venous blood samples adjusted to 5 glucose concentrations (40, 100, 130, 200 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). A total of 500 repetitions were run on each of 2 test strip lots on 10 meters (10 repetitions per meter, per interval). The mean, SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ were calculated for each lot at each glucose level. All SD and $\% \mathrm { C V }$ results were within the sponsor’s acceptance limit of $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 \%$ respectively.

Intermediate precision was assessed by assaying 200 repetitions of each of 3 levels of control material (40, 120, and $3 5 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) on 2 test strip lots and 10 meters, over a period of 11 days by 8 operators. All SD and $\% C V$ results were within the sponsor’s acceptance limit of $5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and $5 \%$ respectively.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

Unpooled venous blood collected from nine donors was adjusted to 7 glucose levels (20, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ). Each concentration was measured with 16 replicates on each of 2 test strip lots and run on 8 meters over a period of 3 days. The results were as follows:

Lot 1 $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 0 2 0 0 9 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 4 5 1 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9$

Lot 2 $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 0 2 0 1 4 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 4 0 5 , \mathrm { r } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 0 0 0$ c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Established in predicate submission (k053529)

2. Comparison studies:

# a. Method comparison with predicate device:

The sponsor conducted a study to demonstrate equivalence between the proposed device and the predicate (Ultra 2 System meter). A total of 400 venous whole blood samples were adjusted to 5 glucose levels (20, 70, 240, 450, and $6 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ) and tested on 16 subject and 16 predicate devices. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria was that the mean bias difference of the UltraLink from the Ultra 2 would be within 3 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ or $4 \%$ , whichever was greater, with $9 5 \%$ confidence. The results were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Glucose level 20</td><td>bias from Ultra 2 0.09 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>-0.62 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td>240</td><td>-0.38 %</td></tr><tr><td>450</td><td>-0.27 %</td></tr><tr><td>600</td><td>-0.28 %</td></tr></table>

The sponsor also conducted a system accuracy study, comparing the UltraLink System to the YSI 2300 Analyzer. In this study, two samples from each of 103 subjects, ranging from 47- $4 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ were tested with 3 test strip lots on 12 meters over 12 days. The results, presented in the format recommended by ISO 15197, were as follows:

For glucose concentrations $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ :

$$
\begin{array} { c c } { { \mathrm { w i t h i n \pm 5 \ : m g / d L ~ \quad } } } & { { \mathrm { w i t h i n \pm 1 0 \ : m g / d L ~ \quad } } } & { { \mathrm { w i t h i n \pm 1 5 \ : m g / d L ~ } } } \\ { { \mathrm { 6 1 ^ { \circ }  { \partial _ { 0 } } ^ { + } } } } & { { \mathrm { 9 4 . 4 ^ { \circ }  { \partial _ { 0 } } ^ { + } } } } \end{array}
$$

For glucose concentrations $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ :

$$
\begin{array} { l c c } { { \mathrm { w i t h i n \pm } } } & { { \le ^ { 0 } \% } } & { { \qquad \mathrm { w i t h i n \pm } 1 0 \% } } & { { \quad \mathrm { w i t h i n \pm } 1 5 \% } } & { { \qquad \mathrm { w i t h i n \pm } 2 0 \% } } \\ { { 3 4 . 7 } } & { { \qquad 6 8 . 3 } } & { { \qquad 9 1 . 3 } } & { { \qquad 9 8 . 8 } } \end{array}
$$

b. Matrix comparison:

The alternative sampling site performance from the palm and forearm was established in predicate submission (k053529).

3. Clinical studies:

a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable

b. Clinical specificity: Not applicable

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

A lay user performance study was conducted with 93 subjects at two study sites. The subjects were briefed on the study procedures and requirements but received no training or instruction on the use of the UltaLink System other than copies of the device labeling. The subjects obtained their own fingerstick samples and ran the test, and then the healthcare professionals obtained a second fingerstick sample. The range of samples tested was $6 0 { - } 3 9 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The results were as follows:

Lay user vs YSI $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 6 \mathbf { x } - 6 . 0 4 . } \end{array}$ , $\mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 7 4$ HCP vs YSI $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 8 5 \mathbf { x } - 4 . 4 4 , \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 7 8$

The results, presented in the format recommended by ISO 15197, were as follows:

For glucose concentrations $< 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ :

<table><tr><td>within ± 5 mg/dL</td><td></td><td>within ± 10 mg/dL</td><td>within ± 15 mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td>lay</td><td>50.0%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>HCP</td><td>33.3%</td><td>66.7%</td><td>100%</td></tr></table>

For glucose concentrations $\geq 7 5 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ :

<table><tr><td></td><td>within ± 5%</td><td>within ± 10%</td><td>within ± 15%</td><td>within ± 20%</td></tr><tr><td>lay</td><td>34.3</td><td>63.5</td><td>86.2</td><td>95.6</td></tr><tr><td>HCP</td><td>34.6</td><td>72.0</td><td>90.7</td><td>98.4</td></tr></table>

4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:

The labeling presents expected blood glucose levels for people without diabetes as follows: (referenced from Joslin Diabetes Manual)

before breakfast 70-105 mg/dL before lunch or dinner 70-110 mg/dL

1 hour after meals $< 1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ 2 hours after meals $< 1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ between 2 and 4 am $> 7 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# N. Instrument Name:

OneTouch UltraLink Blood Glucose Meter

2. Software:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this line of product types:

Yes ___X_ _ or No

3. Specimen Identification:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.

6. Quality Control:

A Glucose control solution at a normal concentration is provided by the sponsor and should be used with this device. An acceptable range for the control is printed on the test strip vial. The user is instructed to contact the Customer Help line if control results fall outside these ranges. An additional level of control (high) is available by calling the Customer Help line.
