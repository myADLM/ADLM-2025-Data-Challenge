# L. Test Principle:

Urea is hydrolysed in the presence of water and urease to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide. In the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), the ammonia combines with alpha - ketoglutarate $\left( \mathsf { \alpha } \mathsf { d } \cdot \mathrm { K G } \right)$ to produce L-glutamate. The resulting decrease in absorbance at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , as NADH is converted to NAD, is proportional to the level of urea in the sample.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility: The precision study was done using serum samples during 21/22 days, with two runs per day, two replicates per run, total 84/88 results per level. For levels 1 and 3 the study included 2 reagent lots, 4 operators, 3 T60 instruments at one site, and 9 calibrations. For level 2 the study included 3 reagent lots, 1 operator, 3 T60 instruments at one site, and 9 calibrations. For the level 4 $( { \sim } 5 . 7 \mathrm { m g / d L } )$ the precision study was done during 5 days, with two runs per day, two replicates per run, 1 reagent lot,1 instrument and 2 calibrations with the total number of measurements being 20. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The linearity study was performed per CLSI EP6-A. The serum samples were diluted in 10 steps (from $100 \%$ to $0 \%$ ) by mixing samples with each other 1:1. For example, the $50 \%$ sample resulted from a 1:1 mixture of the $100 \%$ and $0 \%$ samples. Four parallel measurements were made in random order using one reagent lot (fresh and 30 days open on boarded). To generate samples at low level, commercially available human sera pool was used, while the same was spiked with Urea to generate high level samples. In addition, 8 samples were run using an additional secondary dilution of 1:10 to determine the extended linearity range. Results were as follows:

Based on the linearity study data, the sponsor claims a measuring range of $4 . 2 { - } 5 6 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ and an extended measuring range of $4 . 2 \mathrm { - } 1 6 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ after secondary dilution.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

# Traceability for sCal:

sCal has been cleared earlier for glucose and Carbon Dioxide in the submissions k061107 and k071340 respectively.

sCal is traceable to the NIST SRM 909b reference material. sCal target values are determined using assay specific methods on the DPC T60 and other Thermo analyzer models. The target value is the median of all values obtained by these determinations. The exact calibration values are listed in the separate sCal calibrator sheet. The sponsor recommends that calibration be performed at least once a month or every time a new bottle of reagent is used or whenever control results require recalibration.

Traceability for Nortrol and Abtrol:

Controls Nortrol and Abtrol have been cleared earlier for glucose, AST and Carbon Dioxide in the submissions k061107, k071580 and k071340 respectively.

The target values of the Nortrol and Abtrol are control solutions are determined using assay specific methods on the T60 and other Thermo analyzer models (calibrated by the sCal calibrator). The target value is the median of all values obtained by these determinations.

The sponsor recommends that the quality control samples be used at least once a day and after each calibration and every time a new bottle of reagent is used. Further, the control intervals and limits must be adapted to the individual laboratory requirements. The results of the quality control sample(s) should fall within the limits pre-set by the laboratory. The sponsor further recommends that all local, state and federal guidelines be followed.

# Stability:

The protocol and acceptance criteria for stability studies were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims an open on-board stability of reagents for 30 days. After reconstitution sCal, Abtrol, and Nortrol are stable for 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

# d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A using serum samples. In the Limit of Blank study thirty replicates of a blank sample $( 0 . 9 \% \mathrm { N a C l } )$ were run using two T60 instruments and one reagent lot with the total number of measurements being 60. The results support a claimed LOB of $0 . 3 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ In the Limit of Detection study five low level samples were run in ten replicates with two T60 instruments and one reagent lot during two days with the total number of measurements being 100. The results support a claimed LOD of $1 . 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

# e. Analytical specificity:

Interference Studies: For each interfering substance three parallel measurements of one interfering concentration (including non-interfered sample) were run. There was deemed to be no interference if the observed values were $\pm 1 0 \%$ $_ { \mathrm { 0 r } \pm 7 . 5 \mathrm { U / L } }$ of initial value.

Lipemia: No interference found up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ of Intralipid.

Hemolysate: No interference found up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ $( 1 0 \ \mathrm { g / L } )$ of hemoglobin Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to $5 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ( $1 0 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l / L } )$ of conjugated bilirubin

Bilirubin unconjugated: No interference found up to $5 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d L }$ ( $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 \ : \mu m o l / L } )$ of unconjugated bilirubin.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

One hundred and sixteen Li-heparin plasma samples were analyzed using T60 instrument with Urea / BUN reagents and Bayer Advia 2400 instrument with Urea Nitrogen reagents to demonstrate the equivalence of the two systems. The samples were split in two and then run each one either on the predicate (as singlets) or Thermo device (as duplicates). Each individual measurement is compared to one individual measurement result of the predicate. From Thermo device only the first results from the duplicate measurements were used. Samples ranged from $4 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ to $5 5 . 9 4 \mathrm { m g / }$ dL. Data obtained was plotted and the results of the Deming regression analysis were as follows:

$$
\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 2 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 9 3 7 ; \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 9 5 .
$$

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

Twenty-four matched serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples were run on T60 instrument to demonstrate the use of serum samples. Both serum and plasma samples were run in duplicates but only the first replicate results were used for calculations. Samples ranged from 4.9 to $5 5 . 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Data obtained was plotted and the results of the Deming regression analysis were as follows:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathrm { y } = 1 . 0 3 \mathrm { x } - 0 . 1 6 ; \mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 9 9 . } \end{array}
$$
