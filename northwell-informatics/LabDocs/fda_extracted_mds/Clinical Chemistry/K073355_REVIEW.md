Based on the linearity study data, the sponsor will claim a measuring range of 2.8 – 16.0 $\mathrm { m g / d L }$ and an extended range of $2 . 8 - 4 8 . 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ after secondary dilution.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): The sponsor’s protocols indicate that each calibrator (sCal), and control (Nortrol and Abtrol) lot is traceable to NIST SRM 909b. The values are assigned based on multi determinations performed using T60 instruments. The assigned value is the median of all the values generated for each calibrator and control. Additionally, control range is calculated as the target value $\pm 2$ standard deviations. The expected values for each lot are provided on the value sheet provided with the product.

The sponsor supports a claim of an open on-board stability of reagents for 30 days. After reconstitution sCal, Abtrol, and Nortrol are stable for 7 days at $2 { - } 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .

d. Detection limit:

The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A. In the LoB study, thirty replicates of a blank sample $( 0 . 9 \%$ NaCl) were run using two T60 instruments and two reagent lots with the total number of measurements being 60. The LoB was determined to be $0 . 0 2 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

In the Limit of Detection study five low level samples were run in ten replicates with two T60 instruments and two reagent lots during two days with the total number of measurements being 100. The LoD was determined to be $0 . 0 8 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

# e. Analytical specificity:

The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP7-A. In a paired-difference testing using with three levels of analyte both control and test pools were analyzed, with four replicates from each pool, within one analytical run. The sponsor defined interference as a difference exceeding $\pm 1 0 \%$ of the test value compared to control value. According to the interference studies the following claims were established:

Lipemia: No interference found up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $( 1 0 \ \mathrm { g / l } )$ of Intralipid.   
Hemolysate: No interference found up to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $( 1 0 \mathrm { g } / 1 )$ of hemoglobin   
Bilirubin conjugated: No interference found up to $5 8 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ $\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 \ \mu m o l / l } )$ ) of conjugated bilirubin   
Bilirubin total: No interference found up to $5 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / d l } \left( 1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l / l } \right)$ of unconjugated bilirubin.

f. Assay cut-off: Not Applicable.

# 2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:

One hundred and twelve Li-heparin plasma samples (104 clinical, 2 diluted) were analyzed using $\mathrm { T } 6 0 \mathrm { i }$ instrument with Calcium reagents and Bayer Advia 2400 instrument with Calcium reagents to demonstrate the equivalence of the two systems. Samples ranged from range from 3.2 to $1 4 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . The samples were split in two and then run each one either on the predicate or Thermo device. Each individual measurement was compared to one individual measurement result of the predicate. Deming regression analysis resulted in the equation, $\mathbf { y } = 1 . 0 3 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 0 9 6$ , $\mathrm { r } = 0 . 9 8 7$ .

$b$ . Matrix comparison:

Ninety-seven matched serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples (94 clinical, 3 contrived) were run on T60 instrument to demonstrate the use of serum samples. Samples ranged from range from 6.3 to $1 5 . 0 \mathrm { m g / }$ dL. Both serum and plasma samples were run in duplicates and each individual measurement was compared to one individual measurement. Deming regression analysis resulted in the equation, $\mathbf { y } = 0 . 9 5 \mathbf { x } + 0 . 3 7 3$ , r $= 0 . 9 9 0$ .

3. Clinical studies: a. Clinical Sensitivity:

Not Applicable.

b. Clinical specificity: Not Applicable.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off: Not Applicable.

The expected values of Calcium referenced by the sponsor is $8 . 6 - 1 0 . 3 \mathrm { m g / d l }$ (2.15 - 2.57 mmol/l). The sponsor recommends that each laboratory determine its own reference range.
