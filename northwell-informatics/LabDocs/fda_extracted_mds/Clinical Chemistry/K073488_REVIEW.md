# L. Test Principle:

This method is based on the reaction of a sample containing human apo B and a specific antiserum to form an insoluble complex which can be measured turbidimetrically at $3 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The concentration of apo B can be determined by comparing sample results to a standard curve constructed from the absorbances of standards.

# M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

1. Analytical performance:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:

The precision of the Diazyme Apolipoprotein B assay was evaluated, according to CLSI EP5-A, in a study, using three levels of serum specimens containing low, medium and high levels of Apo B. They were tested with 2 runs per day in duplicates over 10 working days.

# b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

The claimed measuring range of this device is $2 5 - 1 6 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Eleven levels of samples were prepared in triplicate by diluting a serum control containing $1 5 7 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Apo B with saline according to CLSI EP6-A guidelines. Linear Regression analysis results obtained were as follows: Slope $= 0 . 9 8 8$ , Intercept $= 1 . 2 0 3$ with an $\mathrm { \ddot { R } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 9 9 2$ .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Calibrator and Control Stability: The ApoB calibrator stability testing was performed in real time at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { : }$ , and as accelerated stability studies at $2 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ and

$3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ using two lots of the calibrator. Real-time stability tests are ongoing.

Calibrator Traceability: The Calibrator is traceable to WHO/IFCC standards.

d. Detection limit:

Limit of Detection studies were performed following CLSI EP17-A. Five (5) serum samples containing low ApoB were diluted 100X with $7 . 5 \%$ BSA in saline and tested with the ApoB reagent on the Hitachi 917 with 12 replicates each (a total of 60 measurements). The results are summarized as follows: $\mathrm { L o D } = \mathrm { L o B } + ( 1 . 6 4 5 ^ { \ast } \mathrm { S D }$ Low Samples) $= 3 . 6 0 + ( 1 . 6 4 5 ^ { \ast } 0 . 5 5 5 6 ) = 3 . 6 0 +$ $0 . 9 1 { = } 4 . 5 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

The LOD of the Diazyme ApoB assay was determined to be $4 . 5 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$

e. Analytical specificity:

Interference testing was performed per CLSI guideline EP7-A. The following compounds were tested up to the concentrations detailed below with normal serum (containing $7 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ of ApoB). There was $\leq \pm 1 0 \%$ deviation in the observed concentration of ApoB.

Further, there was no cross-reactivity observed with Apo A-1 when tested up to a concentration of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ .

2. Comparison studies:

a. Method comparison with predicate device: The individual patient serum samples used for this study were from a certified commercial source and the assay was performed on a Hitachi 917 analyzer. To ensure the concentrations of Apo B were distributed across the reportable dynamic range claimed, additional Apo B samples were spiked with Apo B to achieve higher concentrations, or diluted with saline to reach lower concentrations. A total of 55 unaltered and 7 altered serum samples were used for the comparison experiment. The comparison results between the Diazyme Apolipoprotein B assay and the Kamiya Apo B reagent are summarized below:

For a total of 62 serum samples ranging from 29.6 to $2 4 1 . 1 \mathrm { m g / d L }$ Apo B, the correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.9864; the slope was 1.0143; and y intercept was -4.3806.

The study was also analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression and the results obtained were:

Y = -2.8942 + 1.0082 X   
Intercept: -2.8942   
$9 5 \%$ CI : -7.6091 to 0.3990   
Slope: 1.0082   
$9 5 \%$ CI : 0.9720 to 1.0512
