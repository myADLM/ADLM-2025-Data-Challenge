# 4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

The DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY BIOOd GluCOSe MonitOring System designed by Tyson Bioresearch Inc., an amperometric biosensor, is adopted for its ease of use, its ability to process accurate results utilizing only a small volume of blood, and its quick response time. DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY provide a convenient and safe monitoring system for diabetes health care professionals, hospitals and most importantly, people with diabetes.

The DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY BlOOd GluCOse MOnitoring System is intended for use in the quantitatively measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and the alternative sites: the palm and the forearm. The DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY Blood GluCOSe 072

Test Strips are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). When the edge of the test strip is touched to a drop of blood, the test strip draws the blood into the sample chamber and the glucose reading is displayed on the meter after 10 seconds. The test measures glucose from 20 mg/dL (1.1mmol/L) to 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L). The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow the comparison of results with laboratory methods.

# 5. INTENDED USE:

The DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX+ INFINITY BloOd GluCOse Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitatively measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and the alternative sites: the palm and the forearm. The DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY Blood GluCOse Test Strips are for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use). The DlACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) by persons with diabetes, or in clinical setting by healthcare professionals as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus. The alternative site testing in the systems can be used only during steady-state blood glucose conditions.

# 6. TEST PRINCIPLE

The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose oxidase. Glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid and electrons are produced from the reaction. The electrons are then trapped by a chemical mediator, potassium ferricyanide. Once the enzymatic reaction is complete, a potential is provided by the meter for a further electrochemical reaction in order to generate a current from the release of trapped electrons. This current is then measured and correlated to the glucose concentration in the whole-blood sample. The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow easy comparison of results with laboratory methods.

# 7. PREDICATE DEVICE:

Predicate device name(s): DIACHEX Blood Glucose Monitoring System

Predicate 510(k) number(s): k062829

Comparison with predicate:

This 510(K) amendment addresses the modification of the DIACHEX Blood Glucose 073

Monitoring System previously cleared under K062829 and addition of alternate site testing sites for the glucose testing portion.

The modifications encompass the sample volume, reaction time, operating principle, meter software, LCD display and addition of alternate site testing sites (the palm and the forearm) for the glucose testing portion. The DlACHEX\* Blood Glucose Monitoring System includes two models, DIACHEX\* DETERMINE and DIACHEX\* INFINiTY. The differences between these two models are the strip ejector function, coding method, LCD display, strip width and meter outside looking. The strip of the DIACHEX\* INFINITY system can be removed by pushing strip eject button and also can be removed by hand. The DIACHEX\* INFINITY system eliminate the need for manual coding of the test strips by the user by assigning codes when manufactured. Except these, all main meter internal electronic components, meter functions and detection algorithm of these two models are exactly the same. The deference between DIACHEX\* DETERMINE and DIACHEX\* INFINITY from DIACHEX system is outline below.

# Clinical Accuracy of the DlACHEX\* Blood Glucose Monitoring System

To ensure that these meters perform similarly, DIACHEX(predicate device), DIACHEX\* DETERMINE and DIACHEX\* INFINITY meters were compared against standard YSI-2300 by testing from the fingertip. The test was assessed in an in-house study performing by technician. 118 participants both males and ferales ranged from age. The samples ranged from 25.4 to 571mg/dL and hematocrit ranged from $34 \%$ to $51 \%$ .

Values obtained from meters were compared to YSI results; linear results regression analysis yielded the following results:

Clinical Accuracy of the DlACHEX\* system was performed with a total of 112 lay users and 12 contrived samples (That were 33 to 48mg/dL and 462 to 581mg/dL) at 2 clinical sites and one OTC site. Participants ranged from age, education and consisted of $41 \%$ EY males and $59 \%$ females with sample range 33\~581mg/dL and hematocrit range $3 3 \% \sim 5 4 \%$ . The performance of alternate site testing (AST) of systems were also been evaluated. The test results of capillary blood obtained from fingertip was compared to the results obtained from palm and forearm. Values obtained from meters were compared to YSl results; linear result regression analysis yielded the following results.

<table><tr><td>Finger</td><td>Lay User vs YSI</td><td>Technician vs YSI</td><td>Lay User vs Technician</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>112</td><td>124</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>Slope</td><td>0.98</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>-0.52</td><td>1.31</td><td>-0.62</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.9789</td><td>0.9872</td><td>0.9900</td></tr></table>

The regression of AST test results was shown as below:

<table><tr><td>Lay User</td><td>Finger vs YSI</td><td>Palm vs YSI</td><td>Palm vs Finger</td><td>Forearm vs YSI</td><td>Forearm vs Finger</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>112</td><td>111</td><td>111</td><td>111</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Slope</td><td>0.98</td><td>0.96</td><td>0.97</td><td>0.95</td><td>0.96</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>-0.52</td><td>1.77</td><td>3.12</td><td>2.34</td><td>3.54</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.9789</td><td>0.9796</td><td>0.9861</td><td>0.9745</td><td>0.9825</td></tr></table>

The acceptable criteria is the IS0 15197 requirement of $9 5 \%$ of individual glucose results falling within $\pm 1 5 m g / d L$ at glucose concentration for samples $< 7 5 m g / d L$ and within $\pm 2 0 \%$ at glucose concentrations 75mg/dL. The samples that met the IS0 15197 requirement were summarized in the table below.

From the above it is concluded that the results obtained from the alternate site sampling using DIACHEX\* DETERMINE system, are similar to those obtained from finger stick whole blood with no effect on clinical action.

From the above test results, we conclude that the modification of the DlACHEX Meter 079

do not affect the effectiveness and safety of the device. The proposed device (DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY Blood Glucose Monitoring System) is substantial equivalent to the original cleared device. The results of clinical alternate site testing demonstrate that the results obtained from the alternate site sampling are similar to those obtained from finger stick whole blood with no effect on clinical action. DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY system provides the users an option to use the palm and the forearm in addition to the fingertip to collect capillary blood for self monitoring of blood glucose within certain conditions as explained in product user's manual. DIACHEX\* DETERMINE / DIACHEX\* INFINITY are suitable for its intended use. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial equivalence decision.
