# 4. Device Description

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ EXL™M with LM clinical chemistry system is a floor model, fully automated, microprocessor-controlled, integrated instrument system which uses prepackaged Dade Behring Flex $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridges to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system can process samples in random access, batch or stat modes.

The Dimension $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ FT4L Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of prepackaged reagents in a plastic eight-well cartridge for use on the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ EXLTM with LM system.

The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Thyroid Calibrator is a liquid, bovine serum albumin based product containing thyroxine. There are four calibrator levels with target values of 0.8, 1.6, 4.0 and $8 . 4 ~ \mathrm { { n g / d L } }$ .

# 5. Device Intended Use

The FT4L method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of Free Thyroxine in human serum and plasma on the Dimension® EXLTM with LM system. Measurements of free thyroxine are used in the diagnosis and monitoring of thyroid disease.

The LOCI® Thyroid Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the FT4L method on the Dimension® EXLTM with LM system.

The Dimension $^ { \mathfrak { Q } }$ EXL™M with LM system is an in vitro diagnostic device that is intended to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system utilizes photometric, turbidimetric, chemiluminescence and integrated ion selective multisensor technology for chemical and immunochemical applications for clinical use.

6. Medical device to which equivalence is claimed and comparison information

The Dimension® EXL TM with LM system is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to the Dimension® RxL Max® system. Both instruments are fully automated, microprocessor-controlled integrated instruments with similar detection technologies and modes of operation.

The Dimension® FT4L Flex® reagent cartridge is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ Vista FT4 Flex $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ reagent cartridge. Both devices use LOCl technology and are intended for use in the quantitative measurement of Free Thyroxine in human serum and plasma. The devices have identical measuring ranges of $0 . 1 - 8 . 0 \ \mathrm { n g / d L }$ .

The $\mathrm { L O C I @ }$ Thyroid Calibrator is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to the Dimension $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ LOCI 1 Calibrator. Both calibrators use a matrix comprised of stripped bovine albumin spiked with USP-grade Thyroxine.

# Comparison Information

Method comparison studies were conducted on the Dimension $^ { © }$ FT4L Flex $\mathfrak { Q }$ vs. the Dimension® Vista FT4 Flex® reagent cartridge using one hundred-and-eighty (180) serum samples. The data was analyzed using least squares linear regression. The Dimension® FT4L Flex® demonstrated excellent correlation to the predicate device as evidenced by a correlation coefficient = 0.999. The resulting regressions statistics are shown below.

Dear Ms. Lewis:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either classII (Special Controls) or class III (MA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 800 to 895. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820).

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific information about the application of labeling requirements to your device, or questions on the promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety at (240) 276-0490. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address at
